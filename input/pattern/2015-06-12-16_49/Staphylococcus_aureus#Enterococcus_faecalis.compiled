TI  - Purification and Characterization of a Cysteine-Rich 14-kDa Antibacterial Peptide from the Granular Hemocytes of Mangrove Crab Episesarma tetragonum and Its Antibiofilm Activity.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptide (AMP) crustin is a type of immune molecule present in the immune system of crustaceans and response against microbial invasion. In the present study, we have identified and characterized the cationic, amphipathic structure consisting of AMP crustin from a mangrove crab Episesarma tetragonum using CM Sepharose-based cation exchange column chromatography. E. tetragonum crustin showed a single band of 14 kDa on SDS-PAGE and the homogeneity showed retention time of 8.4 min in RP-HPLC. Functional studies of E. tetragonum crustin exhibits the antibacterial activity (2-4 mug/ml) and biofilm inhibition (20 mug/ml) against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Hydrophobicity and extrapolysaccharide production of Gram-positive bacteria were inhibited through the bactericidal inhibitory concentration. In situ visualization analysis of biofilm inhibition was observed through light and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Surface morphology and the bacterial biofilm inhibition were viewed by scanning electron and atomic force microscopy. This study emphasizes the potential activity of E. tetragonum crustin, an interesting candidate for the development of novel broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent against bacterial pathogens. Graphical Abstract Antimicrobial peptide synthesis and host-pathogen interaction lead to production of immune molecules directed to destruction of pathogens.
TI  - Telavancin activity tested against Gram-positive clinical isolates from European, Russian and Israeli hospitals (2011-2013) using a revised broth microdilution testing method: redefining the baseline activity of telavancin.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To reassess the activity of telavancin when tested against Gram-positive clinical pathogens recovered from hospitalized patients in European and adjacent regions using a revised broth microdilution method. METHODS: 11 601 consecutive, non-duplicate isolates originating from 36 institutions among 18 countries recovered between 2011 and 2013 were tested for susceptibility using a revised broth microdilution method for telavancin. Interpretive telavancin breakpoints appropriate for the method were those recently approved by the FDA and EUCAST, as available. RESULTS: Telavancin (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) was equally potent against methicillin-susceptible ((MSSA) and methicillin-resistant (MRSA) Staphylococcus aureus. All Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to telavancin (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.12 mg/l) and inhibited at the susceptibility breakpoint (i.e. </= 0.25 mg/l), except for VanA-phenotype vancomycin-resistant isolates (telavancin MIC, >1 mg/l). Telavancin ( </= 0.015/0.03 mg/l) was active against vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium, while higher MIC values were obtained for VanA strains. Telavancin (both MIC50 and MIC90, </= 0.015 mg/l) was potent against Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-haemolytic streptococci (MIC50/90, </= 0.015/0.06 mg/l) and viridans group streptococci (MIC50/90, </= 0.015/0.03 mg/l). CONCLUSIONS: Telavancin exhibited potent activity against this contemporary (2011-2013) collection of organisms, inhibiting indicated pathogens at or below the FDA/EUCAST-approved breakpoints for susceptibility. VanA-phenotype enterococci were less susceptible to telavancin, a feature observed using the previous testing method. These results redefine telavancin's activity against isolates from Europe.
TI  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of Cymbopogon essential oil (lemon grass) and its interaction with silver ions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is well known that Cymbopogon (lemon grass) essential oil exhibits antimicrobial activity while the efficacy of silver ions as a disinfectant is equally well reported. HYPOTHESIS: The antimicrobial activity of CEO and Ag(+) and their synergistic combinations will be useful in improving the current treatment strategies for various infections. STUDY DESIGN: In the present study, we determined the chemical composition and in vitro antimicrobial activity of six different Cymbopogon essential oils (CEO's) alone and in combination with silver ions (Ag(+)) against two Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis), two Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Moraxella catarrhalis) and two yeast species (Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis). The nature of potential interactions was determined by fractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICIs) for CEO's and Ag(+) calculated from microdilution assays and time-kill curves. RESULTS: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry results confirmed the presence of nerol, geranial and geraniol as major volatile compounds. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values confirmed that all the tested pathogens are variably susceptible to both CEO's as well as Ag(+). The MIC of CEO's and Ag(+) against all the tested pathogens ranged from 0.032 mg/ml to 1 mg/ml and 0.004 and 0.064 mg/ml respectively, whereas when assayed in combination the FICI values were drastically reduced to range between 0.258 and 2.186, indicating synergy, additive and indifferent interactions. The most prominent interaction was observed between Cymbopogon flexuosus essential oil and Ag(+) against C. albicans with summation operatorFIC = 0.254. The synergistic interactions were further confirmed through the construction of isobolograms and time-kill plots. Transmission electron microscopy showed disturbance in the cell envelope upon the concomitant treatment of CEO's and Ag(+), which ultimately leads to cell death. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that CEO's and Ag(+) when used in combination offers an opportunity to the formulation scientist to produce novel combinations acting synergistically in the continued quest to control important infectious pathogens.
TI  - Screening currency notes for microbial pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes  using a shotgun metagenomic approach.
AB  - Fomites are a well-known source of microbial infections and previous studies have provided insights into the sojourning microbiome of fomites from various sources. Paper currency notes are one of the most commonly exchanged objects and its potential to transmit pathogenic organisms has been well recognized. Approaches to identify the microbiome associated with paper currency notes have been largely limited to culture dependent approaches. Subsequent studies portrayed the use of 16S ribosomal RNA based approaches which provided insights into the taxonomical distribution of the microbiome. However, recent techniques including shotgun sequencing provides resolution at gene level and enable estimation of their copy numbers in the metagenome. We investigated the microbiome of Indian paper currency notes using a shotgun metagenome sequencing approach. Metagenomic DNA isolated from samples of frequently circulated denominations of Indian currency notes were sequenced using Illumina Hiseq sequencer. Analysis of the data revealed presence of species belonging to both eukaryotic and prokaryotic genera. The taxonomic distribution at kingdom level revealed contigs mapping to eukaryota (70%), bacteria (9%), viruses and archae (~1%). We identified 78 pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Enterococcus faecalis, and 75 cellulose degrading organisms including Acidothermus cellulolyticus, Cellulomonas flavigena and Ruminococcus albus. Additionally, 78 antibiotic resistance genes were identified and 18 of these were found in all the samples. Furthermore, six out of 78 pathogens harbored at least one of the 18 common antibiotic resistance genes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of shotgun metagenome sequence dataset of paper currency notes, which can be useful for future applications including as bio-surveillance of exchangeable fomites for infectious agents.
TI  - Statins and Antimicrobial Effects: Simvastatin as a Potential Drug against Staphylococcus aureus Biofilm.
AB  - Statins are important lipid-lowering agents with other pleiotropic effects. Several studies have explored a possible protective effect of statins to reduce the morbidity and mortality of many infectious diseases. Staphylococcus aureus is one of the main pathogens implicated in nosocomial infections; its ability to form biofilms makes treatment difficult. The present study observed the MIC of atorvastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin against S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. Simvastatin was the only agent with activity against clinical isolates and reference strains of methicilin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Thus, the effects of simvastatin on the growth, viability and biofilm formation of S. aureus were tested. In addition, a possible synergistic effect between simvastatin and vancomycin was evaluated. Simvastatin's MIC was 15.65 microg/mL for S. aureus 29213 and 31.25 microg/mL for the other strains of S. aureus. The effect of simvastatin was bactericidal at 4xMIC and bacteriostatic at the MIC concentration. No synergistic effect was found between simvastatin and vancomycin. However, the results obtained against S. aureus biofilms showed that, in addition to inhibiting adhesion and biofilm formation at concentrations from 1/16xMIC to 4xMIC, simvastatin was also able to act against mature biofilms, reducing cell viability and extra-polysaccharide production. In conclusion, simvastatin showed pronounced antimicrobial activity against S. aureus biofilms, reducing their formation and viability.
TI  - Analysis of Vancomycin Susceptibility Testing Results for Presumptive Categorization of Telavancin.
AB  - Scattergrams between vancomycin and telavancin demonstrated susceptibility agreement rates of 99.96, 99.65 and 100.00% for Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and streptococci, respectively. A single very major error was obtained against E. faecalis, while vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA), and vancomycin-resistant and teicoplanin-susceptible (VanB-phenotype) E. faecalis were responsible for the major and minor errors. These results support the use of vancomycin to infer telavancin susceptibility among indicated pathogens, except VISA, which should be tested for telavancin susceptibility.
TI  - Antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of phosphoric acid solution compared to other root canal irrigants.
AB  - Phosphoric acid has been suggested as an irrigant due to its effectiveness in removing the smear layer. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of a 37% phosphoric acid solution to other irrigants commonly used in endodontics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The substances 37% phosphoric acid, 17% EDTA, 10% citric acid, 2% chlorhexidine (solution and gel), and 5.25% NaOCl were evaluated. The antimicrobial activity was tested against Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Actinomyces meyeri, Parvimonas micra, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella nigrescens according to the agar diffusion method. The cytotoxicity of the irrigants was determined by using the MTT assay. RESULTS: Phosphoric acid presented higher antimicrobial activity compared to the other tested irrigants. With regard to the cell viability, this solution showed results similar to those with 5.25% NaOCl and 2% chlorhexidine (gel and solution), whereas 17% EDTA and 10% citric acid showed higher cell viability compared to other irrigants. CONCLUSION: Phosphoric acid demonstrated higher antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity similar to that of 5.25% NaOCl and 2% chlorhexidine (gel and solution).
TI  - The efficacy of photodynamic therapy and sodium hypochlorite in root canal disinfection by a single-file instrumentation technique.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the efficacy of photodynamic  therapy (PDT) and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) in root canal disinfection by a single-file instrumentation technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy human single-rooted mandibular premolars were infected with Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans, and divided into seven groups (n=10) according to the protocol of disinfection used. Group 1: 1% NaOCl; Group 2: 5.25% NaOCl; Group 3: saline+PDT; Group 4: 1% NaOCl+PDT; Group 5: 5.25% NaOCl+PDT; Group 6: positive control; Group 7: negative control. For PDT, methylene blue (15mug/mL) remained in the root canal for two minutes, followed by irradiation with diode Laser. Samples were collected before and after instrumentation and plated in specific media cultures, to assess the presence or absence of microbial growth and determine the average reduction of viable microorganisms. RESULTS: 5.25% NaOCl+PDT resulted in the highest number of specimens with no microbial growth. Also, 1% NaOCl and 1% NaOCl+PDT exhibited similar antimicrobial effects. Saline+PDT was not able to eliminate all microorganisms. There was statistical significant differences between the groups and the microorganisms. CONCLUSION: The association of 5.25% NaOCl with PDT was the most effective treatment against microorganisms from endodontic infection in root canals instrumented by a single-file instrumentation technique. This result shows that PDT can be useful to improve the root canal disinfection.
TI  - Synthesis, Structural Characterization and Biological Activity of Novel Cyclohexane-1,3-dione Ligands and Their Metal Complexes.
AB  - Some new Zn(II) and Cu(II) complexes [Cu(L1)(OAc)2]H2O, [Cu(L1)(NO3)H2O]NO33.5H2O, [Zn(L1)(NO3)2]4.5H2O, [Zn(L1)(OAc)2(H2O)2]3H2O, [Cu2(L2)(OAc)4]2H2O2DMF, [Cu(L2)2]2NO31.5DMFH2O, [Zn(L2)2(NO3)2]DMF and [Zn2(L2)(OAc)4(H2O)4]5H2O; L1 = 2-[2-(2-methoxyphenyl)hydrazono]cyclohexane-1,3-dione and L2 = 2-[2-(3-nitrophenyl)hydrazono]cyclohexane-1,3-dione were synthesized and characterized by IR, 1H-NMR,13C-NMR and ultraviolet (UV-Vis.) spectroscopy, elemental analysis, magnetic susceptibility, mass spectrometry and thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TGA-DTA). The synthesized ligands and their complexes were tested for antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, and Salmonella typhimurium CCM 583. Some of complexes showed medium-level antibacterial activity against the test bacteria compared with ampicillin.
TI  - Composition and Antimicrobial Activity of Euphrasia rostkoviana Hayne Essential Oil.
AB  - Eyebright, Euphrasia rostkoviana Hayne (Scrophulariaceae), is a medicinal plant traditionally used in Europe for the treatment of various health disorders, especially as eyewash to treat eye ailments such as conjunctivitis and blepharitis that can be associated with bacterial infections. Some Euphrasia species have been previously reported to contain essential oil. However, the composition and bioactivity of E. rostkoviana oil are unknown. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the eyebright essential oil against some organisms associated with eye infections: Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. GC-MS analysis revealed more than 70 constituents, with n-hexadecanoic acid (18.47%) as the main constituent followed by thymol (7.97%), myristic acid (4.71%), linalool (4.65%), and anethole (4.09%). The essential oil showed antimicrobial effect against all organisms tested with the exception of P. aeruginosa. The best activity was observed against all Gram-positive bacteria tested with the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 512 microg/mL. This is the first report on the chemical composition of E. rostkoviana essential oil and its antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Probiotic features of Lactobacillus strains isolated from Ragusano and Pecorino Siciliano cheeses.
AB  - In the present study 177 Lactobacillus spp. strains, isolated from Ragusano and Pecorino Siciliano cheeses, were in vitro screened for probiotic traits, and their characteristics were compared to those of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, commercial strain. Based on acidic and bile salt resistance, thirteen Lactobacillus strains were selected. The multiplex-PCR application revealed that nine strains belonged to L. rhamnosus species and four to Lactobacillus paracasei species. All selected strains were further investigated for transit tolerance in simulated upper gastrointestinal tract (GI), for adhesion capacity to human intestinal cell lines, for hydrophobicity, for co-aggregation and auto-aggregation and for antimicrobial activities. Moreover, antibiotic resistance, hemolytic and bile salt hydrolase activities were investigated for safety assessment. Viable counts after simulated gastric and duodenal transit revealed that overall the selected lactobacilli tolerated better pancreatic juice and bile salts than acidic juice. In particular, three L. rhamnosus strains (FS10, FS2, and PS11) and one L. paracasei strain (PM8) increased their cell density after the simulated GI transit. The same strains showed also high percentage of auto-aggregation and co-aggregation with Escherichia coli. All strains were effective against both Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli and variability was achieved versus Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus faecalis used as pathogenic indicator strains. Different behavior was revealed by strains for adhesion ability and hydrophobicity, which are not always linked each other and are strongly strain-dependent. From the safety point of view, no isolate showed hemolytic and bile salt hydrolase activities, except one, and most of the strains were sensitive to a broad range of clinical antibiotics. This work showed that the L. rhamnosus FS10 and the L. paracasei PM8 are good promising probiotic candidates for further in vivo investigations.
TI  - [Bloodstream infections in southwestern China: 2012 Whire Union report on bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the susceptibility of blood culture isolates to antibiotics in a sample of hospitals in Southwestern China in 2012. METHODS: Blood culture samples were taken and tested from the patients under the Whire Union surveillance in three tertiary hospitals in Southwestern China in 2012. We performed antimicrobial susceptibility analyses on the blood culture isolates using WHONET5. 5 and SPSS19.0. RESULTS: A total of 1745 isolates were identified: 877 Gram-positive (50.26%); 868 Gram-negative (49.74%). Coagulase-negative Staphylococcius (CNS, 541 strains, 31.00%), Escherichia coli (ECO, 379 strains, 21.72%), Klebsiella spp. (170 strains, 9.74%), Enterococcus spp. (143 strains, 8.20%) and Staphylococcus aureus (SAU, 128 strains, 7.34%) comprised the majority of isolates. Methicillin-resistant was found in 37.5% of S. aureus and 85.4% of CNS, respectively. Zero and 6.3% resistance to vancomycin were found for Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, respectively,compared with a 1.4% and 7.9% resistance to linezolid, respectively. Imipenem-resistance occurred in 0.7% E. coli, 3.6% Klebsiella spp., and 11.1% Enterobacter spp.. Nonfermenters were highly resistant to carbapenems, with an imipenem resistance rate of 25.0% in P. aeruginosa and 79.1% in Acinetobacter baumannii. Antimicrobial usage and critical-care units were identified as risk factors for MRSA and multi-drug-resistant A. baumannii infections. Patients undergoing tracheotomy/endotracheal intubation were likely to develop multi-drug-resistant A. baumannii infections than others. CONCLUSION: CNS, E. coli,Klebsiella spp., Enterococcus spp. and S. aureus were the predominant organisms in bloodstream infections in Southwestern China. Low methicillin-resistant rate was found in Staphylococcus aureus. But vancomycin-resistant rate was high in E. faecium. Imipenem-resistant rates varied in Enterobacteriaceae: higher in non-fermenting bacteria especially in Acinetobacter spp. Use of abtimicrobial drugs and invasive procedures can lead to development of antimicrobial drugs-resistance.
TI  - A derivative of the thiopeptide GE2270A highly selective against Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - A chemical derivative of the thiopeptide GE2270A, designated NAI003, was found to possess a substantially reduced antibacterial spectrum in comparison to the parent compound, being active against just a few Gram-positive bacteria. In particular, NAI003 retained low MICs against all tested isolates of Propionibacterium acnes and, to a lesser extent, against Enterococcus faecalis. Furthermore, NAI003 showed a time- and dose-dependent killing of both a clindamycin-resistant and a clindamycin-sensitive P. acnes isolate. Gel-shift experiments indicated that, like the parent compound, NAI003 retained the ability to bind to elongation factors (EF) Tu derived from Escherichia coli, E. faecalis or P. acnes, albeit with reduced efficiency. In contrast, EF-Tu's derived from the NAI003-insenstitive Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes did not bind this compound. These results were confirmed by in vitro studies using a hybrid translation system, which indicated that NAI003 can inhibit most efficiently protein synthesis driven by the P. acnes EF-Tu. P. acnes mutants resistant to NAI003 were isolated by direct plating. With one exception, all analyzed strains carried mutation in the tuf gene, encoding EF-Tu. Because of its selective effect on P. acnes in comparison to resident skin flora, NAI003 represents a promising candidate for the topical treatment of acne, which has already completed a Phase 1 clinical study.
TI  - Decade-long use of the antimicrobial peptide combination tyrothricin does not pose a major risk of acquired resistance with gram-positive bacteria and Candida spp.
AB  - Tyrothricin, an antimicrobial peptide combination produced by Bacillus brevis consisting of gramicidins and tyrocidins commands broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria and some yeasts in vitro. The polypeptide and its components have been used therapeutically for about 60 years in the local treatment of infected skin and infected oro-pharyngeal mucous membranes. Though older studies suggest that resistance development of originally susceptible microorganisms towards tyrothricin is a rare event, data concerning recent state of resistance are lacking. In the present in vitro study the susceptibility to tyrothricin of clinical isolates of bacterial and yeast origin from superficial swabs of the skin and mucous membranes of outpatients and inpatients obtained from clinical material in the second half of the year 2003 was determined. Using a microdilution assay, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC and MIC90, defined as the concentration that inhibits at least 90 percent of the tested strains) of 20 strains each of Staphylococcus aureus of the variety MSSA (susceptible to methicillin), Staphylococcus aureus of the variety MRSA (methicillin resistant), Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium spec., Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis was determined. All of the tested gram-positive bacteria turned out to be highly susceptible to tyrothricin with MICs </= 4mg/l. The tested yeast strains were susceptible to the polypeptide antibiotic as well, but (with MICs of 16 mg/l and 32 mg/l, respectively) to a lesser extent. No acquired resistance of the tested strains was determined, indicating that the risk of resistance development against topically applied tyrothricin is only marginal, if there is any at all. Thus, long-term-, i.e. decade-long use of topically applied tyrothricin and its components in the local treatment of infected skin does not pose a major risk with respect to acquired resistance of originally susceptible gram-positive bacteria and yeasts, not even in the case of Staphylococcus aureus, both with MSSA and MRSA strains. The broad anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activity of tyrothricin combined with its lacking risk for resistance development make the antimicrobial peptide a valuable addition to our therapeutic armamentarium in the treatment of infected skin.
TI  - A novel gene, optrA, that confers transferable resistance to oxazolidinones and phenicols and its presence in Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium of human and animal origin.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The oxazolidinone-resistant Enterococcus faecalis E349 from a human patient tested negative for the cfr gene and 23S rRNA mutations. Here we report the identification of a novel oxazolidinone resistance gene, optrA, and a first investigation of the extent to which this gene was present in E. faecalis and Enterococcus faecium from humans and food-producing animals. METHODS: The resistance gene optrA was identified by whole-plasmid sequencing and subsequent cloning and expression in a susceptible Enterococcus host. Transformation and conjugation assays served to investigate the transferability of optrA. All optrA-positive E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates of human and animal origin were analysed for their MICs and their genotype, as well as the location of optrA. RESULTS: The novel plasmid-borne ABC transporter gene optrA from E. faecalis E349 conferred combined resistance or elevated MICs (when no clinical breakpoints were available) to oxazolidinones (linezolid and tedizolid) and phenicols (chloramphenicol and florfenicol). The corresponding conjugative plasmid pE349, on which optrA was located, had a size of 36 331 bp and also carried the phenicol exporter gene fexA. The optrA gene was functionally expressed in E. faecalis, E. faecium and Staphylococcus aureus. It was detected more frequently in E. faecalis and E. faecium from food-producing animals (20.3% and 5.7%, respectively) than from humans (4.2% and 0.6%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Enterococci with elevated MICs of linezolid and tedizolid should be tested not only for 23S rRNA mutations and the gene cfr, but also for the novel resistance gene optrA.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of the essential oils of Portuguese Foeniculum vulgare fruits.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation from fruits of six fennel accessions collected from wild populations occurring in the centre and south of Portugal. Composition of essential oils was established by Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The obtained yields of the essential oils were found to vary greatly in the range of 1.1 to 2.9% (v/w) and the chemical composition varied with the region of collection. A total of 16 compounds were identified. The main compounds were fenchone (16.9 - 34.7%), estragole (2.5 - 66.0%) and trans-anethole (7.9 - 77.7%). The percentages of these three main compounds were used to determine the relationship between the different oil samples and to group them into four different chemotypes: anethole/fenchone; anethole; estragole and anethole/estragole. Antifungal activity of essential oils was evaluated against six food spoilage fungi: Aspergillus niger, A. japonicus, A. oryzae, Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizophus oryzae and R. stolonifer. Antibacterial activity was assessed against three Gram-positive strains: Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228 and S. aureus ATCC 28213; and against six Gram-negative strains: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922; Morganella morganii LFG 08; Proteus mirabilis LFG 04; Salmonella enteritidis LFG 05; S. entiritidis serovar typhimurium LFG 06 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 by the disc diffusion agar method; the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using the broth macro-dilution method. The MIC values varied from 62.5 (E. coli ATCC 25922) to 2000 micromL (P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853).
TI  - IS256 abolishes gelatinase activity and biofilm formation in a mutant of the nosocomial pathogen Enterococcus faecalis V583.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis is one of the most controversial species of lactic acid bacteria. Some strains are used as probiotics, while others are associated with severe and life-threatening nosocomial infections. Their pathogenicity depends on the acquisition of multidrug resistance and virulence factors. Gelatinase, which is required in the first steps of biofilm formation, is an important virulence determinant involved in E. faecalis pathogenesis, including endocarditis and peritonitis. The gene that codes for gelatinase (gelE) is controlled by the Fsr quorum-sensing system, whose encoding genes (fsrA, fsrB, fsrC, and fsrD) are located immediately upstream of gelE. The integration of a DNA fragment into the fsr locus of a derived mutant of E. faecalis V583 suppressed the gelatinase activity and prevented biofilm formation. Sequence analysis indicated the presence of IS256 integrated into the fsrC gene at nucleotide position 321. Interestingly, IS256 is also associated with biofilm formation in Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus. This is the first description of an insertion sequence that prevents biofilm formation in E. faecalis.
TI  - Polyamine derivatives of betulinic acid and beta-sitosterol: A comparative investigation.
AB  - beta-Sitosterol and betulinic acid were used in designing their conjugates with selected polyamines bearing either an amide bond, or an ester and an amide bond simultaneously in the target molecule. The synthesized compounds were subjected to basic cytotoxic and antimicrobial tests. The synthetic protocol is described separately for each of the three series of the target amides, because each series of compounds required a different synthetic approach. The cytotoxicity was tested on cells derived from human T-lymphoblastic leukemia, breast adenocarcinoma and cervical cancer, and compared with the tests on normal human fibroblasts. Most of the target compounds (5a-5c, 11a-11c and 16a-16c) showed medium to high cytotoxicity (0.7-7.8muM), however, in some cases the compounds showed high cytotoxicity even toward normal human fibroblasts (11a-11c). Two compounds of this series (11c and 16c) also displayed antimicrobial activity with high and selective microbe specificity. The compound 11c was potent against Escherichia coli (minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) 6.25mugmL(-1), i.e. 9.75nMmL(-1)) and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 12.5mugmL(-1), i.e. 19.5nMmL(-1)), and showed medium activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The compound 16c was highly active against Enterococcus faecalis and S. aureus (both, MIC 3.125mugmL(-1), i.e. 4.22nMmL(-1)), both Gram-positive bacteria, however showed only weak activity against E. coli and no activity against P. aeruginosa, both Gram-negative bacteria, which indicates possible microbe specificity of 16c. Comparing beta-sitosterol-based series (5a-5c) and betulinic acid series (11a-11c and 16a-16c) of the target compounds, the latter one gave more promising structures. The compounds 11c and 16c showed effects which may be described as multifarious activity (pleiotropic effects).
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of cationic norbornanes as peptidomimetic antibacterial  agents.
AB  - A series of structurally amphiphilic biscationic norbornanes have been synthesised as rigidified, low molecular weight peptidomimetics of cationic antimicrobial peptides. A variety of charged hydrophilic functionalities were attached to the norbornane scaffold including aminium, guanidinium, imidazolium and pyridinium moieties. Additionally, a range of hydrophobic groups of differing sizes were incorporated through an acetal linkage. The compounds were evaluated for antibacterial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Activity was observed across the series; the most potent of which exhibited an MIC's </= 1 mug mL(-1) against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and several strains of Staphylococcus aureus, including multi-resistant methicillin resistant (mMRSA), glycopeptide-intermediate (GISA) and vancomycin-intermediate (VISA) S. aureus.
TI  - An antibacterial ortho-quinone diterpenoid and its derivatives from Caryopteris mongolica.
AB  - To identify antibacterial components in traditional Mongolian medicinal plant Caryopteris mongolica, an ortho-quinone abietane caryopteron A (1) and three its derivatives caryopteron B-D (2-4) were isolated from the roots of the plant together with three known abietanes demethylcryptojaponol (5), 6alpha-hydroxydemethyl cryptojaponol (6), and 14-deoxycoleon U (7). The chemical structures of these abietane derivatives were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic data. Compounds 1-4 had C-13 methylcyclopropane substructures, and 2-4 had a hexanedioic anhydride ring C instead of ortho-quinone in 1. The stereochemistry of these compound was assumed from NOE spectra and ECD Cotton effects. Compounds 1 and 5-7 showed antibacterial activities against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Micrococcus luteus, being 1 the more potent.
TI  - Global in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents: Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004-2013.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) is a global  antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance study which has been ongoing since 2004. This report examines the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparators against clinically important pathogens collected globally between 2004 and 2013. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using guidelines published by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The Cochran Armitage Trend Test was used to identify statistically significant changes in susceptibility between 2004 and 2013. RESULTS: Among the Enterobacteriaceae susceptibility was highest to the carbapenems [imipenem 97.1% (24,655/25,381), meropenem 97.0% (90,714/93,518)], tigecycline (97.0%, 115,361/118,899) and amikacin (96.9%, 115,200/118,899). Against Acinetobacter baumannii the highest rates of susceptibility were for minocycline (84.5%, 14,178/16,778) and imipenem (80.0%, 3,037/3,795). The MIC90 for tigecycline was 2 mg/L. 40% (6,743/16,778) of A. baumannii isolates were multidrug-resistant. Enterococci were highly susceptible to tigecycline and linezolid (>99%); vancomycin resistance was observed among 2% of Enterococcus faecalis (325/14,615) and 35% of Enterococcus faecium (2,136/6,167) globally. 40% (14,647/36,448) of Staphylococcus aureus were methicillin-resistant while 15% (2,152/14,562) of Streptococcus pneumoniae were penicillin-resistant. Against S. aureus and S. pneumoniae susceptibility to linezolid, vancomycin, and tigecycline was >/=99.9%. Globally, 81% (331/410) of statistically significant susceptibility changes during the study period were decreases in susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS: Amikacin, the carbapenems, and tigecycline were active against most gram-negative pathogens while linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin retained activity against most gram-positive pathogens collected in TEST during 2004-2013.
TI  - Preparation, characterization and antibacterial properties of ZnO/kaoline nanocomposites.
AB  - This paper describes laboratory preparation, characterization and antibacterial activity testing of ZnO/kaoline composites. ZnO/kaoline composites with 50wt.% of ZnO were laboratory prepared, dried at 105 degrees C and calcined at 500 degrees C. XRPD analysis revealed that thermal treatment caused the phase transformation of Zn containing precursor into ZnO. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy techniques were used for characterization of morphology of the prepared samples. A standard microdilution test was used for evaluation of antibacterial activity using four common human pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Daylight was used for induction photocatalytically based antibacterial activity. Second possible explanation of antibacterial activity of ZnO/kaoline could be the presence of biologically available forms of zinc. During the antibacterial activity assays the ZnO/kaoline composites exhibited antibacterial activity, where differences in an onset of the antibacterial activity and activity against bacterial strains were observed. The highest antibacterial activity was observed against S. aureus, where the lowest value of minimum inhibitory concentration was determined equal to 0.41mg/ml.
TI  - Evaluation of regional antibiograms to monitor antimicrobial resistance in Hampton Roads, Virginia.
AB  - We studied recent antibiograms (2010 to 2011) from 12 hospitals in the Hampton Roads area, Virginia, that refer patients to a tertiary-care facility affiliated with Eastern Virginia Medical School. The data was compiled into a regional antibiogram, and sensitivity rates of common isolates from the tertiary-care facility (central) were compared to those of referring hospitals grouped by locale. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common Gram- positive and E. coli the most common Gram- negative organism grown from clinical samples in the area. Overall 53% of S.aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. There was a broad scatter of MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) for vancomycin within the susceptibility range, and MIC of 4 mug/mL was reported in 2012. Penicillin resistance was seen in 50% and erythromycin resistance in 45% of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Vancomycin resistance was seen in 75% of Enterococcus faecium and 2% of Enterococcus faecalis respectively. Acinetobacter baumannii was the most resistant Gram negative organism in the data compiled. Among the Escherichia coli, 26%, 44% and 52%were resistant to Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole ( SXT) ampicillin- sulbactam and ampicillin respectively. We found significant differences in methodology, interpretation and antibiotic panels used by area laboratories. Based on these findings, we are now prospectively following resistance patterns in the tertiary-care facility, sharing data, and creating a consistent approach to antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the region.
TI  - Review and phylogenetic analysis of qac genes that reduce susceptibility to quaternary ammonium compounds in Staphylococcus species.
AB  - The qac genes of Staphylococcus species encode multidrug efflux pumps: membrane proteins that export toxic molecules and thus increase tolerance to a variety of compounds such as disinfecting agents, including quaternary ammonium compounds (for which they are named), intercalating dyes and some antibiotics. In Stapylococcus species, six different plasmid-encoded Qac efflux pumps have been described, and they belong to two major protein families. QacA and QacB are members of the Major Facilitator Superfamily, while QacC, QacG, QacH, and QacJ all belong to the Small Multidrug Resistance (SMR) family. Not all SMR proteins are called Qac and the reverse is also true, which has caused confusion in the literature and in gene annotations. The discovery of qac genes and their presence in various staphylococcal populations is briefly reviewed. A sequence comparison revealed that some of the PCR primers described in the literature for qac detection may miss particular qac genes due to lack of DNA conservation. Despite their resemblance in substrate specificity, the Qac proteins belonging to the two protein families have little in common. QacA and QacB are highly conserved in Staphylococcus species, while qacA was also detected in Enterococcus faecalis, suggesting that these plasmid-born genes have spread across bacterial genera. Nevertheless, these qacA and qacB genes are quite dissimilar to their closest homologues in other organisms. In contrast, SMR-type Qac proteins display considerable sequence variation, despite their short length, even within the Staphylococcus genus. Phylogenetic analysis of these genes identified similarity to a large number of other SMR members, found in staphylococci as well as in other genera. A number of phylogenetic trees of SMR Qac proteins are presented here, starting with genes present in S. aureus and S. epidermidis, and extending this to related genes found in other species of this genus, and finally to genes found in other genera.
TI  - Antimicrobial evaluation of plants used for the treatment of diarrhoea in a rural community in northern Maputaland, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zulu people living in the rural area of Maputaland (KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa) rely heavily on medicinal plants for the treatment of diarrhoea. Abundant availability of medicinal plants in the study area offers low cost health care, but scientific validation is needed in order to lend credibility to the traditional use against many ailments including diarrhoeal infections. With this in mind a study was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of 23 plant species which are used for the treatment of diarrhoea in rural Maputaland. Four 1:1 plant combinations were also evaluated to determine their interactive effects against seven diarrhoea-related bacterial pathogens. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays were undertaken on dichloromethane-methanol (CH2Cl2: MeOH) and aqueous crude extracts. The following micro-organisms were selected for this study and were tested based on their association with stomach ailments and diarrhoea; Bacillus cereus (ATCC 11778), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739), Proteus vulgaris (ATCC 33420), Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028), Shigella flexneri (ATCC 25875) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 12600). The fractional inhibitory concentration index (SigmaFIC) was determined for plants traditionally used in combination. RESULTS: Shigella flexneri proved to be the most susceptible pathogen, where the organic extract of Terminalia sericea showed the most prominent noteworthy antibacterial activity (mean MIC value of 0.04 mg/mL). The aqueous extracts generally showed poorer antimicrobial activity with some exceptions i.e. Acacia burkei, Brachylaena transvaalensis against B. cereus and B. transvaalensis against S. flexneri. In the combination studies, synergy was predominant with mean (across all pathogens) SigmaFIC values of 0.30 for Acanthospermum glabratum with Krauseola mosambicina; SigmaFIC values of 0.46 for A. glabratum with Psidium guajava; SigmaFIC values of 0.39 for B. transvaalensis with P. guajava and SigmaFIC values of 0.88 (additive) for the combination of B. transvaalensis with Sclerocarya birrea. CONCLUSION: This study provided some insight into the bacterial in vitro efficacies of plants traditionally used to treat diarrhoea by the people of Northern Maputaland. Very little connection was observed between frequency of use and efficacy. Plant combinations demonstrated favourable efficacy with mostly synergistic effects noted, lending some credibility to their use in combination.
TI  - In Vitro Evaluation of Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy Associated with Hydroalcoholic Extracts of Schinopsis brasiliensis Engl.: New Therapeutic Perspectives.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the photodynamic potential of extracts of Schinopsis brasiliensis Engl. on bacteria involved in several human infections. BACKGROUND DATA: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involves the interaction of light with an appropriate and photosensitizer wavelength, and the prospect of existing photosensitive compounds in herbal extracts enhanced by the application of laser diode has been promising. METHODS: The antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis was obtained by the disk diffusion method on agar. The laser diode InGaAIP was used with 660 nm wavelength, 100 mW, and 4 J/cm(2), and the application was performed in a timely manner for 34 sec on each disk tested. The groups tested were: Laser and bark extract (B+L+); bark extract only (B+L-); Laser and leaf extract (F+L+); leaf extract only (F+L-); Laser and malachite green (M+L+); malachite green only (M+L-); and laser only (L+). RESULTS: There were significant differences between the B+L- and B+L+ groups (p=0.029) and between the L+F- and L+F+ groups (p=0.029) at various concentrations of the nebulized extracts of bark and leaf. Among the tested pathogens, S. aureus showed the highest zone of inhibition, 24.55+/-0.36 mm in group B+L+, 500 mg.mL(-1). CONCLUSIONS: PDT with malachite green was effective, and groups B+L+ and F+L+ showed excellent activity on the bacteria tested, suggesting the presence of photosensitizers in extracts of S. brasiliensis Engl.
TI  - Incidence, risk factors, microbiology of venous catheter associated bloodstream infections--a prospective study from a tertiary care hospital.
AB  - PURPOSE: Central venous catheters (CVCs) though indispensable in current medical  and intensive care treatment, also puts patients at risk of catheter related infection (CRI) resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. We analysed the incidence, risk factors, bacteriological profile and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the isolates in central venous catheter associated bloodstream infection (CVC-BSI) in the intensive care unit (ICU) patients and studied the formation of biofilm in CVCs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The following case control study included 115 patients with CVC in situ. Quantitative blood cultures (QBC) and catheter tip cultures were performed for the diagnoses. Direct catheter staining was done for an early diagnosis by acridine orange (AO) and Gram staining methods. Biofilm production in catheters was detected by 'tissue culture plate' (TCP) method. The results were analysed using the computer-based program statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS). RESULTS: In 25/115 patients, definite diagnosis of CVC-BSI was made. The mean age was 48.44 +/- 17.34 years (cases) vs 40.10 +/- 18.24 years (controls) and the mean duration of catheterisation was 25.72 +/- 8.73 days (cases) vs 11.89 +/- 6.38 days (controls). Local signs of infection (erythema, tenderness and oozing) were found more significantly in CVC-BSI cases. The AO staining was more sensitive and Gram staining of catheters showed higher specificity. Staphylococcus aureus followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and non-albicans Candida were common CVC-BSI pathogens. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains were isolated in bacterial agents of CVC-BSI. Non-albicans Candida and Enterococcus faecalis showed strong biofilm production. CONCLUSION: The incidence of CVC-BSI was 21.73% and the rate was 14.59 per 1000 catheter days. Prolonged ICU stay and longer catheterisation were major risk factors. S. aureus was isolated most commonly in CVC-BSI cases. The menace of multidrug resistance and biofilm formation in CVCs is associated with CVC-BSI.
TI  - Semi-synthesis of new antimicrobial esters from the natural oleanolic and maslinic acids.
AB  - In this article, we report an effective procedure for the selective isolation of  oleanolic acid 1 and maslinic acid 2 (3.4 and 8.5mg/g DW, respectively) from pomace olive (Olea europaea L.) using an ultrasonic bath, and the synthesis of a series of new triterpenic acid esters. The compounds were characterized by their spectral data and were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity. Among the compounds tested, those having sulfur and chlorine atoms were found to be antibacterial. They showed activity against two Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis and two Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MICs within a range of 5-25mug/mL). The fungus Penicillium italicum was found to be the most sensitive to both sulfur derivatives: (3beta)-3-((thiophene-2-carbonyl)oxy)-olean-12-en-28-oic acid (1a) (IZ=22mm) and (2alpha,3beta-2,3-bis((thiophene-2-carbonyl)oxy)olean-12-en-28-oic acid (2a) (IZ=24mm).
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Actinomycetale isolated from the lagoon in Algeria.
AB  - In the aim of the study of the taxonomy and the antimicrobial activity, a strain  of actinomycete SM2/2GF which was isolated from sediment of the lagoon El-Mellah which is situated in the city of El-Kala in the Northeast of Algeria, was tested against diverse pathogenic microorganisms and against a Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas alcaliphila which was isolated from water of the lagoon El-Mellah. The phenotypic and the molecular characteristics show that the isolate SM2/2GF belongs to the kind Streptomyces. This strain showed an antimicrobial activity against a Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas alcaliphila and the positive-Gram bacteria as Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, as well as the yeast Candida albicans. It has no activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The interesting antimicrobial activity of the strain SM2/2GF against the pathogenic microorganisms could encourage further researches on one or several bioactive molecules which it secretes.
TI  - Auranofin exerts broad-spectrum bactericidal activities by targeting thiol-redox  homeostasis.
AB  - Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a rising public health threat and make the identification of new antibiotics a priority. From a cell-based screen for bactericidal compounds against Mycobacterium tuberculosis under nutrient-deprivation conditions we identified auranofin, an orally bioavailable FDA-approved antirheumatic drug, as having potent bactericidal activities against both replicating and nonreplicating M. tuberculosis. We also found that auranofin is active against other Gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis and Enterococcus faecalis, and drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus. Our biochemical studies showed that auranofin inhibits the bacterial thioredoxin reductase, a protein essential in many Gram-positive bacteria for maintaining the thiol-redox balance and protecting against reactive oxidative species. Auranofin decreases the reducing capacity of target bacteria, thereby sensitizing them to oxidative stress. Finally, auranofin was efficacious in a murine model of methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection. These results suggest that the thioredoxin-mediated redox cascade of Gram-positive pathogens is a valid target for the development of antibacterial drugs, and that the existing clinical agent auranofin may be repurposed to aid in the treatment of several important antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
TI  - 2-Alkyl(aryl)-quinazolin-4(3H)-thiones, 2-R-(quinazolin-4(3H)-ylthio)carboxylic acids and amides: synthesis, molecular docking, antimicrobial and anticancer properties.
AB  - In this study, a series of novel 2-alkyl(aryl)-quinazolin-4(3H)-thiones, 2-R-(quinazolin-4(3H)-ylthio)carboxylic acids and amides were synthesized and evaluated for antimicrobial and anticancer activities. Their structure was confirmed by elemental analysis and spectral data (FT-IR, LC-MS, 1H-NMR). Antimicrobial activity was tested in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Candida albicans and NCI in vitro preliminary anticancer activity against nine different cancer types. The most active antibacterial and antifungal compounds were: 2.1, 2.2 and 2.4. The introduction of the carboxylic acid or amide residue into the fourth position of quinazolin-4(3H)-thione resulted in the absence of antimicrobial activity. Substance 3.8 inhibited renal cancer UO-31 line and 2.18 - leukemia CCRF-CEM. The results of in silico molecular docking for DHFR and CK2 kinase had no correlation with in vitro properties, proposing the presence of other biological activity pathways.
TI  - Optimizing antibiotic therapy of bacteremia and endocarditis due to staphylococci and enterococci: new insights and evidence from the literature.
AB  - Gram-positive cocci are a well-recognised major cause of nosocomial infection worldwide. Bloodstream infections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, and multi-drug resistant enterococci are a cause of concern for physicians due to their related morbidity and mortality rates. Aim of this article is to review the current state of knowledge regarding the management of BSI caused by staphylococci and enterococci, including infective endocarditis, and to identify those factors that may help physicians to manage these infections appropriately. Moreover, we discuss the importance of an appropriate use of antimicrobial drugs, taking in consideration the in vitro activity, clinical efficacy data, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters, and potential side effects.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of curcumin I is associated with damaging of bacterial membrane.
AB  - Curcumin, an important constituent of turmeric, is known for various biological activities, primarily due to its antioxidant mechanism. The present study focused on the antibacterial activity of curcumin I, a significant component of commercial curcumin, against four genera of bacteria, including those that are Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). These represent prominent human pathogens, particularly in hospital settings. Our study shows the strong antibacterial potential of curcumin I against all the tested bacteria from Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative groups. The integrity of the bacterial membrane was checked using two differential permeabilization indicating fluorescent probes, namely, propidium iodide and calcein. Both the membrane permeabilization assays confirmed membrane leakage in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria on exposure to curcumin I. In addition, scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy were employed to confirm the membrane damages in bacterial cells on exposure to curcumin I. The present study confirms the broad-spectrum antibacterial nature of curcumin I, and its membrane damaging property. Findings from this study could provide impetus for further research on curcumin I regarding its antibiotic potential against rapidly emerging bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Biological evaluation and molecular modelling study of thiosemicarbazide derivatives as bacterial type IIA topoisomerases inhibitors.
AB  - In the present article, we describe the inhibitory potency of nine thiosemicarbazide derivatives against bacterial type IIA topoisomerases, their antibacterial profile and molecular modelling evaluation. We found that one of the tested compounds, compound 7, significantly inhibits activity of Staphylococcus aureus DNA gyrase with an IC50 below 15 muM. Besides, this compound displays antibacterial activity on reference Staphylococuss spp. and Enterococcus faecalis strains as well as clinical S. aureus isolates at non-cytotoxic concentrations in mammalian cells with MIC values ranging from 16 to 32 mug/mL thereby indicating, in some cases, equipotent or even more effective action than standard drugs such as vancomycin, ampicillin and nitrofurantoin. The computational studies showed that both molecular geometry and the electron density distribution have a great impact on antibacterial activity of thiosemicarbazide derivatives.
TI  - Bacteriological findings and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of isolated pathogens from visual threatening ocular infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the profiles and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of isolated bacteria from visual threatening ocular infection. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This is a retrospective review of all microbiological culture reports from visual threatening ocular infection patients admitted at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from 2005 to 2009. The culture reports with antimicrobial susceptibility pattern were analyzed and correlated with clinical presentation. RESULTS: There were 682 specimens from 282 patients (286 eyes). Three most common diagnoses were corneal ulcer, endophthalmitis and scleritis, which yielded positive culture of 31.1% (38/122 eyes), 24.2% (25/103 eyes), and 55.6% (5/9 eyes), respectively. Overall, positive cultures were demonstrated from 77 eyes (27%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common causative pathogens of corneal ulcer and scleritis, while Enterococcus faecalis was the most common pathogens of endophthalmitis. All isolated Pseudomonas spp. were susceptible to ciprofloxacin with 4% resistance to both gentamicin and amikacin. Enterococcus faecalis demonstrated 50% of intermediate resistance to ciprofloxacin. There was no methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus identified. CONCLUSION: Overall positive cultures obtained from visual threatening ocular infection from a 5 year-review were 27%. Microbial profile remained stable from 2005 to 2009, and antimicrobial resistance was not obviously observed in our study. The findings may be used as guidelines for the prompt management of antimicrobial agents used in presumed severe bacterial ocular infection, in order to prevent devastating ocular tissue damage.
TI  - [Analysis of pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance in neonatal purulent meningitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical characteristics, pathogenic bacteria, and antibiotics resistance of neonatal purulent meningitis in order to provide the guide for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. METHOD: A retrospective review was performed and a total of 112 cases of neonatal purulent meningitis (male 64, female 58) were identified in the neonatal intensive care unit of Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University seen from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2013. The clinical information including pathogenic bacterial distribution, drug sensitivity, head imageology and therapeutic outcome were analyzed. Numeration data were shown in ratio and chi square test was applied for group comparison. RESULT: Among 112 cases, 46 were admitted from 2004 to 2008 and 66 from 2009 to 2013, 23 patients were preterm and 89 were term, 20 were early onset (occurring within 3 days of life) and 92 were late onset meningitis (occurring after 3 days of life). In 62 (55.4%) cases the pathogens were Gram-positive bacteria and in 50 (44.6%) were Gram-negative bacteria. The five most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli (32 cases, 28.6%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS, 20 cases, 17.9%), Streptococcus (18 cases, 16.1%, Streptococcus agalactiae 15 cases), Enterococci (13 cases, 11.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (9 cases, 8.0%). Comparison of pathogenic bacterial distribution between 2004-2008 and 2009-2013 showed that Gram-positive bacteria accounted for more than 50% in both period. Escherichia coli was the most common bacterium, followed by Streptococcus in last five years which was higher than the first five years (22.7% (15/66) vs. 6.5% (3/46), chi(2) = 5.278, P < 0.05). Klebsiella pneumoniae was more common isolate in preterm infants than in term infants (13.0% (3/23) vs. 1.1% (1/89), chi(2) = 7.540, P < 0.05). Streptococcus (most were Streptococcus agalactiae) was the most common bacteria in early onset meningitis and higher than those in late onset meningitis (35.0% (7/20) vs. 12.0% (11/92), chi(2) = 4.872, P < 0.05). Drug sensitivity tests showed that all the Gram-positive bacterial isolates were sensitive to linezolid. Staphylococci were resistant to penicillin, and most of them were resistant to erythromycin, oxacillin and cefazolin; 77.8%of CNS isolates were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus. No Streptococcus and Enterococcus faecalis was resistant to penicillin. None of enterococci was resistant to vancomycin. Among the Gram-negative bacterial isolates, more than 40% of Escherichia coli were resistant to commonly used cephalosporins such as cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, and all of them were sensitive to amikacin, cefoperazone sulbactam and imipenem. Isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were all resistant to ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, but none of them was resistant to piperacillin tazobactam and imipenem. Of the 112 patients, 69 were cured, 23 improved, 9 uncured and 11 died. There were 47 cases (42.0%) with poor prognosis, they had abnormal head imageology, severe complications and some cases died, 13 of 18 (72.2%) patients with meningitis caused by Streptococcus died. CONCLUSION: Escherichia coli, CNS and Streptococcus are the predominant pathogens responsible for neonatal purulent meningitis over the past ten years. There were increasing numbers of cases with Streptococcus meningitis which are more common in early onset meningitis with adverse outcome, therefore careful attention should be paid in clinic. Linezolid should be used as a new choice in intractable neonatal purulent meningitis cases caused by gram positive bacteria.
TI  - New antimicrobial contact catalyst killing antibiotic resistant clinical and waterborne pathogens.
AB  - Microbial growth on medical and technical devices is a big health issue, particularly when microorganisms aggregate to form biofilms. Moreover, the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the clinical environment is dramatically growing, making treatment of bacterial infections very challenging. In search of an alternative, we studied a novel antimicrobial surface coating based on micro galvanic elements formed by silver and ruthenium with surface catalytic properties. The antimicrobial coating efficiently inhibited the growth of the nosocomial pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium as demonstrated by the growth inhibition on agar surface and in biofilms of antibiotic resistant clinical E. faecalis, E. faecium, and S. aureus isolates. It also strongly reduced the growth of Legionella in a drinking water pipeline and of Escherichia coli in urine. We postulate a mode of action of the antimicrobial material, which is independent of the release of silver ions. Thus, the novel antimicrobial coating could represent an alternative to combat microbial growth avoiding the toxic side effects of high levels of silver ions on eukaryotic cells.
TI  - In vitro activity of gentamicin, vancomycin or amikacin combined with EDTA or l-arginine as lock therapy against a wide spectrum of biofilm-forming clinical strains isolated from catheter-related infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Treatment of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) is hampered by the characteristic tolerance of bacterial biofilms towards antibiotics. Our objective was to study the effect of the combination of antibiotics and the alkaline amino acid l-arginine or the cation chelator EDTA on the bacterial killing of in vitro biofilms formed by an array of clinical strains responsible for CRBSI and representative of epidemiologically relevant bacterial species. METHODS: Among 32 strains described in a previous clinical study, we focused on the most antibiotic-tolerant strains including CoNS (n = 4), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 4), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4) and Enterobacteriaceae (n = 4). We used an in vitro biofilm model (96-well plate assay) to study biofilm tolerance and tested various combinations of antibiotics and non-antibiotic adjuvants. Gentamicin, amikacin or vancomycin was combined with disodium EDTA or l-arginine for 24 h to reproduce the antibiotic lock therapy (ALT) approach. Killing of biofilm bacteria was measured by cfu quantification after a vigorous step of pipetting up and down in order to detach all biofilm bacteria from the surface of the wells. RESULTS: Both of our adjuvant strategies significantly increased the effect of antibiotics against biofilms formed by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. The combination of gentamicin + EDTA was active against all tested strains apart from one P. aeruginosa. The combination of gentamicin + l-arginine was active against most of the tested strains with the notable exception of CoNS for which no potentiation was observed. We also demonstrated that amikacin + EDTA was active against Gram-negative bacteria and that vancomycin + EDTA was active against Gram-positive bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of EDTA enhanced the activity of gentamicin, amikacin and vancomycin against biofilms formed by a wide spectrum of bacterial strains responsible for CRBSI.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of Anacardium occidentale and Mangifera indica in oral care.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral health is an integral and important component of general health. Infectious diseases such as caries, periodontal, and gingivitis indicate the onset of imbalance in homeostasis between oral micro biota and host. The present day medicaments used in oral health care have numerous side effects. The uses of herbal plants as an alternative have gained popularity due to side effects of antibiotics and emergence of multidrug resistant strains. Anacardium occidentale (cashew) and Mangifera indica (mango) have been used as traditional oral health care measures in India since time immemorial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ethanol extracts of cashew and mango leaves were obtained by maceration method. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by clear zone produced by these plant extracts against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans in agar plate method, determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration (MBC/MFC), and suppression of biofilm. The cytotoxic effects of plants extract was determined by microculture tetrazolium assay on human gingival fibroblast and Chinese hamster lung fibroblast (V79) cell lines. RESULTS: Cashew and mango leaf extract significantly (P < 0.05) produced larger zone of inhibition against test pathogens when compared to povidone-iodine-based mouth rinses. Although the MIC and MBC/MFC values of mouth rinses were effective in lower concentrations; plant extracts significantly (P < 0.001) suppressed the biofilms of oral pathogens. The leaf extracts were less cytotoxic (P < 0.001) compared to mouth rinses. CONCLUSIONS: Plant extracts are superior to the mouth rinses and have a promising role in future oral health care.
TI  - Nonselective mevalonate kinase inhibitor as a novel class of antibacterial agents.
AB  - Introduction. There are a few evidences about targeting isoprenoids biosynthesis  pathway in bacteria for finding new antibiotics. This study was conducted to assess antibacterial effects of vanadyl sulfate (VS), one of the mevalonate kinase inhibitors to find a new target for killing bacteria. Materials and Methods. Antibacterial effect of VS alone and in combination with glycine or EDTA was assessed on Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as Gram-negative and Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis as Gram-positive bacteria using serial dilution method and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) identified. Result. MICs for S. aureus and E. coli were 4 and 8 mg/mL, respectively. VS could not affect the growth of two other bacteria. However, VS in combination with glycine not only inhibited the growth of E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa, but also reduced MICs for VS-sensitive bacteria (S. aureus and E. coli). EDTA could reduce MIC for E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Conclusion. VS could inhibit the growth of S. aurous and E. coli, and adding glycine or EDTA improved VS antibacterial activity presumably via instability of the cell wall and enhanced transport of VS through bacterial cell wall. Inhibition of the isoprenoid pathway might provide new tools to overcome bacterial resistance.
TI  - Antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity of Ferula gummosa plant essential oil compared to NaOCl and CHX: a preliminary in vitro study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The usage of medicinal plants as natural antimicrobial agents has grown in many fields including dental medicine. The aim of this in vitro study was three-fold: (i) to determine the chemical compositions of the Ferula gummosa essential oil (FGEO), (ii) to compare the antimicrobial efficacy of the oil with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and chlorhexidine (CHX), (iii) to assess the toxic behavior of FGEO in different concentrations compared to 5% NaOCl and 0.2% CHX. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was used to determine the chemical compositions of the oil. The disk diffusion method and a broth micro-dilution susceptibility assay were exploited to assess the antimicrobial efficacy against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mitis, and Candida albicans. The cytocompatibility of the FGEO was assessed on L929 fibroblasts, and compared to that of NaOCl and CHX. RESULTS: Twenty-seven constituents were recognized in FGEO. The major component of the oil was beta-pinene (51.83%). All three irrigants significantly inhibited the growth of all examined microorganisms compared to the negative control group. FGEO at 50 microg/mL was effective in lower concentration against Enterococcus faecalis than 5% NaOCl and 0.2% CHX, and was also more potent than 0.2% CHX against Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus. FGEO was a cytocompatible solution, and had significantly lower toxicity compared to 5% NaOCl and 0.2% CHX. CONCLUSIONS: FGEO showed a promising biological potency as a root canal disinfectant. More investigations are required on the effectiveness of this oil on intracanal bacterial biofilms.
TI  - Antimicrobial and Antifungal Activity of Pelargonium roseum Essential Oils.
AB  - PURPOSE: The antiseptic qualities of aromatic and medicinal plants and their extracts have been recognized since antiquity, while attempts to characterize these properties in the laboratory date back the beginning of the XX(th) century. In the current study essential oils obtained from Pelargonium roseum (Geraniacea) were analyzed for their antibacterial and antifungal activities. METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of the Pelargonium essential oil was tested against Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli), Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) and fungi (Candida albicans). Disc diffusion method was used to study antimicrobial activity. RESULTS: Inhibition zones showed that the studied essential oils were active against all of the studied bacteria. In the case of Candida albicans, the complete inhibition of the fungus's development was observed. In the cases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus we observed an inhibition comparable to that obtained by the use of an appropriate antimicrobial substance. CONCLUSION: The volatile oils exhibited considerable inhibitory effects against all the organisms under test, in some cases comparable with those of the reference antibiotics. There were no considerable differences between the antimicrobial activities of the oil obtained by distillation and commercially available Pelargonium oils.
TI  - Bactericidal Activity and Mechanism of Photoirradiated Polyphenols against Gram-Positive and -Negative Bacteria.
AB  - The bactericidal effect of various types of photoirradiated polyphenols against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria was evaluated in relation to the mode of action. Gram-positive bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus mutans) and Gram-negative bacteria (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) suspended in a 1 mg/mL polyphenol aqueous solution (caffeic acid, gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, and proanthocyanidin) were exposed to LED light (wavelength, 400 nm; irradiance, 260 mW/cm2) for 5 or 10 min. Caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid exerted the highest bactericidal activity followed by gallic acid and proanthocyanidin against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. It was also demonstrated that the disinfection treatment induced oxidative damage of bacterial DNA, which suggests that polyphenols are incorporated into bacterial cells. The present study suggests that blue light irradiation of polyphenols could be a novel disinfection treatment.
TI  - Utilization of blood cultures in Danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  - This national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (BCs). A primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. From the Danish Microbiology Database, we retrieved all BCs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the National Patient Registry. In total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one BC was taken. Almost 50% of BCs were taken at admission. The chance of having a BC taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. Data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one BC was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. Ten species, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. An increase in BCs and positive BCs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. BCs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for S. pneumoniae particularly. A predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to S. aureus, E. faecium and K. pneumoniae. Minor differences in BCs and positive BCs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. The study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activities of seven Eucalyptus species essential oils leaves.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this paper, we have studied the essential oils chemical composition of the leaves of seven Eucalyptus species developed in Tunisia. Eucalyptus leaves were picked from trees growing in different arboretums in Tunisia. Choucha and Mrifeg arboretums located in Sedjnene, region of Bizerte (Choucha: E. maideni, E. astrengens et E. cinerea; Mrifeg : E. leucoxylon), Korbous arboretums located in the region of Nabeul, North East Tunisia with sub-humid bioclimate, (E. lehmani), Souiniet-Ain Drahem arboretum located in region of Jendouba (E. sideroxylon, E. bicostata). Essential oils were individually tested against a large panel of microorganisms including Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6539), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC29212), Listeria ivanovii (RBL 30), Bacillus cereus (ATCC11778). RESULTS: The yield of essential oils ranged from 1.2% to 3% (w/w) for the different Eucalyptus species. All essential oils contain alpha-pinene, 1,8-cineol and pinocarveol-trans for all Eucalyptus species studied. The 1,8-cineol was the major compound in all species (49.07 to 83.59%). Diameter of inhibition zone of essential oils of Eucalyptus species varied from 10 to 29 mm. The largest zone of inhibition was obtained for Bacillus cereus (E. astrengens) and the lowest for Staphylococcus aureus (E. cinerea). The essential oils from E. maideni, E. astrengens, E. cinerea (arboretum of Bizerte), E. bicostata (arboretum of Aindraham) showed the highest antibacterial activity against Listeria ivanovii and Bacillus cereus. CONCLUSION: The major constituents of Eucalyptus leaves essential oils are 1,8-cineol (49.07 to 83.59%) and alpha-pinene (1.27 to 26.35%). The essential oils from E. maideni, E. astrengens, E. cinerea, E. bicostata showed the highest antibacterial activity against Listeria ivanovii and Bacillus cereus, they may have potential applications in food and pharmaceutical products.
TI  - Extraction, characterization and antimicrobial activity of sulfated polysaccharides from fish skins.
AB  - Sulfated polysaccharides were extracted from gray triggerfish (GTSP) and smooth hound (SHSP) skins. Their chemical and physical characteristics were determined using X-ray diffraction and Infrared spectroscopic analysis. The antibacterial activities of GTSP and SHSP against Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 43251), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Salmonella enterica (ATCC 43972) and Enterobacter sp were evaluated by determining clear growth inhibition zone diameters and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values and by essays in liquid media. GTSP and SHSP were fractionated by a Diethylaminoethyl-cellulose chromatography. Fraction FGII, from GTSP, and fraction FSII, from SHSP, showed the most important inhibitory effects against the tested bacterial species. The sulfated polysaccharides from fish skins did not show hemolytic activity towards bovine erythrocytes. Overall, the results suggested that those polysaccharides could offer promising sources of polysaccharides for future application as dietary ingredients in the nutraceutical industry.
TI  - Natural sesquiterpene lactones enhance oxacillin and gentamicin effectiveness against pathogenic bacteria without antibacterial effects on beneficial lactobacilli.
AB  - This is a report on the synergistic interactions (SIs) between melampolide-type sesquiterpene lactones 1-8 from Acanthospermum hispidum DC., and oxacillin or gentamicin, against four pathogenic strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis; two of them were multi-resistant strains obtained from chronic infectious processes. Our results showed that all associations of 1-8 with antibiotics (ATBs) are more effective than pure ATBs to control pathogenic strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis. The most relevant SIs were observed when the major lactone of A. hispidum, acanthospermal B [5], was combined with gentamicin (protein synthesis inhibitor) against an ex vivo culture of methicillin-resistant S. aureus SAR 1, displaying a significant MIC reduction in 5 (312.5 to 78.1 microg/mL), and gentamicin (120 microg/mL to 3 microg/mL). Compound 4 improved the antibiotic potency of oxacillin (cell wall synthesis inhibitor) against ampicillin-resistant E. faecalis (60 microg/mL to 1.5 microg/mL). It is important to remark that three beneficial lactobacilli were resistant to 1-8 and their mixtures with gentamicin or oxacillin in effective concentrations against pathogenic bacteria. Synergism between ATBs and phytochemicals is a therapeutically helpful concept to improve ATB efficacy and prevent resistance. The present results show that selective SIs occur between melampolides and gentamicin or oxacillin, and open a new field of research. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
TI  - Optimizing supercritical carbon dioxide in the inactivation of bacteria in clinical solid waste by using response surface methodology.
AB  - Clinical solid waste (CSW) poses a challenge to health care facilities because of the presence of pathogenic microorganisms, leading to concerns in the effective sterilization of the CSW for safe handling and elimination of infectious disease transmission. In the present study, supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) was applied to inactivate gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and gram-negative Escherichia coli in CSW. The effects of SC-CO2 sterilization parameters such as pressure, temperature, and time were investigated and optimized by response surface methodology (RSM). Results showed that the data were adequately fitted into the second-order polynomial model. The linear quadratic terms and interaction between pressure and temperature had significant effects on the inactivation of S. aureus, E. coli, E. faecalis, and B. subtilis in CSW. Optimum conditions for the complete inactivation of bacteria within the experimental range of the studied variables were 20 MPa, 60 degrees C, and 60 min. The SC-CO2-treated bacterial cells, observed under a scanning electron microscope, showed morphological changes, including cell breakage and dislodged cell walls, which could have caused the inactivation. This espouses the inference that SC-CO2 exerts strong inactivating effects on the bacteria present in CSW, and has the potential to be used in CSW management for the safe handling and recycling-reuse of CSW materials.
TI  - Microbiological characterization of aquatic microbiomes targeting taxonomical marker genes and antibiotic resistance genes of opportunistic bacteria.
AB  - The dissemination of medically relevant antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (blaVIM-1, vanA, ampC, ermB, and mecA) and opportunistic bacteria (Enterococcus faecium/faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, and CNS) was determined in different anthropogenically influenced aquatic habitats in a selected region of Germany. Over a period of two years, four differently sized wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with and without clinical influence, three surface waters, four rain overflow basins, and three groundwater sites were analyzed by quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). Results were calculated in cell equivalents per 100 ng of total DNA extracted from water samples and per 100 mL sample volume, which seems to underestimate the abundance of antibiotic resistance and opportunistic bacteria. High abundances of opportunistic bacteria and ARG were quantified in clinical wastewaters and influents of the adjacent WWTP. The removal capacities of WWTP were up to 99% for some, but not all investigated bacteria. The abundances of most ARG targets were found to be increased in the bacterial population after conventional wastewater treatment. As a consequence, downstream surface water and also some groundwater compartments displayed high abundances of all four ARGs. It became obvious that the dynamics of the ARG differed from the fate of the opportunistic bacteria. This underlines the necessity of an advanced microbial characterization of anthropogenically influenced environments.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid as assessed through the 2013 LEADER surveillance program.
AB  - The 2013 LEADER surveillance program monitored the in vitro activity of linezolid and comparator agents against Gram-positive bacteria at 60 medical centers in the United States. A total of 7183 pathogens were contributed from 6 predetermined pathogen groups. The groups were Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. The MIC90 value for each of the 6 pathogen groups was 1 mug/mL. Susceptibility of "all organisms" to linezolid was 99.83%. Only 12 isolates (2 S. aureus, 3 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 Streptococcus sanguinis, 5 Enterococcus faecium, and 1 Enterococcus faecalis) were nonsusceptible to linezolid (0.17%). Three of these (2 S. aureus and 1 E. faecium) harbored the cfr resistance mechanism. The findings indicate that linezolid activity remains stable, although there are examples of clonal dissemination within several monitored institutions.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts and isoquinoline alkaloids of selected papaveraceae plants.
AB  - Alkaloidal extracts of seven selected plants of the family Papaveraceae were studied with respect to their activity against six strains of pathogenic bacteria and their alkaloidal fingerprint. Twenty-four alkaloids were determined by GC/MS, and twenty of them identified from their mass spectra, retention times and retention indexes. In the antibacterial assay, three Gram-positive (Enterorococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and S. hyicus), and three Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) strains were used. The most promising antimicrobial activity was shown by the alkaloidal extract of Macleaya cordata with MIC values of 16 mug/mL for Staphylococcus aureus, 32 mug/mL for Enterococcus faecalis and 64 mug/mL for Staphylococcus hyicus and Escherichia coli. All the tested pure isoquinoline alkaloids were considered inactive within the tested concentrations.
TI  - Update of the telavancin activity in vitro tested against a worldwide collection  of Gram-positive clinical isolates (2013), when applying the revised susceptibility testing method.
AB  - A revised broth microdilution susceptibility testing method for telavancin was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Telavancin activity was assessed against Gram-positive pathogens collected worldwide (2013) using the revised method. A total of 12,346 isolates from 90 sites were included as part of the Telavancin International Surveillance Program for the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Telavancin had MIC50 and MIC90 values of 0.03 and 0.06 mug/mL, respectively, against staphylococci, regardless of methicillin susceptibility, and inhibited all Staphylococcus aureus at </=0.12 mug/mL (revised FDA breakpoint). Telavancin was 8-fold more active than daptomycin (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.5 mug/mL) and 16- to 32-fold more active than vancomycin (MIC50/90, 1/1 mug/mL) and linezolid (MIC50/90, 1/1 mug/mL) against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. All 692 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by telavancin (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.12 mug/mL) at </=0.25 mug/mL (FDA breakpoint), except for 1 strain (MIC, 0.5 mug/mL). All Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis with telavancin MIC values of >/=0.5 and >/=1 mug/mL, respectively, had a VanA phenotype. A comparison data analysis based on the MIC90 demonstrated that telavancin was at least 8-fold more potent than comparators against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci. Streptococci showed telavancin MIC50 values of </=0.015 mug/mL, except for Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC50, 0.03 mug/mL). These in vitro results obtained by the recently approved susceptibility testing method establish a new benchmark of telavancin activity worldwide.
TI  - Antibiotic Resistance Prevalence in Routine Bloodstream Isolates from Children's  Hospitals Varies Substantially from Adult Surveillance Data in Europe.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is central for defining appropriate strategies to deal with changing AMR levels. It is unclear whether childhood AMR patterns differ from those detected in isolates from adult patients. METHODS: Resistance percentages of nonduplicate Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream isolates from children less than 18 years of age reported to the Antibiotic Resistance and Prescribing in European Children (ARPEC) project were compared with all-age resistance percentages reported by the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) for the same pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, period and countries. In addition, resistance percentages were compared between ARPEC isolates from children less than 1 year of age and children greater than or equal to1 year of age. RESULTS: Resistance percentages for many important pathogen-antibiotic class combinations were different for ARPEC isolates compared with EARS-Net. E. coli and K. pneumoniae fluoroquinolone resistance percentages were substantially lower in ARPEC (13.4% and 17.9%) than in EARS-Net (23.0% and 30.7%), whereas the reverse was true for all pathogen-antibiotic class combinations in P. aeruginosa (for example, 27.3% aminoglycoside resistance in ARPEC, 19.3% in EARS-Net, 32.8% carbapenem resistance in ARPEC and 20.5% in EARS-Net), and for S. pneumoniae and macrolide resistance. For many Gram-negative pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, isolates from children greater than or equal to 1 year of age showed higher resistance percentages than isolates from children less than 1 year of age. CONCLUSIONS: Age-stratified presentation of resistance percentage estimates by surveillance programs will allow identification of important variations in resistance patterns between different patient groups for targeted intervention.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and stability of electron beam irradiated dental irrigants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The electron beam (e-beam) radiation is considered as an effective means of sterilization of healthcare products as well as to induce the structural changes in the pharmaceutical agents/drug molecules. In addition to structural changes of pharmaceutical it also induces the formation of low molecular weight compounds with altered microbiological, physicochemical and toxicological properties. Among the several known medicaments, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) are used as irrigants in dentistry to kill the pathogenic microorganisms like Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans inhabiting the oral cavity. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and stability of e-beam irradiated dental irrigants, NaOCl and CHX. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two dental irrigants NaOCl (1.25% and 2.5%) and CHX (1% and 2%) were exposed to various doses of e-beam radiation. The antimicrobial activities of e-beam irradiated irrigants were compared with the non-irradiated (control) irrigants against E. faecalis, S. aureus, S. mutans and C. albicans by disc diffusion method. Following the storage, physico-chemical properties of the irrigants were recorded and the cytotoxic effect was evaluated on human gingival fibroblast cells. RESULT: The irrigants, 1.25% NaOCl and 1% CHX showed significantly increased antimicrobial activity against both E. faecalis, (16+0.0) and S. aureus (25+0.0) after irradiation with 1 kGy e-beam. Whereas, 2.5% NaOCl and 2% CHX showed slightly increased antimicrobial activity only against S. aureus (28+0.0). The significant difference was noticed in the antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of irradiated and non-irradiated irrigants following the storage for 180 d at 4(0)C. CONCLUSION: The e-beam irradiation increased the antimicrobial activity of irrigants without altering the biocompatibility.
TI  - In vitro spectrum of pexiganan activity when tested against pathogens from diabetic foot infections and with selected resistance mechanisms.
AB  - Pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid synthetic cationic peptide, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials as a topical antimicrobial agent for the treatment of mild infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers. Bacterial isolates from the 2013 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program designated as pathogens from diabetic foot infections (DFI) and Gram-negative and -positive pathogens from various infection types that harbored selected resistance mechanisms/phenotypes were tested against pexiganan in reference cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth. The MIC50 and MIC90 against all organisms tested from DFI were 16 and 32 mug/ml, respectively. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter koseri, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MIC values ranged from 8 to 16 mug/ml. Pexiganan MIC values among Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA] and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus [MSSA]), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Enterococcus faecium ranged from 8 to 32 mug/ml. Pexiganan activity was not adversely affected for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae or P. aeruginosa that produced beta-lactamases or resistance mechanisms to other commonly used antimicrobial agents. Decreased susceptibility to vancomycin did not affect pexiganan activity against S. aureus or E. faecium. Enterococcus faecalis appears to be intrinsically less susceptible to pexiganan (MIC, 32 to 256 mug/ml). The "all organism" MIC90 of 32 mug/ml for pexiganan in this study was >250-fold below the pexiganan concentration in the cream/delivery vehicle being developed for topical use.
TI  - Drug resistance and molecular epidemiology of aerobic bacteria isolated from puerperal infections in bangladesh.
AB  - Puerperal infection is a common complication during postnatal period in developing countries. Bacterial species, drug resistance, and genetic characteristics were investigated for a total of 470 isolates from puerperal infections in Bangladesh for a 2-year period (2010-2012). The most common species was Escherichia coli (n=98), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (n=54), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=33), Proteus mirabilis (n=32), Staphylococcus aureus (n=27), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=22), and Enterobacter cloacae (n=21). S. aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii were isolated at a higher frequency from wound infections after cesarean section, while E. coli, E. cloacae, and K. pneumoniae were isolated from community-acquired endometritis and urinary tract infections. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was frequent for Enterobacteriacae, and was mainly mediated by blaCTX-M-1 group beta-lactamases. The CTX-M gene in E. coli from the four phylogroups was identified as blaCTX-M-15, and phylogroup B2 isolates with blaCTX-M-15 were classified into ST131 with O25b allele, harboring aac(6')-Ib-cr and various virulence factors. Carbapenemase genes blaNDM-1 and blaNDM-7 were identified in one isolate each of phylogroup A E. coli. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates had type IV or V SCCmec, including isolates of ST361 (CC672), which is related to an emerging ST672 clone in the Indian subcontinent. This study revealed the recent epidemiological status of aerobic bacteria causing puerperal infections in Bangladesh, providing useful information to improve clinical practice and infection control.
TI  - Characterization of ambrette seed oil and its mode of action in bacteria.
AB  - In the present study, chemical composition and the antibacterial mechanism of ambrette seed oil are investigated. Chemical composition of the oil was analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Thirty-five compounds were identified and the major compounds were found to be farnesol acetate (51.45%) and ambrettolide (12.96%). The antibacterial activity was performed by well diffusion assay and the mechanisms were studied by measuring the alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and protein leakage assays. The antibacterial effect of the ambrette seed oil showed inhibitory effect against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. The LDH activity was high in all tested bacteria compared with control, whereas the ALP and protein concentrations were also increased in E. faecalis. Molecular docking revealed the ligands farnesol acetate and ambrettolide had satisfactory binding energy towards the beta lactamase TEM-72 and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) protein. Due to its better antibacterial properties, the ambrette seed oil could be used as a source of antibacterial agents.
TI  - Nanobioarchitectures based on chlorophyll photopigment, artificial lipid bilayers and carbon nanotubes.
AB  - In the last decade, building biohybrid materials has gained considerable interest in the field of nanotechnology. This paper describes an original design for bionanoarchitectures with interesting properties and potential bioapplications. Multilamellar lipid vesicles (obtained by hydration of a dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine thin film) with and without cholesterol were labelled with a natural photopigment (chlorophyll a), which functioned as a sensor to detect modifications in the artificial lipid bilayers. These biomimetic membranes were used to build non-covalent structures with single-walled carbon nanotubes. Different biophysical methods were employed to characterize these biohybrids such as: UV-vis absorption and emission spectroscopy, zeta potential measurements, AFM and chemiluminescence techniques. The designed, carbon-based biohybrids exhibited good physical stability, good antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, and could be used as biocoating materials. As compared to the cholesterol-free samples, the cholesterol-containing hybrid structures demonstrated better stability (i.e., their zeta potential reached the value of -36.4 mV), more pronounced oxygen radical scavenging ability (affording an antioxidant activity of 73.25%) and enhanced biocidal ability, offering inhibition zones of 12.4, 11.3 and 10.2 mm in diameter, against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, respectively.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of prodigiosin isolated from Serratia marcescens UFPEDA 398.
AB  - Prodigiosin is an alkaloid and natural red pigment produced by Serratia marcescens. Prodigiosin has antimicrobial, antimalarial and antitumor properties and induces apoptosis in T and B lymphocytes. These properties have piqued the interest of researchers in the fields of medicine, pharmaceutics and different industries. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of prodigiosin against pathogenic micro-organisms. The red pigments produced by S. marcescens exhibited absorption at 534 nm, Rf of 0.59 and molecular weight of 323 m/z. Antimicrobial activity was tested against oxacillin-resistant Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Acinetobacter sp. and oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. The standard antibiotics employed were ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin and oxacillin. The disc-diffusion tests demonstrated significant inhibition zones for S. aureus (35 +/- 0.6), E. faecalis (22 +/- 1.0) and S. pyogenes (14 +/- 0.6). However, prodigiosin showed resistance to E. coli, P. aeruginosa and acinetobacter, where no significant formation of inhibitory halos were observed. We determined the inhibitory minimum concentrations and bactericidal for 20 strains of oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (ORSA). The pattern was the antibiotic oxacillin. The minimum inhibitory concentrations observed ranged from 1, 2 and 4.0 mug/mL, respectively, while the minimum bactericidal concentrations ranged from 2, 4, 8 and 16 mug/mL. The S. marcescens prodigiosin produced by showed bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect showing promising antimicrobial activity and suggesting future studies regarding its applicability in antibiotics therapies directed ORSA.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2010 and March 2011].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2010 to March 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. Four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. such as Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus avium was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp. such as Streptococcus anginosus and Staphylococcus spp. such as Staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. such as E. faecalis and E. faecium was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. such as S. aureus from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli and R aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of Parvimonas micra, Eggerthella lenta, Streptococcus constellatus, Gemella morbillorum, and Collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. In this series, vancomycin-resistant MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa were not observed.
TI  - Detection of Listeria monocytogenes with short peptide fragments from class IIa bacteriocins as recognition elements.
AB  - We employed a direct peptide-bacteria binding assay to screen peptide fragments for high and specific binding to Listeria monocytogenes. Peptides were screened from a peptide array library synthesized on cellulose membrane. Twenty four peptide fragments (each a 14-mer) were derived from three potent anti-listerial peptides, Leucocin A, Pediocin PA1, and Curvacin A, that belong to class IIa bacteriocins. Fragment Leu10 (GEAFSAGVHRLANG), derived from the C-terminal region of Leucocin A, displayed the highest binding among all of the library fragments toward several pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria, including L. monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. The specific binding of Leu10 to L. monocytogenes was further validated using microcantilever (MCL) experiments. Microcantilevers coated with gold were functionalized with peptides by chemical conjugation using a cysteamine linker to yield a peptide density of approximately 4.8x10(-3) mumol/cm2 for different peptide fragments. Leu10 (14-mer) functionalized MCL was able to detect Listeria with same sensitivity as that of Leucocin A (37-mer) functionalized MCL, validating the use of short peptide fragments in bacterial detection platforms. Fragment Leu10 folded into a helical conformation in solution, like that of native Leucocin A, suggesting that both Leu10 and Leucocin A may employ a similar mechanism for binding target bacteria. The results show that peptide-conjugated microcantilevers can function as highly sensitive platforms for Listeria detection and hold potential to be developed as biosensors for pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Performance evaluation of a DNA chip assay in the identification of major genitourinary pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To prevent the recurrence of genitourinary infections and to reduce the risks of their complications, accurate and rapid diagnosis are required. STDetect(R) Chip is a DNA chip which allows for the simultaneous detection of 13 major genitourinary pathogens in a single vaginal swab or urine specimen. We evaluated the analytical performance of the STDetect(R) Chip for detecting target pathogens that commonly cause genitourinary infections. METHODS: The target pathogens of the STDetect(R) Chip are Chlamydia trachomatis, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Performance of the STDetect(R) Chip for the detection of target pathogens was evaluated comparing with the result of direct sequencing and conventional multiplex PCR assay. And precision tests for STDetect(R) Chip were performed with quality control materials. RESULTS: The STDetect(R) Chip showed high sensitivities (95.1%-100%), specificities (93.4% to 100%), concordance rates (95.0%-100%), positive predictive values (69.8%-100%), and negative predictive values (93.1%-100%) in its identification of 13 target pathogens. The STDetect(R) Chip had a particularly excellent concordance rate (96.5%) for the 4 major pathogens, C. albicans, G. vaginalis, M. hominis, and U. urealyticum, compared with direct sequencing. Comparing to multiplex PCR assay, STDetect(R) Chip showed better sensitivity for detecting M. hominis (97.0% vs. 54.5%) and U. urealyticum (93.2% vs. 65.9%). In precision tests, coefficients of variations for signal intensities were ranged from 11.2% to 26.2%. CONCLUSION: The STDetect(R) Chip showed excellent analytical performance, and its result was in good agreement with that obtained by direct sequencing.
TI  - Syntheses, structures, and antimicrobial activity of new remarkably light-stable  and water-soluble tris(pyrazolyl)methanesulfonate silver(I) derivatives of N-methyl-1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane salt - [mPTA]BF4.
AB  - Two new silver(I) complexes of formula [Ag(mPTA)4](Tpms)4(BF4) (1) and [Ag(Tpms)(mPTA)](BF4) (2) (mPTA = N-methyl-1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane cation, Tpms = tris(pyrazol-1-yl)methanesulfonate anion) have been synthesized and fully characterized by elemental analyses, (1)H and (31)P{(1)H} NMR, ESI-MS, and IR spectroscopic techniques. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction study of 1 discloses a noncoordinated nature of the Tpms species, existing as counterions around the highly charged metal center [Ag(mPTA)](5+), 1 being the first reported coordination compound bearing a kappa(0)-Tpms. 1 features high solubility and stability in water (S25 degrees C approximately 30 mg.mL(-1)). The two complexes interact with calf thymus DNA via intercalation mode, binding to the BSA with decrease of its tryptophan fluorescence with a static quenching mechanism. The two new silver complexes exhibit significant antibacterial and antifungal activities screened in vitro against the standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans.
TI  - Evaluating the efficiency of humic acid to remove micro-organisms from denture base material.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficiency of humic acid substances on removing micro-organisms from denture base materials. BACKGROUND: Old denture wearer needs effective, easy-use and safe denture-cleaning material. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Square-shaped, heat-polymerised acrylic resin specimens (n = 550) were prepared and divided into five groups (n = 110 for each) corresponding to the microbial contamination (Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Contaminated specimens were randomly assigned to the application of five different denture-cleaning agents as follows (n = 20 for each): Kloroben, Corsodyl, Steradent, Corega, experimental solution with humic acid. Ten specimens were assessed as an experimental control carried out simultaneously for the treatment groups for each micro-organism. It was divided into two groups: negative control and positive control (n = 5 for each). All acrylic specimens were incubated 37 degrees C for 24 h (for bacterial strains) and 37 degrees C for 48 h (for yeast strains). After incubation period, all brain-heart infusion broths (BHI) which contain disinfectant acrylic specimens were cultured on 5% sheep blood agar (for bacteria) and Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) for yeast using loop. The numbers of colony-forming units per millilitre (CFU/ml) were calculated. The results were analysed by Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis tests (p = 0.05). RESULTS: Corsodyl and Kloroben completely eliminated the adherence of all investigated micro-organisms (100%) and showed the highest removal activity compared with other cleaning agents (p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between Corsodyl and Kloroben (p >/= 0.05), and there was no statistically significant difference between Corega, Steradent and experimental solution (p >/= 0.05). CONCLUSION: Humic acid could be used as an alternative 'natural' solution for denture-cleaning agent.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of alcoholic extracts obtained from vegetative organs of A. retroflexus.
AB  - In vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of Amaranthus retroflexus leaves and inflorescence alcoholic (ethanol 70%) extracts of various concentrations ranging from 0.78 to 400 muL/ml were analyzed on different clinical and reference bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtills, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii) and fungal strains (Candida albicans, C. famata, C. utilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae) using agar disk diffusion method and broth dilution method (MIC determination) for antimicrobial activity and TEAC (Trolox capacity) assay for the evaluation of the antioxidant activity. The adapted diffusion method was used to test the antimicrobial effect of the extracts separately and in combination with a range of standard antibiotics, in order to evidence any synergic effects of A. retroflexus extracts on the antibiotics activity. The extracts showed the highest inhibitory effect against K. pneumoniae and B. subtilis with no activity against S. aureus among the bacterial strains, while in case of the fungal strains the most intensive effect was exhibited against C. famata by both extracts. The A. retroflexus leaves extract improved the ciprofloxacin and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid activity towards the P. aeruginosa clinical strain. The inflorescences extract significantly increased chloramphenicol activity on B. subtilis strain. The antioxidant activity assay showed that the studied extracts exhibited the ability to neutralize the free radicals leading to the conclusion that the tested extracts bear compounds with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial and antioxidant activity that could represent a potential alternative for treating various infectious diseases.
TI  - Disinfection of gutta-percha cones using three reagents and their residual effects.
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of 5.25% sodium hypochlorite, 2% chlorehexidine and MTAD in disinfecting gutta-percha cones and to analyze the surface topography of gutta-percha cones after the rapid chemical disinfection procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gutta-percha cones were immersed in suspensions of Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus separately. The cones were then immersed in 5.25% NaOCl, 2% CHX and MTAD for 30 seconds, 1 minute and 5 minutes separately. The disinfected cones were then incubated in thioglycollate media for 7 days. The thioglycolate media was sub-cultured and colony forming units were counted. For topographical examination of gutta-percha cones, the cones were immersed in respective solutions for one minute and allowed to air dry for 30 minutes after rinsing or without rinsing the cones with distilled water. The topography of the cones were then analyzed under SEM. Data was statistically analyzed using one way anova. RESULTS: MTAD was found to be the most effective disinfecting solution. The topographical examination of GP cones found some deposits after the disinfection procedure in every group. These deposits were removed when the GP cones were rinsed with distilled water. CONCLUSIONS: MTAD possesses superior bactericidal activity when compared with NaOCl and CHX and a final rinse with distilled water is essential after the disinfection procedure.
TI  - Removal of total and antibiotic resistant bacteria in advanced wastewater treatment by ozonation in combination with different filtering techniques.
AB  - Elimination of bacteria by ozonation in combination with charcoal or slow sand filtration for advanced sewage treatment to improve the quality of treated sewage and to reduce the potential risk for human health of receiving surface waters was investigated in pilot scale at the sewage treatment plant Eriskirch, Baden-Wuerttemberg/Germany. To determine the elimination of sewage bacteria, inflowing and leaving wastewater of different treatment processes was analysed in a culture-based approach for its content of Escherichia coli, enterococci and staphylococci and their resistance against selected antibiotics over a period of 17 month. For enterococci, single species and their antibiotic resistances were identified. In comparison to the established flocculation filtration at Eriskirch, ozonation plus charcoal or sand filtration (pilot-scale) reduced the concentrations of total and antibiotic resistant E. coli, enterococci and staphylococci. However, antibiotic resistant E. coli and staphylococci apparently survived ozone treatment better than antibiotic sensitive strains. Neither vancomycin resistant enterococci nor methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were detected. The decreased percentage of antibiotic resistant enterococci after ozonation may be explained by a different ozone sensitivity of species: Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis, which determined the resistance-level, seemed to be more sensitive for ozone than other Enterococcus-species. Overall, ozonation followed by charcoal or sand filtration led to 0.8-1.1 log-units less total and antibiotic resistant E. coli, enterococci and staphylococci, as compared to the respective concentrations in treated sewage by only flocculation filtration. Thus, advanced wastewater treatment by ozonation plus charcoal or sand filtration after common sewage treatment is an effective tool for further elimination of microorganisms from sewage before discharge in surface waters.
TI  - Physicochemical and biological properties of oxovanadium(IV), cobalt(II) and nickel(II) complexes with oxydiacetate anions.
AB  - The potentiometric and conductometric titration methods have been used to characterize the stability of series of VO(IV)-, Co(II)- and Ni(II)-oxydiacetato complexes in DMSO-water solutions containing 0-50 % (v/v) DMSO. The influence of DMSO as a co-solvent on the stability of the complexes as well as the oxydiacetic acid was evaluated. Furthermore, the reactivity of the complexes towards superoxide free radicals was assessed by employing the nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) assay. The biological properties of the complexes were investigated in relation to their cytoprotective activity against the oxidative damage generated exogenously by using hydrogen peroxide in the Human Dermal Fibroblasts adult (HDFa) cell line as well as to their antimicrobial activity against the bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis). The relationship between physicochemical and biological properties of the complexes was discussed.
TI  - Integration of non-oral bacteria into in vitro oral biofilms.
AB  - Biofilms are polymicrobial communities that grow on surfaces in nature. Oral bacteria can spontaneously form biofilms on the surface of teeth, which may compromise the health of the teeth, or their surrounding (periodontal) tissues. While the oral bacteria exhibit high tropism for their specialized ecological niche, it is not clear if bacteria that are not part of the normal oral microbiota can efficiently colonize and grow within oral biofilms. By using an in vitro "supragingival" biofilm model of 6 oral species, this study aimed to investigate if 3 individual bacterial species that are not part of the normal oral microbiota (Eschericia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecails) and one not previously tested oral species (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) can be incorporated into this established supragingival biofilm model. Staphylococcus aureus and A. actinomycetemcomitans were able to grow efficiently in the biofilm, without disrupting the growth of the remaining species. They localized in sparse small aggregates within the biofilm mass. Enterococcus faecalis and E. coli were both able to populate the biofilm at high numbers, and suppressed the growth of A. oris and S. mutants. Enterococcus faecalis was arranged in a chain-like conformation, whereas E. coli was densely and evenly spread throughout the biofilm mass. In conclusion, it is possible for selected species that are not part of the normal oral microbiota to be introduced into an oral biofilm, under the given experimental micro-environmental conditions. Moreover, the equilibrated incorporation of A. actinomycetemcomitans and S. aureus in this oral biofilm model could be a useful tool in the study of aggressive periodontitis and peri-implantitis, in which these organisms are involved, respectively.
TI  - Outcome of aortic valve replacement for active infective endocarditis in patients on chronic hemodialysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The high risk of morbidity and mortality for patients on hemodialysis who are undergoing cardiac surgery is increased for those with active infective endocarditis (AIE). This retrospective observational single-center study evaluated the impact of chronic hemodialysis on the outcome of aortic valve replacement in patients with aortic AIE. METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected for consecutive patients undergoing aortic valve surgery for AIE diagnosed according to modified Duke criteria between October 1994 and January 2011. Characteristics and outcomes of patients receiving preoperative chronic hemodialysis were analyzed. RESULTS: Aortic valve AIE was present in 992 patients. Forty-five (4.5%) of the aortic valve AIE patients were receiving long-term hemodialysis preoperatively, 19 of whom (42.2%) had diabetes mellitus. Mean logistic EuroSCORE was 64.2% +/- 32.2%. Twenty-four preoperative septic emboli were found in 15 patients. Results of microbiologic cultures were positive in 36 patients, with the major causative organisms identified as Staphylococcus aureus (n = 17) and Enterococcus faecalis (n = 10). Isolated aortic valve replacement was performed in 19 patients (42.2%), and 26 patients (57.8%) underwent concomitant procedures. The mean follow-up was 5.3 +/- 5.2 years (range, 0.1 to 17.1 years). Postoperative complications occurred in 30 patients (66.7%). Nineteen patients (42.2%) died within 30 days of surgery, which in 8 patients was attributable to a cardiac cause. CONCLUSIONS: In patients receiving chronic hemodialysis who undergo aortic valve replacement for acute AIE, postoperative mortality is high, especially in patients undergoing aortic root replacement or culture-negative AIE.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of different filling pastes for deciduous tooth treatment.
AB  - Guedes-Pinto paste is the filling material most employed in Brazil for endodontic treatment of deciduous teeth; however, the Rifocort(R) ointment has been removed. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial potential of filling pastes, by proposing three new pharmacological associations to replace Rifocort(R) ointment with drugs of already established antimicrobial power: Nebacetin(R) ointment, 2% Chlorhexidine Gluconate gel, and Maxitrol(R) ointment. A paste composed of Iodoform, Rifocort(R) ointment and Camphorated Paramonochlorophenol (CPC) was employed as the gold standard (G1). The other associations were: Iodoform, Nebacetin(R) ointment and CPC (G2); Iodoform, 2% Chlorhexidine Digluconate gel and CPC (G3); Iodoform, Maxitrol(R) ointment and CPC (G4). The associations were tested for Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), Streptococcus oralis (S. oralis), Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), Escherichia coli (E. coli), and Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis), using the methods of dilution on solid medium - orifice agar - and broth dilution. The results were tested using statistical analysis ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis. They showed that all the pastes had a bacteriostatic effect on all the microorganisms, without any statistically significant difference, compared with G1. S. aureus was statistically significant (multiple comparison test of Tukey), insofar as G2 and G3 presented the worst and the best performance, respectively. All associations were bactericidal for E. coli, S. aureus, S. mutans and S. oralis. Only G3 and G4 were bactericidal for E. faecalis, whereas no product was bactericidal for B. subtilis. Thus, the tested pastes have antimicrobial potential and have proved acceptable for endodontic treatment of primary teeth.
TI  - Stable synthetic mono-substituted cationic bacteriochlorins mediate selective broad-spectrum photoinactivation of drug-resistant pathogens at nanomolar concentrations.
AB  - Three stable synthetic mono-substituted cationic bacteriochlorins (BC37, BC38 and BC39) were recently reported to show exceptional activity (low nanomolar) in mediating photodynamic killing of human cancer cells after a 24h incubation upon excitation with near-infrared light (730 nm). The presence of cationic quaternary ammonium groups in each compound suggested likely activity as antimicrobial photosensitizers. Herein this hypothesis was tested against a panel of pathogenic microorganisms that have all recently drawn attention due to increased drug-resistance (Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis; Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii; and fungal yeasts, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). All three bacteriochlorins were highly effective against both Gram-positive species (>6 logs of eradication at 200 nM and 10 J/cm(2)). The dicationic bacteriochlorin (BC38) was best against the Gram-negative species (>6 logs at 1-2 muM) whereas the lipophilic monocationic bacteriochlorin (BC39) was best against the fungi (>6 logs at 1 muM). The bacteriochlorins produced substantial singlet oxygen (and apparently less Type-1 reactive-oxygen species such as hydroxyl radical) as judged by activation of fluorescent probes and comparison with 1H-phenalen-1-one-2-sulfonic acid; the order of activity was BC37 > BC38 > BC39. A short incubation time (30 min) resulted in selectivity for microbial cells over HeLa human cells. The highly active photodynamic inactivation of microbial cells may stem from the amphiphilic and cationic features of the bacteriochlorins.
TI  - Synthesis, antibacterial, antioxidant activity and QSAR studies of novel 2-arylidenehydrazinyl-4-arylthiazole analogues.
AB  - A novel series of 2-arylidenehydrazinyl-4-arylthiazole analogues (3a-p) was designed and synthesized in excellent yields using a rapid, simple, efficient methodology. Sixteen novel compounds were screened for in vitro antimicrobial activities against eleven bacteria, namely, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumonia, Citrobacter freundii, Cronobacter sakazakii, Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Yersinia pestis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All 16 compounds showed significant anti-bacterial activities against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In particular, compound 3g showed potent inhibition of E. coli and K. pneumonia, compound 3i inhibited E. faecalis, compound 3n S. tythi and E. faecalis, and compound 3c E. coli and C. sakazakii. In fact, our results indicate that most of the compounds synthesized exhibit strong antibacterial activity. The qualitative structure-antibacterial activity relationships (QSAR) were studied using the physicochemical and quantum-chemical parameters of the ab initio Hartree-Fock model at the RHF/6-31G level of theory. A good qualitative correlation between predicted physicochemical parameters (log P and polar surface area (PSA)) and antibacterial activity has been found. The synthesized compounds were also evaluated for antioxidant activity. Compounds 3j, 3a and 3i exhibited the greatest antioxidant activity, with IC50 values of 0.66, 0.81, and 1.08 microM, respectively, which were comparable to that of ascorbic acid (IC50 0.87 microM). The promising antibacterial and antioxidant activities of some of these synthesized 2-arylidenehydrazinyl-4-arylthiazole derivatives, together with the results of quantum-chemical studies, could be helpful for the development of drugs to combat diseases caused by microorganisms and oxidative stress.
TI  - The question of pathogen quantification in disinfected graywater.
AB  - Graywater (GW) reuse for irrigation is recognized as a sustainable solution for water conservation. One of the major impediments to GW reuse is the presence of pathogenic microorganisms. This study monitored three similar on-site GW treatment systems bi-monthly over the course of a year to compare the presence of pathogens and indicators in raw, biologically treated, and biologically treated and disinfected [by chlorine and ultraviolet light (UV)] GW. The systems were designed to allow the testing of the same batch (collection) of water as it passed through the treatment chain. The samples were analyzed using standard culture-dependent methods and the data were compared to culture-independent DNA-based methods. Results suggested that the presence and abundance of fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa differ among the various GW streams (e.g. raw, biologically treated, and disinfected). The culture-dependent analyses suggested that both chlorine and UV inactivate most of the bacteria tested in the biologically treated GW, albeit at different efficiencies. Conversely, the DNA-based analyses indicated no significant differences in pathogenic bacterial abundance between the biologically treated GW with or without disinfection. To better understand the discrepancies between the results, we repeated the analysis in the laboratory under controlled conditions using Enterococcus faecalis as a model bacterium and obtained similar results. We suggest that disinfection of biologically treated GW with chlorine or UV is effective for treating pathogens, but that the inactivation efficiency cannot be estimated by DNA-based qPCR.
TI  - In-vitro screening of Malaysian honey from different floral sources for antibacterial activity on human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Different researches on therapeutic effects of honey have been conducted in different regions; however the study on the potential antibacterial activity of Malaysian honey is still limited. In this study, antibacterial activities of different monofloral honey samples were tested against several common human pathogenic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The well-diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) techniques were employed to investigate the putative antibacterial activity of Malaysian monofloral honey from Koompassia excelsa (Becc.) Taub (Tualang), Melaleuca cajuputi Powell (Gelam) and Durio zibethinus Murr. (Durian). Honey samples were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC6518 and ATCC25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC12228, Enterococcus faecium LMG16192, Enterococcus faecalis LMG16216 and ATCC29212, Escherichia coli ATCC25922, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC14028 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC13883. RESULTS: Marked variations were observed in the antibacterial activity of these honey samples. Durian honey failed to produce substantial antibacterial activity, whereas Tualang and Gelam honey showed a spectrum of antibacterial activity with their growth inhibitory effects against all of the tested bacterial species including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). CONCLUSION: Present findings suggested Gelam honey possesses highest antibacterial effect among the tested Malaysian honey samples.
TI  - Antibacterial compounds from Salvia adenophora Fernald (Lamiaceae).
AB  - From the aerial parts of Salvia adenophora Fernald four derivatives of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (1-4) together with five clerodane diterpenoids (5, 6, 8-10), and one known diterpene (7) have been isolated. Compounds 1-6 and 8-10 are described for the first time. The structures were established by extensive 1D, 2D NMR and HRESI-TOFMS spectroscopic methods. Finally, the absolute configuration has been established by comparing of experimental and quantum chemical calculation of ECD spectra. Despite a total lack of antimicrobial activity of the plant extract, hinting to the existence of antagonistic interactions in the crude material, three oxylipins (2-4) displayed a promising inhibition on Gram-positive multidrug-resistant clinical strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and, particularly, Staphylococcus epidermidis, while the compounds 9 and 10 revealed a specific and strain-dependent activity against S. epidermidis. Interestingly, the inhibition provided by these compounds was independent of the resistance patterns of these pathogens to classic antibiotics. No action was reported on Gram-negative strains nor on Candida albicans. These results confirm that clerodanes and, particularly, prostaglandin-like compounds can be considered as interesting antimicrobial agents deserving further study.
TI  - Pharmacological basis for the medicinal use of Linum usitatissimum (Flaxseed) in  infectious and non-infectious diarrhea.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Linum usitatissimum, commonly known as Flaxseed has traditionally been used for the management of diarrhea and gastrointestinal infections. This study was planned to assess pharmacological basis for the medicinal use of Flaxseed in infectious and non-infectious diarrhea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The crude aqueous-methanolic extract of Flaxseed was studied using the in vivo castor oil-induced diarrhea, gut motility and enteropooling assays. Mechanistic basis was further elucidated by testing the inhibitory effect on spontaneously contracting isolated rabbit jejunum preparations, suspended in a 10ml tissue bath containing Tyrode solution, maintained at 37 degrees C and aerated with carbogen. Antibacterial efficacy of the Flaxseed extract was tested against different enteric and non-enteric pathogenic bacteria using in vitro antibacterial assays. RESULTS: Flaxseed extract reduced the diarrheal score in mice, by 39%, 63.90% and 68.34% at the respective doses of 100, 300 and 500mg/kg. Intestinal secretions were reduced by 24.12%, 28.09% and 38.80%, whereas the intestinal motility was reduced by 31.66%, 46.98% and 56.20% at respective doses of 100, 300 and 500mg/kg. When tested on isolated rabbit jejunum preparations, Flaxseed extract produced a dose-dependent inhibition of both spontaneous and high K(+) (80mM)-induced contractions, and shifted the concentration-response curves of Ca(++) to the right with suppression of the maximum response, similar to that caused by verapamil. Flaxseed extract was found to possess bactericidal activity at the tested concentrations of 12.5mg/ml, against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (100%), Escherichia coli K1 (88.88%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (98.76%), Bacillus cereus (92.64%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (76.83%) and Salmonella typhi (26.91+/-3.35%). The concentration of 10mg/ml showed bactericidal effects against all the aforementioned pathogens except Escherichia coli K1, whereas for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi, it was bacteriostatic at this concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that Linum usitatissimum (Flaxseed) extract exhibits antidiarrheal and antispasmodic activities by virtue of its antimotility and antisecretory effects which are mediated possibly through inhibition of Ca(++) channels, though additional mechanism(s) cannot be ruled out. Flaxseed extract proved effective against both enteric and non-enteric pathogens causing diarrhea, thus ensuring wide coverage and rationalizing its medicinal use in both the infectious and non-infectious diarrhea.
TI  - Antimicrobial bioassay-guided fractionation of a methanol extract of Eupatorium triplinerve.
AB  - CONTEXT: Eupatorium triplinerve Vahl (Asteraceae), popularly known as Japana, is  widely used in folk medicine, due its analgesic, anticoagulant, antianorexic, antiparasitic, anthelmintic, sedative, antifungal, and antibacterial properties. OBJECTIVE: The present study evaluated the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of E. triplinerve extracts from different parts of the plant and identified the extract with the highest antimicrobial potential. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extracts were obtained by maceration of all parts of plant, and subjected to bioassay-guided fractionation of methanol extract by partition column chromatography. The major chemical groups, saponins, reducing sugars, alkaloids, steroids, triterpenoids, phenols, tannins, flavonoids, and others were screened by standard techniques. The antimicrobial activity of the different extracts was performed by microdilution assay and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were reported. RESULTS: Phytochemical screening of hydroalcoholic extract from all parts of E. triplinerve identified mainly steroids, coumarins, alkaloids, saponins, tannins, depsides and absence of polysaccharides and flavonoids. The methanol extract of leaves presented the highest content of coumarins and lower MIC values of 62 and 75 microg/mL against Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively. In addition, its non-polar fractions showed antimicrobial activity with MIC ranging from 16 to 125 microg/mL against Gram-negative bacteria, mainly Escherichia coli. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Data showed that non-polar fractions of E. triplinerve methanolic extract has better antimicrobial activity and most likely depends on the presence of several compounds, such as depsidones, coumarins, saponins, and triterpenes on crude extract. The results can be exploited largely in research of new antibacterial agents.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activity of hyperimmune globulin preparations against multiresistant nosocomial pathogens.
AB  - PURPOSE: We compared different immunoglobulin preparations containing IgG (Intraglobin/Intratect) or a mixture of IgG, IgA, and IgM (Pentaglobin) to assess the opsonic and protective efficacy of human immunoglobulin preparations against multiresistent nosocomial pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Staphylococcus aureus were tested by opsonophagocytic assay using immunologobulin preparations at dilutions usually obtained in patients. The target antigens of opsonic antibodies were characterized by opsonophagocytic inhibition assays, and the protective efficacy in vivo was tested in a mouse bacteremia model as previously described. RESULTS: All strains were killed to at least 50% by Pentaglobin. One P. aeruginosa strain was not efficiently killed by Intraglobin (23%) but the other strains were killed by Intraglobin to a similar degree compared to Pentaglobin. Opsonic IgG antibodies against E. faecalis were directed against LTA, while opsonic antibodies in Pentaglobin were primarily directed against other cell wall carbohydrates. In a mouse bacteremia model, Pentaglobin was more protective than Intratect against Staphylococcus aureus, while Intratect reduced colony counts better than normal rabbit serum or saline. CONCLUSIONS: All tested human immunoglobulin preparations contain opsonic and protective antibodies against targets present on multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Enrichment of these preparations with IgM increases the protective efficacy against some strains, probably due to antibodies directed against cell wall carbohydrates.
TI  - Comparative Structural and Functional Analysis of Staphylococcus aureus Glucokinase with other Bacterial Glucokinases.
AB  - Glucokinase is classified in bacteria based upon having ATP binding site and 'repressor/open reading frames of unknown function/sugar kinases' motif, the sequence of glucokinase gene (JN645812) of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC12600 showed presence of ATP binding site and 'repressor/open reading frames of unknown function/sugar kinases' motif. We have earlier observed glucokinase of S. aureus has higher affinity towards the substrate compared to other bacterial glucokinase and under anaerobic condition with increased glucose concentration S. aureus exhibited higher rate of biofilm formation. To establish this, 3D structure of glucokinase was built using homology modeling method, the PROCHECK and ProSA-Web analysis indicated this built glucokinase structure was close to the crystal structure. This structure was superimposed with different bacterial glucokinase structures and from the root-mean-square deviation values, it is concluded that S. aureus glucokinase exhibited very close homology with Enterococcus faecalis and Clostridium difficle while with other bacteria it showed high degree of variations both in domain and nondomain regions. Glucose docking results indicated -12.3697 kcal/mol for S. aureus glucokinase compared with other bacterial glucokinase suggesting higher affinity of glucose which correlates with enzyme kinetics and higher rate of biofilm formation.
TI  - Mechanisms of linezolid resistance in staphylococci and enterococci isolated from two teaching hospitals in Shanghai, China.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Linezolid is one of the most effective treatments against Gram-positive pathogens. However, linezolid-resistant/intermediate strains have recently emerged in worldwide. The purpose of this study was to analyse the prevalence and resistance mechanisms of linezolid-resistant/intermediate staphylococci and enterococci in Shanghai, China. RESULTS: Thirty-two linezolid-resistant/intermediate strains, including 14 Staphylococcus capitis, three Staphylococcus aureus, 14 Enterococcus faecalis and one Enterococcus faecium clinical isolates, were collected in this study which displayed linezolid MICs of 8 to 512 mug/ml, 8-32 mug/ml, 4-8 mug/ml and 4 mug/ml, respectively. All linezolid-resistant S. capitis isolates had a novel C2131T mutation and a G2603T mutation in the 23S rRNA region, and some had a C316T (Arg106Cys) substitution in protein L4 and/or harboured cfr. Linezolid-resistant S. aureus isolates carried a C389G (Ala130Gly) substitution in protein L3, and/or harboured cfr. The cfr gene was flanked by two copies of the IS256-like element, with a downstream orf1 gene. Linezolid-resistant/intermediate enterococci lacked major resistance mechanisms. The semi-quantitative biofilm assay showed that 14 linezolid-resistant E. faecalis isolates produced a larger biofilm than linezolid-susceptible E. faecalis strains. Transmission electron microscopy showed the cell walls of linezolid-resistant/intermediate strains were thicker than linezolid-susceptible strains. CONCLUSION: Our data indicated that major resistance mechanisms, such as mutations in 23S rRNA and ribosomal proteins L3 and L4, along with cfr acquisition, played an important role in linezolid resistance. Secondary resistance mechanisms, such as biofilm formation and cell wall thickness, should also be taken into account.
TI  - Anti-bacterial and anti-oxidant activities of leaf extracts of combretum vendae (combretecacea) and the isolation of an anti-bacterial compound.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Combretum vendae A.E. van Wyk (Combretaceae) is used for the treatment of bacterial related infections and oxidative related diseases by indigenous people of South Africa. Dried leaves extracts of C. vendae were investigated for bioactivity against a variety of bacterial strains and their antioxidant potential evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Constituents of leaf material were serially extracted using solvents of varying polarities, TLC chromatograms of the fractions were sprayed with 2,2 diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) to determine the presence of antioxidant compounds. Bio-autography was used to determine the number of antibacterial compounds active against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Eschericha coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined using serial microplate dilution method. The chloroform fraction was subjected to bio-assay guided column chromatography to isolate the active compound. RESULTS: The mass extracted by different solvents was below 10% dry weight. MIC values for different extracts against different pathogens ranges from 0.08 to 0.64 mg/ml. The compound isolated was identified as acacetin having an Rf value of 0.28 following elution in the Ethanol: Methanol: Water [E: M: W (10: 1.35: 1 v/v). Acacetin had MIC values ranging from 0.16 to 0.35 mg/ml. CONCLUSION: We report for the first time the isolation of acacetin as the main antibacterial compound from the leaves of Combretum vendae.
TI  - In Vitro Evaluation of the Antimicrobial Efficacy of Four Endodontic Biomaterials against Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Root canal sealers that possess good antimicrobial property can prevent residual  and recurrent infection and contribute to successful endodontic therapy. This study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of four endodontic sealers, AH Plus, Tubliseal EWT, EndoRez, and iRoot SP, against three different microorganisms, E. faecalis, C. albicans, and S. aureus, by direct contact test. 10 muL microbial suspensions were allowed to directly contact the four endodontic sealers for 1 hr at 37 degrees C. Subsequently microbial growth was measured spectrophotometrically every 30 min for 18 hours. The microbial suspensions were simultaneously tested to determine the antimicrobial effect of components which are capable of diffusing into the medium. The results revealed that AH Plus and iRootSP had significantly higher antimicrobial activity against E. faecalis. AH Plus and Tubliseal EWT showed significantly higher antimicrobial activity against C. albicans and S. aureus compared to iRoot SP and EndoRez. EndoRez showed the least antimicrobial activity against all the three microorganisms. Inhibition of microbial growth is related to the direct contact of microorganisms with the sealers. In conclusion AH Plus had significantly higher antimicrobial activity against E. faecalis, C. albicans, and S. aureus.
TI  - Phytochemical investigation and anti-microbial activity of Clausena anisata (Willd), Hook.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clausena anisata belongs to the family Rutaceae, a shrub widely used  in West Africa for the treatment of bacterial and fungal infections of the skin including boils, ringworm and eczema. The study was designed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and phytochemical screening of ethanol leaf extract of C. anisata (CLE). METHOD: Antimicrobial activity of CLE was investigated using agar well diffusion and micro-dilution methods against four Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus substilis NCTC 10073, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Bacillus thuringiensis ATCC 13838) and two Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 4853, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 4175) and a clinical isolate of Candida albicans. RESULTS: CLE was active against all test organisms with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), range of 0.5 to 7.0 mg/mL against Gram-positive bacteria, 2.5 to 1.0 mg/mL against Gram-negative bacteria and 5.5mg/mL against C. albicans. The MICs of the methanol fraction of CLE were 0.6 mg to 5.0/mL and 1.0 to 3.0 mg/mL for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria respectively. Chloroform fraction had MIC of 3.0 to 7.5 mg/mL and 2.0 to 6.5 mg/mL for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively and petroleum ether fraction had 4.5 to 8.0 mg/mL for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The CLE exhibited static action against all test organisms within a range of 0.5 to 22.0 mg/mL. Phytochemical screening of C. anisata revealed the presence of tannins, flavonoids, steroids, saponins, glycosides and alkaloids. HPLC finger-printing of the CLE and its fractions were determined. CONCLUSION: These results may justify the medicinal uses of C. anisata for the treatment of microbial infections.
TI  - Bacteriocin protein BacL1 of Enterococcus faecalis targets cell division loci and specifically recognizes L-Ala2-cross-bridged peptidoglycan.
AB  - Bacteriocin 41 (Bac41) is produced from clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis and consists of two extracellular proteins, BacL1 and BacA. We previously reported that BacL1 protein (595 amino acids, 64.5 kDa) is a bacteriolytic peptidoglycan D-isoglutamyl-L-lysine endopeptidase that induces cell lysis of E. faecalis when an accessory factor, BacA, is copresent. However, the target of BacL1 remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the targeting specificity of BacL1. Fluorescence microscopy analysis using fluorescent dye-conjugated recombinant protein demonstrated that BacL1 specifically localized at the cell division-associated site, including the equatorial ring, division septum, and nascent cell wall, on the cell surface of target E. faecalis cells. This specific targeting was dependent on the triple repeat of the SH3 domain located in the region from amino acid 329 to 590 of BacL1. Repression of cell growth due to the stationary state of the growth phase or to treatment with bacteriostatic antibiotics rescued bacteria from the bacteriolytic activity of BacL1 and BacA. The static growth state also abolished the binding and targeting of BacL1 to the cell division-associated site. Furthermore, the targeting of BacL1 was detectable among Gram-positive bacteria with an L-Ala-L-Ala-cross-bridging peptidoglycan, including E. faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Streptococcus pneumoniae, but not among bacteria with alternate peptidoglycan structures, such as Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus hirae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Listeria monocytogenes. These data suggest that BacL1 specifically targets the L-Ala-L-Ala-cross-bridged peptidoglycan and potentially lyses the E. faecalis cells during cell division.
TI  - Activity of oritavancin against Gram-positive clinical isolates responsible for documented skin and soft-tissue infections in European and US hospitals (2010-13).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess oritavancin activity in vitro against clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens causing skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) in European and US hospitals. METHODS: 13 262 consecutive and unique isolates deemed to be responsible for SSTIs were included. Isolates originated from 36 and 27 institutions in Europe (Israel included) and the USA, respectively, between 2010 and 2013. RESULTS: Oritavancin (98.8% susceptible) showed modal MIC, MIC50 and MIC90 results of 0.03, 0.03 and 0.06 mg/L, respectively, for Staphylococcus aureus. CoNS from the USA (MIC50, 0.015 mg/L) demonstrated an MIC50 value of oritavancin slightly lower than those from Europe (MIC50, 0.03 mg/L). Overall, vancomycin-resistant (VanA-phenotype) Enterococcus faecalis had oritavancin MICs (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/L) that were 16-fold higher than those obtained for vancomycin-susceptible isolates (MIC50/90, 0.015/0.03 mg/L; 99.2%-99.8% susceptible); nevertheless, oritavancin inhibited all VanA E. faecalis at </=0.5 mg/L. Equivalent oritavancin MICs (MIC50/90, 0.004/0.008 mg/L) were noted for all VanB and vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium, while higher MICs (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/L) were obtained for VanA strains. Oritavancin had low MICs against the overall populations of Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/L; 98.4%-98.6% susceptible), Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/L; 97.9%-98.0% susceptible) and the Streptococcus anginosus group (MIC50/90, 0.008/0.015 mg/L; 100.0% susceptible), with slightly higher MICs for Streptococcus dysgalactiae (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.25 mg/L; >/=98.3% susceptible). CONCLUSIONS: Oritavancin had potent activity in vitro against this contemporary collection of European and US isolates causing SSTIs. These results describe oritavancin activity against Gram-positive pathogens collected shortly prior to its regulatory approval in the USA.
TI  - Healthcare-associated infective endocarditis: a case series in a referral hospital from 2006 to 2011.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Healthcare-associated infective endocarditis (HCA-IE), a severe complication of medical care, shows a growing incidence in literature. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate epidemiology, etiology, risk factors for acquisition, complications, surgical treatment, and outcome of HCA-IE. METHODS: Observational prospective case series study (2006-2011) in a public hospital in Rio de Janeiro. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients with HCA-IE from a total of 151 cases of infective endocarditis (IE) were included. There were 26 (49%) males (mean age of 47 +/- 18.7 years), 27 (51%) females (mean age of 42 +/- 20.1 years). IE was acute in 37 (70%) cases and subacute in 16 (30%) cases. The mitral valve was affected in 19 (36%) patients and the aortic valve in 12 (36%); prosthetic valves were affected in 23 (43%) patients and native valves in 30 (57%). Deep intravenous access was used in 43 (81%) cases. Negative blood cultures were observed in 11 (21%) patients, Enterococcus faecalis in 10 (19%), Staphylococcus aureus in 9 (17%), and Candida sp. in 7 (13%). Fever was present in 49 (92%) patients, splenomegaly in 12 (23%), new regurgitation murmur in 31 (58%), and elevated C-reactive protein in 44/53 (83%). Echocardiograms showed major criteria in 46 (87%) patients, and 34 (64%) patients were submitted to cardiac surgery. Overall mortality was 17/53 (32%). CONCLUSION: In Brazil HCA-IE affected young subjects. Patients with prosthetic and native valves were affected in a similar proportion, and non-cardiac surgery was an infrequent predisposing factor, whereas intravenous access was a common one. S. aureus was significantly frequent in native valve HCA-IE, and overall mortality was high.
TI  - Baseline activity of telavancin against Gram-positive clinical isolates responsible for documented infections in U.S. hospitals (2011-2012) as determined by the revised susceptibility testing method.
AB  - Telavancin had MIC50 and MIC90 values of 0.03 and 0.06 mug/ml (100.0% susceptible), respectively, against methicillin-resistant and -susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Telavancin was active against vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.12 mug/ml; 100% susceptible) and Enterococcus faecium (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.06 mug/ml), while higher MIC values were obtained against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (MIC50/90, 1/2 mug/ml) and E. faecalis (MIC50/90, >2/>2 mug/ml). Streptococci showed telavancin modal MIC results of </= 0.015 mug/ml, except against Streptococcus agalactiae (i.e., 0.03 mug/ml). This study reestablishes the telavancin spectrum of activity against isolates recovered from the United States (2011-2012) using the revised broth microdilution method.
TI  - Clinical epidemiological study on the incidence of Escherichia coli infections in the cancer patients admitted to Surgery Department II of the Iasi Regional Oncology Institute in 2013.
AB  - The aim of study was to identify pathogens involved in hospital-acquired or community-acquired infections in patients suffering from various types of cancers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A clinical epidemiological study included a group of 355 cancer patients admitted and operated at the Surgery Department II of the Iasi Regional Oncology Institute in 2013 was performed using data from hospital statistical service and the surgery and laboratory records, then processed by epidemi ological and statistical methods. RESULTS: In cancer patients the pathogen most commonly involved in infections was E. coli, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter. Analysis of bacterial resistance to antibiotics of the pathogen most commonly involved revealed that of the 29 E. coli strains 22 were tested for resistance/sensitivity to ampicillin; of these, 19 strains showed resistance, and only 3 were sensitive; 14 E. coli strains of were resistant to cephalosporins and 8 sensitive; all strains tested were sensitive to carbapenems, imipenem or meropenem and polypeptides (colistin); the 10 tested strains showed resistance to monobactams (aztreonam). CONCLUSIONS: E. coli was incriminated in most urinary tract infections, the other pathogens being identified sporadically. Surgical wound infections were caused mostly by E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In our study we encountered increased resistance of E. coli to penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams (aztreonam), fluoro-quinolones and tetracyclines.
TI  - Synthetic teichoic acid conjugate vaccine against nosocomial Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Lipoteichoic acids (LTA) are amphiphilic polymers that are important constituents of the cell wall of many Gram-positive bacteria. The chemical structures of LTA vary among organisms, albeit in the majority of Gram-positive bacteria the LTAs feature a common poly-1,3-(glycerolphosphate) backbone. Previously, the specificity of opsonic antibodies for this backbone present in some Gram-positive bacteria has been demonstrated, suggesting that this minimal structure may be sufficient for vaccine development. In the present work, we studied a well-defined synthetic LTA-fragment, which is able to inhibit opsonic killing of polyclonal rabbit sera raised against native LTA from Enterococcus faecalis 12030. This promising compound was conjugated with BSA and used to raise rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Subsequently, the opsonic activity of this serum was tested in an opsonophagocytic assay and specificity was confirmed by an opsonophagocytic inhibition assay. The conjugated LTA-fragment was able to induce specific opsonic antibodies that mediate killing of the clinical strains E. faecalis 12030, Enterococcus faecium E1162, and community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus strain MW2 (USA400). Prophylactic immunization with the teichoic acid conjugate and with the rabbit serum raised against this compound was evaluated in active and passive immunization studies in mice, and in an enterococcal endocarditis rat model. In all animal models, a statistically significant reduction of colony counts was observed indicating that the novel synthetic LTA-fragment conjugate is a promising vaccine candidate for active or passive immunotherapy against E. faecalis and other Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Central line associated blood stream infection rate after intervention and comparing outcome with national healthcare safety network and international nosocomial infection control consortium data.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Benchmarking of central line associated blood stream infection (CLABSI) rates remains a problem in developing countries due to the variations in surveillance practices and/or infection risk as non-availability of national data. AIM: The aim of the following study was to find out the CLABSI rate before and after central line (CL) bundle intervention and compare the outcome with international surveillance data. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This prospective longitudinal cohort study on adult intensive care unit patients was conducted at Hera General Hospital, Makkah Saudi Arabia from January 1 to December 31, 2012. Five key components of bundle were selected; hand hygiene, maximal barrier precautions upon insertion, skin antisepsis, optimum site selection and daily review of line necessity with prompt removal of unnecessary lines. Post-intervention CLABSI rate was compared with National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) and International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC) rates. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 14.0 software (SPSS Inc., 233 South Wacker Drive, 11(th) floor Chicago, USA) was used for statistical analysis included regression analysis for correlation. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: CLABSI rate was reduced from 10.1 to 6.5 per 1000 CL days after interventions and had significant correlation with overall bundle compliance rate 87.6% (P = 0.02) On benchmarking, CLABSI rate after the intervention was similar to mean pool value of INICC (6.8) while higher than NHSN (3.1). The most common microorganisms isolated were; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (30.8%), Acinetobacter baumanii (23.3%) and Enterococcus faecalis (15.4%). CONCLUSION: We found that INICC data was a better benchmarking tool comparative to NHSN because it represents the countries that are developing the surveillance system. A multicenter national study is recommended.
TI  - Antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of polysaccharides, essential oil, and fatty oil extracted from Laurus nobilis growing in Lebanon.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antibacterial activity of the extracts of Laurus nobilis against three Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Staphylococcus epidermidis CIP 444) and two Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 35218 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853). Also, the antibiofilm activity has been investigated against the biofilm produced by Staphylococcus epidermidis CIP 444. MATERIALS: The polysaccharides, essential oil, and fatty oils extracted from the plant were used in broth microdilution methods to study the minimal inhibitory concentration, and then the minimal bactericidal concentration was determined. RESULTS: The results showed that alginate, fucoidan, fatty oils and essential oil have good antibacterial activities against the 5 bacterial strains, and a negligible biofilm eradication activity of fucoidan, laminaran, fatty oil, and essential oil was observed, but a promising biofilm eradication activity was obtained with alginate, which showed a reduced biofilm mass even at low concentration. CONCLUSIONS: The extracts obtained have promising antibacterial capacities which need further investigation for them to be incorporated in medical or nutritional applications.
TI  - Chemical constituent and antimicrobial effect of essential oil from Myrtus communis leaves on microorganisms involved in persistent endodontic infection compared to two common endodontic irrigants: An in vitro study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Persistent infections of human root canals play a fundamental role  in the failure of endodontic treatment. The purpose of this study is to determine the chemical composition of Myrtus communis (M. communis) essential oil and to assess its antimicrobial activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans compared to that of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and chlorhexidine (CHX). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to determine the chemical composition of essential oil from M. communis leaves. A micro-dilution susceptibility assay and disk diffusion methods were utilized to evaluate the antimicrobial activity [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum lethal dose concentration] of the tested solutions against selected microorganisms. RESULTS: GC-MS analyses revealed that M. communis contained 1, 8-Cineole (28.62%), alpha-Pinene (17.8%), Linalool (17.55%), and Geranylacetate (6.3%) as the major compounds and Geraniol (1.6%), alpha-Humulene (1.5%), eugenol (1.3%), isobutyl-isobutyrate (0.8%), and methyl chavicol (0.5%) as minor components. Chlorhexidine had the lowest MIC value among all medicaments tested. M. communis oil had less MIC values than NaOCl against both bacteria, but it had more MIC value against C. albicans. CONCLUSION: M. communis essential oil with the minimum inhibitory concentration in the range of 0.032-32 mug/mL was an effective antimicrobial agent against persistent endodontic microorganisms.
TI  - In vitro activity of oritavancin against Gram-positive pathogens isolated in Canadian hospital laboratories from 2011 to 2013.
AB  - Gram-positive pathogens isolated in 15 Canadian hospital laboratories between 2011 and 2013 were tested for susceptibility to oritavancin and comparative antimicrobial agents using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute broth microdilution method. Oritavancin demonstrated in vitro activity equivalent to, or more potent than, vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline against the isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (n=1460; oritavancin MIC90, 0.06 mug/mL; 99.7% oritavancin-susceptible), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (n=427; oritavancin MIC90, 0.06 mug/mL; 99.5% oritavancin-susceptible), Streptococcus pyogenes (n=132; oritavancin MIC90, 0.25 mug/mL; 99.2% oritavancin-susceptible), Streptococcus agalactiae (n=156; oritavancin MIC90, 0.12 mug/mL; 100% oritavancin-susceptible), and Enterococcus faecalis (n=304; oritavancin MIC90, 0.06 mug/mL; 98.7% oritavancin-susceptible) tested.
TI  - Prevalence of antibacterial resistant bacterial contaminants from mobile phones of hospital inpatients.
AB  - Mobile phones contaminated with bacteria may act as fomites. Antibiotic resistant bacterial contamination of mobile phones of inpatients was studied. One hundred and six samples were collected from mobile phones of patients admitted in various hospitals in Jazan province of Saudi Arabia. Eighty-nine (83.9%) out of 106 mobile phones were found to be contaminated with bacteria. Fifty-two (49.0%) coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, 12 (11.3%) Staphylococcus aureus, 7 (6.6%) Enterobacter cloacae, 3 (2.83%) Pseudomonas stutzeri, 3 (2.83%) Sphingomonas paucimobilis, 2 (1.8%) Enterococcus faecalis and 10 (9.4%) aerobic spore bearers were isolated. All the isolated bacteria were found to be resistant to various antibiotics. Hence, regular disinfection of mobile phones of hospital inpatients is advised.
TI  - Mapping of the modular closthioamide architecture reveals crucial motifs of polythioamide antibiotics.
AB  - Closthioamide, the first known secondary metabolite from an anaerobic microorganism (Clostridium cellulolyticum), represents a highly potent antibiotic that is active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) at nanomolar concentrations. To unveil structure-activity relationships of the unusual polythioamide natural product we have designed a synthetic grid to access analogues with altered terminal aromatic moieties, diverse p-phenyl substituents, different types and sizes of aliphatic spacers, varying numbers of thioamide residues, and diverse sizes and symmetries of the poly-beta-thioalanyl backbone. A library of 28 closthioamide analogues was tested against a panel of human pathogenic bacteria. We found that aromatic terminal groups, the defined length of the spacer groups, the presence of all six thioamide residues and the modular arrangement of the beta-thioalanyl units play essential roles for the antibiotic activity of closthioamide, yet there is a degree of freedom in the symmetry of the molecule. This study yields the first insights into pivotal structural motifs and the structural space of this new family of antibiotics, a prerequisite for the development of these promising antibiotics.
TI  - New antibacterial xanthone from the marine sponge-derived Micrococcus sp. EG45.
AB  - Microluside A [4 (19-para-hydroxy benzoyloxy-O-beta-D-cellobiosyl), 5 (30-para-hydroxy benzoyloxy-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl) xanthone (1)] is a unique O-glycosylated disubstituted xanthone isolated from the broth culture of Micrococcus sp. EG45 cultivated from the Red Sea sponge Spheciospongia vagabunda. The structure of microluside A was determined by 1D- and 2D-NMR techniques as well as high resolution tandem mass spectrometry. The antimicrobial activity evaluation showed that 1 exhibited antibacterial potential against Enterococcus faecalis JH212 and Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 8325 with MIC values of 10 and 13 muM, respectively.
TI  - Selection of potential probiotic Enterococcus faecium isolated from Portuguese fermented food.
AB  - Four Enterococcus faecium strains isolated from fermented products were evaluated for potential use as probiotic strains. In addition to efaAfm gene, commonly found in E. faecium food isolates, none of the isolates possessed virulence genes and none had positive reactions for the production of tyramine, histamine, putrescine and cadaverine in the screening medium used. All of these four isolates proved to be resistant to 65 degrees C. E. faecium 119 did not show antimicrobial activity against any of the target bacteria investigated. E. faecium 85 and 101 inhibited Listeria innocua and E. faecium DSMZ 13590. The strain E. faecium 120 inhibited seven target bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes 7946, L. monocytogenes 7947, L. innocua 2030c, L. innocua NCTC 11286, E. faecium DSMZ 13590, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213) and was chosen as the representative to assess the ability to survive gastrointestinal tract passage simulation, as well as the protective role of two food matrices (skim milk and Alheira) during its passage. For both matrices used, no significant differences (p<0.05) were obtained between the types of digestion - quick and slow passage simulation. In the skim milk matrix the isolate was reduced to values below the detection limit of the enumeration technique by the end of the two digestions, in contrast to the Alheira matrix, for which isolate 120 showed a reduction of only ca. 1 log CFU/ml. The E. faecium strain 120 was shown to be a potential candidate for further investigations as a potential probiotic culture.
TI  - Terpenoids, flavonoids and caffeic acid derivatives from Salvia viridis L. cvar.  Blue Jeans.
AB  - Three diterpenoids, 1-oxomicrostegiol (1), viroxocin (2), viridoquinone (3), were isolated from the roots of Salvia viridis L. cvar. Blue Jeans. Five known diterpenoids, microstegiol (4), 7alpha-acetoxy-14-hydroxy-8,13-abietadiene-11,12-dione (5; 7-O-acetylhorminone tautomer), 7alpha,14-dihydroxy-8,13-abietadiene-11,12-dione (6; horminone tautomer), ferruginol and salvinolonyl 12-methyl ether (7) were also found in the roots together with 1-docosyl ferulate (8), and a mixture of 2-(4'-alkoxyphenyl) ethyl alkanoates (9). Two lupane triterpenoids, 2alpha-acetoxy-lup-20(29)-en-3beta-ol (10), and 3beta-acetoxy-lup-20(29)-en-2alpha-ol (11) were found in the aerial parts together with known compounds, lup-20(29)-ene-2alpha,3beta-diol (12), ursolic acid, oleanolic acid, beta-sitosterol and beta-sitosterol glucoside. A known phenylpropanoid, trans-verbascoside (or acteoside; 13), was the main constituent in the polar fraction of the aerial part, and it is now reported in the genus Salvia for the first time. Other polyphenolic compounds were cis-verbascoside (14), leucosceptoside A (15), martynoside (16), caffeic acid, 6-O-caffeoyl-glucose (18), rosmarinic acid, salidroside, luteolin-7-O-alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-galactopyranoside, luteolin-7-O-beta-galactopyranoside, luteolin-7-O-alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-glucopyranoside, luteolin-7-O-beta-glucopyranoside, and apigenin-7-O-beta-glucopyranoside. The structures were determined by 1D-, 2D-NMR and HR-ESI-MS techniques. Compounds 6, 10, ferruginol, ursolic acid and oleanolic acid exhibited antibacterial activity against Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 775) with MIC 50 muM, 25 muM, 50 muM, 12.5 muM, 12.5 muM respectively. Ferruginol, ursolic acid and oleanolic acid were also active against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6571), and Bacillus cereus (ATCC 2599) with MIC 12.5-50 muM. 4 was also active against S.aureus (ATCC 6571) with MIC 50 muM. These values are consistent with previous studies on the antimicrobial activity of Salvia diterpenoids.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of an experimental dentifrice based on Ricinus communis.
AB  - This study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of a Ricinus communis-based experimental dentifrice for denture hygiene against the following standard strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay was performed with R. communis in pure oil at 2.5%. Only E. coli was not inhibited by R. communis, but the MIC (0.0781%) was effective against the other microorganisms. From these results it was determined the R. communis concentrations for experimental dentifrices, 1, 2, 5 and 10%, which were evaluated by the test-well diffusion in agar. The commercial dentifrices Colgate, Trihydral and Corega Brite were tested for comparative purposes. The diameter of the zones of bacterial growth inhibition produced around the wells was measured (in mm) with a rule under reflected light. Data were analyzed statistically by analysis of variance and Tukey's post-hoc test (alpha=0.05). Neither the commercial nor the experimental dentifrices were effective against E. coli. The experimental dentifrices containing R. communis at 2, 5 and 10% presented action against S. mutans, S. aureaus and E. faecallis. The experimental dentifrices showed no antimicrobial activity against Candida spp. and E. coli in any of the tested concentrations. Trihydral was the most effective. Comparing the experimental dentifrices, the product with 10% R. communis produced the largest zones of bacterial growth inhibition and had similar antimicrobial activity to the commercial dentifrices, except against S. aureus.
TI  - Oligomerization of esculin improves its antibacterial activity and modulates antibiotic resistance.
AB  - In this particular study, the antibacterial activity of esculin and oligomer fractions was assessed. MIC values of esculin and its oligomer fractions as well as of some antibiotics against Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains and against Escherichia coli multiresistant variants were determined by the standard broth microdilution method. Both esculin and oligoesculin fractions exhibited antibacterial effect against reference strains; Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium. It appears that E3 oligomer fraction had the greatest antibacterial activity against these reference strains. Besides, as E2 and E3 revealed the best antibacterial effect against multiresistant variants of E. coli, we decided to test the effect of each, combined to the antibiotic against which the variants were resistant. In the interaction study, E2 and E3 oligoesculin fractions were found to be effective in reducing the resistance of E. coli 6574 to ofloxacin and the resistance of E. coli 6228 to amoxicillin. Only E3 oligoesculin fraction showed a synergetic interaction with amoxicillin and tetracyclin against E. coli 6708, but no interaction was found either with E2 or E3 fractions against E. coli 6234. Our study allowed us to conclude that oligomerization of esculin increases its antibacterial potential, according to the degree of polymerization.
TI  - Monotreme lactation protein is highly expressed in monotreme milk and provides antimicrobial protection.
AB  - Monotremes (platypus and echidna) are the descendants of the oldest ancestor of all extant mammals distinguished from other mammals by mode of reproduction. Monotremes lay eggs following a short gestation period and after an even briefer incubation period, altricial hatchlings are nourished over a long lactation period with milk secreted by nipple-less mammary patches located on the female's abdomen. Milk is the sole source of nutrition and immune protection for the developing young until weaning. Using transcriptome and mass spectrometry analysis of milk cells and milk proteins, respectively, a novel Monotreme Lactation Protein (MLP) was identified as a major secreted protein in milk. We show that platypus and short-beaked echidna MLP genes show significant homology and are unique to monotremes. The MLP transcript was shown to be expressed in a variety of tissues; however, highest expression was observed in milk cells and was expressed constitutively from early to late lactation. Analysis of recombinant MLP showed that it is an N-linked glycosylated protein and biophysical studies predicted that MLP is an amphipathic, alpha-helical protein, a typical feature of antimicrobial proteins. Functional analysis revealed MLP antibacterial activity against both opportunistic pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus and commensal Enterococcus faecalis bacteria but showed no effect on Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Salmonella enterica. Our data suggest that MLP is an evolutionarily ancient component of milk-mediated innate immunity absent in other mammals. We propose that MLP evolved specifically in the monotreme lineage supporting the evolution of lactation in these species to provide bacterial protection, at a time when mammals lacked nipples.
TI  - Plasma components and platelet activation are essential for the antimicrobial properties of autologous platelet-rich plasma: an in vitro study.
AB  - Autologous platelet concentrates are successfully adopted in a variety of medical fields to stimulate bone and soft tissue regeneration. The rationale for their use consists in the delivery of a wide range of platelet-derived bioactive molecules that promotes wound healing. In addition, antimicrobial properties of platelet concentrates have been pointed out. In this study, the effect of the platelet concentration, of the activation step and of the presence of plasmatic components on the antimicrobial activity of pure platelet-rich plasma was investigated against gram positive bacteria isolated from oral cavity. The antibacterial activity, evaluated as the minimum inhibitory concentration, was determined through the microdilution two-fold serial method. Results seem to suggest that the antimicrobial activity of platelet-rich plasma against Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus oralis and Staphylococcus aureus is sustained by a co-operation between plasma components and platelet-derived factors and that the activation of coagulation is a fundamental step. The findings of this study may have practical implications in the modality of application of platelet concentrates.
TI  - Two hit hypothesis: an unusual complication following supra-pubic catheter insertion.
AB  - Osteomyelitis is an inflammation of the bone caused by an infection. Though bone  is normally resistant to bacterial infection, events including trauma, presence of foreign bodies including prosthesis can act as a nidus for infection. Osteomyelitis is a rare but recognised complication of radiotherapy. Osteomyelitis of the pubis has scarcely been reported as a complication following urological procedures- prostatectomy, sling surgery and catheterisation. We report a rare complication of a gentleman post radiotherapy presenting with delayed osteomyelitis of the pubis following supra-pubic catheterisation.
TI  - Carbamidocyclophanes F and G with Anti- Activity from the Cultured Freshwater Cyanobacterium sp.
AB  - Two new (1 and 2) and three known (3-5) carbamidocyclophanes were isolated from a cultured freshwater cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. (UIC 10274) obtained from a sample collected at Des Plaines, Illinois. Their planar structures and stereoconfigurations were determined by extensive spectroscopic analysis including 1D/2D NMR experiments, HRESIMS as well as CD spectroscopy. Carbamidocyclophane F (1) showed potent anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis activity in the microplate Alamar blue assay and low-oxygen-recovery assay with MIC values of 0.8 and 5.4 microM, respectively. Carbamidocyclophane F (1) also displayed antimicrobial activities against the gram positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis with MIC values of 0.1 and 0.2 microM, respectively. Carbamidocyclophane F (1) and Carbamidocyclophane G (2) both showed antiproliferative activity against MDA-MB-435 and HT-29 human cancer cell lines with IC50 values in the range from 0.5 to 0.7 microM.
TI  - Healthcare-Associated Infective Endocarditis: a Case Series in a Referral Hospital from 2006 to 2011.
AB  - Background: Healthcare-associated infective endocarditis (HCA-IE), a severe complication of medical care, shows a growing incidence in literature. Objective: To evaluate epidemiology, etiology, risk factors for acquisition, complications, surgical treatment, and outcome of HCA-IE. Methods: Observational prospective case series study (2006-2011) in a public hospital in Rio de Janeiro. Results: Fifty-three patients with HCA-IE from a total of 151 cases of infective endocarditis (IE) were included. There were 26 (49%) males (mean age of 47 +/- 18.7 years), 27 (51%) females (mean age of 42 +/- 20.1 years). IE was acute in 37 (70%) cases and subacute in 16 (30%) cases. The mitral valve was affected in 19 (36%) patients and the aortic valve in 12 (36%); prosthetic valves were affected in 23 (43%) patients and native valves in 30 (57%). Deep intravenous access was used in 43 (81%) cases. Negative blood cultures were observed in 11 (21%) patients, Enterococcus faecalis in 10 (19%), Staphylococcus aureus in 9 (17%), and Candida sp. in 7 (13%). Fever was present in 49 (92%) patients, splenomegaly in 12 (23%), new regurgitation murmur in 31 (58%), and elevated C-reactive protein in 44/53 (83%). Echocardiograms showed major criteria in 46 (87%) patients, and 34 (64%) patients were submitted to cardiac surgery. Overall mortality was 17/53 (32%). Conclusion: In Brazil HCA-IE affected young subjects. Patients with prosthetic and native valves were affected in a similar proportion, and non-cardiac surgery was an infrequent predisposing factor, whereas intravenous access was a common one. S. aureus was significantly frequent in native valve HCA-IE, and overall mortality was high.
TI  - Presence of aerobic micro-organisms and their influence on basic semen parameters in infertile men.
AB  - Urogenital tract infections in males are one of the significant etiological factors in infertility. In this prospective study, 72 patients with abnormal semen parameters or any other symptoms of urogenital tract infection were examined. Semen analysis according to the WHO 2010 manual was performed together with microbial assessment: aerobic bacteria culture, Chlamydia antigen test, Candida culture, Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma-specific culture. In total, 69.4% of semen samples were positive for at least one micro-organism. Ureaplasma sp. was the most common micro-organism found in 33% of semen samples of infertile patients with suspected male genital tract infection. The 2nd most common micro-organisms were Enterococcus faecalis (12.5%) and Escherichia coli (12.5%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (7%), Chlamydia trachomatis (7%) and Candida sp. (5.6%). Generally, bacteria were sensitive to at least one of the antibiotics tested. No statistically significant relationship was observed between the presence of aerobic micro-organisms in semen and basic semen parameters: volume, pH, concentration, total count, motility, vitality and morphology.
TI  - Enzymatic elucidation of haemocyanin from Kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus and its molecular recognition mechanism towards pathogens.
AB  - Haemocyanin is an important non-specific immune protein present in the hemolymph  of invertebrates, which have the ability to recognize the microbial pathogens and trigger the innate immune system. In this study, we isolated and purified the haemocyanin using gel filtration chromatography and investigated its microbial recognition mechanism against the invading pathogens. Kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus haemocyanin showed the single band with a molecular weight of 76 kDa on SDS-PAGE and its molecular mass was analysed through the MALDI. Pathogen recognition mechanism of M. japonicus haemocyanin was detected through bacterial agglutination, agglutination inhibition and prophenoloxidase activity. M. japonicus haemocyanin agglutinate all human blood RBC types and showed the bacterial agglutination against all tested Gram positive Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus subtilis and Gram negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris and Vibrio parahaemolyticus at the concentrations ranging from 30 to 50 mug/ml. Agglutination was inhibited by 50-200 mM of N-acetylneuraminic acid, a-D-glucose, D-galactose and D-xylose. Our results suggest that, 76 kDa subunit of M. japonicus haemocyanin recognize the pathogenic surface proteins which are present on the outer membrane of the bacteria and mediates the bacterial agglutination through haemocytes. This bacterial agglutination was visualized through Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM). This present study would be helpful to explore the importance of haemocyanin in innate immune response of M. japonicus and its eliciting pathogen recognition mechanism leads to the development of innate immunity in crustaceans.
TI  - Changing pattern of infectious agents in postneurosurgical meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The rates of postneurosurgical infections, particularly meningitis and the most common pathogens have been reported variable during the recent years. The aim of this research was to determine the prevalence of postneurosurgical meningitis and its current spectrum of infectious agent. METHODS: In a descriptive study, the postneurosurgical patients' cerebrospinal fluid was cultured on blood and MacConkey agar plates and evaluated at Microbiology Laboratory. 55 significant isolates as species level were recognized by bacteriological techniques. RESULTS: Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) was the most common organism [29(52.7%)], followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae [8(14.5%)], Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [6(10.9%)], Staphylococcus saprophyticus [5(9.1%)], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [3(5.5%)], Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus [3(5.5%)], and Enterococcus faecalis [1(1.8%)]. The majority of A. baumannii isolates were carbapenem-resistant. CONCLUSION: Our research revealed that the rate of postneurosurgical meningitis due to carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii has been increased. This finding emphasized the importance of preventive strategies against A. baumannii. The changing pattern of infectious agents in postneurosurgical meningitis over time suggests the necessity of other studies.
TI  - Development of a calcium phosphate nanocomposite for fast fluorogenic detection of bacteria.
AB  - Current procedures for the detection and identification of bacterial infections are laborious, time-consuming, and require a high workload and well-equipped laboratories. Therefore the work presented herein developed a simple, fast, and low cost method for bacterial detection based on hydroxyapatite nanoparticles with a nutritive mixture and the fluorogenic substrate. Calcium phosphate ceramic nanoparticles were characterized and integrated with a nutritive mixture for the early detection of bacteria by visual as well as fluorescence spectroscopy techniques. The composite was obtained by combining calcium phosphate nanoparticles (Ca:P ratio, 1.33:1) with a nutritive mixture of protein hydrolysates and carbon sources, which promote fast bacterial multiplication, and the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbellipheryl-beta-D-glucuronide (MUG). The composite had an average particle size of 173.2 nm and did not show antibacterial activity against Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria. After an Escherichia coli suspension was in contact with the composite for 60-90 min, fluorescence detected under UV light or by fluorescence spectrophotometer indicated the presence of bacteria. Intense fluorescence was observed after incubation for a maximum of 90 min. Thus, this calcium phosphate nanocomposite system may be useful as a model for the development of other nanoparticle composites for detection of early bacterial adhesion.
TI  - Impact of minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints on local cumulative bacterial susceptibility data and antibiotic consumption.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of bacteria depends on minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints issued by national and international breakpoint committees. The current study was performed in order to test the influence of different AST standards on local cumulative AST data and on antibiotic consumption. METHODS: Automated AST was performed with clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and E. faecium. From each species 100 prospectively collected non-duplicate clinical isolates were tested and MIC data were interpreted according to the interpretation standards issued by DIN and EUCAST, respectively. In addition cumulative AST data from clinical isolates and antibiotic consumption were monitored before and after implementation of new EUCAST MIC breakpoints. RESULTS: The susceptibility rate of P. aeruginosa against piperacillin and gentamicin, and of C. freundii against piperacillin/tazobactam increased significantly, whereas the susceptibility rates of E. cloacae, S. marcescens, and M. morganii against ciprofloxacin decreased significantly after switching from DIN to EUCAST MIC breakpoints. These changes in the cumulative antibiotic resistance pattern were reflected by enhanced consumption of piperacillin/tazobactam after implementation of EUCAST MIC breakpoints. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that changes of AST breakpoints have a significant influence on local cumulative AST data and on antibiotic consumption.
TI  - Antibacterial validation of electrogenerated hypochlorite using carbon-based electrodes.
AB  - This proof-of-concept study explores the novel use of carbon-based electrodes for the electrochemical generation of hypochlorite and compares the antimicrobial efficacy against commercial hypochlorite solution. Antimicrobial concentrations of hypochlorite were generated using pad-printed carbon and carbon fibre electrodes, yielding up to 0.027% hypochlorite in 60 min and 0.1% hypochlorite in 15 min, respectively, in a nondivided assembly. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the electrogenerated hypochlorite produced using carbon fibre electrodes was established for four medically important bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus approx. 0.025%, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis approx. 0.012%) and found to be in agreement with those determined using commercial hypochlorite solution. Therefore, carbon-based electrodes, particularly carbon fibre, have proven effective for the generation of antimicrobial concentrations of hypochlorite. The similarity of the MIC values to commercial hypochlorite solutions suggests that the antimicrobial efficacy is derived from the quantified hypochlorite generated and not due to marked cogeneration of reactive oxygen species, as identified for other assemblies. As such, the application of carbon electrodes may be suitable for the local production of hypochlorite for healthcare antisepsis. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Carbon fibre electrodes can rapidly generate antimicrobial concentrations of hypochlorite; as such, these cheap and commercially available electrodes are proposed for the local production of hypochlorite for healthcare antisepsis. Importantly, the antimicrobial properties of the electrochemically generated hypochlorite mirror those of commercial hypochlorite, suggesting this is not enhanced by the cogeneration of reactive oxygen species. This illustrates the potential use of disposable carbon electrodes for localized small-volume production of hypochlorite for surface and skin cleansing, and opens a broader scope of research into the exploitation of carbon electrodes for this application.
TI  - Which tree orders in southern Africa have the highest antimicrobial activity and  selectivity against bacterial and fungal pathogens of animals?
AB  - BACKGROUND: The study randomly screened leaf extracts of several hundred southern African tree species against important microbial pathogens to determine which taxa have the highest activity and may yield useful products to treat infections in the animal health market. METHODS: We determined the antibacterial and antifungal activity of 714 acetone leaf extracts of 537 different tree species against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. A sensitive serial dilution microplate method was used. RESULTS: Several extracts had MICs as low as 0.02 mg/ml. We analysed 14 out of the 38 tree orders where we determined the activity of more than 8 different tree species representing 89% of all species examined. There were statistically significant differences in some cases. Celastrales, Rosales and Myrtales had the highest activity against Gram-positive bacteria, the Myrtales and Fabales against the Gram-negative bacteria and the Malvales and Proteales against the fungi. Species present in the Asterales followed by the Gentiales and Lamiales had the lowest activities against all the microorganisms tested. Fabales species had the highest activities against all the microorganisms tested. There was substantial selectivity in some orders. Proteales species had very high activity against the fungi but very low activity against the bacteria. The species in the Celastrales and Rosales had very low antifungal activity, low activity against Gram-negative bacteria and very high activity against Gram-positive bacteria. CONCLUSION: Against all classes of microorganisms, the four orders containing species with the highest average antimicrobial activities also contained several species with low activities against different pathogens and vice versa. These results therefore should be used with circumspection in selecting tree orders that would yield the highest probability of finding species with promising activities. Nevertheless there was a twofold increase in probability of finding extracts with interesting antifungal activity from orders with high mean activity than from orders with low mean activity. The probability increased to threefold and fivefold for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria respectively.
TI  - Low-shear force associated with modeled microgravity and spaceflight does not similarly impact the virulence of notable bacterial pathogens.
AB  - As their environments change, microbes experience various threats and stressors,  and in the hypercompetitive microbial world, dynamism and the ability to rapidly respond to such changes allow microbes to outcompete their nutrient-seeking neighbors. Viewed in that light, the very difference between microbial life and death depends on effective stress response mechanisms. In addition to the more commonly studied temperature, nutritional, and chemical stressors, research has begun to characterize microbial responses to physical stress, namely low-shear stress. In fact, microbial responses to low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG), which emulates the microgravity experienced in space, have been studied quite widely in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Interestingly, LSMMG-induced changes in the virulence potential of several Gram-negative enteric bacteria, e.g., an increased enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli-mediated fluid secretion in ligated ileal loops of mice, an increased adherent invasive E. coli-mediated infectivity of Caco-2 cells, an increased Salmonella typhimurium-mediated invasion of both epithelial and macrophage cells, and S. typhimurium hypervirulence phenotype in BALB/c mice when infected by the intraperitoneal route. Although these were some examples where virulence of the bacteria was increased, there are instances where organisms became less virulent under LSMMG, e.g., hypovirulence of Yersinia pestis in cell culture infections and hypovirulence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes in a Caenorhabditis elegans infection model. In general, a number of LSMMG-exposed bacteria (but not all) seemed better equipped to handle subsequent stressors such as osmotic shock, acid shock, heat shock, and exposure to chemotherapeutics. This mini-review primarily discusses both LSMMG-induced as well as bona fide spaceflight-specific alterations in bacterial virulence potential, demonstrating that pathogens' responses to low-shear forces vary dramatically. Ultimately, a careful characterization of numerous bacterial pathogens' responses to low-shear forces is necessary to evaluate a more complete picture of how this physical stress impacts bacterial virulence since a "one-size-fits-all" response is clearly not the case.
TI  - Bacteriology of pressure ulcers in individuals with spinal cord injury: What we know and what we should know.
AB  - Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) are at increased risk for the development of pressure ulcers. These chronic wounds are debilitating and contribute to prolonged hospitalization and worse medical outcome. However, the species of bacteria and the role that specific species may play in delaying the healing of chronic pressure ulcers in the SCI population has not been well characterized. This study will review the literature regarding what is known currently about the bacteriology of pressure ulcers in individuals with SCI. An electronic literature search of MEDLINE (1966 to February 2014) was performed. Eleven studies detailing bacterial cultures of pressure ulcers in the SCI population met inclusion criteria and were selected for review. Among these studies, bacterial cultures were often polymicrobial with both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria identified with culture techniques that varied significantly. The most common organisms identified in pressure ulcers were Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis. In general, wounds were poorly characterized with minimal to no physical description and/or location provided. Our present understanding of factors that may alter the microbiome of pressure ulcers in individuals with SCI is quite rudimentary, at best. Well-designed studies are needed to assess appropriate wound culture technique, the impact of bacterial composition on wound healing, development of infection, and the optimum medical and surgical approaches to wound care.
TI  - Quantification of polyphenols and evaluation of antimicrobial, analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities of aqueous and acetone-water extracts of Libidibia ferrea, Parapiptadenia rigida and Psidium guajava.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Vast numbers of plant species from northeastern Brazil have not yet been phytochemically or biologically evaluated. AIM OF THE STUDY: The goal of this work was to obtain, characterize and show the antimicrobial, analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities of aqueous and acetone-water extracts of Libidibia ferrea, Parapiptadenia rigida and Psidium guajava. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The plant material (100g) was dried, and the crude extracts were obtained by using turbo-extraction (10%; w/v) with water or acetone:water (7:3, v/v) as the extraction solvent. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods were used to screen the crude extracts for hydrolysable tannins (gallic acid) and condensed tannins (catechins). The antibacterial activity was evaluated by agar-diffusion and microdilution methods against Gram-positive strains (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis INCQS 00016, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and a clinical isolate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) as well as Gram-negative strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Salmonella enteritidis INCQS 00258, Shigella flexneri and Klebsiella pneumoniae). To evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity, a leukocyte migration model was used. Analgesic activity was determined by the hot plate test and the acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing test. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) at a significance level of 5%. RESULTS: Parapiptadenia rigida presented the highest amount of total polyphenols (35.82 +/- 0.20%), while the greatest catechin content was found in the acetone-water extract of Psidium guajava (EAWPg; 1.04 mug/g). The largest amounts of catechins were found in the aqueous extract of Libidibia ferrea (EALf; 1.07 mug/g) and the acetone-water extract of Parapiptadenia rigida (EAWPr; 1.0 mug/g). All extracts showed activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The aqueous and acetone-water extracts of Psidium guajava showed the greatest inhibition zones in the agar diffusion tests. In the evaluation of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), the most susceptible Gram-positive bacterium was Staphylococcus epidermidis and the most susceptible Gram-negative bacterium was Shigella flexneri. EAPg and EAWPg showed the greatest MIC values. All extracts were significant inhibitors of leukocyte migration (p<0.05). Using the writhing test, significant analgesic activity was found for EAPr (50 mg/kg), EAWPr (100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg) and EAWPg (50 mg/kg) (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Thus, the appropriate extraction procedure preserves the chemical components such as gallic acid and catechin, and showed antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.
TI  - Whole-animal chemical screen identifies colistin as a new immunomodulator that targets conserved pathways.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to take advantage of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to perform a whole-animal chemical screen to identify potential immune activators that may confer protection against bacterial infections. We identified 45 marketed drugs, out of 1,120 studied compounds, that are capable of activating a conserved p38/PMK-1 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway required for innate immunity. One of these drugs, the last-resort antibiotic colistin, protected against infections by the Gram-negative pathogens Yersinia pestis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa but not by the Gram-positive pathogens Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. Protection was independent of the antibacterial activity of colistin, since the drug was administered prophylactically prior to the infections and it was also effective against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Immune activation by colistin is mediated not only by the p38/PMK-1 pathway but also by the conserved FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 and the transcription factor SKN-1. Furthermore, p38/PMK-1 was found to be required in the intestine for immune activation by colistin. Enhanced p38/PMK-1-mediated immune responses by colistin did not reduce the bacterial burden, indicating that the pathway plays a role in the development of host tolerance to infections by Gram-negative bacteria. IMPORTANCE: The innate immune system represents the front line of our defenses against invading microorganisms. Given the ever-increasing resistance to antibiotics developed by bacterial pathogens, the possibility of boosting immune defenses represents an interesting, complementary approach to conventional antibiotic treatments. Here we report that the antibiotic colistin can protect against infections by a mechanism that is independent of its microbicidal activity. Prophylactic treatment with colistin activates a conserved p38/PMK-1 pathway in the intestine that helps the host better tolerate a bacterial infection. Since p38/PMK-1-mediated immune responses appear to be conserved from plants to mammals, colistin may also activate immunity in higher organisms, including humans. Antibiotics with immunomodulatory properties have the potential of improving the long-term outcome of patients with chronic infectious diseases.
TI  - Bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
AB  - The ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. Fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. The frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. Experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. A specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial cells. Much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. The use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Development of a multiplex real-time PCR assay for the rapid diagnosis of neonatal late onset sepsis.
AB  - The diagnosis of late onset sepsis (LOS), a severe condition with high prevalence in preterm infants, is hampered by the suboptimal sensitivity and long turnaround time of blood culture. Detection of the infecting pathogen directly in blood by PCR would provide a much more timely result. Unfortunately, PCR-based assays reported so far are labor intensive and often lack direct species identification. Therefore we developed a real-time multiplex PCR assay tailored to LOS diagnosis which is easy-to-use, is applicable on small blood volumes and provides species-specific results within 4h. Species-specific PCR assays were selected from literature or developed using bioinformatic tools for the detection of the most prevalent etiologic pathogens: Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp. and Serratia marcescens. The PCR assays showed 100% specificity, full coverage of the target pathogens and a limit of detection (LOD) of </=10CFUeq./reaction. These LOD values were maintained in the multiplex format or when bacterial DNA was isolated from blood. Clinical evaluation showed high concordance between the multiplex PCR and blood culture. In conclusion, we developed a multiplex PCR that allows the direct detection of the most important bacterial pathogens causing LOS in preterm infants.
TI  - [Neonatal bacteremia--frequency, spectrum of organisms and correlation between clinical symptoms and laboratory data for early onset sepsis].
AB  - Improved obstetrical management and evidence-based peripartum antimicrobial therapy in the last decades reduce the frequency of early-onset neonatal sepsis (EONS) and improve the outcome. The spectrum of the microrganisms is different according to regions, countries and periods of time. Appropriate diagnosis and treatment improve the outcome. However dissociation often occurs between clinical manifestation, laboratory and microbiological findings. AIMS: To determine the incidence of neonatal bacteremia in our hospital, to identify the spectrum of organisms from positive blood cultures (BC), to analyze the correlation between clinical manifestation of EOS and/or laboratory abnormalities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was carried out at the University Hospital of Obstetrics and Gynecology "Maichin dom"- Sofia for 2012. From all 4081 inborn babies 848 were at risk for maternal-fetal infection. In the first two hours after birth they were screened for EONS using a panel of microbiological probes and laboratory blood tests, followed up the next days. According the guidelines of the Neonatology clinic a standard antibiotic therapy was started. 43 of the screened infants (1.05% of all inborn babies) had positive BC and were enrolled in this study. RESULTS: Sixteen from the 43 babies with positive BC were with birthweight > 2500g (0.48% from all 3316 life born term infants), 27--with birthweight < 2500g (3.5% from all 765 low birthweight babies), 24 were patients of the NICU (3.8% of all 635 babies admitted at the NICU for 2012). No one died. The following groups of organisms in BC were isolated: 24 BC with coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Methicilline sensitive (MSCoNS)--11 of them without any clinical symptoms and laboratory abnormalities were interpreted as result of contamination, 1 BC with Staphylococcus aureus MS (MSSA), 8 with alpha-Streptococci, 5 with Enterococcus faecalis (1 in combination with MSCoNS), 2 with GBS, 2 with Aerococcus urinae and 2 BC with Listeria monocytogenes. Gram-negative organisms were not found in BC after birth. 30 from the infants with positive BC didn't show any clinical symptom of EONS. 20 of them were without laboratory criteria for infection and were discharged after negative BC control. 10 newborns were with transient elevation of CRP but without clinical symptoms. 13 babies showed clinical symptoms of EOS, 3 of them had transient respiratory failure, but negative laboratory criteria. 10 babies met the clinical and laboratory criteria for EONS; in 8 of them the CRP was significantly elevated. Most critically ill were 3 ELBW and ELGA babies: 2 twins with Listeria and 1 baby with MSSA-EONS. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, CoNS were found to be the most common cause of EONS or bacteremia, low incidence of GBS sepsis was established. Almost the half of the babies with positive BC were asymptomatic and without laboratory data for infection. Elevation of the CRP-value was the most frequent laboratory abnormality in symptomatic infants.
TI  - Inspecting the potential physiological and biomedical value of 44 conserved uncharacterised proteins of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The major Gram-positive coccoid pathogens cause similar invasive diseases and show high rates of antimicrobial resistance. Uncharacterised proteins shared by these organisms may be involved in virulence or be targets for antimicrobial therapy. RESULTS: Forty four uncharacterised proteins from Streptococcus pneumoniae with homologues in Enterococcus faecalis and/or Staphylococcus aureus were selected for analysis. These proteins showed differences in terms of sequence conservation and number of interacting partners. Twenty eight of these proteins were monodomain proteins and 16 were modular, involving domain combinations and, in many cases, predicted unstructured regions. The genes coding for four of these 44 proteins were essential. Genomic and structural studies showed one of the four essential genes to code for a promising antibacterial target. The strongest impact of gene removal was on monodomain proteins showing high sequence conservation and/or interactions with many other proteins. Eleven out of 40 knockouts (one for each gene) showed growth delay and 10 knockouts presented a chaining phenotype. Five of these chaining mutants showed a lack of putative DNA-binding proteins. This suggest this phenotype results from a loss of overall transcription regulation. Five knockouts showed defective autolysis in response to penicillin and vancomycin, and attenuated virulence in an animal model of sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Uncharacterised proteins make up a reservoir of polypeptides of different physiological importance and biomedical potential. A promising antibacterial target was identified. Five of the 44 examined proteins seemed to be virulence factors.
TI  - Beyond paraquats: dialkyl 3,3'- and 3,4'-bipyridinium amphiphiles as antibacterial agents.
AB  - Dialkyl 4,4'-bipyridinium compounds, known as 'paraquats' (PQs), have a long history of use as herbicides, as redox indicators, and more recently as potent antibacterial agents. However, due to their ability to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vivo, PQs are also known to be toxic. We proposed that altering the electrochemical properties of PQ, specifically by preparing isomeric bipyridinium structures with 3,3'- and 3,4'-substitution of the nitrogen heteroatoms on the biaryl core, would maintain antibacterial activity, yet decrease toxicity. We have thus prepared a series of 17 amphiphiles, dubbed 'metaquat' (MQ) and 'parametaquat' (PMQ), respectively, and investigated their antibacterial and electrochemical properties. Optimal inhibition of bacterial growth was observed in symmetric, biscationic structures; minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values measured as low as 0.5 muM against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria for the compound PMQ-11,11. Electrochemical analysis demonstrated the redox properties of the dialkyl 3,3'- and 3,4'-bipyridinium amphiphiles to be distinct from those of the 4,4'-bipyridinium isomer. Thus MQ and PMQ amphiphiles maintain the strong antibacterial activity of the PQ isomers, but show promise for reduced ROS toxicity.
TI  - Improved antibacterial behavior of titanium surface with torularhodin-polypyrrole film.
AB  - The problem of microorganisms attaching and proliferating on implants and medical devices surfaces is still attracting interest in developing research on different coatings based on antibacterial agents. The aim of this work is centered on modifying titanium (Ti) based implants surfaces through incorporation of a natural compound with antimicrobial effect, torularhodin (T), by means of a polypyrrole (PPy) film. This study tested the potential antimicrobial activity of the new coating against a range of standard bacterial strains: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The morphology, physical and electrochemical properties of the synthesized films were assessed by SEM, AFM, UV-Vis, FTIR and cyclic voltammetry. In addition, biocompatibility of this new coating was evaluated using L929 mouse fibroblast cells. The results showed that PPy-torularhodin composite film acts as a corrosion protective coating with antibacterial activity and it has no harmful effect on cell viability.
TI  - Antibacterial efficiency of vermiculite/chlorhexidine nanocomposites and results  of the in vivo test of harmlessness of vermiculite.
AB  - Clay minerals have been proposed as very useful materials for modulating drug delivery. These are the commonly used materials in pharmaceutical production both as inorganic carriers or active agents. We focused on the development of suitable long-acting material for local treatment of oral infection where clay minerals act as inorganic drug carriers. Organovermiculites with antibacterial activity were prepared by ion exchange reactions using different concentrations of chlorhexidine diacetate. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermal analysis (TGA). The antibacterial activity was evaluated by finding the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). All studied organoclays possessed good antibacterial activity after 24h exposure against Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and particularly against Staphylococcus aureus. Pseudomonas aeruginosa however proved very resistant as only the sample with the highest concentration of CA that successfully inhibited bacterial growth. Furthermore, clay mineral vermiculite was subjected to in vivo toxicological analysis and its influence on gastrointestinal tract during its oral application was investigated. Tissue samples from buccal mucosa, tongue, esophagus, stomach, terminal duodenum, small intestine, caecum, distal colon and liver were subjected to histological examination, both macroscopically and microscopically. Neither systemic nor local reactions were observed. Therefore the toxicity of vermiculite to a mammal model organism can be excluded.
TI  - Novel nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes sequenced from intertidal mudflat bacteria.
AB  - Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) are actively sought out, due to pharmacologically important activities of their metabolites. In marine environment, the most prevalent nonribosomal peptide antibiotic producers are sponges inhabiting microorganisms. Conversely, strains from marine sediments and more especially from intertidal mudflats have not been extensively screened for the presence of new NRPS. In this study, for the first time, a collection of one hundred intertidal mudflat bacterial isolates (Marennes-Oleron Bay, France) was assessed for (1) the presence of NRPS genes by degenerated PCR targeting conserved adenylation domains and (2) for their production of antimicrobial molecules. (1) Bacteria with adenylation domains (14 strains) were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and grouped into Firmicutes (one strain) and Proteobacteria (13 strains). In silico analysis of the NRPS amino acid sequences (n = 7) showed 41-58% ID with sequences found in the NCBI database. Three new putative adenylation domain signatures were found. (2) The culture supernatant of one of these strains, identified as a Bacillus, was shown to strongly inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis. This study portends that the intertidal mudflat niche could be of interest for the discovery of new NRPS genes and antimicrobial producing strains.
TI  - Screening and characterisation of antimicrobial properties of semisynthetic betulin derivatives.
AB  - Betulin (lup-20(29)-ene-3beta, 28-diol) is a naturally occurring triterpene, which is found in substantial amounts from the outer bark of birch trees. A library of 51 structurally diverse semisynthetic betulin derivatives was screened against five bacterial strains, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and a fungal strain Candida albicans, using broth microdilution assays. Primary antimicrobial screening at 50 microM concentration led to the identification of five compounds showing antimicrobial properties (inhibition of growth by >70% against one or more microbial strains). According to the dose-response results, 28-O-(N-acetylanthraniloyl)betulin (compound 5) was the most active, showing MIC90 of 6.25 microM against two Gram-positive bacteria, E. faecalis and S. aureus. However, the activity of this compound was affected by albumin binding, which was demonstrated by the loss of activity in a host-pathogen co-culture assay as well as in the antibacterial assay in the presence of increased concentration of albumin. Furthermore, the effects on mammalian cells were evaluated by cytotoxicity assessment on hepatocyte cell culture after 24 h exposure to the compounds. Betulinic aldehyde (18), betulin-28-oxime (31) and hetero cycloadduct with acetoxy groups at carbon atoms 3 and 28 and ethyl substituent at the triazolo ring (43) displayed cytotoxicity towards hepatocytes, with IC50 values of 47, 25 and 16 microM, respectively. The IC50 value for 28-O-(N-acetylanthraniloyl)betulin (5) was 56 microM. The current study presents an insight into using betulin scaffold for developing derivatives with antibacterial potential, and furthermore the necessity of in-depth analysis of found actives through selectivity profiling and follow-up studies including in silico ADMET predictions.
TI  - Using color histograms and SPA-LDA to classify bacteria.
AB  - In this work, a new approach is proposed to verify the differentiating characteristics of five bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus oralis, and Staphylococcus aureus) by using digital images obtained with a simple webcam and variable selection by the Successive Projections Algorithm associated with Linear Discriminant Analysis (SPA-LDA). In this sense, color histograms in the red-green-blue (RGB), hue-saturation-value (HSV), and grayscale channels and their combinations were used as input data, and statistically evaluated by using different multivariate classifiers (Soft Independent Modeling by Class Analogy (SIMCA), Principal Component Analysis-Linear Discriminant Analysis (PCA-LDA), Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and Successive Projections Algorithm-Linear Discriminant Analysis (SPA-LDA)). The bacteria strains were cultivated in a nutritive blood agar base layer for 24 h by following the Brazilian Pharmacopoeia, maintaining the status of cell growth and the nature of nutrient solutions under the same conditions. The best result in classification was obtained by using RGB and SPA-LDA, which reached 94 and 100 % of classification accuracy in the training and test sets, respectively. This result is extremely positive from the viewpoint of routine clinical analyses, because it avoids bacterial identification based on phenotypic identification of the causative organism using Gram staining, culture, and biochemical proofs. Therefore, the proposed method presents inherent advantages, promoting a simpler, faster, and low-cost alternative for bacterial identification.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of Medilox(R) super-oxidized water.
AB  - AIM: Super-oxidized water is one of the broad spectrum disinfectants, which was introduced recently. There are many researches to find reliable chemicals which are effective, inexpensive, easy to obtain and use, and effective for disinfection of microorganisms leading hospital infections. Antimicrobial activity of super-oxidized water is promising. The aim of this study was to investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of different concentrations of Medilox(R) super-oxidized water that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as high level disinfectant. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, super-oxidized water obtained from Medilox(R) [Soosan E & C, Korea] device, which had been already installed in our hospital, was used. Antimicrobial activities of different concentrations of super-oxidized water (1/1, 1/2, 1/5, 1/10, 1/20, 1/50, 1/100) at different exposure times (1, 2, 5, 10, 30 min) against six ATCC strains, eight antibiotic resistant bacteria, yeasts and molds were evaluated using qualitative suspension test. Dey-Engley Neutralizing Broth [Sigma-Aldrich, USA] was used as neutralizing agent. RESULTS: Medilox(R) was found to be effective against all standard strains (Acinetobacter baumannii 19606, Escherichia coli 25922, Enterococcus faecalis 29212, Klebsiella pneumoniae 254988, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27853, Staphylococcus aureus 29213), all clinical isolates (Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Myroides spp.), and all yeastsat 1/1 dilution in >/=1 minute. It was found to be effective on Aspergillus flavus at 1/1 dilution in >/=2 minutes and on certain molds in >/=5 minutes. CONCLUSION: Medilox(R) super-oxidized water is a broad spectrum, on-site producible disinfectant, which is effective on bacteria and fungi and can be used for the control of nosocomial infection.
TI  - Susceptibility of methacrylate-based root canal filling to degradation by bacteria found in endodontic infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To present a case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, Resilon/RealSeal (RS). To determine if RS is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show RS degradation. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Emulsions of RS were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. Lipase PS served as a positive control. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for their ability to biodegrade RS. The bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for RS degradation for 7 days. RESULTS: Degradation of the emulsified RS manifested in the formation of clear zones around P aeruginosa, P intermedia, P asaccharolytica, S aureus, and S epidermidis. No degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain RS emulsion. CONCLUSION: Endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade RS. These findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with RS may be impaired by a microbial insult.
TI  - Evaluation of the antimicrobial potency of silver nanoparticles biosynthesized by using an endophytic fungus, Cryptosporiopsis ericae PS4.
AB  - In the present study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with an average particle size  of 5.5 +/- 3.1 nm were biosynthesized using an endophytic fungus Cryptosporiopsis ericae PS4 isolated from the ethno-medicinal plant Potentilla fulgens L. The nanoparticles were characterized using UV-visible spectrophotometer, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), selective area electron diffraction (SAED), and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy analysis. Antimicrobial efficacy of the AgNPs was analyzed singly and in combination with the antibiotic/antifungal agent chloramphenicol/fluconazole, against five pathogenic microorganisms--Staphylococcus aureus MTCC96, Salmonella enteric MTCC735, Escherichia coli MTCC730, Enterococcus faecalis MTCC2729, and Candida albicans MTCC 183. The activity of AgNPs on the growth and morphology of the microorganisms was studied in solid and liquid growth media employing various susceptibility assays. These studies demonstrated that concentrations of AgNPs alone between 10 and 25 muM reduced the growth rates of the tested bacteria and fungus and revealed bactericidal/fungicidal activity of the AgNPs by delaying the exponential and stationary phases. Examination using SEM showed pits and ruptures in bacterial cells indicating fragmented cell membrane and severe cell damage in those cultures treated with AgNPs. These experimental findings suggest that the biosynthesized AgNPs may be a potential antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Mechanisms of vancomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic used for the treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections. Traditionally, it has been used as a drug of last resort; however, clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin (vancomycin intermediate-resistant S. aureus [VISA]) and more recently with high-level vancomycin resistance (vancomycin-resistant S. aureus [VRSA]) have been described in the clinical literature. The rare VRSA strains carry transposon Tn1546, acquired from vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, which is known to alter cell wall structure and metabolism, but the resistance mechanisms in VISA isolates are less well defined. Herein, we review selected mechanistic aspects of resistance in VISA and summarize biochemical studies on cell wall synthesis in a VRSA strain. Finally, we recapitulate a model that integrates common mechanistic features of VRSA and VISA strains and is consistent with the mode of action of vancomycin.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of cationic peptides in endodontic procedures.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial and biofilm  inhibition activity of synthetic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) against microbes such as Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans which are involved in endodontic infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Agar diffusion test was done to determine the activity of peptides. The morphological changes in E. faecalis and reduction in biofilm formation after treatment with peptides were observed using scanning electron microscope. The efficacy of peptides using an ex vivo dentinal model was determined by polymerase chain reaction and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Platelet aggregation was done to determine the biocompatibility of peptides. RESULTS: Among 11 peptides, two of the amphipathic cationic peptides were found to be highly active against E. faecalis, S. aureus, C. albicans. Efficacy results using dentinal tubule model showed significant reduction in microbial load at 400 mum depth. The peptides were also biocompatible. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that synthetic AMPs have the potential to be developed as antibacterial agents against microorganisms involved in dental infections and thus could prevent the spread and persistence of endodontic infections improving treatment outcomes and teeth preservation.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of Azadirachta indica, Mimusops elengi, Tinospora cardifolia, Ocimum sanctum and 2% chlorhexidine gluconate on common endodontic pathogens: An in vitro study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To check the antimicrobial activity of Azadirachta indica (Neem), Ocimum sanctum (Tulsi), Mimusops elelngi (Bakul), Tinospora cardifolia (Giloy) and Chlorhexidine Gluconate (CHX) on common endodontic pathogens like Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The agar diffusion test was used to check the antimicrobial activity of the Methanolic extracts of the medicinal plants along with CHX. Six different concentrations of the tested agents were used for the study. The values of Zone of Inhibition were tabulated according to the concentration of the tested agent and data was statistically analyzed using ANOVA and Bonferroni post- hoc tests. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentrations (MBC) values were also recorded. RESULTS: All the plants extracts showed considerable antimicrobial activity against selected endodontic pathogens. At 3mg. concentration, O.sanctum was the most effective against S. mutans, M. elengi showed highest zone of inhibition against E.faecalis, whereas CHX was the most effective agent against S.aureus. CHX was also the most consistent of all the medicaments testes, showing inhibitory effect against all the tree pathogens at all the selected concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: The Methanolic extract of A.Indica, O.sanctum, M. Elengi, T.cardifolia and Chlorhexidine Gluconate has considerable antimicrobial activity against S. mutans, E. faecalis and S. aureus.
TI  - Prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and its antibacterial susceptibility pattern among pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic at kanpur, India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Symptomatic and asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is common in pregnant  women. Pregnancy enhances the progression from ASB to symptomatic bacteriuria, which if left untreated, could lead to acute pyelonephritis and other adverse outcomes such as prematurity, postpartum, hypertensive disease, anaemia, UTIs and higher foetal mortality rates. AIM: To identify the prevalence of ASB, the most common causative microorganisms and the antibacterial susceptibilities of the isolated microorganisms at a tertiary care centre at Kanpur, India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total number of 300 asymptomatic pregnant women were screened for ASB by urine culture by using a semi quantitative culture method. RESULTS: In this study, significant bacteriuria was found in only 22 cases (7.3%). Growth of contaminants was seen in 40 cases (13.3%). Among cases which showed positive cultures, 48.9% were primigravidae and 51.1% were multigravidae. Highest incidence was reported in age group of 21-30 years. The predominant organisms which were isolated were Escherichia coli, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis. Escherichia coli, the most common isolate, was found to be only 61% and 70% sensitive to ampicillin and amoxicillin + clavulanate, respectively. Sensitivity to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin was 95%, and sensitivity to amikacin was 99%. Hundred percent sensitivity was found for the broad spectrum pencillins, imipenem, and meropenem. Klebsiella pneumoniae, the second most frequent organism which was grown on culture, was only 11% sensitive to ampicillin, while sensitivity to amoxicillin + clavulanate and cefuroxime was 86%. 100% sensitivity was found for cefepime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, imipenem and meropenem. CONCLUSION: Routine urine culture test should be carried out for all antenatal women, to detect asymptomatic bacteriuria, and every positive case should be treated with appropriate antibiotic therapy, to prevent any obstetric complication which is associated with pregnancy.
TI  - Endophytic fungi from Myrcia guianensis at the Brazilian Amazon: distribution and bioactivity.
AB  - Beneficial interactions between plants and microorganisms have been investigated  under different ecological, physiological, biochemical, and genetic aspects. However, the systematic exploration of biomolecules with potential for biotechnological products from this interaction still is relatively scarce. Therefore, this study aimed the evaluation of the diversity and antimicrobial activity of the endophytic fungi obtained from roots, stems and leafs of Myrcia guianensis (Myrtaceae) from the Brazilian Amazon. 156 endophytic fungi were isolated and above 80% were identified by morphological examination as belonging to the genera Pestalotiopsis, Phomopsis, Aspergillus, Xylaria, Nectria, Penicillium and Fusarium. Fermented broth of those fungi were assayed for antimicrobial activity and four inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans and Penicillium avellaneum. As the strain named MgRe2.2.3B (Nectria haematococca) had shown the most promising results against those pathogenic strains, its fermented broth was fractioned and only its two low polar fractions demonstrated to be active. Both fractions exhibited a minimum bactericidal concentration of 50 mug.mL(-1) against S. aureus and a minimum fungicidal concentration of 100 mug.mL(-1) against P. avellaneum. These results demonstrate the diversity of fungal genera in M. guianensis and the potential of these endophytic fungi for the production of new antibiotics.
TI  - Effect of addition of 2% chlorhexidine or 10% doxycycline on antimicrobial activity of biodentine.
AB  - AIM: The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether the addition of  2% chlorhexidine gluconate or 10% doxycycline would enhance the antimicrobial activity of Biodentine against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC-25923), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC-29212), Candida albicans (ATCC-90028), and Streptococcus mutans (MTCC-497). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three wells of 4 mm diameter and 4 mm depth on each plate were prepared on the agar medium with standardized suspensions of each microorganism. Biodentine powder mixed with 2% chlorhexidine (0.06 g) or 10% doxycycline (0.30 g) in its liquid or liquid alone was placed to fill each well. Plates were incubated at 37 degrees C as required for microbial growth. A blinded, independent observer measured zones of inhibition. The data were analyzed using independent "t" test to compare the differences among the three cement preparations for different micro-organisms. RESULTS: All Biodentine samples inhibited microbial growth. The highest mean diameters of zone of inhibition for all the micro-organisms were found around Biodentine/chlorhexidine (13.417) followed by Biodentine alone (12.236) and Biodentine/doxycycline (11.25). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, adding 2% chlorhexidine gluconate in liquid of Biodentine enhanced the antimicrobial activity of Biodentine against all the tested micro-organisms except Candida albicans, while addition of 10% doxycycline decreased the antimicrobial activity of Biodentine. The differences were significant statistically (P < 0.05).
TI  - Use of a dissolved oxygen microsensor for assessing the viability and thickness of microbial biofilm on root surfaces.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the use of a dissolved oxygen microsensor (DOMS) for assessing the viability and thickness of microbial biofilms on the apical external surface of contaminated human tooth roots. METHODOLOGY: Apical biofilm formation was evaluated in 15 roots contaminated in vitro with a polymicrobial mixture of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans for 7, 21 and 60 days and in three freshly extracted roots with associated radiographically visible periapical lesions. In each root, the thickness and viability (measured by the amount of dissolved oxygen) of biofilm formed on the apical 2 mm were examined with the DOMS. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used as an auxiliary analysis to confirm the existence of the biofilms detected by the DOMS. RESULTS: The DOMS detected dissolved oxygen on the biofilms formed on the three residual roots up to thickness of 375 mum, 480 mum and 1650 mum. In the 15 roots contaminated in vitro, the DOMS detected dissolved oxygen in six specimens up to thicknesses from 75 to 250 mum, and the intensity of the metabolic activity (biofilm thickness) was directly proportional to the contamination time. SEM confirmed the presence of biofilm in all roots. CONCLUSION: The dissolved oxygen microsensor allowed the measurement of the amount of dissolved oxygen in the biofilm, which is indicative of the intensity of the microbial metabolic activity (viability), correlating the results with biofilm thickness. The DOMS was effective in freshly extracted roots, but had limitations in roots contaminated in vitro after short periods (7 and 21 days) of contamination.
TI  - Bacteriology and drug susceptibility analysis of pus from patients with severe intra-abdominal infection induced by abdominal trauma.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to retrospectively analyze the bacteriology and  drug susceptibility of pus flora from abdominal trauma patients with severe intra-abdominal infection (SIAI). A total of 41 patients with SIAI induced by abdominal trauma were enrolled in the study, from which 123 abdominal pus samples were obtained. The results from laboratory microbiology and drug sensitivity were subjected to susceptibility analysis using WHONET software. A total of 297 strains were isolated in which Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria and fungi accounted for 53.5 (159/297), 44.1 (131/297) and 0.7% (2/297), respectively. Anaerobic bacteria accounted for 1.7%. The five predominant bacteria were Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). E. coli was highly susceptible to cefoperazone (91%) and imipenem (98%), while Gram-positive cocci were highly susceptible to teicoplanin (100%) and linezolid (100%). S. aureus was 100% susceptible to vancomycin and K. pneumoniae was highly susceptible to imipenem (100%) and amikacin (79%). P. aeruginosa was the most susceptible to ciprofloxacin (90%). Gram-negative bacterial infection was present in the majority of cases of SIAI. However, a large number of patients were infected by Gram-positive bacteria, particularly S. aureus that exhibited significant resistance to penicillin (100%), oxacillin (100%) and a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic cefotaxime (95%). Amongst the pathogenic bacteria that cause SIAI, both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria account for a high proportion, so high-level and broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initially used.
TI  - Influence of acetylation degree and molecular weight of homogeneous chitosans on  antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  - The results given in the literature are conflicting when considering the relationship between antimicrobial activity and chitosan characteristics. To be able to clarify, we prepared fifteen homogeneous chitosans with different acetylation degrees (DA) and molecular weights (MW) by reacetylation of a fully deacetylated chitin under homogeneous conditions. They were tested at different pH values for their antimicrobial activities against four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhi), four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Micrococcus luteus) and three fungi (Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum and Alternaria solani). Chitosans markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria and fungi tested, although the inhibitory effect depends on the type of microorganism and on the chitosan characteristics (DA and MW) with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the range of 0.001 to 0.1 w%. Considering chitosan efficiency on bacteria, our series of data clearly show that the lower DA and the lower pH give the larger efficiency. Antibacterial activity was further enhanced for Gram-negative bacteria with decreasing MW, whereas, opposite effect was observed with the Gram-positive. Concerning the antifungal activity, the influence of chitosan characteristics was dependent on the particular type of fungus. Fungal growth decreased with increasing MW for F. oxysporum and decreasing DA for A. solani, but no MW or DA dependences were observed with A. niger.
TI  - Safety of topical vancomycin for pediatric spinal deformity: nontoxic serum levels with supratherapeutic drain levels.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. OBJECTIVE: To establish if drain levels exceed the minimum inhibitory concentrations for common pathogens (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and Propionibacterium acnes-2 mug/mL; Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis-4 mug/mL). Evaluate the safety of topical vancomycin in pediatric patients undergoing spinal deformity surgery and determine if postoperative serum levels approach toxicity (25 mug/mL). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The application of topical vancomycin powder has decreased postoperative wound infections in retrospective analyses in the adult population with minimal local and systemic risks. The safety and efficacy of vancomycin powder has not been completely evaluated in the pediatric population after deformity surgery. METHODS: Topical vancomycin powder (1 g) was applied during wound closure after instrumented posterior spinal fusion. All patients received intravenous perioperative antibiotics and a subfascial drain was used. Serum and drain vancomycin levels were collected immediately postoperatively and during the first 2 postoperative days (PODs). Complications were recorded. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 25 patients with a mean age of 13.5 years (9.5-17.1 yr) and mean +/- standard deviation body weight of 44.5 +/- 18 kg. Underlying diagnoses included: adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (12), neuromuscular scoliosis (10), and kyphosis (3). Mean serum vancomycin levels trended downward from 2.5 mug/mL (POD 0) to 1.9 mug/mL (POD 1) to 1.1 mug/mL (POD 2). Mean drain levels also trended downward from 403 mug/mL (POD 0) to 251 mug/mL (POD 1) to 115 mug/mL (POD 2). No vancomycin toxicity or deep wound infections were observed. One patient with neuromuscular scoliosis developed a superficial wound dehiscence that was managed with dressing changes. CONCLUSION: Topical application of vancomycin powder in pediatric spinal deformity surgery produced local levels well above the minimum inhibitory concentration for common pathogens and serum levels below the toxicity threshold (25 mug/mL). There were no deep wound or antibiotic related complications. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.
TI  - Quality control MIC ranges used for telavancin with application of a revised CLSI reference broth microdilution method.
AB  - The telavancin broth microdilution susceptibility testing method was revised, which provides MIC results lower than those obtained by the previous method. This study was performed to reestablish the quality control ranges for telavancin when tested against the strains (updated MIC range) Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 (0.03 to 0.12 mug/ml), Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 (0.03 to 0.12 mug/ml), and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 (0.004 to 0.015 mug/ml).
TI  - Determination of kinetics and the crystal structure of a novel type 2 isopentenyl diphosphate: dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase from Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IDI) is a key enzyme in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway and is required for all organisms that synthesize isoprenoid metabolites from mevalonate. Type 1 IDI (IDI-1) is a metalloprotein that is found in eukaryotes, whereas the type 2 isoform (IDI-2) is a flavoenzyme found in bacteria that is completely absent from human. IDI-2 from the pathogenic bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli. Steady-state kinetic studies of the enzyme indicated that FMNH2 (KM =0.3 muM) bound before isopentenyl diphosphate (KM =40 muM) in an ordered binding mechanism. An X-ray crystal structure at 1.4 A resolution was obtained for the holoenzyme in the closed conformation with a reduced flavin cofactor and two sulfate ions in the active site. These results helped to further approach the enzymatic mechanism of IDI-2 and, thus, open new possibilities for the rational design of antibacterial compounds against sequence-similar and structure-related pathogens such as Enterococcus faecalis or Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Potent oxazolidinone antibacterials with heteroaromatic C-ring substructure.
AB  - Novel oxazolidinone analogues bearing a condensed heteroaromatic ring as the C-ring substructure were synthesized as candidate antibacterial agents. Analogues 16 and 21 bearing imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine and 18 and 23 bearing [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine as the C-ring had excellent in vitro antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP). They also showed promising therapeutic effects in a mouse model of lethal infection. Preliminary safety data (inhibitory effects on cytochrome P450 isoforms and monoamine oxidases) were satisfactory. Further evaluation of 18 and 23 is ongoing.
TI  - Phage neutralization by sera of patients receiving phage therapy.
AB  - The aim of our investigation was to verify whether phage therapy (PT) can induce  antiphage antibodies. The antiphage activity was determined in sera from 122 patients from the Phage Therapy Unit in Wroclaw with bacterial infections before and during PT, and in sera from 30 healthy volunteers using a neutralization test. Furthermore, levels of antiphage antibodies were investigated in sera of 19 patients receiving staphylococcal phages and sera of 20 healthy volunteers using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The phages were administered orally, locally, orally/locally, intrarectally, or orally/intrarectally. The rate of phage inactivation (K) estimated the level of phages' neutralization by human sera. Low K rates were found in sera of healthy volunteers (K </= 1.73). Low K rates were detected before PT (K </= 1.64). High antiphage activity of sera K > 18 was observed in 12.3% of examined patients (n = 15) treated with phages locally (n = 13) or locally/orally (n = 2) from 15 to 60 days of PT. High K rates were found in patients treated with some Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis phages. Low K rates were observed during PT in sera of patients using phages orally (K </= 1.04). Increased inactivation of phages by sera of patients receiving PT decreased after therapy. These results suggest that the antiphage activity in patients' sera depends on the route of phage administration and phage type. The induction of antiphage activity of sera during or after PT does not exclude a favorable result of PT.
TI  - Innate host defense requires TFEB-mediated transcription of cytoprotective and antimicrobial genes.
AB  - Animal host defense against infection requires the expression of defense genes at the right place and the right time. Understanding such tight control of host defense requires the elucidation of the transcription factors involved. By using an unbiased approach in the model Caenorhabditis elegans, we discovered that HLH-30 (known as TFEB in mammals) is a key transcription factor for host defense. HLH-30 was activated shortly after Staphylococcus aureus infection, and drove the expression of close to 80% of the host response, including antimicrobial and autophagy genes that were essential for host tolerance of infection. TFEB was also rapidly activated in murine macrophages upon S. aureus infection and was required for proper transcriptional induction of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Thus, our data suggest that TFEB is a previously unappreciated, evolutionarily ancient transcription factor in the host response to infection.
TI  - Linezolid update: stable in vitro activity following more than a decade of clinical use and summary of associated resistance mechanisms.
AB  - Linezolid, approved for clinical use since 2000, has become an important addition to the anti-Gram-positive infection armamentarium. This oxazolidinone drug has in vitro and in vivo activity against essentially all Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). The in vitro activity of linezolid was well documented prior to its clinical application, and several ongoing surveillance studies demonstrated consistent and potent results during the subsequent years of clinical use. Emergence of resistance has been limited and associated with invasive procedures, deep organ involvement, presence of foreign material and mainly prolonged therapy. Non-susceptible organisms usually demonstrate alterations in the 23S rRNA target, which remain the main resistance mechanism observed in enterococci; although a few reports have described the detection of cfr-mediated resistance in Enterococcus faecalis. S. aureus isolates non-susceptible to linezolid remain rare in large surveillance studies. Most isolates harbour 23S rRNA mutations; however, cfr-carrying MRSA isolates have been observed in the United States and elsewhere. It is still uncertain whether the occurrences of such isolates are becoming more prevalent. Coagulase-negative isolates (CoNS) resistant to linezolid were uncommon following clinical approval. Surveillance data have indicated that CoNS isolates, mainly Staphylococcus epidermidis, currently account for the majority of Gram-positive organisms displaying elevated MIC results to linezolid. In addition, these isolates frequently demonstrate complex and numerous resistance mechanisms, such as alterations in the ribosomal proteins L3 and/or L4 and/or presence of cfr and/or modifications in 23S rRNA. The knowledge acquired during the past decades on this initially used oxazolidinone has been utilized for developing new candidate agents, such as tedizolid and radezolid, and as linezolid patents soon begin to expire, generic brands will certainly become available. These events will likely establish a new chapter for this successful class of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Multispecies biofilm in an artificial wound bed--A novel model for in vitro assessment of solid antimicrobial dressings.
AB  - Wound infections represent a major problem, particularly in patients with chronic wounds. Bacteria in the wound exist mainly in the form of biofilms and are thus resistant to most antibiotics and antimicrobials. A simple and cost-effective in vitro model of chronic wound biofilms applied for testing treatments and solid devices, especially wound dressings, is presented in this work. The method is based on the well-established Lubbock chronic wound biofilm transferred onto an artificial agar wound bed. The biofilm formed by four bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was stable for up to 48h post-transplant. The applicability of the model was evaluated by testing two common iodine wound treatments. These observations indicate that this method enables assessing the effects of treatments on established resilient wound biofilms and is clinically highly relevant.
TI  - Eco-designed biohybrids based on liposomes, mint-nanosilver and carbon nanotubes  for antioxidant and antimicrobial coating.
AB  - Noncovalent entities (consisting of liposomes, phyto-nanosilver and carbon nanotubes) with interesting properties were constructed by a "green" bottom-up method. Phytosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using the Mentha piperita extract combines the benefits of this herb with the interesting properties of silver. The obtained silver-based biohybrids showed antioxidant and antimicrobial properties that have been considerable improved in the presence of carbon nanotubes. Thus the eco-designed bioconstructs consisting of cholesterol-containing liposomes, phytonanosilver and carbon nanotubes exhibited high antioxidant activity (AA=90.8%) and have been shown to be strong biocides offering inhibition zone of 25mm against Escherichia coli and 23mm against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - In vitro and ex vivo antimicrobial efficacy of nano-MgO in the elimination of endodontic pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The use of metal oxide nanoparticles has attracted lots of attention, mostly because of their promising antimicrobial activity along with their biocompatibility with mammalian cells. This study aims to investigate the in vitro and ex vivo antimicrobial efficiency of nano-magnesium oxide (MgO) aqueous solution against endodontic pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cytotoxicity of different concentrations of nano-MgO was assessed using lactate dehydrogenase cytotoxicity assay (LDH assay). A comparison of the antimicrobial efficiency of several concentrations of nano-MgO solution, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), and chlorhexidine (CHX) gluconate against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans was made using the direct contact method. An ex vivo model of decoronated and experimentally infected human teeth was employed to compare the efficiency of nano-MgO (5 mg/L) solution with NaOCl (5.25 %) in the elimination of E. faecalis. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between nano-MgO solutions (10 and 5 mg/L), 5.25 % NaOCl, and 2 % CHX gluconate in terms of the required time to inhibit the growth of the tested pathogens (p > 0.05). The LDH assay showed no cytotoxicity of different concentrations of nano-MgO used in this study (p < 0.001). In the ex vivo model of infected human teeth, 6 h post-irrigation, there was no statistically significant difference between colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter of nano-MgO (5 mg/L) and NaOCl (5.25 %)-treated teeth (5-6 log scale reduction). However, the nano-MgO group showed a significant decrease in colony-forming units per milliliter (7 log scale), 24 h post-irrigation (p < 0.05). At other tested time points-24, 48, 72, and 168 h-the levels of CFU per milliliter were significantly less in the nano-MgO group (2-3 log scale difference) compared to the NaOCl group, indicating long-term antibacterial activity of nano-MgO (p < 0.05). At 72 and 168 h post-irrigation, no detectable bacterial growth was observed in the nano-MgO group. The detection limit was 10 CFU/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Nano-MgO aqueous solutions represent promising antimicrobial activities, both in vitro and ex vivo with minimal toxicity. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Compared to NaOCl (5.25 %), nano-MgO (5 mg/L) exhibits statistically significant long-term efficiency in the elimination of E. faecalis in the root canal system. After further investigations, nano-MgO could be considered as a new root canal irrigant.
TI  - Development of an immunochromatographic test with anti-LipL32-coupled gold nanoparticles for Leptospira detection.
AB  - Detection of antibody specific to Leptospira by various immunological techniques  has been used for leptospirosis diagnosis. However, the sensitivity of antibody detection during the first few days after infection is low. Molecular techniques are suggested to provide earlier diagnosis than antibody detection, but a rapid and easy to perform assay for Leptospira antigen detection would provide an additional useful tool for disease diagnosis. In this study, we coupled gold nanoparticles with antibody to LipL32, a protein commonly found in pathogenic Leptospira. This coupled gold reagent was used in the immunochromatographic strip for Leptospira detection. We demonstrated that the sensitivity of Leptospira detection by this strip was 10(3) ml(-1). There was no positive result detected when strips were tested with non-pathogenic Leptospira, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus group B, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis or Enterococcus faecium. These data suggest that gold nanoparticles coupled with antibody to LipL32 could be used for Leptospira detection by a rapid test based on an immunochromatographic technique.
TI  - [Clinical distribution and antimicrobial resistance analysis of 754 pathogenic bacteria in diabetic foot infection].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the microbiological profiles and antibiotic susceptibility  patterns of organisms isolated from diabetic foot ulcers so as to provide selection rationales of antibiotics. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on the microbiological profiles and antibiotic susceptibilities in 754 strains of pathogens isolated from 519 patients with diabetic foot ulcers at our hospital from January 2010 to August 2013. The inter-group data were compared by Chi-square test. RESULTS: There were 322 (62.0%) males and 197 (38.0%) females. Their mean age was (67.7 +/- 12.3) (30-93) years, duration of diabetes 10 (0-40) years, duration of lower-limb lesion 1.0 (0.0-72.0) months and HbA1c (9.09% +/- 2.28%). Among 444 (85.5%) cases, a total of 754 strains of pathogens were isolated. Gram-positive aerobes were the most frequently isolated (47.3%, 357 strains) and followed by gram-negative aerobes and fungus (40.3% vs 12.3%, 304 vs 93 strains respectively). With rising Wagner's grades, bacterial floras transformed from Gram-positive cocci to Gram-negative rods while fungus and composite infections increased. And 122 strains were of multi drug resistant organisms (MDRO). Among 357 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were dominating floras. Staphylococcus was highly resistant to penicillin G, erythromycin, and oxacillin while vancomycin and linezolid were the most effective agents against gram-positive bacteria. Among 304 strains of gram-negative bacteria, enterobacteria were the most prevalent, including 48 strains of Escherichia coli, 34 strains of Proteus mirabilis and 31 strains of Proteus vulgaris. And there were 29 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Enterobacteria were highly resistant to ampicillin, followed by bactrim and furadantin while meropenem, imipenem, piperacillin/sulbactam, sulperazone and cefepime were the most effective agents. The predominant fungus was Blastomyces albicans. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe diabetic foot ulcers, Gram-negative rods predominate while the prevalence of fungus and composite infections increases. Vancomycin and imipenem maintain highly antibacterial activity. It is essential to pay attention to pathogen survey and use antibiotics more rationally.
TI  - Protein content analysis and antimicrobial activity of the crude venom of Montivipera bornmuelleri; a viper from Lebanon.
AB  - Viperidae snakes venoms represent a source of efficient bioactive components that have already led to the development of several new drugs. In this work, we analyzed the protein content of the Montivipera bornmuelleri crude venom using LC-ESI-MS, sephadex G-75 gel filtration and SDS-PAGE and demonstrated the presence of proteins with molecular masses corresponding to metalloprotease III, serine-protease and PLA2 in three fractions collected after gel filtration. Equally, we examined the antimicrobial effect of the venom that showed an important potency, as bactericidal agent, based on MBC and MIC values obtained, against Staphylococcus aureus and Morganella morganii bacteria. However, no activity was registered against Enterococcus faecalis, being the most resistant bacteria, neither against Aspergillus flavus and Penicillium digitatum fungal. Furthermore, on eleven other bacterial strains and the Candida albicans fungus, the venom has shown an intermediate efficacy by slightly reducing the growth. Our data concerning the Montivipera bornmuelleri venom give evidence of a rich and complex content aiding the exploration of new bioactive molecules for biopharmaceuticals purposes.
TI  - New rhenium complexes with ciprofloxacin as useful models for understanding the properties of [99mTc]-ciprofloxacin radiopharmaceutical.
AB  - Rhenium complexes with the antibiotic ciprofloxacin have been prepared to be studied as models of technetium radiopharmaceuticals. With this aim, the new rhenium complexes 1 {[ReO(Cpf)2]Cl}, 2 {[ReO(CpfH)2]Cl3} and 3 {fac-[Re(CO)3(H2O)(Cpf)]} with ciprofloxacin (CpfH=ciprofloxacin; Cpf=conjugated base of ciprofloxacin) have been synthesised and characterised by elemental analyses, IR, NMR ((1)H, (19)F and (13)C CP-MAS) spectroscopy, as well as MS measurements. All spectroscopic data are consistent with the coordination of ciprofloxacin in all these complexes through the carbonyl and the carboxylate oxygen atoms with the formation of a six member chelate ring. The study of a Tc-ciprofloxacin solution by ESI-MS reveals the presence of [TcO(Cpf)2](+) cations, which agrees with the hypothesis that complexes 1 and 2 can be seen as model rhenium complexes of this radiopharmaceutical. Antimicrobial and DNA gyrase inhibition studies performed with complexes 2 and 3 have shown a very similar behaviour between complex 2 and the free antibiotic, whereas complex 3 exhibit a lower antimicrobial activity. Based on a joint analysis of the data reported in the literature and the chemical and biological results obtained in this study, a tentative proposal to explain some aspects of the behaviour of Tc-ciprofloxacin radiopharmaceutical has been made.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of THAM Trisphenylguanide against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - This study investigated the potential antibacterial activity of three series of compounds synthesized from 12 linear and branched polyamines with 2-8 amino groups, which were substituted to produce the corresponding guanides, biguanides, or phenylguanides, against Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Antibacterial activity was measured for each compound by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration against the bacteria, and the toxicity towards mammalian cells was determined. The most effective compound, THAM trisphenylguanide, was studied in time-to-kill and cytoplasmic leakage assays against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, USA300) in comparison to chlorhexidine. Preliminary toxicity and MRSA challenge studies in mice were also conducted on this compound. THAM trisphenylguanide showed significant antibacterial activity (MIC approximately 1 mg/L) and selectivity against MRSA relative to all the other bacteria examined. In time-to-kill assays it showed increased antimicrobial activity against MRSA versus chlorhexidine. It induced leakage of cytoplasmic content at concentrations that did not reduce cell viability, suggesting the mechanism of action may involve membrane disruption. Using an intraperitoneal mouse model of invasive MRSA disease, THAM trisphenylguanide reduced bacterial burden locally and in deeper tissues. This study has identified a novel guanide compound with selective microbicidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus, including a methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strain.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization, antimicrobial activity and carbonic anhydrase enzyme inhibitor effects of salicilaldehyde-N-methyl p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone and its Palladium(II), Cobalt(II) complexes.
AB  - We report the synthesis of the ligand, salicilaldehyde-N-methyl p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone (salptsmh) derived from p-toluenesulfonicacid-1-methylhydrazide (ptsmh) and its Pd(II) and Co(II) metal complexes were synthesized for the first time. The structure of the ligand and their complexes were investigated using elemental analysis, magnetic susceptibility, molar conductance and spectral (IR, NMR and LC-MS) measurements. Salptsmh has also been characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. (1)H and (13)C shielding tensors for crystal structure were calculated with GIAO/DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) methods in CDCl3. The complexes were found to have general composition [ML2]. The results of elemental analysis showed 1:2 (metal/ligand) stoichiometry for all the complex. Magnetic and spectral data indicate a square planar geometry for Pd(II) complex and a distorted tetrahedral geometry for Co(II) complexes. The ligand and its metal chelates have been screened for their antimicrobial activities using the disk diffusion method against the selected Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Gram negative bacteria: Eschericha coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia. The inhibition activities of these compounds on carbonic anhydrase II (CA II) and carbonic anhydrase I (CA I) have been investigated by comparing IC50 and Ki values and it has been found that Pd(II) complex have more enzyme inhibition efficiency than salptsmh and Co(II) complex.
TI  - Iliopsoas abscess in children: report on five patients with a literature review.
AB  - We aimed in this study to present the clinical findings in children with iliopsoas abscess (IPA) and to discuss the diagnosis and treatment. The files of five patients, hospitalized between August 2011 and June 2013 and monitored with a diagnosis of IPA, were reviewed retrospectively. Demographic characteristics, symptoms and signs, laboratory examinations, and diagnostic and treatment methods of the cases were evaluated. Two of the cases were females and three were males, and their ages ranged from 10 to 15 years. Before the diagnosis, the duration of symptoms in patients ranged from five days to one year. The primary symptoms included fever and difficulty in walking. One patient presented with septic shock and had a history of trauma as a predisposing factor. All patients except one had a higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) value. Psoas abscess was demonstrated by ultrasonography (USG), except in one patient. Four patients underwent percutaneous drainage of the abscess. The isolated microorganisms included Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Enterococcus faecalis. All the cases recovered without sequelae. Diagnosis of IPA in children is difficult, and many physicians are usually consulted before any diagnosis is made. IPA should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with complaints of lower back, hip, groin and leg pain and difficulty in walking.
TI  - Isolation and biological activity of compounds from Garcinia preussii.
AB  - CONTEXT: Plants of the genus Garcinia (Clusiaceae) are traditionally used to relieve stomachaches, toothaches, and as a chew stick. OBJECTIVE: In order to determine which compounds were responsible for these activities, a phytochemical investigation of the fruits and leaves of Garcinia preussii Engl. was pursued. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plants were extracted by solvents of various polarities. Compounds isolation was then carried out using chromatography methods (medium- and high-pressure liquid chromatography, open column and thin-layer chromatography). The isolated compounds were identified and characterized by using 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopies. The antioxidant activity was evaluated using DPPH(*), ABTS(*-), ALP, and ORAC assays. The antimicrobial activity was assayed against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value. The cytotoxic activity of most of the isolated compounds was evaluated on a small panel of human cancer cell lines (DU145, HeLa, HT-29, and A431) using the XTT method. RESULTS: The phytochemical investigation of G. preussii led to the isolation of eight known compounds, six benzophenones and two flavonoids. These compounds were tested for their biological activities. 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8 demonstrated a high free radical scavenging activity with ER50 ranging from 0.1 to 0.7. The antimicrobial activity was shown only against Gram-positive bacteria for 1, 4, and 5. A moderate cytotoxic activity with IC50 ranging from 7 to 50 microM was observed, except for 6 which was not active. CONCLUSION: These results appear to support some of the properties reported for Garcinia species.
TI  - Paenibacterin, a novel broad-spectrum lipopeptide antibiotic, neutralises endotoxins and promotes survival in a murine model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced sepsis.
AB  - Paenibacterin, produced by Paenibacillus thiaminolyticus OSY-SE, is active both against Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Paenibacterin showed relatively low cytotoxicity against a human kidney cell line (ATCC CRL-2190), with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50)>/=109mug/mL. The cationic paenibacterin molecule binds to the negatively charged Gram-negative endotoxins in vitro, suggesting that paenibacterin can neutralise lipopolysaccharides. In a murine septic shock model, two 500mug doses of paenibacterin significantly increased the survival of mice challenged with a lethal level of P. aeruginosa. Considering that paenibacterin is effective against many strains of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, this study suggests that this antimicrobial agent is a promising candidate as a new drug.
TI  - Colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip test compromising optimised combinations of anti-S. suis capsular polysaccharide polyclonal antibodies for detection of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - A rapid diagnosis kit that detects Streptococcus suis (S. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ICS) test was developed in this study. The ICS test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against S. suis. The pAbs were developed from rabbits immunised with S. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (CPS). Development of the pAbs was investigated to establish their binding to CPS and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ICS test. The results of the ICS optimisation revealed that the combinations of pAb C-N1 and pAb C-N2 had the highest sensitivity to CPS. The minimum limitation of ICS sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (CFU) and a CPS concentration of 0.05 microg. The assay time for detection of S. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. A cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae). The cross-reactivity of other serotypes in S. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. This study presents the first report of a development of an ICS that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. The S. suis ICS provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.
TI  - Occurrence of urinary tract infection in adolescent and adult women of shanty town in Dhaka City, Bangladesh.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is commonly experienced by women of various age groups especially elderly ones. We planned to find out the prevalent microbial strains causing UTI in slum inhabitant adolescent and adult women in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Urine sample was collected from 462 UTI suspected female subjects. Pathogenic bacteria were identified using standard microbiological tests, and antimicrobial sensitivity profiles of the pathogens were determined. RESULTS: Bacteriuria was present in 9% of the subjects. A higher incidence (16.8%) of UTI was noted among adult women aged above 19 years. Escherichia coli (69%), Streptococcus spp. (15%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%) were more frequently isolated from the urine samples compared to Enterococcus faecalis (3%), Staphylococcus aureus (2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2%) and Hafnia alvei (2%). The E. coli isolates showed complete resistance to commonly used drugs, and 58% of these isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR). Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values for ciprofloxacin ranged between 64microg/ml and 512microg/ml, and the Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) values against the isolates were 128microg/ml or above. Isolated strains of E. coli exhibited equal extent of ciprofloxacin resistance irrespective of the presence or absence of plasmid in them. CONCLUSION: The extent of drug resistance among the uropathogens if ignored may render them uncontrollable. This study suggests regular monitoring of drug resistance phenotype of the UTI pathogens to reduce the morbidity of female UTI patients and offer better treatment strategy in the healthcare sectors of Bangladesh.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of antimicrobial features of vasopressors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drugs administered as intravenous infusion may be contaminated during several stages of production or preparation. However studies focusing on antibacterial effects of vasopressor drugs are very rare. This study investigates the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the clinically used forms of vasopressors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro antimicrobial activities of vasopressor drugs of different concentrations were investigated by using the micro dilution technique. Microorganisms used in the test were Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis ATCC 911, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145, Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 43251, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus 702 Roma, Mycobacterium smegmatis ATCC607, Candida albicans ATCC 60193, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae RSKK 251. Antibacterial assays were performed in Mueller-Hinton broth at pH 7.3 and antifungal assays were performed in buffered Yeast Nitrogen Base at pH 7.0. RESULTS: Two different dopamine preparations showed antimicrobial activity. No other study drug showed any antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSIONS: In our opinion, dopamine's antibacterial effects may be advantageous for inhibiting the spread of bacterial contamination during the preparation of the infusion solutions. However, it is important that strict guidelines regarding the need for sterile equipment and deliverables be adhered to during all procedures performed in the intensive care units.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of kaolinite/nanoTiO2 composites in relation to irradiation time.
AB  - The paper addresses laboratory preparation and antibacterial activity testing of  kaolinite/nanoTiO2 composite in respect of the daylight irradiation time. Kaolinite/nanoTiO2 composites with 20 and 40 wt% of TiO2 were laboratory prepared, dried at 105 degrees C and calcined at 600 degrees C. The calcination caused transformation of kaolinite to metakaolinite and origination of the metakaolinite/nanoTiO2 composite. X-ray powder diffraction, Raman and FTIR spectroscopic methods revealed titanium dioxide only in the form of anatase in all evaluated samples (non-calcined and calcined) and also transformation of kaolinite to metakaolinite after the calcination treatment. Scanning electron microscopy was used as a method for characterization of morphology and elemental composition of the studied samples. A standard microdilution test was used to determine the antibacterial activity using four human pathogenic bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). A lamp with a wide spectrum bulb simulating daylight was used for induction of photocatalysis. The antibacterial assays found all the KATI samples to have antibacterial potency with different onset of the activity when calcined samples exhibited antibacterial activity earlier than the non-calcined. Significant difference in antibacterial activity of KATI samples for different bacterial strains was not observed.
TI  - [Specific features of materials for initial pulpitis treatment].
AB  - The aim of the current study was to assess antibacterial and cytotoxic properties of Biodentine (Septodont), Rootdent (TehnoDent) and adhesive Futurabond capital EN, Cyrilliccapital ER, Cyrillic (Voco). Two lines of experiments were carried out using cements water solutions and firm tablet-like samples (made by means of special pattern). Citotoxic activity was tested on NCTC L929 mice line fibroblasts culture. All the examined materials showed antibacterial activity against E. coli, S. aureus, C. albismall es, Cyrillicans, St. faecalis, mostly evident in Futurabond and the poorest in Biodentine samples. As for cytotoxic properties, Biodentine proved not to suppress metabolic activity stimulating odontotropic impact. The results confirm the analyzed materials to be a useful tool for deep caries lesions and initial pulpitis treatment.
TI  - Ceftobiprole activity against over 60,000 clinical bacterial pathogens isolated in Europe, Turkey, and Israel from 2005 to 2010.
AB  - Ceftobiprole medocaril is a newly approved drug in Europe for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) (excluding patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia but including ventilated HAP patients) and community-acquired pneumonia in adults. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole against prevalent Gram-positive and -negative pathogens isolated in Europe, Turkey, and Israel during 2005 through 2010. A total of 60,084 consecutive, nonduplicate isolates from a wide variety of infections were collected from 33 medical centers. Species identification was confirmed, and all isolates were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. Ceftobiprole had high activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (100.0% susceptible), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (99.3% susceptible), with MIC90 values of 0.25, 0.12, </= 0.06, and 0.5 mug/ml, respectively. Ceftobiprole was active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (98.3% susceptible) and methicillin-resistant CoNS, having a MIC90 of 2 mug/ml. Ceftobiprole was active against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC50/90, 0.5/4 mug/ml) but not against most Enterococcus faecium isolates. Ceftobiprole was very potent against the majority of Enterobacteriaceae (87.3% susceptible), with >80% inhibited at </= 0.12 mug/ml. The potency of ceftobiprole against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC50/90, 2/>8 mug/ml; 64.6% at MIC values of </= 4 mug/ml) was similar to that of ceftazidime (MIC50/90, 2/>16 mug/ml; 75.4% susceptible), but limited activity was observed against Acinetobacter spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. High activity was also observed against all Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, </= 0.06 mug/ml) and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC50/90, </= 0.06/0.25 mug/ml) isolates. Ceftobiprole demonstrated a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against this very large longitudinal sample of contemporary pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities of PR-39 derived peptides.
AB  - The porcine cathelicidin PR-39 is a host defence peptide that plays a pivotal role in the innate immune defence of the pig against infections. Besides direct antimicrobial activity, it is involved in immunomodulation, wound healing and several other biological processes. In this study, the antimicrobial- and immunomodulatory activity of PR-39, and N- and C-terminal derivatives of PR-39 were tested. PR-39 exhibited an unexpected broad antimicrobial spectrum including several Gram positive strains such as Bacillus globigii and Enterococcus faecalis. Of organisms tested, only Staphylococcus aureus was insensitive to PR-39. Truncation of PR-39 down to 15 (N-terminal) amino acids did not lead to major loss of activity, while peptides corresponding to the C-terminal part of PR-39 were hampered in their antimicrobial activity. However, shorter peptides were all much more sensitive to inhibition by salt. Active peptides induced ATP leakage and loss of membrane potential in Bacillus globigii and Escherichia coli, indicating a lytic mechanism of action for these peptides. Finally, only the mature peptide was able to induce IL-8 production in porcine macrophages, but some shorter peptides also had an effect on TNF-alpha production showing differential regulation of cytokine induction by PR-39 derived peptides. None of the active peptides showed high cytotoxicity highlighting the potential of these peptides for use as an alternative to antibiotics.
TI  - Amikacin-fosfomycin at a five-to-two ratio: characterization of mutation rates in microbial strains causing ventilator-associated pneumonia and interactions with commonly used antibiotics.
AB  - The amikacin-fosfomycin inhalation system (AFIS), a combination of antibiotics administered with an in-line nebulizer delivery system, is being developed for adjunctive treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The in vitro characterization of amikacin-fosfomycin (at a 5:2 ratio) described here included determining resistance selection rates for pathogens that are representative of those commonly associated with VAP (including multidrug-resistant strains) and evaluating interactions with antibiotics commonly used intravenously to treat VAP. Spontaneous resistance to amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) was not observed for most strains tested (n, 10/14). Four strains had spontaneously resistant colonies (frequencies, 4.25 x 10(-8) to 3.47 x 10(-10)), for which amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) MICs were 2- to 8-fold higher than those for the original strains. After 7 days of serial passage, resistance (>4-fold increase over the baseline MIC) occurred in fewer strains (n, 4/14) passaged in the presence of amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) than with either amikacin (n, 7/14) or fosfomycin (n, 12/14) alone. Interactions between amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) and 10 comparator antibiotics in checkerboard testing against 30 different Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacterial strains were synergistic (fractional inhibitory concentration [FIC] index, </= 0.5) for 6.7% (n, 10/150) of combinations tested. No antagonism was observed. Synergy was confirmed by time-kill methodology for amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) plus cefepime (against Escherichia coli), aztreonam (against Pseudomonas aeruginosa), daptomycin (against Enterococcus faecalis), and azithromycin (against Staphylococcus aureus). Amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) was bactericidal at 4-fold the MIC for 7 strains tested. The reduced incidence of development of resistance to amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) compared with that for amikacin or fosfomycin alone, and the lack of negative interactions with commonly used intravenous antibiotics, further supports the development of AFIS for the treatment of VAP.
TI  - Exploring 5-nitrofuran derivatives against nosocomial pathogens: synthesis, antimicrobial activity and chemometric analysis.
AB  - The burden of nosocomial or health care-associated infection (HCAI) is increasing worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it is several fold higher in low- and middle-income countries. Considering the multidrug-resistant infections, the development of new and more effective drugs is crucial. Herein, two series (I and II) of 5-nitrofuran derivatives were designed, synthesized and assayed against microorganisms, including Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, and fungi. The pathogens screened was directly related to either the most currently relevant HCAI, or to multidrug-resistant infection caused by MRSA/VRSA strains, for instance. The sets I and II were composed by substituted-[N'-(5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene]benzhydrazide and 3-acetyl-5-(substituted-phenyl)-2-(5-nitro-furan-2-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1,3,4-oxadiazo le compounds, respectively. The selection of the substituent groups was based upon physicochemical properties, such as hydrophobicity and electronic effect. The compounds have showed better activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis. The findings from S. aureus strain, which was more susceptible, were used to investigate the intersamples and intervariables relationships by applying chemometric methods. It is noteworthy that the compound 4-butyl-[N'-(5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene]benzhydrazide has showed similar MIC value to vancomycin, which is the reference drug for multidrug-resistant S. aureus infections. Taken the findings together, the 5-nitrofuran derivatives might be indeed considered as promising hits to develop novel antimicrobial drugs to fight against nosocomial infection.
TI  - In vitro efficacy of antibiotic beads in treating abdominal vascular graft infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Abdominal aortic vascular graft infection often involves several different organisms. Antibiotic polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) beads may be effective in controlling infection after debridement, but bacterial species identification and antibiotic susceptibility are often not available at the time of operation, generating a need for a broad-spectrum drug combination for empirical use. We sought to determine an effective antibiotic in PMMA beads for use in abdominal vascular graft infection. METHODS: PMMA beads were impregnated with combinations of antibiotics, consisting of daptomycin, tobramycin, and meropenem. Antibiotics were selected on the basis of activity spectrum and heat stability. Beads were placed on separate agar plates with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Antibiotic inhibition was recorded by use of a modified agar-based disk-diffusion method. RESULTS: Daptomycin alone was not active against K. pneumoniae (average = 0 mm). Tobramycin alone was not active against vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, K. pneumoniae, or methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Tobramycin and daptomycin in combination had moderate broad-spectrum activity with 8- to 14-mm mean inhibition halos. Meropenem showed strong activity against all tested organisms with >15-mm mean inhibition halos. The addition of daptomycin to meropenem provided improved coverage of gram-positive organisms. The presence of tobramycin reduced the efficacy of meropenem. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic PMMA beads containing 10% meropenem with 2.5% daptomycin had excellent in vitro activity against typical bacterial species associated with abdominal vascular graft infections. The addition of antibiotic beads may be a useful adjunct in managing such cases. Further studies are required to determine efficacy in clinical practice.
TI  - Infective endocarditis in New Zealand: data from the International Collaboration  on Endocarditis Prospective Cohort Study.
AB  - AIMS: The International Collaboration on Endocarditis Prospective Cohort Study (ICE-PCS) collected worldwide data on the presentation, management and outcome of infective endocarditis (IE). We present data from patients with endocarditis enrolled from New Zealand. METHODS: Patients who fulfilled the Duke criteria for definite or probable endocarditis were enrolled from five district health boards: Auckland, Counties Manukau, Waitemata, Capital and Coast, and Canterbury, between June 2000 and September 2005. RESULTS: There were 336 New Zealand patients enrolled in the ICE-PCS. Prosthetic valve endocarditis occurred in 31%. Underlying medical conditions were present in 28% of patients, but only 4% of patients had rheumatic heart disease. Forty patients (12%) had healthcare-associated endocarditis. Viridans streptococci were the most common cause of IE (32%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (24%). Patients with S. aureus IE were more likely to present within a week of symptom onset than those with viridans streptococcus IE (OR 4.18, 95% CI 2.36-7.42). Surgery was performed in 33% of patients. In total, 20 patients (6%) died in hospital. Those with endocarditis caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci had an increased risk of death compared with those viridans streptococcus endocarditis (RR 4.7, 95% CI 1.2-17). The risk of stroke was higher in those with endocarditis caused by S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (RR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-6.05, and 4.9, 95% CI 1.9-13, respectively). CONCLUSION: While viridans streptococci remain the predominant causative organisms of IE in New Zealand, many 'traditional' clinical and management aspects of this disease no longer apply. This paper provides a reference for local practitioners assessing and managing IE.
TI  - Hospital acquired infections among patients admitted in the medical and surgical  wards of a non-teaching secondary care hospital in northern India.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of Nosocomial Infection (NI) and type of  bacteriological isolates among the patients admitted in the medical and surgical wards of a non-teaching secondary care hospital in north India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional hospital based study conducted in the Wards of General Medicine, General Surgery and Orthopaedic of the hospital. The patient were admitted in the department for various surgical procedures, without evidence of initial infection, were included in the study. RESULTS: A total of 176 patients were included in the study of which 82 were from Medical and 94 from Surgical ward. Overall incidence of NI was found to be 26.1% (Medical ward=28%, Surgical ward=24.5%., p=0.58). The isolation rate of Acinetobacter baumanii was (p=0.15) higher among the patients of medical ward (95.7%) than surgical ward (82.6). Escherichia coli was isolated in 89.1% and no significant difference was observed between medical and surgical wards. Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated in 50% patients and was almost similar (p=0.37) in medical surgical wards. The isolation rate of Pseudomonos aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Coagulase negative staphylococci were 43.5%, 73.9%, 34.8% and 17.4% respectively. A significant difference was observed in the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis (p=0.007) and Coagulase negative staphylococci (p=0.002) between medical and surgical wards. Overall, among the patients who developed NI, 27.2% patient's bacterial isolates were Gram positive (Surgical=64.1, Medical=80%). CONCLUSION: The incidence of NI is increasing in the hospitals, so extensive that more care has to be taken in cleaning the wards of the hospitals.
TI  - High inhibition of Paenibacillus larvae and Listeria monocytogenes by Enterococcus isolated from different sources in Tunisia and identification of their bacteriocin genes.
AB  - A total of 300 isolates of Enterococcus, from different sources including faeces  of poultry, cow and sheep, raw milk, ricotta cheese and water, in Tunisia, were screened for their antibacterial activity. Amongst them, 59 bacteriocin-producing strains were detected and identified by molecular methods. Genes encoding for entA, entP, entB, entL50A/B, AS-48 and bac31 bacteriocins were targeted by PCR. The bacteriocin-producing strains were assigned to the species Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus mundtii and Enterococcus durans, respectively, 34, 19, 3, 2 and 1 isolates. Antimicrobial activity was specifically observed against different spoilage and pathogenic micro-organisms, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua, Listeria ivanovii, Escherichia coli, Ent. faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis and Paenibacillus larvae. The inhibitory activity was totally lost after proteinase K treatment, thereby revealing the proteinaceous nature of the antimicrobial compound. Only three bacteriocin genes, namely entP, entA and entL50A/B were detected in the isolates included in this study. Enterocins A and P were the most frequent genes and they were found in 55 (93.2%) and 39 isolates (66.1%), respectively, followed by enterocin L50A/B present in 27 isolates (45.7%). These newly identified bacteriocin-producing enterococci have the potential to be used in bio-preservation of food as well as biological control of foulbrood disease. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Enterococci possess interesting properties not only for the food industry, but also for animal and human health. The antimicrobial potential of these bacteria includes principally bacteriocin-like molecules. With the aim of identifying bacteriocinogenic strains, a collection of 300 enterococci isolated from different origins were screened and their spectrum of action, as well as the gene encoding the bacteriocin, was determined. Fifty-nine bacteriocin-producing Enterococcus showed high activity against Listeria monocytogenes and Paenibacillus larvae, the causative agent of American foulbrood. Enterocins A, P and L50A/B were found in various combinations. The most important finding of this study is the growth inhibition of P. larvae due to bacteriocin-producing Enterococcus, which opens up the possibility to use these strains to control the disease in honeybees.
TI  - Composition and biological activities of hogweed [Heracleum sphondylium L. subsp. ternatum (Velen.) Brummitt] essential oil and its main components octyl acetate and octyl butyrate.
AB  - The essential oil obtained from the fruits of hogweed (Heracleum sphondylium subsp. ternatum) growing in central Apennines (Italy) was analysed for chemical composition by gas chromatographic-flame ionisation detector (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The oil was composed mainly of aliphatic esters (86.9-89.5%), among them octyl acetate (54.9-60.2%) and octyl butyrate (10.1-13.4%) were the most abundant. The oil and its two major esters, octyl acetate and octyl butyrate, were tested for in vitro biological activity, namely antibacterial, antioxidant and cytotoxic, by microdilution, DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl), ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid)) and MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assays. Worthy of mention was only the cytotoxic activity of the oil against two tumour cell lines, i.e. A375 (human malignant melanoma) and HCT116 (human colon carcinoma) cells, with IC50 values of 48.69 and 95.83 mug/mL, respectively; the major compound responsible for this effect was octyl butyrate which displayed IC50 values of 20.19 mug/mL (100.8 muM) and 55.35 mug/mL (276.3 muM) on the same cells, respectively.
TI  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium active dimeric isobutyrylphloroglucinol from Ivesia gordonii.
AB  - Bioassay-guided fractionation of the chloroform soluble fraction of stem, leaf, and flower extracts of the American plant Ivesia gordonii led to the isolation of a new dimeric acylphloroglucinol, 3,3'-diisobutyryl-2,6'-dimethoxy-4,6,2',4'-tetrahydroxy-5,5'dimethyldiphenyl methane (1), to which we have assigned the trivial name ofivesinol (1), together with a known monomeric acylphloroglucinol, 1,5-dihydroxy-2-(2'-methylpropionyl)-3-methoxy-6-methylbenzene (2). The structures of the isolated compounds were characterized using 1D- and 2D- NMR spectroscopy, including COSY, HMQC, HMBC, and ROESYexperiments, as well as mass spectrometry. Ivesinol (1) showed potent activity against Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) with IC50/MIC/MBC values of 0.10/1.25/>20 microg/mL and 0.05/0.31/>20 microg/mL, respectively (vs. IC50/MIC/MBC 0.13/0.5/1.0 microg/mL and 0.13/0.5/1.0 microg/mL of ciprofloxacin), while the corresponding monomer 2 was found to be less active. Compound 1 also demonstrated strong activity against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) with IC50/MlC/MBC values of 0.22/1.25/>20 microg/mL, whereas the reference standard ciprofloxacin was found to be inactive against this strain. In addition, compound 2 showed moderate activity against two species of Candida and Cryptococcus neoformans, while 1 was inactive against these fungi. In order to evaluate the influence of the acyl group(s) in phloroglucinol (3) as a ligand, the mono- (4) and diacetylphloroglucinol (5) were prepared from 3, and evaluated for their in vitro SA, MRSA, and VRE activities; 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (5) showed potent activity, like 1, against SA, MRSA, and VRE (ATCC 700221) with IC50/MIC values of 0.3/2.5, 0.23/2.5, and 0.86/2.5 microg/mL, respectively, while 4 was inactive.
TI  - Influence of in vitro gastrointestinal digestion of fruit juices enriched with pine bark extract on intestinal microflora.
AB  - The selective antimicrobial effect of fruit juices enriched with pine bark extract (PBE) (0.5 g/L) has been studied before and after in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. PBE (a concentrate of water-soluble bioflavonoids, mainly including phenolic compounds) has been proven to have high stability to the digestion process. Pure phenolic compounds such as gallic acid had a high antimicrobial effect on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, maintaining the lactic acid bacteria population ( approximately 100%). Otherwise, E. coli O157:H7 only growth 50% when PBE was added to the culture media, while a slight increase on the growth of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria was observed after exposition to the bark extract. Fresh fruit juices enriched with PBE showed the highest inhibitory effect on pathogenic intestinal bacterial growth, mainly E. coli and Enterococcus faecalis. The in vitro digestion process reduced the antibacterial effect of juices against most pathogenic bacteria in approximately 10%. However, the beneficial effect of fruit juices enriched with PBE (0.5 g/L) on gut microbiota is still considerable after digestion.
TI  - Application of nanometal oxides in situ in nonwoven polyester fabric for the removal of bacterial indicators of pollution from wastewater.
AB  - The objective of this study is to investigate and assess the use of in situ deposit nanosilver (nAg2O) or nanocopper oxides (nCuO) into nonwoven polyester fabric (NWPF) as a safe and effective antibacterial filter of pollution from domestic wastewater. The bactericidal effect of both nAg2O and nCuO was examined against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi) and Gram-positive bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus) using agar diffusion disk method. In addition, the capability of nAg2O and nCuO as disinfectants for secondary treated domestic wastewater was investigated as a case study. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) confirmed the formation of nAg2O and nCuO particles with average particle sizes of 15 and 41 nm, respectively. Disk diffusion results showed that nAg2O had a higher bactericidal effect than nCuO. Moreover, the disinfection of secondary treated wastewater using 1.27 mg/cm(3) of nAg2O in the nonwoven fabric was capable of hindering 99.6% and 91.7% of total and fecal coliforms within 10 minutes with a residual value of 18 and 15 MPN-index/100 mL, respectively. The residual total and fecal coliform concentrations were far less than that stated in the national and international limits for wastewater reuse in agriculture purpose.
TI  - Graphene oxide as an anaerobic membrane scaffold for the enhancement of B. adolescentis proliferation and antagonistic effects against pathogens E. coli and S. aureus.
AB  - The impact of the gut microbiota on human health is widely perceived as the most  exciting advancement in biomedicine. The gut microbiota has been known to play a crucial role in defining states of human health and diseases, and thus becomes a potential new territory for drug targeting. Herein, graphene oxide (GO) interaction with five common human gut bacteria, B. adolescentis, L. acidophilus, E. coli, E. faecalis, and S. aureus, was studied. It was shown that, in bacterial media, GO sheets were able to form effective, anaerobic membrane scaffolds that enhanced the antagonistic activity of B. adolescentis against the pathogens E. coli andS. aureus. Data obtained using bacterial growth measurements, colony counting and 16S rRNA gene sequencing consistently indicated that GO sheets promoted proliferation of gut bacteria, particularly for B. adolescentis. Scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy images, and membrane potential measurements showed that cell membranes maintained their integrity and that no observable variations in cell morphology were induced after interaction with GO sheets, indicating good biocompatibility of GO. These results suggest the possibility of using GO sheets as efficient drug carriers in therapeutic applications to treat diseases related to the gut microbiota.
TI  - Quorum sensing in gram-positive bacteria: assay protocols for staphylococcal agr  and enterococcal fsr systems.
AB  - A thiolactone/lactone peptide-mediated quorum sensing (QS) system is commonly employed in gram-positive bacteria to control the expression of a variety of phenotypes, including the production of virulence factors and biofilm formation. Here, we describe assay protocols for the well-studied QS systems (agr and fsr) of two representative gram-positive pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. These convenient assay systems are useful for the screening of QS inhibitors as well as for basic research to address the mechanism of these QS systems.
TI  - Toxicity of magnetic chitosan micro and nanoparticles as carriers for biologically active substances.
AB  - Nanoparticles of inorganic magnetic core surrounded by layers of functional coatings are potential representatives of nanostructures for immobilization of bio-substances. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are often bound in aggregates due to a strong magnetic dipole, which has a lot of advantages, such as large surface area for binding biologically active substances. Chitosan is a polysaccharide polymer that is non-toxic, hydrophilic, biocompatible and has hydroxy and amino groups in its structure. Because of these chemical and biological properties it is a desirable bio-product for immobilization of enzymes and for binding of other biologically active substances. Magnetic micro and nanoparticles were synthesized with chitosan by three different methods; microemulsion process, suspension cross-linking technique and covalent binding of chitosan. Toxic effect of the prepared magnetic particles was determined as well and was examined on five different bacterial cultures; Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. At concentrations of 10-30 mg of magnetic particles per 0.5 McFarland Standard solution of E. coli and per 400 CFU of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis in K. pneumonia, no inhibition on the chosen bacterial cultures was detected.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of water-soluble gold(I) N-heterocyclic carbene complexes.
AB  - The antibacterial properties of water-soluble gold(I) complexes [1-methyl-3-(3-sulfonatopropyl)imidazol-2-ylidene]gold(I) chloride (C1), [1-mesityl-3-(3-sulfonatopropyl)imidazol-2-ylidene]gold(I) chloride (C2), [1-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-3-(3-sulfonatopropyl)imidazol-2-ylidene]gold(I) chloride (C3) and [1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropyl-4-sodiumsulfonatophenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene]gold(I) chloride (C4) and the respective ligands were assessed by agar diffusion and broth macrodilution methods against Gram-positives Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Micrococcus luteus and the Gram-negative bacteria Yersinia ruckeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Viability after treatments was determined by direct plate count. The bactericidal activity displayed by C1 and C3 was comparable to that of AgNO3.
TI  - Synergistic antibacterial effect of honey and Herba Ocimi Basilici against some bacterial pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antibacterial activity of the combination of different honey brands and methanolic fraction of Herba Ocimi Basilici using agar well diffusion assay. METHODS: The antibacterial activity was determined against thirteen pathogenic bacterial clinical isolates including six gram negative (Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimirium, Xanthomonas campestris) and six gram positive strains (Enterococcus faecalis faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens type C, Clostridium perfringens type D, Clostridium chauvoei). Agar well diffusion method was used while zones of inhibition were measured with vernier scale. RESULTS: At higher concentration, all the honey brands showed good to significant activity. The highest activity was observed for Hamdard brand honey (27.60 +/- 0.40) against Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSION: These results revealed that combinations of plant extracts of Herba Ocimi Basilici with honey can be used for the development of potent and novel antibacterial agents.
TI  - Aureobasidium pullulans as a source of liamocins (heavy oils) with anticancer activity.
AB  - Liamocins are structurally unique, heavier-than-water "oils" produced by certain  strains of Aureobasidium pullulans. The aim of the current study is to identify new sources of liamocins and evaluate their potential as anticancer agents. Nine strains of A. pullulans from phylogenetic clades 8, 9, and 11 were examined for the first time for production of liamocins. Strains in these clades have only been isolated from tropical environments, and all strains tested here were from various locations in Thailand. Strains RSU 9, RSU 21, and RSU 29, all from clade 11, produced from 7.0 to 8.6 g liamocins/l from medium containing 5 % sucrose. These are the highest yields of liamocins that we have found thus far. These strains also produced from 9.4 to 17 g pullulan/l. The structural identity of liamocins was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry; differential spectra were obtained in which the dominant ion was either at about m/z 805.5 or m/z 949.6, consistent with the structure of liamocins. Liamocins from A. pullulans strains RSU 9 and RSU 21 inhibited two human breast cancer cell lines and a human cervical cancer cell line (IC50 values of 32.2 +/- 1.4 to 63.1 +/- 2.4 mug liamocins/ml) but were not toxic to a normal cell line. Liamocins weakly inhibited a strain of Enterococcus faecalis, but did not inhibit strains of Lactobacillus fermentum, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus, A. pullulans phylogenetic clade 11 is a promising source of liamocins, and these compounds merit further examination as potential anticancer agents.
TI  - [In vitro activity of sitafloxacin against clinical isolates in 2012].
AB  - In vitro activity of sitafloxacin (STFX) and various oral antimicrobial agents against bacterial isolates recovered from clinical specimens between January and December 2012, at different healthcare facilities in Japan was evaluated. A total of 1,620 isolates including aerobic and anaerobic organisms were available for the susceptibility testing using the microbroth dilution methods recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The minimum inhibitory concentration of STFX at which 90% of isolates (MIC90) was 0.5 microg/mL for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and was 2 times lower than that of garenoxacin (GRNX), 4 times lower than that of moxifloxacin (MFLX), and 16 times lower than that of levofloxacin (LVFX). STFX inhibited the growth of all the isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 microg/mL or less. The MIC90 of STFX was 0.03 microg/mL and was 2 times lower than that of GRNX, 4 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, the MIC90 of STFX was 0.06 microg/mL and was 2 times lower than that of GRNX, 8 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX was 2 microg/mL for Enterococcus faecalis, and was 4 times lower than that of GRNX, 8 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX for Escherichia coli was 2 microg/mL, and the MIC90(s) of other 10 species of Enterobacteriaceae which were the lowest values of the quinolones tested ranged from 0.03 to 1 microg/mL. The MIC90 of STFX for Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates recovered from urinary infections was 4 microg/mL and was 32 times lower than those of GRNX, MFLX and LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX for P. aeruginosa isolates recovered from respiratory infections was 4 microg/mL and was 8 to 16 times lower than those of GRNX, MFLX, and LVFX. STFX inhibited the growth of all the isolates of Haemophilus influenzae at 0.004 microg/mL or less, and was 4 times lower than that of GRNX, 16 times lower than that of MFLX, and 8 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX was 0.015 microg/mL for Moraxella catarrhalis, and was equal to that of GRNX, 4 times lower than those of MFLX and LVFX. The MIC90(s) of STFX ranged from 0.03 to 0.25 microg/mL for all the species of anaerobic bacteria and were the lowest values of all the antimicrobial agents tested. In conclusion, the activity of STFX against Gram-positive cocci was comparable or superior to those of GRNX, MFLX and LVFX. STFX showed the most potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria of all the antimicrobial agents tested in this study.
TI  - Systematic evaluation of commercial susceptibility testing methods for determining the in vitro activity of daptomycin versus Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococci.
AB  - We systematically evaluated 5 methods for testing daptomycin versus 48 Enterococcus faecalis, 51 Enterococcus faecium, and 50 Staphylococcus aureus isolates using (i and ii) broth microdilution (BMD) with 50-mg/liter calcium medium supplementation (reference method) and 30-mg/liter calcium medium supplementation (BMD30 method), (iii) Etest, and (iv and v) MicroScan panel 33 using 2 methods to prepare the bacterial inoculum (MicroScan turbidity and MicroScan Prompt). Isolates were categorized as susceptible (S) or nonsusceptible (NS) based on measured MICs. Essential (+/- 1 dilution) agreement (EA) and categorical (S/NS) agreement (CA) for each method were compared to the reference method. For E. faecium, categorical agreement was poor between the reference method and BMD30 as well as with the three commercial methods, with frequent false-NS results (30 for BMD30, 18 for Etest, 22 for MicroScan Prompt, and 25 for MicroScan turbidity). All E. faecalis isolates were judged to be S by the reference method; two of these isolates were categorized as NS using the BMD30 method, and one was categorized as NS by all three commercial methods. All S. aureus isolates were judged to be S using all five methods. MIC values determined by the comparator methods tended to be higher than those for the reference method, especially for E. faecium isolates. EAs between the reference BMD and BMD30, Etest, MicroScan Prompt, and MicroScan turbidity were 63%, 63%, 63%, and 56%, respectively, for E. faecium, 87%, 83%, 98%, and 80%, respectively, for E. faecalis, and all 100% for S. aureus.
TI  - Impact of Staphylococcus aureus on pathogenesis in polymicrobial infections.
AB  - Polymicrobial infections involving Staphylococcus aureus exhibit enhanced disease severity and morbidity. We reviewed the nature of polymicrobial interactions between S. aureus and other bacterial, fungal, and viral cocolonizers. Microbes that were frequently recovered from the infection site with S. aureus are Haemophilus influenzae, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Corynebacterium sp., Lactobacillus sp., Candida albicans, and influenza virus. Detailed analyses of several in vitro and in vivo observations demonstrate that S. aureus exhibits cooperative relations with C. albicans, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, and influenza virus and competitive relations with P. aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Lactobacillus sp., and Corynebacterium sp. Interactions of both types influence changes in S. aureus that alter its characteristics in terms of colony formation, protein expression, pathogenicity, and antibiotic susceptibility.
TI  - Daptomycin activity tested against 164457 bacterial isolates from hospitalised patients: summary of 8 years of a Worldwide Surveillance Programme (2005-2012).
AB  - We report the results of 8 years (2005-2012) of the Daptomycin Surveillance Programme Worldwide. Consecutive non-duplicate bacterial isolates (prevalence design) were collected from patients with documented infections in 410 medical centres and were susceptibility tested by reference broth microdilution methods. A total of 164457 Gram-positive isolates were evaluated, including 97542 Staphylococcus aureus, 21413 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 29619 enterococci and 15883 beta-haemolytic streptococci. The prevalence of daptomycin-non-susceptible isolates was extremely low for all species in all geographic regions. Overall, the highest occurrence of non-susceptible isolates was observed among CoNS (0.19%), followed by Enterococcus faecium (0.18%), S. aureus (0.05%), Enterococcus faecalis (0.02%) and beta-haemolytic streptococci (0.00%). Moreover, no trend towards increased daptomycin resistance (non-susceptibility) was observed for any species in any geographic region during the study interval. Against S. aureus, the daptomycin MIC(50/90) was 0.25/0.5 mg/L in all geographic regions (99.95% susceptible overall). Only 53 daptomycin-non-susceptible S. aureus isolates were observed and the vast majority (49; 92.5%) had a daptomycin MIC value only 1 log(2) dilution above the published susceptible breakpoint. Daptomycin was also active against CoNS (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/L; 99.81% susceptible), E. faecalis (MIC(50/90), 1/2 mg/L; 99.98% susceptible), E. faecium (MIC(50/90), 2/4 mg/L; 99.82% susceptible) including vancomycin-non-susceptible isolates (4521 isolates; MIC(50/90), 2/2 mg/L; 99.76% susceptible), and beta-haemolytic streptococci (MIC(50/90), </=0.06/0.25 mg/L; 100.0% susceptible). In conclusion, daptomycin has remained very active against indicated species worldwide, and no significant year-to-year or regional variation in daptomycin activity has been detected.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy testing of a bioelectric wound dressing against clinical wound pathogens.
AB  - Silver-based wound dressings have been developed for the control of bioburden in  wounds. However, the popularity and extensive use of silver-based dressings has been associated with emerging microbial resistances to silver. In this study we examined in vitro antibacterial efficacy of a bioelectric dressing containing silver and zinc against various wound pathogens. Antibiotic-sensitive clinical wound isolates showed a 100% reduction in bacterial growth, except that Enterococcus faecalis isolate was shown to survive with a bacterial log10 reduction rate of less than 10(2) CFU. We also investigated antibacterial efficacy against the extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) bacteria, multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The bioelectric dressing was effective in killing wound pathogens including ESBL, MDR, and MRSA in vitro. Furthermore, based on the primary results against E. faecalis, we carried out extensive studies against several nosocomial Enterococcus species including vancomycin-resistant species. Overall, the vancomycin-sensitive or -resistant Enterococcus species were resistant to this dressing at up to 48 h, except for the vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus raffinosus isolate only showing a 100% bacterial reduction at 48 h, but not at 24 h. The results demonstrated the effective bactericidal activity of a bioelectric dressing against antibiotic-sensitive and MDR strains, but Enterococcus species are bacteriostatic.
TI  - Evaluation of cytotoxicity, antimicrobial activity and physicochemical properties of a calcium aluminate-based endodontic material.
AB  - A calcium aluminate-based endodontic material, EndoBinder, has been developed in  order to reduce MTA negative characteristics, preserving its biological properties and clinical applications. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity, antimicrobial activity, pH, solubility and water sorption of EndoBinder and to compare them with those of white MTA (WMTA). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cytotoxicity was assessed through a multiparametric analysis employing 3T3 cells. Antimicrobial activity against Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Staphylococcus aureus. (ATCC 25923) and Candida albicans (ATCC 10556) was determined by the agar diffusion method. pH was measured at periods of 3, 24, 72 and 168 hours. Solubility and water sorption evaluation were performed following ISO requirements. Data were statistically analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey`s test with a significance level of 5%. RESULTS: EndoBinder and WMTA were non-cytotoxic in all tested periods and with the different cell viability parameters. There was no statistical differences between both materials (P>.05). All tested materials were inhibitory by direct contact against all microbial strains tested. EndoBinder and WMTA presented alkaline pH in all tested times with higher values of pH for WMTA (P<.05). Both materials showed values complying with the solubility minimum requirements. However, EndoBinder showed lower solubility than WMTA (P<.05). No statistical differences were observed regarding water sorption (P>.05). CONCLUSION: Under these experimental conditions, we concluded that the calcium aluminate-based endodontic material EndoBinder demonstrated suitable biological and physicochemical properties, so it can be suggested as a material of choice in root resorption, perforations and root-end filling.
TI  - Genomics-guided discovery of endophenazines from Kitasatospora sp. HKI 714.
AB  - In this study we report on the genomics-guided exploration of the metabolic potential of the newly discovered strain Kitasatospora sp. HKI 714. The bioinformatics analysis of the whole genome sequence revealed the presence of a biosynthetic gene cluster presumably responsible for the biosynthesis of formerly unknown endophenazine derivatives. A 200 L cultivation combined with bioactivity-guided isolation techniques revealed four new natural products belonging to the endophenazines and the 5,10-dihydrophenazines. Detailed descriptions of their biological effects, mainly focused on antimicrobial properties against several mycobacteria, are given.
TI  - [Development of polycomponent metabolite probiotic].
AB  - AIM: Construct composition of polycomponent probiotic based on lactobacilli cultural fluid (CF) supernatant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Species membership of lactobacilli strains was specified by analysis of nucleotide sequences of 16S RNA genes. For comparison of probiotic effect of CF, supernatant and ultrafiltrate of a consortium of lactobacilli strains, studies of specter of peptides, amino- and other organic acids contained in them as well as profile of bactericidal and fungicidal activity was carried out. RESULTS; Technology of production of amicrobial probiotic agent based on CF of the consortium of lactobacilli strains was developed. During determination of concentration of metabolites of protein nature analogy of parameters was shown in CF supernatant and native lactobacilli cultures. In both the studied supernatants and CF the same set of organic acids was also reported to be present. During comparison of antimicrobial and anticandidosis activity of lactobacilli native culture and CF supernatant against Staphylococcus aureus 209, Enterococcus faecalis 1154 and Candida albicans 5 test-strains, an equivalent effect of both samples was shown. CONCLUSION: Polycomponent metabolite probiotic based on CF supernatant of Lactobacillus helveticus NKJC, Lactobacillus helveticus JCH and Lactobacillus casei KAA strains completely retains bactericidal and fungicidal activity of the native culture of the consortium of strains and at the same time lacks disadvantages of compositions containing live microorganisms.
TI  - Antibacterial properties and mode of action of new triaryl butene citrate compounds.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of newly synthesized triaryl butene analogues of tamoxifen. Several compounds were synthesized and converted to citrate salts to ensure greater solubility. Four compounds showed significant antibacterial activity at micromolar concentrations against Gram-positive and Gram-negative foodborne pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria ivanovii, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Two compounds at 50 muM, caused only 7.8 and 11% hemolysis. One of these as well as the remaining two caused high K(+) and Na(+) efflux from bacterial cells. Ultrastructural alterations were also visible using transmission electron microscopy, which revealed severe damage of the inner or outer membrane of E. coli. L. ivanovii showed swelling, corrugations and similar damage indicating a loss of cell-wall integrity. Organometallic compounds may offer interesting opportunities for the design of novel classes of antimicrobial compounds.
TI  - Novel benzoxazoles: synthesis and antibacterial, antifungal, and antitubercular activity against antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive microbes.
AB  - A new series of 5-(p-substituted benzamido/phenylacetamido)-2-(p-tert-butylphenyl)benzoxazole derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial, antifungal, and antimycobacterial activities against antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as against Candida albicans and Candida krusei. The compounds possessed broad-spectrum activity against all of the tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and yeasts, their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging between 16-128 microg/ml. One compound exhibited significant antibacterial activity (16 microg/ml) against an antibiotic-resistant Enterococcus faecalis isolate, having twice the potency of the compared standard drugs vancomycin and gentamycin sulfate. The compounds also showed moderate antitubercular activity with MIC values between 8-128 microg/ml against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its clinical isolate.
TI  - Etiological factors of infections in diabetic foot syndrome - attempt to define optimal empirical therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic foot syndrome (DFS) represents one of the most frequent reasons for lower limb amputation in developed countries. In most cases, it is associated with bacterial infection, requiring optimal antibiotic therapy. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify the most frequent pathogens responsible for infections associated with DFS, establish the optimal protocol of empirical therapy, and ascertain the clinical variables that may determine the choice of the appropriate antibacterial agent. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The analysis included hospital records of patients treated at the Department between 2008 and 2010. A total of 102 individuals were identified; their material was cultured and tested for antibiotic susceptibility. RESULTS: A total of 199 bacterial strains were isolated. There was a predominance of Gram-positive bacteria, particularly Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus coagulase-negative strains, and Enterococcus faecalis. Of note was the high percentage of E. faecalis infection (16.08%). One can speculate on the potential etiological factors in the case of some bacteria, e.g. patients infected with S. aureus were characterized by higher monocytosis and lymphocytosis as compared to other patients. Analysis of drug susceptibility revealed that ciprofloxacin has the highest (but still only 44%) efficacy of all agents tested as monotherapy, and a combination of piperacillin and tazobactam or amoxicillin and clavulanate with aminoglycosides is particularly beneficial. CONCLUSIONS: Staphylococcus spp. predominates amongst the etiological factors of DFS infection; however, the rate of E. faecalis infection is alarmingly high. Monotherapy enables effective treatment in a minority of cases; therefore, at least two-drug protocols should be implemented from the very beginning of the therapy.
TI  - The antibacterial activity, antioxidant activity and selectivity index of leaf extracts of thirteen South African tree species used in ethnoveterinary medicine to treat helminth infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diseases caused by bacteria remain a major challenge globally and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The plants used in this study have been used in South Africa to treat helminth infections in livestock and humans. In a previous study we found a correlation between antifungal and anthelmintic activity in some cases. In this study we examined other potential uses of these thirteen plant species by determining the antibacterial and antioxidant activity of the leaf acetone extracts.The antibacterial activity was determined by using a serial microdilution method against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. Bioautography was used to determine the number of antibacterial compounds. The antioxidant activity was determined using the ABTS and DPPH methods. RESULTS: Maesa lanceolata and Leucosidea sericea with an MIC of 0.02 mg/ml had excellent antibacterial activity against Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There was a poor correlation between antioxidant activity and antibacterial activity with R2 = 0.143. This is because antibacterial activity is mainly related to non-polar compounds and antioxidant activity to polar compounds. Maesa lanceolata extracts had a low cytotoxicity with a selectivity index of 5.2, 2.6, 2.6 and 1.3 for P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis, E. coli and S. aureus respectively. Strychnos mitis extracts had a therapeutic index of 1.1 for E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that plant extracts of some species used in ethnoveterinary medicine as anthelmintic may also have excellent antibacterial activity.
TI  - Recombinant human lipocalin 2 acts as an antibacterial agent to prevent platelet  contamination.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet products is the major infectious  risk in blood transfusion medicine, which can result in life-threatening sepsis in recipient. Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) is an iron-sequestering protein in the antibacterial innate immune response, which inhibit bacterial growth. This study was aimed to evaluate the antibacterial property of Lcn2 in preventing bacterial contamination of platelets. METHODS: Recombinant Lcn2 was expressed in a eukaryotic expression system and following purification and characterization of the recombinant Lcn2, its minimum inhibitory concentration was determined. Then, platelet concentrates were inoculated with various concentrations of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis, and the antibacterial effects of Lcn2 was evaluated at 20-24 degrees C. RESULTS: Results revealed that Lcn2 effectively inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(4) CFU/ml S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and E. faecalis at 40 ng/ml. At this concentration, Lcn2 also inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(3) CFU/ml Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis. CONCLUSION: Recombinant Lcn2 inhibited growth of a variety of platelet-contaminating bacteria. Therefore, supplementation of platelet concentrates with Lcn2 may reduce bacterial contamination.
TI  - Microwave-assisted preparation of azachalcones and their N-alkyl derivatives with antimicrobial activities.
AB  - Two new azachalcones were prepared by both Claisen-Schmidt condensation and a simple environmentally trendy microwave-assisted method. Ten new N-alkyl (C6,8,10,12,14)-substituted azachalconium bromides (3a-e, 4a-e) were prepared from compounds 1 and 2 with corresponding alkyl halides. The antimicrobial activities of all the compounds were tested against Enterococcus faecalis, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus micro-organisms.
TI  - Daptomycin-loaded polymethylmethacrylate bone cement for joint arthroplasty surgery.
AB  - Antibiotic-loaded acrylic bone cement has been frequently used as an infection prophylaxis or antibiotic-loaded spacer in infected arthroplasty. In addition, daptomycin has been used recently against broad spectrum Gram-positive organisms. The goal of this in vitro study is to investigate the bacteriacidal and mechanical properties of daptomycin-incorporated polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement and evaluate its feasibility for clinical use. Daptomycin (0.5, 1, or 2 g) was premixed with 40 g of PMMA bone cement powder before curing. The mechanical properties of the daptomycin-loaded acrylic bone cement (DLABC) were estimated following standard guidance, and the release profile and kinetics of daptomycin from PMMA were analyzed. The antimicrobial efficacy of DLABC was determined with a zone of inhibition (ZOI) assay against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium, respectively. The results showed that the compressive strength, of PMMA bone cement, which was higher than 100 MPa in all groups, was sufficient according to ISO 5833 after incorporation of daptomycin. The encapsulated daptomycin was released for 2 weeks with a 9.59 +/- 0.85%, 15.25 +/- 0.69%, and 20.64 +/- 20.33% released percentage on the first day in the low, mid, and high groups, respectively. According to the calculated release kinetics, incorporated daptomycin should be 3.3 times the original dose to double its release. Although all recipes of DLABC had a microbial inhibitory effect, the effect with a higher encapsulated amount of daptomycin was more significant. Therefore, we believe that daptomycin can be locally delivered from PMMA bone cement at the surgical site as a prophylactic or treatment for osteomyelitis against Gram-positive organisms with intact cement function.
TI  - Spiromastixones A-O, antibacterial chlorodepsidones from a deep-sea-derived Spiromastix sp. fungus.
AB  - Fifteen new depsidone-based analogues named spiromastixones A-O (1-15) were isolated from the fermentation broth of a deep-sea Spiromastix sp. fungus. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of extensive NMR and mass spectroscopic analysis in association with chemical conversion. Spiromastixones A-O are classified into two subtypes based on the orientation of ring C relative to ring A, while the n-propyl substituents on rings A and C are rarely seen in natural products. Most analogues are substituted by various numbers of chlorine atoms. All compounds exhibited significant inhibition against Gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Bacillus subtilis with MIC values ranging from 0.125 to 8.0 mug/mL. In addition, compounds 6-10 displayed potent inhibitory effects against methicillin-resistant bacterial strains of S. aureus (MRSA) and S. epidermidis (MRSE), while 10 also inhibited the growth of the vancomycin-resistant bacteria Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium (VRE). The structure-activity relationships are discussed.
TI  - Is there a need for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in patients undergoing urological procedures?
AB  - Heart valve repair or replacement is a serious problem.The focused update on infective endocarditis of American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2008 (ACC/AHA guidelines) and Guidelines on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infective endocarditis (new version 2009) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC guidelines) describe prophylaxis against infective endocarditis as not recommended for urinary tract procedures in the absence of active infection. A statistical association has been recently shown between urological procedures and the development of infective endocarditis. New evidences concerning infective endocarditis due to Actinobaculum schaalii, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aerococci and Staphylococcus aureus, and new findings indicate there is a need for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in patients undergoing urological procedures especially in elderly patients and in cancer and immunocompromised patients, to avoid serious consequences.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of plant extracts from southern Minas Gerais cerrado.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of plant hidroethanolic extracts on bacteria Gram positive, Gram negative, yeasts, Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37 and Mycobacterium bovis was evaluated by using the technique of Agar diffusion and microdilution in broth. Among the extracts evaluated by Agar diffusion, the extract of Bidens pilosa leaf presented the most expressive average of haloes of growth inhibition to the microorganisms, followed by the extract of B. pilosa flower, of Eugenia pyriformis' leaf and seed, of Plinia cauliflora leaf which statistically presented the same average of haloes inhibitory formation on bacteria Gram positive, Gram negative and yeasts. The extracts of Heliconia rostrata did not present activity. Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37 and Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) appeared resistant to all the extracts. The susceptibility profile of Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae fungi were compared to one another and to the Gram positive Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis and the Gram negative Salmonella typhimurium bacteria (p > 0.05). The evaluation of cytotoxicity was carried out on C6-36 larvae cells of the Aedes albopictus mosquito. The extracts of stem and flower of Heliconia rostrata, leaf and stem of Plinia cauliflora, seed of Anonna crassiflora and stem, flower and root of B. pilosa did not present toxicity in the analyzed concentrations. The highest rates of selectivity appeared in the extracts of stem of A. crassiflora and flower of B. pilosa to Staphylococcus aureus, presenting potential for future studies about a new drug development.
TI  - A Comparison between Antibacterial Activity of Propolis and Aloe vera on Enterococcus faecalis (an In Vitro Study).
AB  - Removing the bacteria, including Enterococcus faecalis, from the root canal is one of the important aims in endodontic treatment.We aimed to compare the antibacterial activity of Chlorhexidine with two natural drugs. The antibacterial activities of three different propolis extracts (alcohol concentrations: 0, 15, 40%) and Aloe vera gel on E. faecalis were compared using three methods: disk diffusion, microdilution and direct contact test. In addition to the above bacterium, the Aloe vera gel effect on Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans was evaluated. Disk diffusion test revealed that propolis ethanolic extracts (the alcohol concentration of 15 and 40%) and Aloe vera gel have antibacterial activities but aqueous extract of propolis did not show any effect in this test. The MICs for propolis ethanolic extracts, Aloe vera gel and aqueous extract of propolis (0% alcohol) were 313 microg/ml, 750 microg/ml, 2250 microg/ml, and >/= 500 microg/ml respectively, much higher than the Chlorhexidine one. In direct contact test, contrary to Aloe vera, all three propolis extracts showed antibacterial effects on E. faecalis. The Aloe vera gel also showed significant antibacterial effect on S.aureus and S.mutans. The hydroalcoholic extracts of propolis and Aloe vera gel had antibacterial effects on E. faecalis, however, propolis is more potent than Aloe vera. The antibacterial effect of Aloe vera on S. aureus and S. mutans is low (MIC >/= 2250 microg/ml). Appropriate concentrations of alcoholic extracts of propolis and some fractions of Aloe vera gel might be good choices for disinfecting the root canal in endodontic treatments.
TI  - New flavonoids C-glycosides from Rhabdophyllum arnoldianum.
AB  - Two new flavone glycosides, 3''-O-acetyl-7-O-methylvitexin (1) and 6''-alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-7-O-methylvitexin (2), along with nine known compounds (3-11) were isolated from the leaves of Rhabdophyllum arnoldianum (Ochnaceae). The structures of the new compounds were established by detailed spectroscopic studies and mass spectrometry, while known compounds were characterised by direct comparison of their reported NMR data with those found in the literature. All these compounds were the first reported from Rhabdophyllum genus. The biological assays on crude extracts and compounds of this plant demonstrated that the crude extracts possess significant antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the marine alkaloids, clathrodin and oroidin, and their synthetic analogues.
AB  - Marine organisms produce secondary metabolites that may be valuable for the development of novel drug leads as such and can also provide structural scaffolds for the design and synthesis of novel bioactive compounds. The marine alkaloids, clathrodin and oroidin, which were originally isolated from sponges of the genus, Agelas, were prepared and evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against three bacterial strains (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) and one fungal strain (Candida albicans), and oroidin was found to possess promising Gram-positive antibacterial activity. Using oroidin as a scaffold, 34 new analogues were designed, prepared and screened for their antimicrobial properties. Of these compounds, 12 exhibited >80% inhibition of the growth of at least one microorganism at a concentration of 50 microM. The most active derivative was found to be 4-phenyl-2-aminoimidazole 6h, which exhibited MIC(9)(0) (minimum inhibitory concentration) values of 12.5 microM against the Gram-positive bacteria and 50 microM against E. coli. The selectivity index between S. aureus and mammalian cells, which is important to consider in the evaluation of a compound's potential as an antimicrobial lead, was found to be 2.9 for compound 6h.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of synthetic curcumin derivatives: 3,5-bis(benzylidene)-4-piperidone (EF24) and EF24-dimer linked via diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid (EF2DTPA).
AB  - Curcumin is well known for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. However, since systemic absorption and bioavailability of curcumin from gastrointestinal tract is considerably poor, synthetic curcuminoids are being developed as better alternatives. Two curcumin derivatives: 3,5-bis(benzylidene)-4-piperidone (EF24) and EF24-dimer linked via diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid (EF2DTPA), were included in this study. We investigated the antibacterial activity of EF24 and EF2DTPA against Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. We also studied the effects of EF24 and EF2DTPA on uptake and localization of pHrodo-labeled E. coli in the acidic compartments (phagolysosomes) of dendritic cells (DCs) under in vitro conditions. Our results demonstrate that treatment with EF24 and EF2DTPA directly suppresses the bacterial growth. However, these compounds do not affect the bacterial uptake or localization in the DCs.
TI  - Cerecidins, novel lantibiotics from Bacillus cereus with potent antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified antimicrobial peptides that are widely produced by Gram-positive bacteria, including many species of the Bacillus group. In the present study, one novel gene cluster coding lantibiotic cerecidins was unveiled in Bacillus cereus strain As 1.1846 through genomic mining and PCR screening. The designated cer locus is different from that of conventional class II lantibiotics in that it included seven tandem precursor cerA genes, one modification gene (cerM), two processing genes (cerT and cerP), one orphan regulator gene (cerR), and two immunity genes (cerF and cerE). In addition, one unprecedented quorum sensing component, comQXPA, was inserted between cerM and cerR. The expression of cerecidins was not detected in this strain of B. cereus, which might be due to repressed transcription of cerM. We constitutively coexpressed cerA genes and cerM in Escherichia coli, and purified precerecidins were proteolytically processed with the endoproteinase GluC and a truncated version of putative serine protease CerP. Thus, two natural variants of cerecidins A1 and A7 were obtained which contained two terminal nonoverlapping thioether rings rarely found in lantibiotics. Both cerecidins A1 and A7 were active against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive bacteria. Cerecidin A7, especially its mutant Dhb13A, showed remarkable efficacy against multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MDRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), and even Streptomyces.
TI  - In Vitro antibacterial efficacy of 21 Indian timber-yielding plants against multidrug-resistant bacteria causing urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To screen methanolic leaf extracts of 21 timber-yielding plants for antibacterial activity against nine species of uropathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples of a hospital (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). METHODS: Bacterial strains were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity tests by the Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method. The antibacterial potentiality of leaf extracts was monitored by the agar-well diffusion method with multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of nine uropathogens. RESULTS: Two Gram-positive isolates, E. faecalis and S. aureus, were resistant to 14 of the 18 antibiotics used. Gram-negative isolates A. baumannii, C. freundii, E. aerogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa were resistant to 10, 12, 9, 11, 11, 10, and 11 antibiotics, respectively, of the 14 antibiotics used. Methanolic leaf extracts of Anogeissus acuminata had the maximum zone of inhibition size-29 mm against S. aureus and 28 mm against E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa. Cassia tora had 29 mm as the zone of inhibition size for E. faecalis, E. aerogenes, and P. aeruginosa. Based on the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values, the most effective 10 plants against uropathogens could be arranged in decreasing order as follows: C. tora > A. acuminata > Schleichera oleosa > Pterocarpus santalinus > Eugenia jambolana > Bridelia retusa > Mimusops elengi > Stereospermum kunthianum > Tectona grandis > Anthocephalus cadamba. The following eight plants had moderate control capacity: Artocarpus heterophyllus, Azadirachta indica, Dalbergia latifolia, Eucalyptus citriodora, Gmelina arborea, Pongamia pinnata, Pterocarpus marsupium, and Shorea robusta. E. coli, followed by A. baumannii, C. freundii, E. aerogenes, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa were controlled by higher amounts/levels of leaf extracts. Phytochemicals of all plants were qualitatively estimated. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of timber-yielding plants studied had in vitro control capacity against MDR uropathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Etiology of peritonitis.
AB  - AIM: To determine the etiology of peritonitis, as well as the sensitivity of isolated bacteria to antibiotics. METHODS: Study was performed at the Surgical Clinic, Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, Department of Microbiology, Department of Clinical Pharmacology of University Clinical Centre (UCC) Tuzla. In a prospective study, starting from 1.6.2009. to 30.6.2010., was 60 patients analyzed who underwent surgery for acute peritonitis in the Surgical Clinic, UCC Tuzla. RESULTS: After microbiological processing of the content of the operative field, wound swabs and smears of drainage, we isolated Gram positive coccid bacteria: Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus in 18.36%, Staphylococcus aureus in 12.6%, while Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecum were found in 3.44% isolates. In the group of Gram-negative bacteria we isolated: Escherichia coli in 15.51%, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 10.34% of the cases. The sensitivity of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus was largest to vancomycin (100%), and lowest to penicillin (10%) and Staphylococcus aureus sensitivity was largest to vancomycin and amoxicillin-clavulanate (100%) and lowest to penicillins (3.7%). Sensitivity of the facultative anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli was highest to carbapenems 95-100%, and lowest to penicillin preparations 0-56%. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of microbiological findings of 83.33% patients empirical antibiotic therapy was appropriately involved, and in 16.67% was inadequate and later changed, following the results of microbiological findings. This study indicates the importance and validity of microbiological diagnostics to determine the etiology of peritonitis and appropriate selection of antibiotics to treat these infections, with the required surgical treatment.
TI  - Vellozia flavicans Mart. ex Schult. hydroalcoholic extract inhibits the neuromuscular blockade induced by Bothrops jararacussu venom.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Snakebite is a significant public health issue in tropical countries. In Brazil, some of the most common snake envenomations are from Bothrops. Bothrops bites trigger local and systemic effects including edema, pain, erythema, cyanosis, infections, and necrosis. Vellozia flavicans is a plant from the Brazilian "cerrado" (savanna) that is popularly used as an anti-inflammatory medicine. Since inflammation develops quickly after Bothrops bites, which can lead to infection, the aim of the present study was to observe possible anti-snake venom and antimicrobial activities of V. flavicans (Vf). METHODS: The chromatographic profile of the main constituents from the Vf leaf hydroalcoholic extract was obtained by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The anti-snake venom activity was measured by Vf's ability to neutralize the in vitro neuromuscular blockade caused by Bothrops jararacussu venom (Bjssu) in a mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm model (PND). After a 20 min incubation, preparations of PND were added to Tyrode's solution (control); Vf (0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/mL); 40 mug/mL Bjssu; pre-incubation for 30 min with Bjssu and 1 mg/mL Vf; and a Bjssu pretreated preparation (for 10 min) followed by 1 mg/mL Vf. Myographic recording was performed, and the contractile responses were recorded. The antimicrobial activity (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] and minimum bactericidal concentration [MBC]) was obtained for Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis, using gentamicin and vancomycin as positive controls. RESULTS: TLC analysis yielded several compounds from Vf, such as flavonoids (quercetin) and phenolic acids (chlorogenic acid). Bjssu completely blocked the contractile responses of PND preparations, while Vf preserved 97% (+/-10%) of the contractile responses when incubated with Bjssu. In the PND pretreated with Bjssu, Vf was able to inhibit the neuromuscular blockade progress. MIC and MBC of Vf ranged from 2.5 to 5.0 mg/mL for P. aeruginosa and S. aureus strains, while no antimicrobial activity was observed for E. coli and E. faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: The hydroalcoholic extract from Vf leaves was able to neutralize and decrease the in vitro neuromuscular blockade caused by Bjssu. However, it did not show significant antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria.
TI  - [Investigation of antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects of some preservatives used in drugs, cosmetics and food products].
AB  - Preservatives are added to food, drugs and other pharmaceutical products to avoid microbial contamination. For antimicrobial activity testing and preservative efficacy testing, vegetative forms of the standard test organisms are used. However, microbial biofilm formation may occur on living tissues, medical implants, industrial or drinking water pipes, natural aquatic systems, glass and plastic surfaces. In our study, it was aimed to determine the antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects of some preservatives used in drug, cosmetics and food products and to compare the minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC) of microbial biofilm formed on glass surfaces which are commonly used in those areas and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the planktonic forms. In the study Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Salmonella Thyphimurium SL1344, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis NCTC 11047, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were used as the standard strains; sodium nitrate, methylparaben, prophylparaben, potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate as the preservatives; ampicillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, amphotericin B and itraconazole as the antimicrobial agents. MIC values were determined through the guidelines of CLSI M100-S18 and M27-A3 protocols. BioTimer method was used to determine the MBIC values. The value of "colony forming unit (CFU)/glass beads" was calculated using the graphics drawn by plotting the time of color change for phenol red or resazurin against log10CFU. All experiments were done with four media at different pH values namely pH: 7, pH: 6.5, pH: 6 and pH: 5.5. According to the results of tests on planktonic forms of the microorganisms, sodium benzoate was determined to be the most effective preservative against all the microorganisms tested except S.aureus and E.faecalis. The most effective preservative against S.aureus and E.faecalis was prophylparaben. Prophylparaben was also effective against S.epidermidis. However, in our study it was determined that preservatives were not effective against biofilm forms even if the inoculum was lower, equal to or higher than the inocula of the planktonic forms. The data obtained from this study indicated that preservatives used to prevent microbial contamination in pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food products, are not effective against biofilm forms of the microorganisms. This study is thought to be a guide for further studies to be held in the investigation of antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects of preservatives used in drugs, cosmetics and food industry.
TI  - Antimicrobial and enzyme inhibitory activities of the constituents of Plectranthus madagascariensis (Pers.) Benth.
AB  - Plectranthus madagascariensis is used as a traditional medicine in Southern Africa. In search of compounds and activities supporting the medicinal use, the chemical profile of the methanolic extract was studied by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD). Four major constituents were isolated and identified as rosmarinic acid (1), 7beta,6beta-dihydroxyroyleanone (2), 7beta-acetoxy-6beta-hydroxyroyleanone (3) and coleon U quinone (4). The two abietane diterpenoids (2 and 3) were isolated for the first time from this species. Antimicrobial, cholinesterase and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities of these compounds were studied. The compounds exhibited inhibitory activity on alpha-glucosidase with IC50 values from 33 to 275 muM. Abietanes showed potent antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - New hydrazines with sulphonamidic structure: synthesis,characterization and biological activity.
AB  - Infections caused by bacterial species are common in immunocompromised patients and carry significant treatment costs and mortality. The emerging resistance of microorganisms to some synthetic antimicrobial agents makes it necessary to continue the research for new antimicrobial drugs. AIM: To design new sulphonamide compounds with potential antibacterial and antioxidant activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: New N-hydrazino acetyl-sulphonamides were prepared by condensation of some sulphonamides with chloroacetyl chloride and amination of intermediate compounds with hydrazine hydrate. RESULTS: The synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against Gram positive (Klebsiellapneumoniae. Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram negative bacterial strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli). Some of them were found to have good antibacterial activity. The antioxidant activity of these compounds was also tested using different methods: total antioxidant capacity, reducing power, and DPPH radical scavenging activity. CONCLUSIONS: Chemical modulations performed on sulphonamide structure have a good influence on the biological activity of the synthesized compounds, especially on their antioxidant effects.
TI  - Chemical composition, antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of the essential oil from the flowers of Tunisian Convolvulus althaeoides L.
AB  - This study describes the chemical composition and evaluates the antibacterial and the cytotoxic effects of the essential oil from the flowers of Convolvulus althaeoides. Its chemical composition, determined by GC and GC-MS, is reported for the first time. A total of 24 compounds, accounting for 95.5% of the total oil, have been identified. The oil was characterised by a high proportion of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (36.3%), followed by oxygenated sesquiterpenes (34.7%) and oxygenated monoterpenes (24.5%). The main compounds were germacrene D (12.5%), T-cadinol (11.8%) and verbenone (6.9%). The essential oil was tested for its antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and the clinical strain Acinetobacter sp. as well as facts cytotoxic activity towards the human breast cancer cells MCF-7. This oil did not exhibit significant antibacterial activity against the tested bacteria; however, it exerted a significant cytotoxic activity against the tested cell line (IC(5)(0) = 8.16 mug/mL).
TI  - gamma-Alkylidene-gamma-lactones and isobutylpyrrol-2(5H)-ones analogues to rubrolides as inhibitors of biofilm formation by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Several molecules have been discovered that interfere with formation of bacterial biofilms, opening a new strategy for the development of more efficient treatments in case of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Amongst the most active compounds are some natural brominated furanones from marine algae Delisea pulchra that have proven to be able to control pathogenic biofilms. We have recently reported that some rubrolide analogues are able to inhibit biofilm formation of Enterococcus faecalis. In the present Letter we describe results of the biological evaluation of a small library of 28 compounds including brominated furanones and the corresponding lactams against biofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus mutans. Our results showed that in general these compounds were more active against biofilms of S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa, with little or no inhibition of planktonic bacterial growth. In some cases they were able to prevent biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa at concentrations as low as 0.6 mug/mL (1.3 muM, compound 3d) and 0.7 mug/mL (1.3 muM, 3f). Results also indicate that, in general, lactams are more active against biofilms than their precursors, thus designating this class of molecules as good candidates for the development of a new generation of antimicrobial drugs targeted to biofilm inhibition.
TI  - Acanthamoeba and bacteria produce antimicrobials to target their counterpart.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the microbial ecosystem, microbes compete for space and nutrients. Consequently, some have developed the ability to kill or inhibit the growth of other competing microbes by producing antimicrobial substances. As the 'producer' species are generally immune to these substances, their compounds act on the competing microbial species and give the producer more space and access to nutrients for growth. Many currently used antibiotics were developed by exploiting this potential of certain microbes. FINDINGS: Here, the free-living amoeba, Acanthamoeba castellanii, was investigated for its antibacterial activity against representative Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, while bacterial isolates were tested for their anti-amoebic properties. Conditioned medium from A. castellanii showed remarkable bactericidal properties against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) exhibiting almost 100% kill rate, but had limited effect against Acinetobacter sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). Similarly, the conditioned medium of E. coli K1 and Enterobacter sp., exhibited potent anti-Acanthamoebic effects in a concentration-dependent manner. Conditioned media of Acanthamoeba, E. coli K1 and Enterobacter sp. showed no cytotoxicity in vitro when tested against human brain microvascular endothelial cells. Active molecule/s in aforementioned amoebic and two bacterial conditioned media were 5 - 10 kDa, and <5 kDa respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A. castellanii conditioned medium showed potent bactericidal properties against MRSA. The active molecule(s) are heat- and pronase-resistant, and in the 5 to 10 kDa molecular mass range. Contrary to this, E. coli K1 and Enterobacter sp., conditioned medium showed anti-amoebic effects that are <5 kDa in molecular mass, suggestive of active metabolites.
TI  - Performance of Vitek 2 for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Staphylococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp.
AB  - Vitek 2 (bioMerieux, Inc., Durham, NC) is a widely used commercial antimicrobial  susceptibility testing system. We compared MIC results obtained by Vitek 2 to those obtained by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution (BMD) reference method for 134 staphylococcal and 84 enterococcal clinical isolates. Nineteen agents were evaluated, including all those available on Vitek 2 for testing staphylococci and enterococci. The resistance phenotypes tested included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (n = 58), S. aureus with inducible clindamycin resistance (ICR) (n = 30), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-resistant MRSA (n = 10), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (n = 37), high-level gentamicin-resistant Enterococcus (n = 15), linezolid-resistant Enterococcus (n = 5), and daptomycin-nonsusceptible Enterococcus faecalis (n = 6). For the staphylococci, there was 98.9% categorical agreement (CA). There was one very major error (VME) for gentamicin in a Staphylococcus hominis isolate, six VMEs for inducible clindamycin in S. aureus isolates, and two major errors (ME) for daptomycin in an S. aureus and a Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate. For enterococci, there was 97.3% CA. Two VMEs were observed for daptomycin in isolates of E. faecalis and 2 ME, 1 for high-level gentamicin resistance and 1 for nitrofurantoin, in E. faecium isolates. Overall, there was 98.3% CA and 99% essential agreement for the testing of staphylococci and enterococci by the Vitek 2. With the exception of detecting ICR in S. aureus, Vitek 2 performed reliably for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of staphylococci and enterococci.
TI  - Effect of proton pump inhibitors on in vitro activity of tigecycline against several common clinical pathogens.
AB  - In this study, we evaluated the effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on in vitro antimicrobial activity of tigecycline against several species of clinical pathogens. Clinical non-duplicate isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and three species of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Enterobacter cloacae) were collected from a tertiary hospital and their MICs of tigecycline alone and in combination with PPIs (omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole) were determined. With one randomly selected isolate of each bacterial species, an in vitro time-kill study was performed for the confirmation of the effect of PPIs on tigecycline activity. The MIC changes after PPIs addition correlated with the PPIs concentrations in the test media. Compared with tigecycline alone, the addition of 5 mg/L PPIs could increase the MICs of tigecycline by 0 to 2-fold and the addition of 50 mg/L PPIs could increase the MICs of tigecycline by 4 to >128-fold. The time-kill study confirmed that the addition of PPIs could affect the in vitro activity of tigecycline. Even at low concentration (5 mg/L) of omeprazole and pantoprazole, antagonistic effect could be observed in E. cloacae and E. faecalis strains. We conclude that In vitro activity of tigecycline can be influenced by the presence of PPIs in a concentration-dependent manner.
TI  - Evaluation of epidemiological cut-off values indicates that biocide resistant subpopulations are uncommon in natural isolates of clinically-relevant microorganisms.
AB  - To date there are no clear criteria to determine whether a microbe is susceptible to biocides or not. As a starting point for distinguishing between wild-type and resistant organisms, we set out to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) distributions for four common biocides; triclosan, benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine and sodium hypochlorite for 3319 clinical isolates, with a particular focus on Staphylococcus aureus (N = 1635) and Salmonella spp. (N = 901) but also including Escherichia coli (N = 368), Candida albicans (N = 200), Klebsiella pneumoniae (N = 60), Enterobacter spp. (N = 54), Enterococcus faecium (N = 53), and Enterococcus faecalis (N = 56). From these data epidemiological cut-off values (ECOFFs) are proposed. As would be expected, MBCs were higher than MICs for all biocides. In most cases both values followed a normal distribution. Bimodal distributions, indicating the existence of biocide resistant subpopulations were observed for Enterobacter chlorhexidine susceptibility (both MICs and MBCs) and the susceptibility to triclosan of Enterobacter (MBC), E. coli (MBC and MIC) and S. aureus (MBC and MIC). There is a concern on the potential selection of antibiotic resistance by biocides. Our results indicate however that resistance to biocides and, hence any potential association with antibiotic resistance, is uncommon in natural populations of clinically relevant microorganisms.
TI  - In vitro activity of rifaximin against isolates from patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
AB  - Rifaximin, a non-absorbable rifamycin derivative, has published clinical efficacy in the alleviation of symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is associated with the pathogenesis of IBS. This study describes for the first time the antimicrobial effect of rifaximin against SIBO micro-organisms from humans. Fluid was aspirated from the third part of the duodenum from 567 consecutive patients; quantitative cultures diagnosed SIBO in 117 patients (20.6%). A total of 170 aerobic micro-organisms were isolated and the in vitro efficacy of rifaximin was studied by (i) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing by a microdilution technique and (ii) time-kill assays using bile to simulate the small intestinal environment. At a breakpoint of 32 mug/mL, rifaximin inhibited in vitro 85.4% of Escherichia coli, 43.6% of Klebsiella spp., 34.8% of Enterobacter spp., 54.5% of other Enterobacteriaceae spp., 82.6% of non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negative spp., 100% of Enterococcus faecalis, 100% of Enterococcus faecium and 100% of Staphylococcus aureus. For the time-kill assays, 11 E. coli, 15 non-E. coli Gram-negative enterobacteria and three E. faecalis isolates were studied. Rifaximin produced a >3 log10 decrease in the starting inoculum against most of the tested isolates at 500 mug/mL after 24h of growth. The results indicate that rifaximin has a potent effect on specific small bowel flora associated with SIBO. This conclusion should be regarded in light of the considerable time-kill effect at concentrations lower than those achieved in the bowel lumen after administration of conventional doses in humans.
TI  - Chemical composition of the essential oil from the leaves of Carapa guianensis collected from Venezuelan Guayana and the antimicrobial activity of the oil and crude extracts.
AB  - The essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation of Carapa guianensis Aubl. (Meliaceae) leaves was analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS. Twenty-three components were identified, which made up 93.7% of the oil. The most abundant constituents were bicyclogermacrene (28.5%), alpha-humulene (17.2%), germacrene B (11.9%), and trans-beta-caryophyllene (9.9%). Antimicrobial activity of the essential oil, as well as the crude extracts of the leaves obtained by refluxing the dried leaves with n-hexane, dichloromethane, and methanol, was determined using the disc diffusion assay. Activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29923 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 was only found for the essential oil and the methanolic extract, at minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 400 microg/mL and 50 microg/mL.
TI  - Detection, partial purification and characterization of bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus brevis FPTLB3 isolated from freshwater fish: Bacteriocin from Lb. brevis FPTLB3.
AB  - Lactobacillus brevis FPTLB3 was isolated from freshwater fish, capable of producing bacteriocin that had broad spectrum of inhibition (3200 AU/ml) against Escherichia coli MTCC 1563, Enterococcus faecalis MTCC 2729, Lactobacillus casei MTCC 1423, Lactobacillus sakei ATCC 15521 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. The antimicrobial activity of crude supernatant fluid was stable after heating at 121 degrees C for 60 min and declined thereafter. Stability of antimicrobial activity was observed at pH range of 2.0 to 8.0. Its active principle was proteinaceous in nature since the bacteriocin was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but not by other non-proteolytic enzymes. Mitomycin C and UV light did not affect the activity of the bacteriocin, while chloroform extraction completely destroyed their activity. Exposure to surfactant resulted in an increase in titre, except Nonidet P-40, which led to total loss of activity. No bacteriocin adsorption was detected at pH 1 to 2, whereas 100% bacteriocin adsorption was found at pH 6.5. Based on Tricine SDS-PAGE the estimated molecular mass of bacteriocin was 54 kDa. No plasmid was found to present in the isolate.
TI  - Restriction of the conformational dynamics of the cyclic acyldepsipeptide antibiotics improves their antibacterial activity.
AB  - The cyclic acyldepsipeptide (ADEP) antibiotics are a new class of antibacterial agents that kill bacteria via a mechanism that is distinct from all clinically used drugs. These molecules bind and dysregulate the activity of the ClpP peptidase. The potential of these antibiotics as antibacterial drugs has been enhanced by the elimination of pharmacological liabilities through medicinal chemistry efforts. Here, we demonstrate that the ADEP conformation observed in the ADEP-ClpP crystal structure is fortified by transannular hydrogen bonding and can be further stabilized by judicious replacement of constituent amino acids within the peptidolactone core structure with more conformationally constrained counterparts. Evidence supporting constraint of the molecule into the bioactive conformer was obtained by measurements of deuterium-exchange kinetics of hydrogens that were proposed to be engaged in transannular hydrogen bonds. We show that the rigidified ADEP analogs bind and activate ClpP at lower concentrations in vitro. Remarkably, these compounds have up to 1200-fold enhanced antibacterial activity when compared to those with the peptidolactone core structure common to two ADEP natural products. This study compellingly demonstrates how rational modulation of conformational dynamics may be used to improve the bioactivities of natural products.
TI  - Human pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and viruses in Drosophila: disease modeling, lessons, and shortcomings.
AB  - Drosophila has been the invertebrate model organism of choice for the study of innate immune responses during the past few decades. Many Drosophila-microbe interaction studies have helped to define innate immunity pathways, and significant effort has been made lately to decipher mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis. Here we catalog 68 bacterial, fungal, and viral species studied in flies, 43 of which are relevant to human health. We discuss studies of human pathogens in flies revealing not only the elicitation and avoidance of immune response but also mechanisms of tolerance, host tissue homeostasis, regeneration, and predisposition to cancer. Prominent among those is the emerging pattern of intestinal regeneration as a defense response induced by pathogenic and innocuous bacteria. Immunopathology mechanisms and many microbial virulence factors have been elucidated, but their relevance to human health conventionally necessitates validation in mammalian models of infection.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from Ankober District, North Shewa Zone, Amhara Region, Ethiopia.
AB  - CONTEXT: Traditional medicinal plants have long been used in Ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. Despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still poorly known. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in Ankober District. METHODS: About 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against Bacillus cereus, Bacteroides fragilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. RESULTS: Plant extracts from Embelia schimperi Vatke (Myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 64 microg/ml against B. cereus, L. monocytogenes, and S. pyogenes. Growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of Ocimum lamiifolium Hochst. (Lamiaceae) against S. pyogenes, and those of Rubus steudneri Schweinf. (Rosaceae) against S. epidermidis at an MIC value of 128 microg/ml. Generally, 74% of ethanol extracts (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial strains tested at an MIC value of 512 microg/ml or below. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of Ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed strong antimicrobial activities.
TI  - ArdA proteins from different mobile genetic elements can bind to the EcoKI Type I DNA methyltransferase of E. coli K12.
AB  - Anti-restriction and anti-modification (anti-RM) is the ability to prevent cleavage by DNA restriction-modification (RM) systems of foreign DNA entering a new bacterial host. The evolutionary consequence of anti-RM is the enhanced dissemination of mobile genetic elements. Homologues of ArdA anti-RM proteins are encoded by genes present in many mobile genetic elements such as conjugative plasmids and transposons within bacterial genomes. The ArdA proteins cause anti-RM by mimicking the DNA structure bound by Type I RM enzymes. We have investigated ArdA proteins from the genomes of Enterococcus faecalis V583, Staphylococcus aureus Mu50 and Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343, and compared them to the ArdA protein expressed by the conjugative transposon Tn916. We find that despite having very different structural stability and secondary structure content, they can all bind to the EcoKI methyltransferase, a core component of the EcoKI Type I RM system. This finding indicates that the less structured ArdA proteins become fully folded upon binding. The ability of ArdA from diverse mobile elements to inhibit Type I RM systems from other bacteria suggests that they are an advantage for transfer not only between closely-related bacteria but also between more distantly related bacterial species.
TI  - Pathways and roles of wall teichoic acid glycosylation in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The thick peptidoglycan layers of Gram-positive bacteria are connected to polyanionic glycopolymers called wall teichoic acids (WTA). Pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, or Enterococcus faecalis produce WTA with diverse, usually strain-specific structure. Extensive studies on S. aureus WTA mutants revealed important functions of WTA in cell division, growth, morphogenesis, resistance to antimicrobials, and interaction with host or phages. While most of the S. aureus WTA-biosynthetic genes have been identified it remained unclear for long how and why S. aureus glycosylates WTA with alpha- or beta-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). Only recently the discovery of two WTA glycosyltransferases, TarM and TarS, yielded fundamental insights into the roles of S. aureus WTA glycosylation. Mutants lacking WTA GlcNAc are resistant towards most of the S. aureus phages and, surprisingly, TarS-mediated WTA beta-O-GlcNAc modification is essential for beta-lactam resistance in methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Notably, S. aureus WTA GlcNAc residues are major antigens and activate the complement system contributing to opsonophagocytosis. WTA glycosylation with a variety of sugars and corresponding glycosyltransferases were also identified in other Gram-positive bacteria, which paves the way for detailed investigations on the diverse roles of WTA modification with sugar residues.
TI  - An alkenylresorcinol derivative from Hakea sericea fruits and their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Hakea sericea has been introduced to Portugal for ornamental purposes. The phytochemical composition and the antioxidant, antibacterial, antibiofilm and cytotoxic properties of this shrub species have been previously reported. The present work describes the bioassay-guided fractionation of the crude methanolic extract of H. sericea fruits and the isolation of 9-(3,5-dihydroxy-4-methylphenyl)nona-3(Z)-enoic acid. The structure of this new compound was established by one- and two-dimensional NMR and IR spectroscopy, and high-resolution mass spectrometry. The antibacterial properties of the new alkenylresorcinolwere studied by determining its MIC values against several strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria using the resazurin microtiter assay. The new alkenylresorcinol inhibited the growth of Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus cereus with MIC values of 0.31, 0.02 and 0.16 mg/mL, respectively. Good MIC values were obtained against Staphylococcus aureus strains (0.005 - 0.16 mg/mL), including the clinical isolates (SA 01/10, SA 02/10 and SA 03/10) and MRSA strains.
TI  - A rare case of quadruple valve infective endocarditis of normal native valves - the advantage of TEE.
AB  - Quadruple valve infective endocarditis of apparently normal native valves is a relatively uncommon condition, reported particularly in the setting of intravenous drug use, structural heart disease and immunocompromised state, but its occurrence outside these settings is rare. Multiple valve endocarditis is caused by Staphylococcus aureus in the majority of cases. Although Enterococcus faecalis is a common cause of bacterial infective endocarditis overall, it is rarely reported to cause multiple valve involvement. The present case is one such rare report of a patient who had quadruple valve endocarditis of normal native valves, caused by E. faecalis. Compared to single valve endocarditis, multiple valve disease is associated more frequently with heart failure, perivalvular complications and need for heart surgery; hence, early recognition of the extent of disease and number of valves involved is crucial, as this in turn influences the management, risk of complications and outcomes. Transthoracic echocardiography is a widely used first-line tool in the imaging of infective endocarditis, but transesophageal echocardiography, which is more sensitive, should be used more frequently to assess the extent of involvement. Extensive valvular involvement alone does not preclude medical management, and surgical management should be considered only in those who do not respond to antimicrobials or in the case of hemodynamic compromise or mechanical complications.
TI  - [Bacteriological spectrum and drug susceptibility of pus from severe intra-abdominal infected patients with abdominal trauma].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively analyze the bacteriological spectrum and drug susceptibility of pus flora from abdominal traumatic patients with severe intra-abdominal infection. METHODS: A total of 41 severe intra-abdominal infected patients with abdominal trauma were recruited to collect 123 abdominal pus specimens. And the results of laboratory microbiology and drug sensitivity were analyzed with the WHONET 5.4 software. RESULTS: A total of 297 strains of bacteria were isolated at (7.2 +/- 2.3) strains for each patient. Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 44.1% (131/297) , Gram-negative bacteria 55.2% (164/297) and fungi 0.7% (2/297). The top five isolates were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Those antibiotics highly sensitive (>90%) to Escherichia coli included cefoperazone (91%), imipenem (98%); highly sensitive to Gram-positive cocci included teicoplanin (100%) and linezolid (100%). Staphylococcus aureus was 100% sensitive to vancomycin. The agents with a high susceptibility to Klebsiella pneumonia included imipenem (100%) and amikacin (79%). Ciprofloxacin (90%) had the highest sensitivity to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: The predominant bacteria of causing severe intra-abdominal infection of traumatic patients is Gram-negative bacteria, but the infection of Gram-positive bacteria, especially the ratio of Staphylococcus aureus infection is also comparatively high. Cefoperazone, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid have higher antibacterial activity.
TI  - TMEDA-derived biscationic amphiphiles: An economical preparation of potent antibacterial agents.
AB  - Bis-alkylated derivatives of N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) represent a well-known class of versatile biscationic amphiphiles, owing to their low cost and ease of preparation. Asymmetric TMEDA derivatives, however, have been studied significantly less, particularly in regards to their antimicrobial properties. We have thus prepared a series of 36 mono- and bis-alkylated TMEDA derivatives to evaluate their inhibition of bacterial growth. This series of compounds showed low micromolar activity against a panel of four bacteria. Optimal inhibition was observed when the biscationic amphiphiles possessed modest asymmetry and were composed of between 20 and 24 total carbon atoms in the side chains. These amphiphiles were prepared in a simple two-step procedure, utilizing inexpensive materials and atom-economical reactions, making them practical for further development.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the roots, stems and leaves of Alchornea floribunda.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Alchornea floribunda Mull. Arg. is used in traditional medicine across Africa for the treatment of bacterial, fungal, parasitic and inflammatory disorders. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the antibacterial activity of the crude extracts of different plant parts in order to provide a scientific rationale for the proposed broad efficacy of Alchornea floribunda in the treatment of bacterial infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extracts of roots, stems and leaves were prepared using solvents of various polarities in order to extract a wide range of phytochemicals. The antibacterial activity of these crude extracts was evaluated by micro-dilution assay, against Gram-positive (i.e. Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus saprophyticus) as well as Gram-negative (i.e. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Proteus mirabilis) bacteria. RESULTS: Generally, the ethanol (EtOH), methanol (MeOH), ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and chloroform (CHCl3) extracts demonstrated the best activities, with the leaves exhibiting the highest average activity for six of the eight pathogens. Of these, the ethanolic leaf extract was the most active against Staphylococcus aureus with an MIC value of 50microg/mL. Some other notable activity was observed for the ethyl acetate and chloroform root extracts against Staphylococcus aureus (50microg/mL), and for selected stem extracts against Staphylococcus aureus (50microg/mL), Klebsiella pneumoniae (63microg/mL) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (63microg/mL). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the promising antibacterial activity of Alchornea floribunda against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria responsible for gastrointestinal, skin, respiratory and urinary ailments, and validates its use in the ethnopharmacology of the region.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts from in vivo and in vitro propagated Lamium album L. plants.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of 18 different extracts from in vivo and in vitro grown L. album L. plants was evaluated against clinical bacteria and yeasts using the well diffusion method. All the used extracts demonstrated antibacterial activity, whereas only the water extracts from leaves (in vivo) possessed antifungal activity against Candida albicans NBIMCC 72 and Candida glabrata NBIMCC 8673 (14 and 20 mm diameter of inhibition zones and MIC 10 mg/ml, respectively). The methanol and ethanol extracts obtained from the in vitro propagated plants had a broader spectrum of antibacterial activity than those from in vivo plants, while the opposite tendency was observed for the chloroform extracts. All tested flower extracts possessed antimicrobial activity. The chloroform extract from in vivo flowers demonstrated the highest activity against E. faecalis NBIMCC 3915, S. aureus NBIMCC 3703, P. hauseri NBIMCC 1339 and P. aeruginosa NBIMCC 3700 (22 mm, 13 mm, 11 mm, 23 mm zone diameter of inhibition and MIC 0.313 mg/ml, respectively). The water extracts from leaves (both in vivo and in vitro) possessed higher antibacterial activity than extract from flowers. The obtained results showed that both in vivo and in vitro propagated L. album L. could be used as a source of antibacterial substances.
TI  - Comparison of peptide nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridization assays with culture-based matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry for the identification of bacteria and yeasts from blood cultures and cerebrospinal fluid cultures.
AB  - Peptide nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridization (PNA FISH) is a molecular diagnostic tool for the rapid detection of pathogens directly from liquid media. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate PNA FISH assays in comparison with culture-based matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) identification, as a reference method, for both blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures, during a 1-year investigation. On the basis of the Gram stain microscopy results, four different PNA FISH commercially available assays were used ('Staphylococcus aureus/CNS', 'Enterococcus faecalis/OE', 'GNR Traffic Light' and 'Yeasts Traffic Light' PNA FISH assays, AdvanDx). The four PNA FISH assays were applied to 956 positive blood cultures (921 for bacteria and 35 for yeasts) and 11 CSF cultures. Among the 921 blood samples positive for bacteria, PNA FISH gave concordant results with MALDI-TOF MS in 908/921 (98.64%) samples, showing an agreement of 99.4% in the case of monomicrobial infections. As regards yeasts, the PNA FISH assay showed a 100% agreement with the result obtained by MALDI-TOF MS. When PNA FISH assays were tested on the 11 CSF cultures, the results agreed with the reference method in all cases (100%). PNA FISH assays provided species identification at least one work-day before the MALDI-TOF MS culture-based identification. PNA FISH assays showed an excellent efficacy in the prompt identification of main pathogens, yielding a significant reduction in reporting time and leading to more appropriate patient management and therapy in cases of sepsis and severe infections.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of resin rich plant extracts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The in vitro antibacterial activity of resin rich methanolic extracts (RRMEs) of Commiphora myrrha, Operculina turpethum, and Pinus roxburghii. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Different concentration were studied by agar-well diffusion method against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative bacterial strains (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae). RESULTS: Among all the bacterial strains tested, E. faecalis was most sensitive and S. typhi was resistant to C. myrrha and P. roxburghii. The extracts of O. turpethum were active against all tested strains in which B. subtilis and S. aureus were the most sensitive. CONCLUSION: This suggested that the antibacterial activity of RRMEs of O. turpethum was more than C. myrrha and P. roxburghii. This probably explains the potential of these plants against a number of infections caused by bacterial strains tested.
TI  - [Comparative evaluation of antimicrobial activity of root canal irrigation agents].
AB  - A comparative study of the antimicrobial activity of different antiseptics for root canal irrigation: chlorhexidine bigluconate solution in 6 concentrations (2.0-1.0-0.5-0.2-0.1-0.02%), two sodium hypochlorite formulations: "Parcan" (France) and "Hypochloran-3" (Russia), and stabilized EDTA solution (EDTA Solutions (Korea)) was carried out. The results indicate that the level of antimicrobial activity of chlorhexidine is directly proportional to its concentration. Sodium hypochlorite tends to be more effective in compare with chlorhexidine. EDTA Solutions has a pronounced antimicrobial activity against all strains.
TI  - Effects of microgravity on the virulence of Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus  faecalis, Candida albicans, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - To evaluate effects of microgravity on virulence, we studied the ability of four  common clinical pathogens--Listeria monocytogenes, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans--to kill wild type Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) nematodes at the larval and adult stages. Simultaneous studies were performed utilizing spaceflight, clinorotation in a 2-D clinorotation device, and static ground controls. The feeding rate of worms for killed E. coli was unaffected by spaceflight or clinorotation. Nematodes, microbes, and growth media were separated until exposed to true or modeled microgravity, then mixed and grown for 48 h. Experiments were terminated by paraformaldehyde fixation, and optical density measurements were used to assay residual microorganisms. Spaceflight was associated with reduced virulence for Listeria, Enterococcus, MRSA, and Candida for both larval and adult C. elegans. These are the first data acquired with a direct in vivo assay system in space to demonstrate virulence. Clinorotation reproduced the effects of spaceflight in some, but not all, virulence assays: Candida and Enterococcus were less virulent for larval worms but not adult worms, whereas virulence of MRSA and Listeria were unaffected by clinorotation in tests with both adult and larval worms. We conclude that four common clinical microorganisms are all less virulent in space.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of H2O2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. We tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. For all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. In contrast, antibacterial activity against any of the bacterial species tested (S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. coli, S. salivarius, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mutans, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection treatment up to 40 times. This finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. The active ingredient of this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of H2O2. Therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. In conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of H2O2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.
TI  - [Surveillance of bacterial distribution and drug resistance in inpatients with surgical infections: a single center study].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the bacterial distribution and drug resistance in patients with surgical infections, and provide the basis for the standardization treatment of the surgical infection. METHODS: Retrospectively analyzed from January 2008 to December 2011 surgical infection in our samples bacteria identification and drug sensitivity test results. RESULTS: A total of 3829 nonduplicate isolates from 3257 samples, Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 62.4% (the main microbes were P.aeruginosa, K. pneumonia and E.coli etc) and Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 37.6% (the main microbes were Enterococcus, Staphylococcus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus). Incidence of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis were on an obvious increase. For the performance of the high level of sensitive to Imipenem, Amikacin, Piperacillin and Tazobactam by E. coli and K. pneumonia. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii to cephalosporins, Carbapenems and Fluoroqinolones were higher resistant with Multidrug resistance. No vancomycin and teicoplanin resistant Enterococcus faecium were found. The prevalence of ESBL E.coli was 45.6%-61.5% and ESBL K.pneumoniae isolates were fluctuated. The methicillin-resistant S.aureus (MRSA) isolates were relatively high (21.1%-55.8%), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis was higher than the other Gram-positive cocci. Vancomycin for Staphylococcus performance was highly sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: The main composition of surgical clinical infection pathogens are Gram-negative bacillus, and the emergency of resistance of bacteria to antibacterial drugs is a common phenomenon. The resistant rate shows ascendant trend; Drug resistance is significantly higher in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Antimicrobial resistance is a serious and challenging issue.
TI  - Comparison of bacteria isolated from emergency department patients versus hospitalized patients.
AB  - PURPOSE: The frequencies and corresponding susceptibilities of bacteria isolated  from patients in the emergency department (ED) were compared with those from hospitalized patients. METHODS: A microbiology laboratory report of all positive bacterial cultures obtained in the ED, regardless of the source (e.g., blood, urine, sputum), was obtained. In the case of duplicate cultures, only the first isolate cultured from a single patient was included. Colonization-site cultures (e.g., nasal swabs) and culture reports identified by the laboratory as contaminant organisms were excluded from the evaluation. Antimicrobial susceptibility results were then compiled into a standardized ED-specific antibiogram. Antimicrobial susceptibilities for each pathogen in the ED antibiogram were compared with those in the hospitalwide antibiogram. If there was a difference of >/=5% between the susceptibility of a single antimicrobial agent, chi-square tests were conducted, and unadjusted odds ratios were calculated. Pathogens with fewer than 30 isolates were excluded from the susceptibility comparison. RESULTS: A total of 3140 cultures were evaluated (1417 from the ED, 1723 from the hospital). The frequencies of pathogens isolated in the ED and hospitalwide were similar, with the exception of Escherichia coli, which were more commonly isolated in ED patients, and Enterococcus species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which were more common in hospitalized patients. Significant differences in susceptibility profiles were identified for Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: Significant differences in the frequencies of bacteria isolated and corresponding susceptibilities were found in cultures obtained in ED patients compared with those obtained in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of alpha-substituted isonipecotic acid benzothiazole analogues as potent bacterial type II topoisomerase inhibitors.
AB  - The discovery and optimisation of a new class of benzothiazole small molecules that inhibit bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV are described. Antibacterial properties have been demonstrated by activity against DNA gyrase ATPase and potent activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae. Further refinements to the scaffold designed to enhance drug-likeness included analogues bearing an alpha-substituent to the carboxylic acid group, resulting in excellent solubility and favourable pharmacokinetic properties.
TI  - [Pathogens of prostatitis and their drug resistance: an epidemiological survey].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiological features of the pathogens responsible for prostatitis in the Changshu area, and offer some evidence for the clinical treatment of prostatitis. METHODS: This study included 2 306 cases of prostatitis that were all clinically confirmed and subjected to pathogenic examinations in 3 hospitals of Changshu area from 2008 to 2012. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, mycoplasma urealyticum and chlamydia trachomatis were detected by nucleic acid amplification ABI 7500, the bacterial data analyzed by VITEK-2 Compact, the drug-resistance to antibacterial agents determined using the WHONET 5.6 software, and the enumeration data processed by chi-square test and curvilinear regression analysis using SPSS 19.0. RESULTS: The main pathogens responsible for prostatitis were found to be Staphylococcus haemolyticus (30%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (12%), Enterococcus faecalis (9%), Escherichia coli (6%), Staphylococcus warneri and Staphylococcus aureus (3%), Mycoplasma urealyticum (8%), chlamydia trachomatis (5%) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (6%). Statistically significant increases were observed in the detection rates of Escherichia coli (chi2 = 17.56, P<0.05), Mycoplasma urealyticum (chi2 = 8.73, P<0.05), Chlamydia trachomatis (chi2 = 8.73, P<0.05) and Enterococcus (chi2 = 8.22, P<0.05), but not in other pathogens. The resistance rates of Gram-positive bacteria to erythromycin and benzylpenicillin G were both above 45%, but with no significant difference between the two, those of Oxacillin (chi2 = 10.06, P<0.05) and Cefoxitin (chi2 = 9.89, P<0.05) were markedly increased, but those of quinolones, gentamycin and clindamycin remained low, except rifampicin (chi2 = 11.09, P<0.05). The resistance rates of Gram-negative bacteria to cefazolin and ampicillin were relatively high (mean 57.3%), and those to ceftriaxone (chi2 = 11.26, P<0.05) and trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole (chi2 =11.00, P< 0.05) significantly high; those to amikacin, cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem remained at low levels with no significant changes. However, the resistance rates of mycoplasma urealyticum to ciprofloxacin (chi2 = 11.18, P<0.05) and azithromycin (chi2 = 9.89, P<0.05) were remarkably increased. CONCLUSION: Gram-positive bacteria are the major pathogens responsible for prostatitis, but Escherichia coli, enterococcus and sexually transmitted disease pathogens are found to be involved in recent years. Quinolones and aminoglycosides are generally accepted as the main agents for the treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infection. However, rational medication for prostatitis should be based on the results of pathogen isolation and drug sensitivity tests in a specific area.
TI  - Lipoteichoic acid of Streptococcus mutans interacts with Toll-like receptor 2 through the lipid moiety for induction of inflammatory mediators in murine macrophages.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is a pathogenic Gram-positive bacterium that is closely associated with dental caries and subsequent pulpal inflammation. Although lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is considered a major virulence factor of Gram-positive bacteria, little is known about the innate immunity to S. mutans LTA. In this study, we purified LTA from S. mutans (Sm.LTA) through n-butanol extraction, hydrophobic interaction column chromatography, and ion-exchange column chromatography to investigate its immunological properties using murine macrophages. The Sm.LTA preparation had no detectable contamination with endotoxins, proteins, or nucleic acids. Upon exposure to Sm.LTA, the murine macrophage cell-line RAW 264.7 cells produced TNF-alpha and nitric oxide (NO) in a dose-dependent manner. Sm.LTA preferentially bound to and activated CHO/CD14/TLR2 cells rather than CHO/CD14/TLR4 cells, which are stable transfectants expressing CD14 and TLR2 or CD14 and TLR4, respectively. Sm.LTA could not induce TNF-alpha or NO production in macrophages derived from TLR2-deficient mice whereas it dose-dependently induced those inflammatory mediators in wild-type macrophages. TLR2-dependent induction of NO by Sm.LTA was also confirmed in RAW 264.7 cells using specific antibodies blocking TLR2. Furthermore, Sm.LTA deacylated by alkaline hydrolysis neither stimulated TLR2 nor induced TNF-alpha or NO production, suggesting that Sm.LTA lipid moieties are crucial for the immuno-stimulatory activity of Sm.LTA. Unlike Staphylococcus aureus LTA, which has potent immuno-stimulating activity, Sm.LTA showed a modest induction of NO production comparable to LTAs of other oral bacteria Enterococcus faecalis and Lactobacillus plantarum. In conclusion, our results suggest that the Sm.LTA interacts with TLR2 through the lipid moiety for the induction of inflammatory mediators in macrophages.
TI  - Prevalence of the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase genes aph(3')-IIIa and aph(3')-IIa in Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica and Staphylococcus aureus isolates in Austria.
AB  - The aminoglycoside phosphotransferase aph(3')-IIa primarily inactivates kanamycin and neomycin, whilst aph(3')-IIIa also inactivates amikacin. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of both resistance genes in major human pathogens to obtain their baseline prevalence in the gene pool of these bacterial populations in Austria. In total, 10 541 Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica and Staphylococcus aureus isolates were collected representatively without selection bias between 2008 and 2011. Isolates were analysed by aph(3')-IIIa/nptIII- and aph(3')-IIa/nptII-specific TaqMan real-time PCR. For positive strains, MICs using Etests were performed and resistance gene sequences were determined. The overall prevalence of aph(3')-IIIa/nptIII was 1.62 % (95 % confidence interval: 1.38-1.88 %). In Escherichia coli, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, P. aeruginosa and Salmonella spp., the aph(3')-IIIa/nptIII prevalence was 0.47 % (0-1.47 %), 37.53 % (32.84-42.40 %), 2.90 % (1.51-5.02 %), 0 % (0-0.32 %) and 0 % (0-0.037 %), respectively. Eleven of a total of 169 carriers showed single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the resistance allele. The overall prevalence of aph(3')-IIa/nptII was 0.0096 % (0-0.046 %). Escherichia coli (0-0.70 %), enterococci (0-0.75 %), Staphylococcus aureus (0-0.73 %) and P. aeruginosa (0-0.32 %) did not carry aph(3')-IIa. A single Salmonella isolate was positive, resulting in an aph(3')-IIa prevalence of 0.013 % (0-0.058 %). aph(3')-IIIa/nptIII carriers were moderately prevalent in the strains tested except for in enterococci, which appeared to be an important reservoir for aph(3')-IIIa. aph(3')-IIa/nptII genes were detected at clinically irrelevant frequencies and played no significant role in the aminoglycoside resistance gene pool during the observation period.
TI  - Inducing secondary metabolite production by the endophytic fungus Fusarium tricinctum through coculture with Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - Coculturing the fungal endophyte Fusarium tricinctum with the bacterium Bacillus  subtilis 168 trpC2 on solid rice medium resulted in an up to 78-fold increase in the accumulation in constitutively present secondary metabolites that included lateropyrone (5), cyclic depsipeptides of the enniatin type (6-8), and the lipopeptide fusaristatin A (9). In addition, four compounds (1-4) including (-)-citreoisocoumarin (2) as well as three new natural products (1, 3, and 4) were not present in discrete fungal and bacterial controls and only detected in the cocultures. The new compounds were identified as macrocarpon C (1), 2-(carboxymethylamino)benzoic acid (3), and (-)-citreoisocoumarinol (4) by analysis of the 1D and 2D NMR and HRMS data. Enniatins B1 (7) and A1 (8), whose production was particularly enhanced, inhibited the growth of the cocultivated B. subtilis strain with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 16 and 8 mug/mL, respectively, and were also active against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis with MIC values in the range 2-8 mug/mL. In addition, lateropyrone (5), which was constitutively present in F. tricinctum, displayed good antibacterial activity against B. subtilis, S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and E. faecalis, with MIC values ranging from 2 to 8 mug/mL. All active compounds were equally effective against a multiresistant clinical isolate of S. aureus and a susceptible reference strain of the same species.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the minimum bactericidal concentrations of different root-end filling materials.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of root-end filling materials ProRoot MTA, MTA Angelus and IRM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Macrodilution broth method was used. Microorganisms used were: Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) and Streptococcus mutans. Serial two-fold dilutions of root-end filling samples were prepared in macrodilution tubes with concentrations ranging from 1/2 to 1/512. The samples dilutions were incubated for 24 hours. After incubation, 0.1 ml of diluted culture was inoculated onto the surface of supplemented sheep blood agar (Merck, Germany) and all plates were incubated at 37 degrees C in aerobic condition for 24 hours. The MBC was defined as the lowest concentration of root-end filling samples where no growth was recorded. RESULTS: MBC of both mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) products against S. aureus were recorded as 15.62 mg/ml and for IRM 31.25 mg/ml MBC for both MTA groups against E. faecalis were recorded as 31.25 mg/ml and for IRM 62.5 mg/ml. MBC of all root-end filling samples against S. mutans were recorded as 62.5 mg/ml. CONCLUSION: All tested root-end filling materials showed acceptable MBC against S. aureus and E. faecalis. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: All tested materials can be used safely for filling of a root-end cavity.
TI  - Antimicrobial Efficacy of Mineral Trioxide Aggregate with and without Silver Nanoparticles.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Most current root-end filling materials do not provide a perfect seal. Thus, a microscopic space is likely to exist in the interface between walls of the root-end cavity and filling material, which allows microorganisms and their products to penetrate. In addition to good sealing ability and biocompatibility, root-end filling materials should ideally have some antimicrobial activity. Therefore, this in vitro study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of Angelus white mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and the mixture of MTA with silver nanoparticles (1% weight; MTA/SN). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antimicrobial properties of MTA and MTA/SN were tested by agar diffusion technique against Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans. The microbial inhibition zones around the materials were measured by a caliper with 0.1-mm accuracy. Student's t-test was used for comparison between the two groups in normal data distribution and Man-Whitney U test for non-normal distribution. RESULTS: Student's t-test revealed that for E. faecalis, C. albicans, and P. aeruginosa, microbial inhibition zone of MTA/SN was significantly greater than that of MTA (P = 0.000). Mann-Whitney U test indicated no significant difference between the effect of MTA and MTA/SN on S. aureus (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, adding silver nanoparticles to MTA improved its antimicrobial efficacy.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of the ethanol extract, fractions and eight compounds isolated from Eriosema robustum (Fabaceae).
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and  the cytotoxicity of the ethanol crude extract, fractions and isolated compounds from the twigs of Eriosema robustum, a plant used for the treatment of coughs and skin diseases. METHODS: Column chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques were used to isolate and identify eight compounds, robusflavones A (1) and B (2), orostachyscerebroside A (3), stigmasterol (4), 1-O-heptatriacontanoyl glycerol (5), eicosanoic acid (6), 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside of sitosterol (7) and 6-prenylpinocembrin (8), from E. robustum. A two-fold serial microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against fungi and bacteria, and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity. RESULTS: Fraction B had significant antimicrobial activity against Aspergillus fumigatus and Cryptoccocus neoformans (MIC 0.08 mg/ml), whilst the crude extract and fraction A had moderate activity against A. fumigatus and Candida albicans (MIC 0.16 mg/ml). Fraction A however had excellent activity against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 0.02 mg/ml), Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli (MIC 0.04 mg/ml). The crude extract had significant activity against S. aureus, E. faecalis and E. coli. Fraction B had good activity against E. faecalis and E. coli (MIC 0.08 mg/ml). All the isolated compounds had a relatively weak antimicrobial activity. An MIC of 65 mug/ml was obtained with robusflavones A (1) and B (2) against C. albicans and A. fumigatus, orostachyscerebroside A (3) against A. fumigatus, and robusflavone B (2) against C. neoformans. Compound 8 had the best activity against bacteria (average MIC 55 mug/ml). The 3 fractions and isolated compounds had LC50 values between 13.20 to > 100 mug/ml against Vero cells yielding selectivity indices between 0.01 and 1.58. CONCLUSION: The isolated compounds generally had a much lower activity than expected based on the activity of the fractions from which they were isolated. This may be the result of synergism between different compounds in the complex extracts or fractions. The results support the traditional use of E. robustum to treat infections. The crude extract had a good activity and low preparation cost, and may be useful in topical applications to combat microbial infections.
TI  - Bioactive polyhydroxylated sterols from the marine sponge Haliclona crassiloba.
AB  - Four new polyhydroxylated sterols, named halicrasterols A-D (1-4), together with  six known analogs (5-10) were isolated from the marine sponge Haliclona crassiloba. Compounds 1 and 2 represented rare examples of steroids featuring 17(20)E-double bonds. The structures of 1-10 were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis and comparison with reported data. This is the first report of a steroid profile for this species. The antimicrobial activities of 1-10 were evaluated against a panel of bacterial and fungal strains in vitro, and compounds 4 and 9 showed moderate activity against some of the Gram-positive strains with MICs ranging from 4 to 32 mug/mL.
TI  - Bio-preservation of ground beef meat by Enterococcus faecalis CECT7121.
AB  - Meat and particularly ground beef is frequently associated with Food Poisoning episodes and breeches in Food Safety. The main goal of this research was to evaluate the bactericide effect of the probiotic Enterococcus faecalis CECT7121, against different pathogens as: Escherichia coli O157:H7, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens and Listeria monocytogenes, inoculated in ground beef meat. Three studies were performed to evaluate the inhibition of E. faecalis CECT7121 on ground beef meat samples inoculated with pathogens: Study I: Samples (100 g meat) were inoculated with pathogens (10(3) CFU/g)) and E. faecalis CECT7121 (10(4) CFU/g) simultaneously. Study II: Samples were inoculated with E. faecalis CECT7121 24 h before the pathogens. Study III: E. faecalis CECT7121were inoculated 24 h after pathogens. The viable counts were performed at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h post-inoculation. The simultaneous inoculation of E. faecalis CECT7121 with E. coli O157:H7 strains resulted in the absence of viable counts of bacteria at 72 h post-treatment. However, when the probiotic was added 24 h before and 24 h after the pathogen E. coli O157:H7, viable cells were not detected at 24 h and 48 h post-treatment, respectively. Consistently, neither S. aureus nor Cl. perfringens viable bacteria were detected at 48 h in whole assays when inoculated with E. faecalis CECT7121. The same trend than described before was obtained after applying the 3 models assayed for L. monocytogenes. The current assays demonstrated the bactericide activity of E. faecalis CECT7121 strain on bacterial pathogens in ground beef meat.
TI  - The impact of inappropriate antibiotics on bacteremia patients in a community hospital in Taiwan: an emphasis on the impact of referral information for cases from a hospital affiliated nursing home.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence for the impact of inappropriate antimicrobial therapy on bacteremia is mainly from studies in medical centers. We investigated the impact of inappropriate antimicrobial therapy on bacteremia in a community hospital. In particular, patients from the hospital's affiliated nursing home were sent to the hospital with adequate referral information. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study to collect data of patients with bacteremia in a community hospital in Taiwan from 2005 to 2007. RESULTS: A total of 222 patients with blood stream infection were diagnosed, of whom 104 patients (46.8%) died. The rate of initial inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions was high (59%). Multivariate analysis revealed that patients with initial inappropriate antibiotics, patients with ventilator support and patients requiring ICU care were the independent predictors for inhospital mortality. Patients referred from the hospital-affiliated nursing home and patients with normal WBC counts had better survival outcome. More than 80% cases infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecalis received initial inappropriate antimicrobial therapy. With the longer delay to administer appropriate antibiotic, a trend of higher mortality rates was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteremia patients from a hospital-affiliated nursing home had a better prognosis, which may have been due to the adequate referral information. Clinicians should be aware of the commonly ignored drug resistant pathogens, and efforts should be made to avoid delaying the administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy.
TI  - The DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor functions as a regulator of epidermal innate immunity.
AB  - The Caenorhabditis elegans DAF-16 transcription factor is critical for diverse biological processes, particularly longevity and stress resistance. Disruption of the DAF-2 signaling cascade promotes DAF-16 activation, and confers resistance to killing by pathogenic bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. However, daf-16 mutants exhibit similar sensitivity to these bacteria as wild-type animals, suggesting that DAF-16 is not normally activated by these bacterial pathogens. In this report, we demonstrate that DAF-16 can be directly activated by fungal infection and wounding in wild-type animals, which is independent of the DAF-2 pathway. Fungal infection and wounding initiate the Galphaq signaling cascade, leading to Ca(2+) release. Ca(2+) mediates the activation of BLI-3, a dual-oxidase, resulting in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS then activate DAF-16 through a Ste20-like kinase-1/CST-1. Our results indicate that DAF-16 in the epidermis is required for survival after fungal infection and wounding. Thus, the EGL-30-Ca(2+)-BLI-3-CST-1-DAF-16 signaling represents a previously unknown pathway to regulate epidermal damage response.
TI  - Bi-directional-bi-dimensionality alignment of self-supporting Mn3O4 nanorod and nanotube arrays with different bacteriostasis and magnetism.
AB  - Self-supported Mn3O4 patterns of aligned nanorods and nanotubes were synthesized  through a bi-directional-bi-dimensionality growth model by using sodium gluconate and urea as additives under mild hydrothermal conditions without the use of any substrates. In one direction, Mn3O4 grows to form one-dimensional nanorods or nanotubes, while in the other direction Mn3O4 grows into two-dimensional nanoplates to support the nanorods or nanotubes to align into arrays. These two kinds of new nanostructures, a nanotube pattern and a nanorod pattern, show similar and good bacteriostasis for Gram positive bacteria, but for Gram negative bacteria the nanotube pattern shows much better bacterial restraint than the nanorod pattern. Magnetic studies show that the nanorod arrays display similar magnetic properties to the commercial Mn3O4, while the nanotube arrays show different ferromagnetic behaviors with enhanced remnant magnetization and saturation magnetization (Ms) at low temperature.
TI  - A new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - An in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant Hypericum olympicum L. cf. uniflorum. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes); and Clostridium difficile. MICs were 2-8 mg/L for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/L for S. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/L for all species in the presence of blood. Compound 1 was also tested against Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium but was inactive. The MIC for Mycobacterium bovis BCG was 60 mg/L, and compound 1 inhibited the ATP-dependent Mycobacterium tuberculosis MurE ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) = 75 muM]. In a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of S. aureus overexpressing the NorA multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)C-enoxacin in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. Only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with IC50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 muM against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and SAR study of new gemini imidazolium-based chlorides.
AB  - A series of 70 new 3,3'(alpha,omega-dioxaalkyl)bis(1-alkylimidazolium) chlorides  were synthesized. They were characterized with respect to surface active properties and antimicrobial activity against the following pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida krusei, and Candida albicans. In this article, besides description of the synthesis, we characterize a set of features of these compounds, concerning their structure (described by the length of the dioxaalkan spacer and the length of the alkyl substituent in the aromatic ring) and surface active properties (critical micelle concentration, value of surface tension at critical micelle concentration, value of surface excess, molecular area of a single particle, and free energy of adsorption of molecule). Then, we present a SAR study for Staphylococcus aureus, as one of the most widespread pathogenic strains, conducted with the help of the Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA), that involves identification of relevant features and relevant combinations of features being in strong relationship with a high antimicrobial activity of the compounds. The SAR study shows, moreover, that the antimicrobial activity is dependent on the type of substituents and their position at the chloride moiety, as well as on the surface active properties of the compounds.
TI  - Isolation and partial characterization of bacteria (Pseudoalteromonas sp.) with potential antibacterial activity from a marine costal environment from New Caledonia.
AB  - Marine bacteria are a rich source of bioactive metabolites. However, the microbial diversity of marine ecosystem still needs to be explored. The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize bacteria with antimicrobial activities from various marine coastal environment of New Caledonia. We obtained 493 marine isolates from various environments and samples of which 63 (12.8%) presented an antibacterial activity against a panel of reference pathogenic strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis). Ten out of the most promising strains were cultured, fractionated and screened for antibacterial activity. Four of them (NC282, NC412, NC272 and NC120) showed at least an activity against reference and multidrug-resistant pathogenic strains and were found to belong to the genus Pseudoalteromonas, according to the 16S phylogenetic analysis. The NC282 strain does not belong to any described Pseudoalteromonas species and might be of interest for further chemical and biological characterization. These findings suggest that the identified strains may contribute to the discovery for new sources of antimicrobial substances to develop new therapies to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: With the constant increasing of bacterial resistance against known antibiotics in worldwide public health, it is now necessary to find new sources of antimicrobials. Marine bacteria from New Caledonia were isolated, tested for antibacterial activity and characterized to find new active molecules against multidrug-resistant bacteria. This study illustrates the diversity of the marine ecosystem with potent new bacteria species. Also the potential of marine bacteria as a rich source of bioactive molecule, for example antibiotics, is highlighted.
TI  - [Analysis of resistance tendency of bloodstream-infecting pathogens in China].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the resistance profiles and the trend of bloodstream-infecting pathogens isolated from hospitalized patients during 2004-2010. METHODS: The bloodstream isolates were collected from 18 hospitals in 17 cities. Minimum inhibition concentrations (MIC) were determined using the agar dilution method recommended by CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute), and susceptibility results were analyzed according to the 2011 CLSI guideline. RESULTS: Among the 2004-2005, 2007-2008 and 2009-2010 periods, the proportions of clinical isolates were similar; 43.1% (149 isolates), 34.0% (151 isolates) and 47.5% (776 isolates) for Gram positive strains, 56.9% (197 isolates), 66.0% (293 isolates) and 52.5% (858 isolates) for Gram negative strains, respectively. The isolating rate of MRSA was 54.1% (20/37) in 2007-2008, which was the highest among the 3 periods during 2004 to 2010, while it decreased in 2009-2010 (36.5%, 62/170). The MRCNS proportions were similar across the 3 periods. One (1.8%) vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and 1 linezolid-resistant Enterococcus faecalis were found. Although the isolating rates of penicillin non-sensitive strains (oral) were similar between 2009-2010 and 2007-2008 [54.5% (6/11) and 53.9% (7/13), respectively], the resistant rates increased from 0% in 2007-2008 to 30.8% (4/13) in 2009-2010. The results were similar according to the non-meningitis criterion (IV), and the susceptibility rates decreased from 100.0% (11 isolates) in 2007-2008 to 84.6% (11/13) in 2009-2010. ESBL-harboring strains in E. coli were similar among the 3 periods during 2004 to 2010 [66.7% (30/45), 73.2% (71/97) and 67.9% (233/343), respectively]. ESBL-producing strains in Klebsilla pnuemoniae decreased year after year, 72.4% (21/29), 50.0% (18/36) and 41.1% (65/158) in 2004-2005, 2007-2008 and 2009-2010, respectively. Except that the sensitive rate of Enterobacter cloacae to ertapenem was 80% (32/40), the sensitive rates of other strains to carbapenems were still above 90% and the resistance rates were less than 5%. Acinetobacter baumannii had the highest multi-drug resistance rate (81.8%, 81/99). One strain (1.0%, 1/99) of Acinetobacter baumannii isolated in 2009-2010 was reported to be pan-resistant. CONCLUSIONS: We are facing a more serious situation of bacterial resistance. Acinetobacter baumannii resistance was most serious, usually with the characteristics of multiple drug resistance, and even pan-resistance. Carbapenems remain to be the most effective against enterobacteriaceae. Strains resistant to novel antibiotics (linezolid and tigecycline) have emerged.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of curcumin: an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration study.
AB  - Aim: To evaluate the antibacterial effect of curcumin with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method in standard bacterial strains. METHODS: The in vitro antibacterial activity of curcumin was evaluated against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (ATCC 29213), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (ATCC 43300), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6633), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 700603) using the macrodilution broth susceptibility test method. After incubation in tubes, the antibacterial activity of curcumin was detected by a lack of turbidity, which indicated the inhibition of bacterial growth. The concentration in the tube with the highest dilution showing no turbidity was defined as the MIC. RESULTS: The curcumin MIC values were 175 microg/ml, 129 microg/ml, 219 microg/ml, 217 microg/ml, 163 microg/ml, 293 microg/ml and 216 microg/ml against P. aeruginosa, B. subtilis, MSSA, MRSA, E. coli, E. faecalis and K. Pneumonia, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study revealed antibacterial effects of curcumin against standard bacterial strains in high concentrations. Animal experiments have demonstrated that curcumin applied at high doses has strong antibacterial activity. There is a need for further in vivo studies to shed light on antibacterial effects of curcumin with high concentrations.
TI  - A current perspective on daptomycin for the clinical microbiologist.
AB  - Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antimicrobial with in vitro bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria that was first approved for clinical use in 2004 in the United States. Since this time, significant data have emerged regarding the use of daptomycin for the treatment of serious infections, such as bacteremia and endocarditis, caused by Gram-positive pathogens. However, there are also increasing reports of daptomycin nonsusceptibility, in Staphylococcus aureus and, in particular, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis. Such nonsusceptibility is largely in the context of prolonged treatment courses and infections with high bacterial burdens, but it may occur in the absence of prior daptomycin exposure. Nonsusceptibility in both S. aureus and Enterococcus is mediated by adaptations to cell wall homeostasis and membrane phospholipid metabolism. This review summarizes the data on daptomycin, including daptomycin's unique mode of action and spectrum of activity and mechanisms for nonsusceptibility in key pathogens, including S. aureus, E. faecium, and E. faecalis. The challenges faced by the clinical laboratory in obtaining accurate susceptibility results and reporting daptomycin MICs are also discussed.
TI  - In vitro efficacy of various topical antimicrobial agents in different time periods from contamination to application against 6 multidrug-resistant bacterial strains isolated from burn patients.
AB  - AIM: In vitro efficacy evaluation of eleven topical antimicrobials against multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria isolated from burn wounds of our patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Growth of six MDR bacterial strains: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2 strains), Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli in burn-wound models was evaluated 24-h after application of the tested agents. Four different wound models were created to investigate the role of time elapsed between inoculation of bacteria and application of the agents on their antimicrobial activity and efficacy. RESULTS: The efficacy against all the 6 bacteria in freshly contaminated wounds was excellent in majority of the tested agents. The longer was the time interval between inoculation and application of the topical antimicrobial agents, the higher failure of the agents was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Topical antimicrobials play an important role in treatment of burn wounds, but they should be used according to their efficacy against bacterial strains present in patients' wounds. In cases where topical agents have been applied after 24 h, when formation of mature biofilm in the wound could be expected, it would probably not be possible to kill all the bacteria using topical antimicrobial therapy only.
TI  - High-dose daptomycin therapy for left-sided infective endocarditis: a prospective study from the international collaboration on endocarditis.
AB  - The use of daptomycin in Gram-positive left-sided infective endocarditis (IE) has significantly increased. The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of high-dose daptomycin on the outcome of left-sided IE due to Gram-positive pathogens. This was a prospective cohort study based on 1,112 cases from the International Collaboration on Endocarditis (ICE)-Plus database and the ICE-Daptomycin Substudy database from 2008 to 2010. Among patients with left-sided IE due to Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Enterococcus faecalis, we compared those treated with daptomycin (cohort A) to those treated with standard-of-care (SOC) antibiotics (cohort B). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Time to clearance of bacteremia, 6-month mortality, and adverse events (AEs) ascribable to daptomycin were also assessed. There were 29 and 149 patients included in cohort A and cohort B, respectively. Baseline comorbidities did not differ between the two cohorts, except for a significantly higher prevalence of diabetes and previous episodes of IE among patients treated with daptomycin. The median daptomycin dose was 9.2 mg/kg of body weight/day. Two-thirds of the patients treated with daptomycin had failed a previous antibiotic regimen. In-hospital and 6-month mortalities were similar in the two cohorts. In cohort A, median time to clearance of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteremia was 1.0 day, irrespective of daptomycin dose, representing a significantly faster bacteremia clearance compared to SOC (1.0 versus 5.0 days; P < 0.01). Regimens with higher daptomycin doses were not associated with increased incidence of AEs. In conclusion, higher-dose daptomycin may be an effective and safe alternative to SOC in the treatment of left-sided IE due to common Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (ITCs) extracted from horseradish (Armoracia rusticana) root against oral microorganisms.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (ITCs) extracted from horseradish root was investigated against oral microorganisms: 6 strains of facultative anaerobic bacteria, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus casei, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; one strain of yeast, Candida albicans, and 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella nigrescens, and Clostridium perfringens. The ITCs extracted from horseradish root showed antimicrobial activity against all oral microorganisms by the paper disk method. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the ITCs extracted from horseradish root ranged from 1.25 to 5.00 mg/ml against 6 strains of facultative anaerobic bacteria and one strain of yeast, and 4.17 to 16.67 mg/ml against 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria. The ITCs extracted from horseradish root showed the strongest antimicrobial activity, with a MBC of 1.25 mg/ml, against C. albicans among facultative microorganisms, and 4.17 mg/ml against F. nucleatum among anaerobic bacteria. These results suggest that the ITCs extracted from horseradish root may be a candidate for use as an antimicrobial agent against oral microorganisms.
TI  - Production of microbial medium from defatted brebra (Milletia ferruginea) seed flour to substitute commercial peptone agar.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate and optimize microbial media that substitute peptone agar using brebra seed defatted flour. METHODS: Defatted process, inoculums preparation, evaluation of bacterial growth, preparation of cooked and hydrolyzed media and growth turbidity of tested bacteria were determined. RESULTS: Two percent defatted flour was found to be suitable concentration for the growth of pathogenic bacteria: Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Salmonella (NCTC 8385) and Shigella flexneri (ATCC 12022) (S. flexneri), while 3% defatted flour was suitable for Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) (S. aureus). E. coli (93+/-1) and S. flexneri (524+/-1) colony count were significantly (P</=0.05) greater in defatted flour without supplement than in supplemented medium. E. coli [(3.72x10(9)+/-2) CFU/mL], S. aureus [(7.4x10(9)+/-2) CFU/mL], S. flexneri [(4.03x10(9)+/-2) CFU/mL] and Salmonella [(2.37x10(9)+/-1) CFU/mL] in non-hydrolyzed sample were statistically (P</=0.05) greater than hydrolyzed one and commercial peptone agar. Colony count of Salmonella [(4.55x10(9)+/-3) CFU/mL], S. flexneri [(5.40x10(9)+/-3) CFU/mL] and Lyesria moncytogenes (ATCC 19116) [(5.4x10(9)+/-3) CFU/mL] on raw defatted flour agar was significantly (P</=0.05) greater than cooked defatted flour and commercial peptone agar. Biomass of E. coli, S. aureus, Salmonella and Enterococcus faecalis in non-hydrolyzed defatted flour is highly increased over hydrolyzed defatted flour and commercial peptone broth. CONCLUSIONS: The defatted flour agar was found to be better microbial media or comparable with peptone agar. The substances in it can serve as sources of carbon, nitrogen, vitamins and minerals that are essential to support the growth of microorganisms without any supplements. Currently, all supplements of peptone agar are very expensive in the market.
TI  - Microwave assisted synthesis of dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones;  synthesis, in vitro antimicrobial and anticancer activities of novel coumarin substituted dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones.
AB  - The present article describes the synthesis of dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one (2a-h) under microwave irradiation. The product was obtained in excellent yield (74-94%) in a shorter reaction time (2 min). These molecules (2a, b) further reacted with various substituted 4-bromomethylcoumarins (3a-f) to yield a new series of coumarin substituted dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones (4a-h). The structure of all the synthesized compounds were confirmed by spectral studies and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against three Gram-positive bacteria viz., Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans and three Gram-negative bacteria viz., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and antifungal activity against Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium oxysporum, Penicillium chrysogenum and anticancer activity against Dalton's Ascitic Lymphoma (DAL) cell line. In general, all the compounds possessed better antifungal properties than antibacterial properties. The coumarin substituted dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one (4g) (R = i-Pr, R(1) = 6-Cl) was found to be the most potent cytotoxic compound (88%) against Dalton's Ascitic Lymphoma cell line at the concentration of 100 mug/mL.
TI  - Evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  VersaTREK blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  - The Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) assay (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of Gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. A total of 148 VersaTREK REDOX 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating Gram-positive bacteria were tested. Results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) identifications. We obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (24), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (14), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (17), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus parasanguinis (2), Streptococcus sanguinis (1), Streptococcus cristatus (1), the Streptococcus bovis group (5), Streptococcus agalactiae (9), the Streptococcus anginosus group (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE FCM) (16), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (3), Aerococcus viridans (2), Bacillus (6), Corynebacterium (8), Lactobacillus (2), Micrococcus (2), Neisseria mucosa (1), Escherichia coli (3), Candida tropicalis (1), Propionibacterium (1), and Rothia (1). Overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. A total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. We tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. A chart review of 31 patients with MRSA, MSSA, or VRE demonstrated that the Nanosphere BC-GP assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. Additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with MRSA or VRE. The BC-GP assay may have a positive impact on patient care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants from the cerrado of the centralwestern region of Brazil.
AB  - Ethanol extracts from six selected species from the Cerrado of the Central-Western region of Brazil, which are used in traditional medicine for the treatment of infectious diseases and other medical conditions, namely Erythroxylum suberosum St. Hil. (Erythroxylaceae), Hyptis crenata Pohl. ex Benth. (Lamiaceae), Roupala brasiliensis Klotz. (Proteaceae), Simarouba versicolor St. Hil. (Simaroubaceae), Guazuma ulmifolia Lam. (Sterculiaceae) and Protium heptaphyllum (Aubl.) March. (Burseraceae), as well as fractions resulting from partition of these crude extracts, were screened in vitro for their antifungal and antibacterial properties. The antimicrobial activities were assessed by the broth microdilution assay against six control fungal strains, Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis and Cryptococcus neoformans, and five control Gram-positive and negative bacterial strains, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Toxicity of the extracts and fractions against Artemia salina was also evaluated in this work. All plants investigated showed antimicrobial properties against at least one microorganism and two species were also significantly toxic to brine shrimp larvae. The results tend to support the traditional use of these plants for the treatment of respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders and/or skin diseases, opening the possibility of finding new antimicrobial agents from these natural sources. Among the species investigated, Hyptis crenata, Erythroxylum suberosum and Roupala brasiliensis were considered the most promising candidates for developing of future bioactivity-guided phytochemical investigations.
TI  - The antimicrobial screening of a Barbadian medicinal plant with indications for use in the treatment of diabetic wound infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Diabetes mellitus is a chronic non-communicable disease with high prevalence in the North American and Caribbean region. Diabetic Foot Syndrome which is an associated complication can lead to the development of wounds and ulcers which can become infected. Justicia secunda, a plant known locally in Barbados as Bloodroot used in folklore for wound healing, was selected to test its ability to aid diabetic wound healing by antimicrobial activity. It was therefore tested against the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Enterococcus feacalis (clincal strain) which are commonly found in diabetic wounds. METHODS: The plant was collected by local users. Methanol and acetone extracts of the plant were prepared with use of soxhlet extraction. The antimicrobial activity was assessed with the use of a modified Kirby-Baurer method. Concentrations of 200 mg/ml, 100 mg/ml, 10 mg/ml, and 1 mg/ml of the extract were used, with a standard ciprofloxacin 5 microg positive control, and a 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution negative control. RESULTS: The J secunda methanol and acetone extracts with an extraction yield of 15.3% and 0.75%, respectively yielded no activity within the concentration range against the three strains of bacteria tested. In comparison with the positive control, relative inhibition zone diameter (RIZD) values of 0% resulted for both the negative control and the extracts, with the positive control having a value of 100%. CONCLUSION: The in vitro screen of the extracts prepared from J secunda, yielded no antimicrobial activity against the three strains of bacteria tested and therefore does not support the folklore claims by this mechanism of action.
TI  - Risk factors for and epidemiology of community-onset vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis in southeast Michigan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the known link between vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VREF) and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA), the recent increase in prevalence of VREF in southeast Michigan has raised concerns about the presence of a large "community" reservoir of VREF. Efforts to control its spread face some important challenges. METHODS: Patients with clinical isolates of community-onset (CO) VREF (cases) were compared with matched uninfected controls (study 1) and patients with hospital-onset (HO) VREF (study 2). Here, CO was defined as a hospital stay of </=2 days before VRE isolation. RESULTS: Independent predictors for the isolation of CO-VREF compared with uninfected controls were nonhome residence; chronic skin ulcers; previous invasive procedures/surgery; exposure to cephalosporin, penicillin, and/or vancomycin; immunosuppressive status; and the presence of indwelling devices. Independent predictors for isolation of CO-VREF compared with HO-VREF included no stay in an intensive care unit in the previous 3 months and recent hospitalization. VREF isolation from wounds and aminoglycoside exposure were inversely associated with isolation of CO-VREF. CONCLUSIONS: Health care-related exposures and antimicrobial exposures are risk factors for the isolation of CO-VREF. Regional infection control practices are imperative in controlling CO-VREF, in addition to the emergence and spread of VRSA.
TI  - Correlations between Income inequality and antimicrobial resistance.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to investigate if correlations exist between income inequality and antimicrobial resistance. This study's hypothesis is that income inequality at the national level is positively correlated with antimicrobial resistance within developed countries. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Income inequality data were obtained from the Standardized World Income Inequality Database. Antimicrobial resistance data were obtained from the European antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network and outpatient antimicrobial consumption data, measured by Defined daily Doses per 1000 inhabitants per day, from the European Surveillance of antimicrobial Consumption group. Spearman's correlation coefficient (r) defined strengths of correlations of: > 0.8 as strong, > 0.5 as moderate and > 0.2 as weak. Confidence intervals and p values were defined for all r values. Correlations were calculated for the time period 2003-10, for 15 European countries. RESULTS: Income inequality and antimicrobial resistance correlations which were moderate or strong, with 95% confidence intervals > 0, included the following. Enterococcus faecalis resistance to aminopenicillins, vancomycin and high level gentamicin was moderately associated with income inequality (r= >/=0.54 for all three antimicrobials). Escherichia coli resistance to aminoglycosides, aminopenicillins, third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones was moderately-strongly associated with income inequality (r= >/=0.7 for all four antimicrobials). Klebsiella pneumoniae resistance to third generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones was moderately associated with income inequality (r= >/=0.5 for all three antimicrobials). Staphylococcus aureus methicillin resistance and income inequality were strongly associated (r=0.87). CONCLUSION: As income inequality increases in European countries so do the rates of antimicrobial resistance for bacteria including E. faecalis, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and S. aureus. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings outside Europe and investigate the processes that could causally link income inequality and antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Synthesis and characterization of novel organocobaloximes as potential catecholase and antimicrobial activity agents.
AB  - An asymmetric, potentially bidentate dioxime ligand (H(2)L) was formed by condensation of 4-biphenylchloroglyoxime and napthyl-1-amine. Two equivalents of H(2)L were reacted with CoCl(2) . 6H(2)O under appropriate conditions with deprotonation of the dioxime ligand. A series of new organocobaloxime derivatives of the type [CoR(HL)(2)Py], [CoRL(2)PyB(2)F(4)], and [CoRL(2)Py(Cu(phen))(2)] (H(2)L = 4-(napthyl-1-amino)biphenylglyoxime; phen = 1,10-phenathroline; R = izopropyl and benzyl; Py = pyridine) were synthesized. The products were characterized by elemental analysis, molar conductance, FT-IR, (1)H NMR, and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Catecholase-like activity properties of all complexes were also studied. All complexes are catalysts for the oxidation of 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol to 3,5-di-tert-butyl-1,2-benzoquinone in methanol. Antimicrobial activity studies of H(2)L and the six complexes were carried out on standard strains (human pathogenic) of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudominas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi) and the yeast Candida albicans. The compounds showed a significant inhibition of the growth of the Gram-positive bacteria tested. Among the tested microorganisms, S. aureus was the most sensitive strain, especially to H(2)L and its complexes.
TI  - Lysozyme-encapsulated gold nanocluster-based affinity mass spectrometry for pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - RATIONALE: Bacterial infections can be difficult to treat and can lead to irreversible damage to patients if proper treatment is not provided in time. Additionally, the emerging threat from antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains makes medical treatment even more difficult. Thus, rapid identification of infected bacterial strains is essential to assist diagnostics and medical treatment. METHODS: Lysozymes are glycoside hydrolases that can bind with peptidoglycans on bacterial cell walls. In this work, we demonstrated that lysozyme-encapsulated gold nanoclusters (lysozyme-AuNCs) with red photoluminescence can be used as affinity probes to concentrate pathogenic bacteria. After bacteria had been probed by the lysozyme-AuNCs in a sample solution, the lysozyme-AuNC-bacteria conjugates were readily spun down at a low centrifugation speed. The red emission from the AuNCs on the conjugates could be visualized with the naked eye under illumination of ultraviolet light. The bacteria in the conjugates can be identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) combined with principal component analysis (PCA). RESULTS: We demonstrated that pathogenic bacteria including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, pandrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) can be readily concentrated by the lysozyme-AuNCs and distinguished by the results combining MALDI-MS and PCA. Additionally, the possibility of using the current approach to differentiate E. faecalis from VRE was also demonstrated. The lowest detection concentration for E. coli using the current approach is ~10(6) cells/mL. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that the lysozyme-AuNCs are effective affinity probes for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. By combining the results from MALDI-MS and PCA, different bacteria can be easily distinguished. The current approach can be potentially used to assist the identification of bacteria from biological fluids.
TI  - [Comparative study of antimicrobial activity of "Biodentin" and "Rootdent" cements and "Futurabond NR" adhesive].
AB  - Bacterial contamination under fillings proved to be the main reason for pulp inflammation thus emphasizing the importance of antibacterial properties of restorative materials. The aim of the current study was to assess antibacterial properties of "Biodentine" (Septodont), "Rootdent" (TehnoDent) and adhesive "Futurabond capital EN, Cyrilliccapital ER, Cyrillic" (Voco). Two lines of experiments were carried out using cements water solutions and firm tablet-like samples (made by means of special pattern). All the examined materials showed antibacterial activity against E. coli, S. aureus, C. albismall es, Cyrillicans, Str. faecalis. The results confirm the analyzed materials to be a useful tool for deep caries lesions treatment.
TI  - Reduction of the neutralisation time during antimicrobial activity testing of disinfectants according to European Standards.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evaluation of the biocidal activity of chemical disinfectants and antiseptics according to European Standards (EN) is based on determination of the reduction of the number of viable test microorganisms under defined conditions. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate whether reducing the neutralization time required following declared product contact times for the tested microorganisms yields method validations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was conducted on 14 products containing active substances from different chemical groups: alcohols, aldehydes, biguanides, quaternary ammonium compounds, phenols, amines derivatives, oxidizing agents. These products were tested according to phase 1 tests: EN 1040:2005 and EN 1275:2005 and then according to phase 2, step 1 tests: Draft EN 13727:2005 and EN 13624:2003. Biocidal activity was evaluated using the following test organisms: S. aureus ATCC 6538, P. aeruginosa ATCC 15442, E. coli NCTC 10538, E. coli ATCC 10536, E. hirae ATCC 10541, C. albicans ATCC 10231 and A. brasiliensis ATCC 16404. RESULTS: Validation C results for all products and tested microorganism strains were at least half of the density of the suspension for validation (Nvo) after only 10 s of neutralization. Furthermore, results from test procedures performed in parallel were also positive except 5 products toward A. brasiliensis. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study confirm that the contact time described in the European Standards phase 1: EN 1040 and EN 1275, as well as phase 2, step 1: Draft EN 13727 and EN 13624 can be precisely determined in spite of reducing the neutralization time from 5 minutes to even 10 seconds.
TI  - Biological evaluation of hyperforin and its hydrogenated analogue on bacterial growth and biofilm production.
AB  - Bacterial biofilms are organized communities of microorganisms, embedded in a self-produced matrix, growing on a biotic surface and resistant to many antimicrobial agents when associated with a medical device. These biofilms require the development of new strategies for the prevention and treatment of infectious disease, including the potential use of natural products. One interesting natural product example is Hypericum, a plant genus that contains species known to have antimicrobial properties. The major constituent of Hypericum perforatum is an unstable compound named hyperforin (1); for this reason it was not believed to play a significant role in the pharmacological effects. In this investigation a hydrogenated hyperforin analogue (2) was tested on several ATCC and clinical isolate strains, in their planktonic and biofilm form (Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, and Enterococcus faecalis). Compound 2 was effective against planktonic and biofilm cultures, probably due to higher stability, showing the percentage of cells killed in the range from 45% to 52%. These results are noteworthy from the point of view of future development of these polyprenylated phloroglucinols as potential antibiotics.
TI  - The diversity and antimicrobial activity of Preussia sp. endophytes isolated from Australian dry rainforests.
AB  - Limited knowledge currently exists regarding species diversity and antimicrobial  activity of endophytic isolates of Preussia within Australia. This report describes endophytic Preussia species that were identified through molecular analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region. Screening for antimicrobial secondary metabolites was determined by testing crude ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extracts derived from fungal mycelia against a panel of ATCC type strains which included Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and the opportunist yeast pathogen Candida albicans. Subsequently, high-performance liquid chromatography generated fractions of bioactive EtOAc extracts which were subject to confirmatory testing using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute reference microdilution antimicrobial activity assay. A total of 18 Preussia were isolated from nine host plants with 6/18 having a <97 % sequence similarity to other known species in Genbank, suggesting that they are new species. In preliminary screening, 13/18 Preussia isolates revealed antimicrobial activity against at least one of the microbes tested, whilst 6/18 isolates, including 4/6 putative new species showed specific antimicrobial activity against MRSA and C. albicans. These results highlight the antimicrobial potential of Australian Preussia spp. and also the importance of Australian dry rainforests as an untapped repository of potentially significant bioactive compounds.
TI  - One-day point prevalence of emerging bacterial pathogens in a nationwide sample of 62 German hospitals in 2012 and comparison with the results of the one-day point prevalence of 2010.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance of bacterial pathogens is an emerging problem worldwide. To combat multidrug resistant organisms (MRDOs) networks of care providers have been established in all states in Germany. The HICARE-network, a project to combat MRDOs, founded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, has published data from 2010 of a voluntary, German-wide, multicenter point-prevalence survey in 2011 conducted in collaboration with the German Society of Hospital Hygiene. The aim of the present survey was the re-evaluation of the situation in 2012. METHOD: The survey was conducted as a voluntary, anonymous, point-prevalence in May 2012 using routine data of microbiological diagnostics of the hospitals. As in the former survey of 2010 it was differentiated between primary, secondary and tertiary care hospitals and only data from intensive care units, surgical and medical wards were collected. Based on the survey form used in 2010, an updated version was used including more pathogens and corrected issues observed in the former survey. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (total as well as separated in hospital-acquired (HA), community-acquired (CA) and lifestock-associated (LA) MRSA), vancomycin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA/GRSA), vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis resp. Enterococcus faecium (VR-E. faecalis resp. VR-E. faecium), extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-building (ESBL) E. coli (ESBL-EC) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP), multiresistant Acinetobacter spp. (MAB), multiresistant Pseudomonas spp. (MRP), carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) as well as Clostridium difficile (CD) infections and severe infections requiring ICU-treatment were included in the survey along with additional data on screening strategy, the equipment with infection control staff and possible confounders. RESULTS: Out of 1,550 hospitals asked to participate, 62 returned data (4%). Data from 56 hospitals including primary (26), secondary (20) and tertiary (10) care hospitals were analyzable (3.6%). The most frequently reported organisms were MRSA 1.53% [CI95: 1.32-1.75], followed by CDAD 1.30% [CI95: 1.11-1.50], ESBL-EC 0.97% [CI95: 0.80-1.14], and ESBL-KP 0.27% [CI95: 0.18-0.36], regardless of the level of care. Prevalence of MRDOs depended on the level of care and on the type of ward, as expected. Overall prevalence was highest on intensive care wards, and prevalences were remarkably high on medical wards compared to surgical wards. All tertiary care providers employed their own infection control nurse, while only ~70% of the secondary and primary care hospitals did. Surprisingly, in two of the ten participating tertiary care providers neither an internal nor an external infection control doctor was available. DISCUSSION: With more than 13,000 patients in 56 hospitals distributed all over Germany, the survey included more than three times as many patients as the first survey and therefore not only adds valuable information about the epidemiology of emerging nosocomial pathogens, but also helps to raise awareness of the problem of antibacterial resistance in Germany. The prevalences reported seem to be comparable to the results of the former survey and of other surveys published. Some hospitals reported to have no infection control personnel available at all. This statement is in line with another survey published in this issue.
TI  - Rapid detection of Gram-positive organisms by use of the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  - Assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. We evaluated the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (BC-GP) in two pediatric hospitals. Positive BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN blood cultures with Gram-positive organisms were tested using the BC-GP in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. To test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 CFU per milliliter. A total of 249 Gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. The BC-GP detected Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%, respectively. The BC-GP detected Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. The BC-GP correctly identified 14/15 cases of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae. It misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with Streptococcus mitis/Streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with Streptococcus anginosus group as S. pneumoniae. The BC-GP detected a case of Streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with Streptococcus agalactiae. BC-GP's rapid accurate detection of Staphylococcus spp., E. faecium, and E. faecalis and its ability to ascertain mecA, vanA, and vanB status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining to optimal antibiotic use. False-positive S. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "Streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the BC-GP.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of amazonian medicinal plants.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aqueous extracts of currently utilized Amazonian medicinal plants were assayed in vitro searching for antimicrobial activity against human and animal pathogenic microorganisms. METHODS: Medium resuspended lyophilized aqueous extracts of different organs of Amazonian medicinal plants were assayed by in vitro screening for antimicrobial activity. ATCC and standardized microorganisms obtained from Oswaldo Cruz Foundation/Brazil were individually and homogeneously grown in agar plate, and holes previously perforated in the gel were filled with diluted plant aqueous extracts. Inhibition halos were evaluated and controlled by the use of the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin. RESULTS: The Amazonian medicinal plants, Hymenelobium petraeum showed inhibitory activity over Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, Acinetobacter baumannii and Candida albicans, while Vatairea guianensis and Symphonia globulifera presented inhibitory activity exclusively for Staphylococcus aureus. Also, Ptychopetalum olacoides and Pentaclethra macroloba inhibited the growth of Klebsiella ozaenae and Acinetobacter baumannii. CONCLUSION: The aqueous botanic extracts that showed activity against microroganisms of ATTC and Osvaldo Cruz strains had at least 40% of antimicrobial activity when compared to halo inhibition produced by the commercial antibiotic ciprofloxacin utilized as a control. Of all plants extracts assayed, the Hymenelobium petraeum had the best performance, sometimes exhibiting higher activity than ciprofloxacin. It is not well-defined by the physicians the exact indication of the majority of medicinal plants in the Amazon area in Brazil. Natives utilize the plants according to their symptoms, based on the traditional knowledge transmitted orally from generation to generation, among Amerindians, Afrodescendents and ethnic mixed populations. A significant number of Amazonian medicinal plants are totally unknown related to their medicinal properties including mechanism of action and therapeutic effects, as very few information is reported in the scientific literature. A tiny amount of data is presented, as the preliminary antimicrobial properties of the medicinal plants here accessed, under the urgent necessity of new antibiotics in the market and in face of the increased resistance of infectious microorganisms to antimicrobials.
TI  - A product of heme catabolism modulates bacterial function and survival.
AB  - Bilirubin is the terminal metabolite in heme catabolism in mammals. After deposition into bile, bilirubin is released in large quantities into the mammalian gastrointestinal (GI) tract. We hypothesized that intestinal bilirubin may modulate the function of enteric bacteria. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of bilirubin on two enteric pathogens; enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), a Gram-negative that causes life-threatening intestinal infections, and E. faecalis, a Gram-positive human commensal bacterium known to be an opportunistic pathogen with broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance. We demonstrate that bilirubin can protect EHEC from exogenous and host-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the absorption of free radicals. In contrast, E. faecalis was highly susceptible to bilirubin, which causes significant membrane disruption and uncoupling of respiratory metabolism in this bacterium. Interestingly, similar results were observed for other Gram-positive bacteria, including B. cereus and S. aureus. A model is proposed whereby bilirubin places distinct selective pressure on enteric bacteria, with Gram-negative bacteria being protected from ROS (positive outcome) and Gram-positive bacteria being susceptible to membrane disruption (negative outcome). This work suggests bilirubin has differential but biologically relevant effects on bacteria and justifies additional efforts to determine the role of this neglected waste catabolite in disease processes, including animal models.
TI  - Trimebutine as a potential antimicrobial agent: a preliminary in vitro approach.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this preliminary study was to investigate the in vitro effect of  "non-antibiotic" trimebutine against reference strains Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, ATCC 35218, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212; microbiota that are potentially involved in the pathophysiology of post-infectious functional gastrointestinal disorders. METHODS: Trimebutine activity was assessed by the broth microdilution method according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommendations against reference strains S. aureus ATCC 29213 and ATCC 25923, E. coli ATCC 25922 and ATCC 35218, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and E. faecalis ATCC 29212. Bactericidal activity of the compound was determined by spreading a 10 muL aliquot on Mueller-Hinton agar from each dilution showing non-visible growth. All tests were carried out in triplicate. RESULTS: Trimebutine was active against all strains tested presenting with MIC ranging from 1024 to 4000 mg/L. MIC and MBC were similar for E. coli ATCC 25922 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 whereas for Gram-positive isolates and E. coli ATCC 35218 the MBC was higher. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the in vitro bacteriostatic/bactericidal activity of trimebutine against bacteria frequently colonizing the gastrointestinal tract and potentially involved in human gastrointestinal infections that might trigger post-infectious functional gastrointestinal disorders.
TI  - Rapid detection of bacteria in urine samples by the "three-plug-injection" method using capillary electrophoresis.
AB  - This study explored a method that can rapidly detect bacteria in urine samples for the auxiliary determination of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Urine samples from patients with UTIs (230 cases) were obtained using aseptic technique. The urine biochemical assay was then carried out using an automated urine analyzer for all the urine samples. Bacterial species were identified by a combination of bacterial culture technique, morphological observation and the BACT-IST microbial identification/susceptibility analysis system. The most common seven species of bacteria in the study included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Bacterial samples were suspended in sample buffer solutions and separated by the "three-plug-injection" method using capillary electrophoresis (CE). Each species of bacteria appeared as a bacterial peak. The mixture of the seven species also provided only one peak. Further analysis showed that the concentration limit for the "three-plug-injection" method is 10(6) colony forming units (CFU)/mL, and there is a good linear relationship between the peak height and bacterial concentration (R(2)=0.99). The effect of urine composition on CE results was also investigated. The results showed that urine composition, i.e., proteins, white blood cells (WBCs) and red blood cells (RBCs), affected the peak retention time but could not affect the separation of bacteria. The results demonstrated that the bacteria in urine samples can be detected within 10min by the "three-plug-injection" method using CE. The "three-plug-injection" method is therefore suitable for the rapid detection of organisms in clinical urine samples from UTIs.
TI  - Identification of pathogen bacteria and protozoa in treated urban wastewaters discharged in the Ebro River (Spain): water reuse possibilities.
AB  - The aim of this research work is to identify the presence of pathogens, bacteria  and protozoa, in different treated urban wastewaters and to relate biological pollution with the processes used in wastewater treatment plants. A study of the possibilities for water reuse is carried out taking into account bacterial and parasite composition. The analysed bacteria and protozoa are: Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens (spore), Salmonella spp., Legionella spp., helminths eggs, Giardia, Cryptosporidium spp. and free-living amoebae (FLA). The selected municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWTPs) are located in Navarra (Spain) and the main difference between them is the use of natural lagoons as tertiary treatment in some plants. The results concerning bacteriological identification showed contamination of mainly faecal origin, and the use of natural lagoons as tertiary treatment in some MWTPs produced an important disinfection effect. Moreover, pathogen parasites such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium were not detected in the samples studied although FLA were identified in all cases.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the recombinant antimicrobial peptide Ib-AMP4 from Impatiens balsamina and its synergy with other antimicrobial agents against drug resistant bacteria.
AB  - Ib-AMP4 is an antimicrobial peptide of Impatiens balsamina (Balsaminaceae). Ib-AMP4 was produced as a recombinant peptide and in this study its antimicrobial activity against human bacterial pathogens was investigated. Ib-AMP4 was bactericidal against both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria with MIC values between 0.49 and 3.5 microM in sensitive species. A genuine synergistic effect was achieved when IB-AMP4 was employed in combination with the plant monoterpene thymol against drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC) ATCC700603, or with the antibiotics vancomycin or oxacillin against Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) ATCC51299.
TI  - Screening of antimicrobial activity and cytotoxic effects of two Cladonia species.
AB  - The present study explores the antimicrobial activity and cytotoxic effects in culture assays of two fruticose soil lichens, Cladonia rangiformis Hoffm. and Cladonia convoluta (Lamkey) Cout., to contribute to possible pharmacological uses of lichens. In vitro antimicrobial activities of methanol and chloroform extracts against two Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli), two Gram-positive bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus), and the yeast Candida albicans were examined using the paper disc method and through determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). The data showed the presence of antibiotic substances in the chloroform and the methanol extracts of the lichen species. The chloroform extracts exhibited more significant antimicrobial activity than the methanol extracts. However, a higher antifungal activity was noted in the methanol extract of C. rangiformis. The maximum antimicrobial activity was recorded for the chloroform extract of C. convoluta against E. coli. The cytotoxic effects of the lichen extracts on human breast cancer MCF-7 cells were evaluated by the trypan blue assay yielding IC50 values of ca. 173 and 167 microg/ml for the extracts from C. rangiformis and C. convoluta, respectively.
TI  - Interdigitated silver-polymer-based antibacterial surface system activated by oligodynamic iontophoresis - an empirical characterization study.
AB  - There is a pressing need to control the occurrences of nosocomial infections due  to their detrimental effects on patient well-being and the rising treatment costs. To prevent the contact transmission of such infections via health-critical surfaces, a prophylactic surface system that consists of an interdigitated array of oppositely charged silver electrodes with polymer separations and utilizes oligodynamic iontophoresis has been recently developed. This paper presents a systematic study that empirically characterizes the effects of the surface system parameters on its antibacterial efficacy, and validates the system's effectiveness. In the first part of the study, a fractional factorial design of experiments (DOE) was conducted to identify the statistically significant system parameters. The data were used to develop a first-order response surface model to predict the system's antibacterial efficacy based on the input parameters. In the second part of the study, the effectiveness of the surface system was validated by evaluating it against four bacterial species responsible for several nosocomial infections - Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis - alongside non-antibacterial polymer (acrylic) control surfaces. The system demonstrated statistically significant efficacy against all four bacteria. The results indicate that given a constant total effective surface area, the system designed with micro-scale features (minimum feature width: 20 mum) and activated by 15 muA direct current will provide the most effective antibacterial prophylaxis.
TI  - Czech ethanol-free propolis extract displays inhibitory activity against a broad  spectrum of bacterial and fungal pathogens.
AB  - Propolis acts primarily as a biocide against invasive bacteria and fungi in the hive, suggesting its potential for industrial applications. In food application, propolis is considered as a chemical preservative in meat products, extending shelf life of frozen meat and other food. The mechanism of action is still unclear due to the synergy of multiple compounds contained in propolis and due to parallel targeting of multiple pathways within each affected organism. Here, we examined the antimicrobial properties of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) Czech propolis extract. Until recently, DMSO was only rarely used in the propolis studies, although the other solvents tested (mostly ethanol) may significantly affect the observed inhibitory effects, notwithstanding the antimicrobial effects of ethanol itself. Here, we provide results of zone inhibition tests against Aspergillus fumigatus, Microsporum gypseum, Microsporum canis, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis. Although we determined inhibitory effects against all the microorganisms tested, the dose-dependent response curves were not similar to each other. While inhibitory effects against C. albicans or S. aureus were strictly dose-dependent, responses of M. gypseum and E. faecalis displayed plateau across the broad range of concentrations tested. Interestingly, response of E. coli revealed the double-peak dose-dependent curve, and responses of M. canis and L. monocytogenes decreased at the highest concentrations tested. Suggested is evaluation of DMSO propolis extracts in experimental treatment of human and veterinary infections, preferably in multitherapy with antibiotics.
TI  - Direction of aminoacylated transfer RNAs into antibiotic synthesis and peptidoglycan-mediated antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Prokaryotic aminoacylated-transfer RNAs often need to be efficiently segregated between translation and other cellular biosynthetic pathways. Many clinically relevant bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa direct some aminoacylated-tRNA species into peptidoglycan biosynthesis and/or membrane phospholipid modification. Subsequent indirect peptidoglycan cross-linkage or change in membrane permeability is often a prerequisite for high-level antibiotic resistance. In Streptomycetes, aminoacylated-tRNA species are used for antibiotic synthesis as well as antibiotic resistance. The direction of coding aminoacylated-tRNA molecules away from translation and into antibiotic resistance and synthesis pathways are discussed in this review.
TI  - Evaluation of pH, calcium ion release and antimicrobial activity of a new calcium aluminate cement.
AB  - This study evaluated the pH, calcium ion release and antimicrobial activity of EndoBinder (EB), containing different radiopacifiers: bismuth oxide (Bi2O3), zinc oxide (ZnO) or zirconium oxide (ZrO2), in comparison to MTA. For pH and calcium ion release tests, 5 specimens per group (n=5) were immersed into 10 mL of distilled and deionized water at 37 degrees C. After 2, 4, 12, 24, 48 h; 7, 14 and 28 days, the pH was measured and calcium ion release quantified in an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. For antimicrobial activity, the cements were tested against S. aureus, E. coli, E. faecalis and C. albicans, in triplicate. MTA presented higher values for pH and calcium ion release than the other groups, however, with no statistically significant difference after 28 days (p>0.05); and the largest inhibition halos for all strains, with no significant difference (E. coli and E. faecalis) for pure EB and EB+Bi2O3 (p>0.05). EB presented similar performance to that of MTA as regards pH and calcium ion release; however, when ZnO and ZrO2 were used, EB did not present antimicrobial activity against some strains.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of quinoxalines, quinazolines, and 1,5-naphthyridines.
AB  - Several phenyl substituted naphthalenes and isoquinolines have been identified as antibacterial agents that inhibit FtsZ-Zing formation. In the present study we evaluated the antibacterial of several phenyl substituted quinoxalines, quinazolines and 1,5-naphthyridines against methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcusaureus and vancomycin-sensitive and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcusfaecalis. Some of the more active compounds against S. aureus were evaluated for their effect on FtsZ protein polymerization. Further studies were also performed to assess their relative bactericidal and bacteriostatic activities. The notable differences observed between nonquaternized and quaternized quinoxaline derivatives suggest that differing mechanisms of action are associated with their antibacterial properties.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance reversal (ARR) in Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens employing electric fields.
AB  
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of SMT19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against Clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  - The comparative in vitro activity of SMT19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined Clostridium difficile strains, 174 Gram-positive and 136 Gram-negative intestinal anaerobes, and 40 Gram-positive aerobes. SMT19969 was one dilution more active against C. difficile isolates (MIC range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; MIC90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. SMT19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against Gram-negative anaerobes, especially the Bacteroides fragilis group species, than vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that SMT19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. SMT19969 showed limited activity against other Gram-positive anaerobes, including Bifidobacteria species, Eggerthella lenta, Finegoldia magna, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with MIC90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. Clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with C. innocuum being susceptible (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) and C. ramosum and C. perfringens being nonsusceptible (MIC90, >512 mug/ml). Activity against Lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; MIC90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. Gram-positive aerobic cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and streptococci) showed high SMT19969 MIC90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).
TI  - Synthetic inhibitors of bacterial cell division targeting the GTP-binding site of FtsZ.
AB  - Cell division protein FtsZ is the organizer of the cytokinetic Z-ring in most bacteria and a target for new antibiotics. FtsZ assembles with GTP into filaments that hydrolyze the nucleotide at the association interface between monomers and then disassemble. We have replaced FtsZ's GTP with non-nucleotide synthetic inhibitors of bacterial division. We searched for these small molecules among compounds from the literature, from virtual screening (VS), and from our in-house synthetic library (UCM), employing a fluorescence anisotropy primary assay. From these screens we have identified the polyhydroxy aromatic compound UCM05 and its simplified analogue UCM44 that specifically bind to Bacillus subtilis FtsZ monomers with micromolar affinities and perturb normal assembly, as examined with light scattering, polymer sedimentation, and negative stain electron microscopy. On the other hand, these ligands induce the cooperative assembly of nucleotide-devoid archaeal FtsZ into distinct well-ordered polymers, different from GTP-induced filaments. These FtsZ inhibitors impair localization of FtsZ into the Z-ring and inhibit bacterial cell division. The chlorinated analogue UCM53 inhibits the growth of clinical isolates of antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. We suggest that these interfacial inhibitors recapitulate binding and some assembly-inducing effects of GTP but impair the correct structural dynamics of FtsZ filaments and thus inhibit bacterial division, possibly by binding to a small fraction of the FtsZ molecules in a bacterial cell, which opens a new approach to FtsZ-based antibacterial drug discovery.
TI  - Characterization and application of enterocin RM6, a bacteriocin from Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Use of bacteriocins in food preservation has received great attention in recent years. The goal of this study is to characterize enterocin RM6 from Enterococcus faecalis OSY-RM6 and investigate its efficacy against Listeria monocytogenes in cottage cheese. Enterocin RM6 was purified from E. faecalis culture supernatant using ion exchange column, multiple C18-silica cartridges, followed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The molecular weight of enterocin RM6 is 7145.0823 as determined by mass spectrometry (MS). Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis revealed that enterocin RM6 is a 70-residue cyclic peptide with a head-to-tail linkage between methionine and tryptophan residues. The peptide sequence of enterocin RM6 was further confirmed by sequencing the structural gene of the peptide. Enterocin RM6 is active against Gram-positive bacteria, including L. monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Enterocin RM6 (final concentration in cottage cheese, 80 AU/mL) caused a 4-log reduction in population of L. monocytogenes inoculated in cottage cheese within 30 min of treatment. Therefore, enterocin RM6 has potential applications as a potent antimicrobial peptide against foodborne pathogens in food.
TI  - Multiplex identification of gram-positive bacteria and resistance determinants directly from positive blood culture broths: evaluation of an automated microarray-based nucleic acid test.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A multicenter study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of the Verigene Gram-Positive Blood Culture Test (BC-GP) test to identify 12 Gram-positive bacterial gene targets and three genetic resistance determinants directly from positive blood culture broths containing Gram-positive bacteria. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 1,252 blood cultures containing Gram-positive bacteria were prospectively collected and tested at five clinical centers between April, 2011 and January, 2012. An additional 387 contrived blood cultures containing uncommon targets (e.g., Listeria spp., S. lugdunensis, vanB-positive Enterococci) were included to fully evaluate the performance of the BC-GP test. Sensitivity and specificity for the 12 specific genus or species targets identified by the BC-GP test ranged from 92.6%-100% and 95.4%-100%, respectively. Identification of the mecA gene in 599 cultures containing S. aureus or S. epidermidis was 98.6% sensitive and 94.3% specific compared to cefoxitin disk method. Identification of the vanA gene in 81 cultures containing Enterococcus faecium or E. faecalis was 100% sensitive and specific. Approximately 7.5% (87/1,157) of single-organism cultures contained Gram-positive bacteria not present on the BC-GP test panel. In 95 cultures containing multiple organisms the BC-GP test was in 71.6% (68/95) agreement with culture results. Retrospective analysis of 107 separate blood cultures demonstrated that identification of methicillin resistant S. aureus and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus spp. was completed an average of 41.8 to 42.4 h earlier using the BC-GP test compared to routine culture methods. The BC-GP test was unable to assign mecA to a specific organism in cultures containing more than one Staphylococcus isolate and does not identify common blood culture contaminants such as Micrococcus, Corynebacterium, and Bacillus. CONCLUSIONS: The BC-GP test is a multiplex test capable of detecting most leading causes of Gram-positive bacterial blood stream infections as well as genetic markers of methicillin and vancomycin resistance directly from positive blood cultures.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a UV-stable bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS) produced by Enterococcus faecium strain DSH20 against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) strains.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The narrow spectrum of action of most bacteriocins is an important limitation for their application as antimicrobial agents. The current study describes a novel bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS) that display extended spectrum antimicrobial activity against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) strains. METHODS: Acquired resistance profiles of Enterococcus isolates determined based on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition as multidrug-resistant (MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR) and pandrug resistant (PDR). BLIS activity of Enterococcus isolates was investigated against Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) ATCC 29212 as the indicator strain and clinical isolates including VRE, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Gram-negative bacteria containing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, and Escherichia coli (E. coli). RESULTS: Among 273 Enterococcus isolates, 27 and 2 VRE isolates, respectively, were XDR and PDR and eight isolates had BLIS activity against the indicator strain. One of these isolates, identified as E. faecium strain DSH20 based on its phenotypical and biochemical properties, as well as its 16S rRNA gene sequence, had potent BLIS production against all 29 VRE strains, but had no activity against MRSA, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, and E. coli strains. It was heat stable up to 121 degrees C for 15 minutes (autoclave condition), active within the pH range of 3-9 and had UV stability, but its activity disappeared by treatment with proteinase K, pepsin, and trypsin, demonstrating its proteinaceous nature. It was designated as an approximately 35kDa peptide using the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) method. CONCLUSION: This peptide is a potential agent for use as an alternative antibacterial agent for the treatment of drug-resistant strains of VRE infection.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of unused, disposable non-sterile gloves on a hospital orthopaedic ward.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-sterile disposable gloves are used on large hospital wards, however their potential role as a vehicle for pathogen transmission has not been explored in this setting. AIMS: This study investigates glove use on a hospital orthopaedic ward to examine whether pathogen contamination occurs prior to contact with patients. METHOD: Glove samples were aseptically removed from boxes on a hospital orthopaedic ward on opening and days 3, 6 and 9 thereafter. Following elution of bacteria and viable counts, glove isolates were identified by standard techniques and 16s rDNA sequencing. Methicillin resistance of staphylococci was determined by disc diffusion, Epsilon tests and PCR. Gloves were inoculated to determine two isolate survival rates. RESULTS: Total bacterial counts ranged from 0 to 9.6 x 10(3) cfu/glove. Environmental bacteria, particularly Bacillus species, were present on 31/38 (81.6%) of samples. Half (19/38) the samples were contaminated with skin commensals; coagulase negative staphylococci were predominant. Enterococcus faecalis , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Pseudomonas sp. or methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus were recovered from 5/38 (13.2%) of samples. Significantly more skin commensals and pathogens were recovered from samples from days 3, 6, 9 than box-opening samples. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae inoculated onto gloves remained viable for several days but counts decreased. CONCLUSION: Health care workers introduced skin commensals and pathogenic bacteria into glove boxes indicating that unused, non-sterile gloves are potential pathogen transmission vehicles in hospitals. Findings highlight adherence to handwashing guidelines, common glove retrieval practice, and glove-box design as targets for decreasing bacteria transmission via gloves on hospital wards.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of actinomycetes isolated from different soil samples of Sheopur (A city of central India).
AB  - The main objective of the present study was isolation, purification, and characterization of actinomycetes from soil samples, having antimicrobial activity against 12 selected pathogenic strains. Soils samples were taken from different niche habitats of Sheopur district, Madhya Pradesh, India. These samples were serially diluted and plated on actinomycete isolation agar media. Potential colonies were screened, purified, and stored in glycerol stock. Isolates were morphologically and biochemically characterized. These isolates were subjected to extraction for production of the antibacterial compound. Antibacterial activity and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the purified extract of isolates were evaluated. Totally 31 actinomycete isolates were tested for antagonistic activity against 12 pathogenic microorganisms. Isolates AS14, AS27, and AS28 were highly active, while AS1 showed less activity against the pathogenic microorganisms. Isolate AS7 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity against Bacillus cereus (24 mm) and AS16 showed the highest activity against Enterococcus faecalis (21 mm). MIC was also determined for actinomycete isolates against all the tested microorganisms. MIC of actinomycete isolates was found to be 2.5 mg/ml against Shigella dysenteriae, Vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and was 1.25 mg/ml for Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus xylosus, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. All actinomycetes isolates showed antibacterial activity against S. aureus, while they showed less activity against S. dysenteriae. These isolates had antibacterial activity and could be used in the development of new antibiotics for pharmaceutical or agricultural purposes.
TI  - Lysins: the arrival of pathogen-directed anti-infectives.
AB  - Lysins represent a novel class of anti-infectives derived from bacteriophage. Lysins are bacterial cell-wall hydrolytic enzymes that selectively and rapidly kill (>/=3 log c.f.u. in 30 min) specific Gram-positive bacteria providing a targeted therapeutic approach with minimal impact on unrelated commensal flora. The potential for bacterial resistance to lysins is considered low due to targeting of highly conserved peptidoglycan components. Through cutting-edge genetic engineering, lysins can be assembled into large libraries of anti-infective agents tailored to any bacterium of interest including drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens such as meticillin- and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Lysins can eliminate bacteria systemically and topically from mucosal surfaces and biofilms, as evidenced by experimental models of sepsis, endocarditis, pneumonia, meningitis, and nasopharyngeal, skin and vaginal decolonization. Furthermore, lysins can act synergistically with antibiotics and, in the process, resensitize bacteria to non-susceptible antibiotics. Clinical trials are being prepared to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic properties of lysins in humans.
TI  - Resistance mechanisms and epidemiology of multiresistant pathogens in Europe and  efficacy of tigecycline in observational studies.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial drug resistance is a growing problem in Europe and, even with differences in epidemiology, it is of great concern. The treatment of complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTIs) and complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs) is hindered further by pathogens that are resistant to methicillin, carbapenems, third-generation cephalosporins and glycopeptides. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An analysis of the microbiological results from five European observational studies (July 2006 to October 2011) evaluating the efficacy of tigecycline (prescribed as monotherapy or in combination with other antibacterials) for the treatment of cSSTI and cIAI is presented. RESULTS: In total, 213 cSSTI and 623 cIAI patients were included; 34.4% and 56.6%, respectively, were critically ill in intensive care units. At baseline, at least one pathogen was isolated in 167 (78.4%) cSSTI and 464 (74.5%) cIAI patients, and 32.9% and 49.1% of infections were polymicrobial. In cSSTI, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (52.7% and 18.0%, respectively) were the most frequently isolated pathogens, whereas in cIAI most infections were due to E. coli (41.8%), Enterococcus faecium (40.1%) and Enterococcus faecalis (21.1%). Clinical response was observed in >80% of patients with E. coli in both cIAI and cSSTI. In cSSTI patients, the clinical response rate to S. aureus was 80.8%. For cIAI, 77.4% of E. faecium and 79.5% of E. faecalis patients responded to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Tigecycline when given alone or in combination with other antibacterials appeared to be efficacious against multiple pathogens, affirming its role in real-life clinical practice as a broad-spectrum antibacterial for the treatment of patients with cSSTI and cIAI, including the critically ill, across Europe.
TI  - Quantitative detection of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in human oral epithelial cells from subjects with periodontitis and periodontal health.
AB  - Epithelial cells in oral cavities can be considered reservoirs for a variety of bacterial species. A polymicrobial intracellular flora associated with periodontal disease has been demonstrated in buccal cells. Important aetiological agents of systemic and nosocomial infections have been detected in the microbiota of subgingival biofilm, especially in individuals with periodontal disease. However, non-oral pathogens internalized in oral epithelial cells and their relationship with periodontal status are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to detect opportunistic species within buccal and gingival crevice epithelial cells collected from subjects with periodontitis or individuals with good periodontal health, and to associate their prevalence with periodontal clinical status. Quantitative detection of total bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis in oral epithelial cells was determined by quantitative real-time PCR using universal and species-specific primer sets. Intracellular bacteria were visualized by confocal microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Overall, 33% of cell samples from patients with periodontitis contained at least one opportunistic species, compared with 15% of samples from healthy individuals. E. faecalis was the most prevalent species found in oral epithelial cells (detected in 20.6% of patients with periodontitis, P = 0.03 versus healthy individuals) and was detected only in cells from patients with periodontitis. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that high levels of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus were present in both the periodontitis and healthy groups. However, the proportion of these species was significantly higher in epithelial cells of subjects with periodontitis compared with healthy individuals (P = 0.016 for P. aeruginosa and P = 0.047 for S. aureus). Although E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa were detected in 57% and 50% of patients, respectively, with probing depth and clinical attachment level >/=6 mm, no correlation was found with age, sex, bleeding on probing or the presence of supragingival biofilm. The prevalence of these pathogens in epithelial cells is correlated with the state of periodontal disease.
TI  - Impact of chlorine dioxide gas sterilization on nosocomial organism viability in  a hospital room.
AB  - To evaluate the ability of ClO2 to decontaminate pathogens known to cause healthcare-associated infections in a hospital room strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Staphylococcus aureus were spot placed in duplicate pairs at 10 sites throughout a hospital room and then exposed to ClO2 gas. Organisms were collected and evaluated for reduction in colony forming units following gas exposure. Six sterilization cycles with varied gas concentrations, exposure limits, and relative humidity levels were conducted. Reductions in viable organisms achieved ranged from 7 to 10-log reductions. Two sterilization cycles failed to produce complete inactivation of organisms placed in a bathroom with the door closed. Reductions of organisms in the bathroom ranged from 6-log to 10-log reductions. Gas leakage between hospital floors did not occur; however, some minor gas leakage from the door of hospital room was measured which was subsequently sealed to prevent further leakage. Novel technologies for disinfection of hospital rooms require validation and safety testing in clinical environments. Gaseous ClO2 is effective for sterilizing environmental contamination in a hospital room. Concentrations of ClO2 up to 385 ppm were safely maintained in a hospital room with enhanced environmental controls.
TI  - Human colonic mucus is a reservoir for antimicrobial peptides.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To prevent bacterial adherence and translocation, the colonic mucosa is covered by a protecting mucus layer and the epithelium synthesizes antimicrobial peptides. The present qualitative study investigated the contents and interaction of these peptides in and with rectal mucus. METHODS: Rectal mucus extracts were analyzed for antimicrobial activity and screened with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, Dot blot and immunohistochemistry for antimicrobial peptides. In addition, binding of AMPs to mucins was investigated by Western blot and enzyme-linked lectin assays. RESULTS: In functional tests the mucus layer exhibited a strong antimicrobial activity. We detected 11 antimicrobial peptides in mucus extracts from healthy persons including the defensins HBD-1 and -3, the cathelicidin LL-37, ubiquitin, lysozyme, histones, high mobility group nucleosome-binding domain-containing protein 2, ubiquicidin and other ribosomal proteins. AMPs were bound by mucins but this was demonstrated to be reversible and inhibition of antibacterial activity was limited. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that epithelial antimicrobial peptides are retained in the intestinal mucus layer without losing their efficacy. Thus, the mucus layer and its composition provide an attractive drug target to restore antimicrobial barrier function in intestinal diseases.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of lapachol and its thiosemicarbazone and semicarbazone derivatives.
AB  - Lapachol was chemically modified to obtain its thiosemicarbazone and semicarbazone derivatives. These compounds were tested for antimicrobial activity against several bacteria and fungi by the broth microdilution method. The thiosemicarbazone and semicarbazone derivatives of lapachol exhibited antimicrobial activity against the bacteria Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.05 and 0.10 micromol/mL, respectively. The thiosemicarbazone and semicarbazone derivatives were also active against the pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus gattii (MICs of 0.10 and 0.20 micromol/mL, respectively). In addition, the lapachol thiosemicarbazone derivative was active against 11 clinical isolates of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, with MICs ranging from 0.01-0.10 micromol/mL. The lapachol-derived thiosemicarbazone was not cytotoxic to normal cells at the concentrations that were active against fungi and bacteria. We synthesised, for the first time, thiosemicarbazone and semicarbazone derivatives of lapachol. The MICs for the lapachol-derived thiosemicarbazone against S. aureus, E. faecalis, C. gattii and several isolates of P. brasiliensis indicated that this compound has the potential to be developed into novel drugs to treat infections caused these microbes.
TI  - The agr locus regulates virulence and colonization genes in Clostridium difficile 027.
AB  - The transcriptional regulator AgrA, a member of the LytTR family of proteins, plays a key role in controlling gene expression in some Gram-positive pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. AgrA is encoded by the agrACDB global regulatory locus, and orthologues are found within the genome of most Clostridium difficile isolates, including the epidemic lineage 027/BI/NAP1. Comparative RNA sequencing of the wild type and otherwise isogenic agrA null mutant derivatives of C. difficile R20291 revealed a network of approximately 75 differentially regulated transcripts at late exponential growth phase, including many genes associated with flagellar assembly and function, such as the major structural subunit, FliC. Other differentially regulated genes include several involved in bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) synthesis and toxin A expression. C. difficile 027 R20291 agrA mutant derivatives were poorly flagellated and exhibited reduced levels of colonization and relapses in the murine infection model. Thus, the agr locus likely plays a contributory role in the fitness and virulence potential of C. difficile strains in the 027/BI/NAP1 lineage.
TI  - Photodynamic effect of hypericin on the microorganisms and primary human fibroblasts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypericin (HYP) is a natural photosensitizer considered for the new generation of photodynamic therapy (PDT) drugs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro bactericidal effect of HYP-PDT on four bacterial species, assessing its photocytotoxicity to primary human fibroblasts to determine possible side effects. METHODS: Effect of photosensitizer concentration (0.1, 0.3, 0.6, and 1 mug/ml) and light irradiation time (3, 5, 10 min) on photodynamic inactivation of microorganisms and primary human fibroblasts was investigated. RESULTS: A 6.3 log killing was obtained for Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) treated with 1 mug/ml at 48 J/cm(2). For this set of PDT parameters, Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 11700) showed 6.5 log killing, Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) 6.2 log killing, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) 0.7 log killing. Fibroblasts can be preserved by keeping the HYP concentration below 0.6 mug/ml and the light dose below 48 J/cm(2). CONCLUSION: S. aureus, E. faecalis, and E. coli appear to be suitable for treatment with HYP-PDT without significant damage to fibroblasts.
TI  - Performance of the Vitek MS matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry system for identification of Gram-positive cocci routinely isolated in clinical microbiology laboratories.
AB  - We evaluated the performance of the Vitek MS for identification of Gram-positive  cocci routinely isolated in clinical microbiology laboratories. With a total of 424 well-characterized isolates, the results of the Vitek MS were compared to those of conventional methods and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The Vitek MS correctly identified 97.9 % of the isolates tested to species level. The Vitek MS correctly identified the species of 97.2 % of the staphylococci (95.9 % of coagulase-negative staphylococci), 97.8 % of the streptococci, and 100 % of the enterococci. For the identification of Gram-positive cocci isolates, the overall concordance rate between conventional identification and the Vitek MS was 94.5 %. The Vitek MS matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) system can be a reliable and rapid method for the identification of most relevant Gram-positive cocci. In addition, expanding the database of the Vitek MS, especially for coagulase-negative staphylococci, is needed to enhance the performance of the Vitek MS.
TI  - Preparation, characterization and antibacterial activity of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) electrospun fibers loaded with amoxicillin for controlled release in biomedical applications.
AB  - Amoxicillin (AMOX) was successfully encapsulated at different concentrations into poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) by the electrospinning technique, and mats of non-woven fibers were obtained and characterized in terms of morphology, in vitro release and antibacterial properties. The scanning electron microscopy evidenced the nanofibrous structure of the pristine PCL, composed of individual, uniform, and randomly oriented fibres with an average diameter ranging around 0.8 micron. The addition of amoxicillin at different concentrations (3, 5 and 7 wt%) did not evidence change in the fiber morphology. The release curves, for all samples, present mainly two stages: a first stage, quick as a "burst," is followed by a second slow stage. The burst was analyzed as a function of amoxicillin concentration and thickness of the membranes, and values corresponding to absence of burst were individuated. In the second stage the release was found very slow extending up to months for the most concentrated sample. The antibacterial activity of the electrospun fibers was effective to inhibit in different proportions Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. The properties of the filled membranes and their capability for local delivery of antibiotics make them suitable for biomedical applications.
TI  - Antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, and phenolic compounds of selected Inula species from Turkey.
AB  - Three Inula species, I. viscosa, I. helenium ssp. turcoracemosa and I. montbretiana, collected from different locations of Anatolia were investigated for their antioxidant and antimicrobial potential, and their total phenolic content and phenolic composition. Antioxidant activities of various extracts of the plant parts were measured using DPPH radical scavenging and ABTS assays. Antimicrobial potential of methanol extracts of the plant parts was determined by the agar dilution method against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis. All the extracts were more active against Gram-positive bacteria and yeasts than Gram-negative bacteria. The extracts exhibited antioxidant and antimicrobial activities in different concentrations. Total phenolic concentration of the extracts was estimated with Folin-Ciocalteu reagent using gallic acid as standard. The total phenolic content varied widely in different parts of the three tested Inula species, ranging from 21.1 +/- 0.8 to 190.9 +/- 6.1 mg GAE/g extract. Phenolic components, such as chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, myricetin, quercetin, luteolin and kaempferol were quantified by HPLC-DAD in the methanol extracts of the Inula species. It was obvious that the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of the plants were due to the phenolics.
TI  - Candida albicans mucin Msb2 is a broad-range protectant against antimicrobial peptides.
AB  - The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans releases a large glycofragment of the  Msb2 surface protein (Msb2*) into the growth environment, which protects against the action of human antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) LL-37 and histatin-5. Quantitation of Msb2*/LL-37 interactions by microscale thermophoresis revealed high-affinity binding (dissociation constant [KD] = 73 nM), which was lost or greatly diminished by lack of O-glycosylation or by Msb2* denaturation. Msb2* also interacted with human alpha- and beta-defensins and protected C. albicans against these AMPs. In addition, the lipopeptide antibiotic daptomycin was bound and inactivated by Msb2*, which prevented the killing of bacterial pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum. In coculturings or mixed biofilms of S. aureus with C. albicans wild-type but not msb2 mutant strains, the protective effects of Msb2* on the bactericidal action of daptomycin were demonstrated. These results suggest that tight binding of shed Msb2* to AMPs that occurs during bacterial coinfections with C. albicans compromises antibacterial therapy by inactivating a relevant reserve antibiotic.
TI  - Internalisation potential of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus in lettuce seedlings and mature plants.
AB  - The internalisation potential of Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium in lettuce was evaluated using seedlings grown in vermiculite in seedling trays as well as hydroponically grown lettuce. Sterile distilled water was spiked with one of the four human pathogenic bacteria (10(5) CFU/mL) and used to irrigate the plants. The potential for pathogen internalisation was investigated over time using light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and viable plate counts. Additionally, the identities of the pathogens isolated from internal lettuce plant tissues were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction with pathogen-specific oligonucleotides. Internalisation of each of the human pathogens was evident in both lettuce seedlings and hydroponically grown mature lettuce plants. To our knowledge, this is the first report of S. aureus internalisation in lettuce plants. In addition, the levels of background microflora in the lettuce plants were determined by plate counting and the isolates identified using matrix-assisted laser ionisation-time of flight (MALDI-TOF). Background microflora assessments confirmed the absence of the four pathogens evaluated in this study. A low titre of previously described endophytes and soil inhabitants, i.e., Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Lysinibacillus fusiformis, Rhodococcus rhodochrous, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus hominis were identified.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in human chronic periodontitis microbiota.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic periodontitis (CP) may yield multiple species of putative periodontal bacterial pathogens that vary in their antibiotic drug susceptibility. This study determines the occurrence of in vitro antibiotic resistance among selected subgingival periodontal pathogens in patients with CP. METHODS: Subgingival biofilm specimens from inflamed deep periodontal pockets were removed before treatment from 400 adults with CP in the United States. The samples were cultured, and selected periodontal pathogens were tested in vitro for susceptibility to amoxicillin at 8 mg/L, clindamycin at 4 mg/L, doxycycline at 4 mg/L, and metronidazole at 16 mg/L, with a post hoc combination of data for amoxicillin and metronidazole. Gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads were subjected to ciprofloxacin disk-diffusion testing. RESULTS: Overall, 74.2% of the patients with CP revealed subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to at least one of the test antibiotics. One or more test species, most often Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, Streptococcus constellatus, or Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were resistant in vitro to doxycycline, amoxicillin, metronidazole, or clindamycin, in 55%, 43.3%, 30.3%, and 26.5% of the patients with CP, respectively. Fifteen percent of patients harbored subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to both amoxicillin and metronidazole, which were mostly either S. constellatus (45 individuals) or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains of Gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads (nine individuals). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CP in the United States frequently yielded subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant in vitro to therapeutic concentrations of antibiotics commonly used in clinical periodontal practice. The wide variability found in periodontal pathogen antibiotic-resistance patterns should concern clinicians empirically selecting antibiotic treatment regimens for patients with CP.
TI  - Sequences of metanicins, 20-residue peptaibols from the ascomycetous fungus CBS 597.80.
AB  - Four linear 20-residue peptaibols, named metanicins (MTCs) A-D, were isolated from submerged cultures of the ascomycetous fungus CBS 597.80. Structure elucidation was performed by a combination of fast-atom-bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS), electrospray ionization MS, Edman degradation of isolated fragments, and amino acid analysis by ion-exchange and gas chromatography, and enantioselective HPLC. The sequences of MTC A(B) are (amino acid exchange in B and C in parentheses): Ac-Aib-Ala-Aib-Ala-Aib-Ala-Gln-Aib-Val-Aib-Gly-Leu-Aib-Pro-Val-Aib-Aib(D-Iva)-Gln -Gln-Pheol and of MTC C(D) Ac-Aib-Ala-Aib-Ala-Aib-Ala-Gln-Aib-Val-Aib-Gly-Leu-Aib-Pro-Val-Aib-Aib(D-Iva)-Gln -Gln-Pheol (Ac, acetyl; Aib, alpha-aminoisobutyric acid; Iva, isovaline; Pheol, L-phenylalaninol). The peptides are related, and some of the sequences are identical, to other 20-residue peptaibols isolated from Trichoderma species. MTCs show moderate activities against Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, and very low activities against Bacillus subtilis. The producer has originally been identified and deposited as Metarhizium anisopliae var. anisopliae CBS 597.80. Although this identification has been withdrawn by Centralbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS) in the meantime, the accession number will be retained - independently from any taxonomic revisions.
TI  - Anti-infective potential of marine invertebrates and seaweeds from the Brazilian  coast.
AB  - This manuscript describes the evaluation of anti-infective potential in vitro of  organic extracts from nine sponges, one ascidian, two octocorals, one bryozoan, and 27 seaweed species collected along the Brazilian coast. Antimicrobial activity was tested against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Candida albicans (ATCC 10231) by the disk diffusion method. Antiprotozoal activity was evaluated against Leishmania braziliensis (MHOM/BR/96/LSC96-H3) promastigotes and Trypanosoma cruzi (MHOM/BR/00/Y) epimastigotes by MTT assay. Activity against intracellular amastigotes of T. cruzi and L. brasiliensis in murine macrophages was also evaluated. Antiviral activity was tested against Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 (HSV-1, KOS strain) by the plaque number reduction assay (IC(5)(0)). Cytotoxicity on VERO cells was evaluated by the MTT assay (CC(5)(0)). The results were expressed as SI = CC(5)(0)/IC(5)(0). The most promising antimicrobial results were obtained against S. aureus and C. albicans with Dragmacidon reticulatum. Among the seaweeds, only Osmundaria obtusiloba showed moderate activity against P. aeruginosa. Concerning antiprotozoal activity, Bugula neritina, Carijoa riseii, Dragmaxia anomala and Haliclona (Halichoclona) sp. showed the most interesting results, mainly against extracellular promastigote forms of L. braziliensis (66, 35.9, 97.2, and 43.6% inhibition, respectively). Moreover, six species of seaweeds Anadyomene saldanhae, Caulerpa cupressoides, Canistrocarpus cervicornis, Dictyota sp., Ochtodes secundiramea, and Padina sp. showed promising results against L. braziliensis (87.9, 51.7, 85.9, 93.3, 99.7, and 80.9% inhibition, respectively), and only Dictyota sp. was effective against T. cruzi (60.4% inhibition). Finally, the antiherpes activity was also evaluated, with Haliclona (Halichoclona) sp. and Petromica citrina showing the best results (SI = 11.9 and SI > 5, respectively). All the active extracts deserve special attention in further studies to chemically characterize the bioactive compounds, and to perform more refined biological assays.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among Gram-positive organisms collected from pediatric patients globally between 2004 and 2011: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) was designed to monitor  global longitudinal changes in bacterial susceptibility to a panel of antimicrobial agents, including tigecycline. In this study, we examine susceptibility among Gram-positive isolates collected from pediatric patients globally between 2004 and 2011. A total of 9,422 Gram-positive isolates were contributed by 1,255 centers, predominantly from Europe and North America. One-third of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were methicillin resistant, peaking in prevalence in 2007. All S. aureus isolates (n = 3,614) were susceptible to linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin; minocycline, imipenem, and meropenem were also highly active (>92% susceptibility). Ampicillin and penicillin susceptibility increased significantly during the study period (P < 0.0001 for both). Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (n = 3,373) were highly susceptible to vancomycin (100%), linezolid (>99%), and levofloxacin and tigecycline (both >96%); imipenem susceptibility was low (32%) in Africa while minocycline susceptibility was low in Asia-Pacific Rim (38%). Penicillin resistance occurred in one-fifth of all S. pneumoniae isolates, with penicillin susceptibility ranging from 14% in Africa to 65% in Europe. Streptococcus agalactiae isolates (n = 1,056) were highly susceptible to most antimicrobials, although only 16% were susceptible to minocycline. Enterococcus faecalis isolates (n = 1,112) were highly susceptible (>97%) to ampicillin, linezolid, penicillin, tigecycline, and vancomycin globally, but only 34% were minocycline susceptible; minocycline susceptibility decreased significantly from 2004 to 2011 (P < 0.001). Tigecycline and linezolid were highly active against Enterococcus faecium (n = 267) globally (100% and 98% susceptible, respectively). Tigecycline and linezolid were highly active against Gram-positive pathogens from pediatric patients in TEST 2004 to 2011, with vancomycin and the carbapenems performing well against most pathogens.
TI  - Volatile metabolites of pathogens: a systematic review.
AB  - Ideally, invading bacteria are detected as early as possible in critically ill patients: the strain of morbific pathogens is identified rapidly, and antimicrobial sensitivity is known well before the start of new antimicrobial therapy. Bacteria have a distinct metabolism, part of which results in the production of bacteria-specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which might be used for diagnostic purposes. Volatile metabolites can be investigated directly in exhaled air, allowing for noninvasive monitoring. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of VOCs produced by the six most abundant and pathogenic bacteria in sepsis, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. Such VOCs could be used as biological markers in the diagnostic approach of critically ill patients. A systematic review of existing literature revealed 31 articles. All six bacteria of interest produce isopentanol, formaldehyde, methyl mercaptan, and trimethylamine. Since humans do not produce these VOCs, they could serve as biological markers for presence of these pathogens. The following volatile biomarkers were found for identification of specific strains: isovaleric acid and 2-methyl-butanal for Staphylococcus aureus; 1-undecene, 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptane, 2-butanone, 4-methyl-quinazoline, hydrogen cyanide, and methyl thiocyanide for Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and methanol, pentanol, ethyl acetate, and indole for Escherichia coli. Notably, several factors that may effect VOC production were not controlled for, including used culture media, bacterial growth phase, and genomic variation within bacterial strains. In conclusion, VOCs produced by bacteria may serve as biological markers for their presence. Goal-targeted studies should be performed to identify potential sets of volatile biological markers and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of these markers in critically ill patients.
TI  - Etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial pathogens from urinary tract infection.
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common infection in both community and  hospital patients. In majority of the cases, empirical antimicrobial treatment is practiced before the laboratory results of urine culture. Thus, antibiotic resistance may increase in urinary bacterial pathogens due to improper use of drugs. This study was designed to find out the etiological agents of UTI and their prevalence, and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the bacterial pathogens isolated from urine culture. This study was conducted in Kathmandu Model Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal from April to October, 2009. Midstream Urine samples from 1323 patients suspected of UTI were analyzed by microscopy, and conventional semi-quantitative culture technique for the significant growth. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed for the isolates by Modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Data were analyzed using SPSS software window version 16. The overall prevalence of UTI was found to be 18.89%. The most frequent causative organisms isolated were Escherichia coli (82.30%), Enterococcus faecalis (5.60%), Citrobacter freundii (3.60%), Enterobacter aerogenes (2.40%), Coagulase Negative Staphylococci (2.40%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.20%), Proteus mirabilis (0.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.4%), and Staphylococcus aureus (0.4%). Nitrofurantoin and Amoxycillin were found to be the most effective antibiotic against gram negative and gram positive isolates respectively. E. coli was found to be the most common etiological agent of UTI and Nitrofurantoin was the most effective drug among the isolates.
TI  - New antibacterial germacrene from Verbesina negrensis.
AB  - Several health benefits have been attributed to members of the Verbesina genus, including promotion of urinary and gastrointestinal health. Verbesina species are also reported to exhibit antibacterial, antiparasitic, and antioxidant activities. Although members of the Verbesina genus produce various pharmacologically relevant chemicals as secondary metabolites, including eudesmanes, flavonoids, guanidine alkaloids, acetylenic compounds, and germacrenes, the active compounds required for these benefits remain unknown. To investigate potential antimicrobial activities of Verbesina negrensis, crude extracts from plant aerial structures were evaluated. Following chemical fractionation, the chloroformic extract from Verbesina negrensis was subjected to bioassay-guided isolation using disk diffusion assays to determine antimicrobial activity. The active compound was characterized as 6beta-cinnamoyloxy-1beta-hydroxy-10alpha-metoxy-3-oxo-germacra-4,5Z-ene (1). Fractions containing 1 inhibited both Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29 212) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213). The MIC for 1 was determined by microbroth dilution assay to be 64 microg/mL for both E. faecalis and S. aureus.
TI  - Prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria from milkmen and cows with clinical mastitis in and around Kampala, Uganda.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Identification of pathogens associated with bovine mastitis is helpful in treatment and management decisions. However, such data from sub-Saharan Africa is scarce. Here we describe the distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria from cows with clinical mastitis in Kampala, Uganda. Due to high concern of zoonotic infections, isolates from milkmen are also described. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Ninety seven milk samples from cows with clinical mastitis and 31 nasal swabs from milkmen were collected (one sample per cow/human). Fifty eight (60%) Gram-positive isolates namely Staphylococci (21), Enterococci (16), Streptococci (13), Lactococci (5), Micrococci (2) and Arcanobacteria (1) were detected in cows; only one grew Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, 24 (25%) coliforms namely Escherichia coli (12), Klebsiella oxytoca (5), Proteus vulgaris (2), Serratia (2), Citrobacter (1), Cedecea (1) and Leclercia (1) were identified. From humans, 24 Gram-positive bacteria grew, of which 11 were Staphylococci (35%) including four Staphylococcus aureus. Upon susceptibility testing, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were prevalent; 57%, 12/21 in cows and 64%, 7/11 in humans. However, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was not detected. Furthermore, methicillin and vancomycin resistant CoNS were detected in cows (Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus lugdunensis) and humans (Staphylococcus scuiri). Also, vancomycin and daptomycin resistant Enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, respectively) were detected in cows. Coliforms were less resistant with three pan-susceptible isolates. However, multidrug resistant Klebsiella, Proteus, Serratia, Cedecea, and Citrobacter were detected. Lastly, similar species grew from human and bovine samples but on genotyping, the isolates were found to be different. Interestingly, human and bovine Staphylococcus aureus were genetically similar (spa-CC435, spa-type t645 corresponding to ST121) but with different susceptibility patterns. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: CoNS, Enterococci, Streptococci, and Escherichia coli are the predominant pathogens associated with clinical bovine-mastitis in Kampala, Uganda. Multidrug resistant bacteria are also prevalent. While similar species occurred in humans and cows, transmission was not detected.
TI  - Evaluation of pharmacological activities, cytotoxicity and phenolic composition of four Maytenus species used in southern African traditional medicine to treat intestinal infections and diarrhoeal diseases.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microbial infections and resulting inflammation and oxidative stress  are common pathogenesis of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) disorders. In South Africa, several species of the genus Maytenus are used in traditional medicine to treat various infectious diseases. Most of the previous work on this genus was focused on nonpolar extracts from the root and bark. In this study, leaf extracts of polar extracts of Maytenus peduncularis, Maytenus procumbens, Maytenus senegalensis and Maytenus undata were evaluated for antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities to determine their efficacy as therapeutic agents in GIT disorders. METHODS: Phenolic-enriched leaf extracts and fractions were prepared by extracting with acidified 70% methanol and solvent-solvent fractionation. The activities of the fractions against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis as well as clinical isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans were determined using a serial microplate dilution method. Antioxidant activities were determined using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS), hydroxyl (OH) radical scavenging and linoleic acid peroxidation inhibitory assays. The phenolic composition as well as the cytotoxicity against Vero cell lines of the crude extracts was evaluated using various standard protocols. RESULTS: The antimicrobial activities were concentrated in the non-polar fractions of hexane, dichloromethane and ethyl acetate (MICs 19-312 mug/ml). The crude extracts and polar fractions (butanol and water) had moderate to poor antimicrobial activity (MICs 312 to above 2500 mug/ml). The crude extracts and polar fractions had good antioxidant activity (EC50 values varied from 1.22 to 607 mug/ml, 1.71 to 312 mug/ml and 23 to 284 mug/ml for DPPH, ABTS and OH respectively. Linoleic acid peroxidation inhibition EC50 values of the crude extracts ranged between 27 and 39 mug/ml with relatively low toxicity against Vero cell lines (IC50 values 87 to 187 mug/ml). Fractionation of a crude extract with low activity could lead to fractions with more potent activity. CONCLUSION: This study justifies the traditional use of leaf crude extracts and fractions from these four plants to remedy gastrointestinal disorders resulting from infection, inflammation and oxidative stress complications. The study also provides rationale for the use of leaf extracts with same beneficial effects in place of unsustainable root and bark harvest.

TI  - High-throughput screening of inhibitors targeting Agr/Fsr quorum sensing in Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis employ cyclic peptide-mediated quorum sensing (QS) systems, termed agr and fsr respectively, to regulate the expression of a series of virulence genes. To identify quorum sensing inhibitors (QSIs) that target agr/fsr systems, an efficient screening system was established. In addition to the gelatinase-induction assay to examine E. faecalis fsr QS, the use of an S. aureus agr reporter strain that carries luciferase and green fluorescence protein genes under the agr P3 promoter facilitated the development of a high-throughput screen (HTS) for QSIs. As a result of screening of 906 actinomycetes culture extracts, four showed QSI activity against the agr and fsr systems without growth inhibitory activity. The extracts were purified on a small scale, and three HPLC peaks were obtained with obvious QSI activity. In sum, the established HTS system is a promising strategy for the discovery of anti-pathogenic agents targeting cyclic peptide-mediated QS in Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Analysis of the tolerance of pathogenic enterococci and Staphylococcus aureus to  cell wall active antibiotics.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Tolerance refers to the phenomenon that bacteria do not significantly die when exposed to bactericidal antibiotics. Enterococci are known for their high tolerance to these drugs, but the molecular reasons why they resist killing are not understood. In a previous study we showed that the superoxide dismutase (SOD) is implicated in this tolerance. This conclusion was based on the results obtained with one particular strain of Enterococcus faecalis and therefore the objective of the present communication was to analyse whether dependence of tolerance on active SOD is a general phenomenon for enterococci and another Gram-positive pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS: Mutants deficient in SOD activity were constructed in pathogenic enterococci. The wild-type sodA gene was cloned into an expression vector and transformed into SOD-deficient strains for complementation with varying levels of SOD activity. Previously constructed SOD-deficient strains of S. aureus were also included in this study. Tolerance to vancomycin and penicillin was then tested. RESULTS: We demonstrated that the dependence on SOD of tolerance to vancomycin and penicillin is a common trait of antibiotic-susceptible pathogenic enterococci. By varying the levels of expression we could also show that tolerance to vancomycin is directly correlated to SOD activity. Interestingly, deletion of the sodA gene in a non-tolerant Enterococcus faecium strain did not further sensitize the mutant to bactericidal antibiotics. Finally, we showed that the SOD enzymes of S. aureus are also implicated in tolerance to vancomycin. CONCLUSION: High tolerance of enterococci to cell wall active antibiotics can be reversed by SOD deficiency.
TI  - Redox balance via lactate dehydrogenase is important for multiple stress resistance and virulence in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis is a highly stress resistant opportunistic pathogen. The intrinsic ruggedness of this bacterium is supposed to be the basis of its capacity to colonize the hostile environments of hospitals and to cause several kinds of infections. We show in this work that general resistance to very different environmental stresses depends on the ability of E. faecalis to maintain redox balance via lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Furthermore, LDH-deficient mutants are less successful than the wild type at colonizing host organs in a murine model of systemic infection. Taken together, our results, as well as those previously published for Staphylococcus aureus (A. R. Richardson, S. J. Libby, and F. C. Fang, Science 319:1672-1676, 2008), identify LDH as an attractive drug target. These drugs may have additional applications, as in the fight against glycopeptide antibiotic-resistant bacteria and even cancer.
TI  - Bloodstream infections in patients with or without cancer in a large community hospital.
AB  - PURPOSE: Cancer is associated with an increased risk of acquiring bloodstream infection (BSIs). Most knowledge on pathogens and outcome are derived from specialised cancer centres. We here sought to compare causative micro-organisms in BSIs in patients with or without cancer in a 600-bed teaching community hospital. METHODS: We analysed all positive blood cultures from adult patients between January 2005 and January 2011. RESULTS: A total of 4,918 episodes of BSI occurred in 2,891 patients, of whom 13.4% had a diagnosis of cancer (85.5% with a solid tumour). In both patient groups, Gram-positive isolates were more prevalent (58.7 and 61.4% in patients with and without cancer, respectively) than Gram-negative isolates (31.8 and 32.3%, respectively). Amongst Gram-positive organisms, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci were the most frequently isolated in both patient groups; in cancer patients, twice as many BSIs were caused by Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. Amongst Gram-negative organisms, Escherichia coli was the most common isolate; in cancer patients, twice as many BSIs were caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae. Yeasts were grown from 3.0% of blood cultures from cancer patients compared to 1.5% of cultures from non-cancer patients. Cancer patients had a 90-day mortality of 35.8% following BSI compared to 23.5% in patients without cancer. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate distinct BSI pathogens and impaired outcomes in patients with cancer in the setting of a large community teaching hospital.
TI  - Interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing practices for hospital inpatients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The first publication of this review in Issue 3, 2005 included studies up to November 2003. This update adds studies to December 2006 and focuses on application of a new method for meta-analysis of interrupted time series studies and application of new Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Risk of Bias criteria to all studies in the review, including those studies in the previously published version. The aim of the review is to evaluate the impact of interventions from the perspective of antibiotic stewardship. The two objectives of antibiotic stewardship are first to ensure effective treatment for patients with bacterial infection and second support professionals and patients to reduce unnecessary use and minimize collateral damage. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the effectiveness of professional interventions that, alone or in combination, are effective in antibiotic stewardship for hospital inpatients, to evaluate the impact of these interventions on reducing the incidence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens or Clostridium difficile infection and their impact on clinical outcome. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE from 1980 to December 2006 and the EPOC specialized register in July 2007 and February 2009 and bibliographies of retrieved articles. The main comparison is between interventions that had a restrictive element and those that were purely persuasive. Restrictive interventions were implemented through restriction of the freedom of prescribers to select some antibiotics. Persuasive interventions used one or more of the following methods for changing professional behaviour: dissemination of educational resources, reminders, audit and feedback, or educational outreach. Restrictive interventions could contain persuasive elements. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized clinical trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCT), controlled before-after (CBA) and interrupted time series studies (ITS). Interventions included any professional or structural interventions as defined by EPOC. The intervention had to include a component that aimed to improve antibiotic prescribing to hospital inpatients, either by increasing effective treatment or by reducing unnecessary treatment. The results had to include interpretable data about the effect of the intervention on antibiotic prescribing or microbial outcomes or relevant clinical outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors extracted data and assessed quality. We performed meta-regression of ITS studies to compare the results of persuasive and restrictive interventions. Persuasive interventions advised physicians about how to prescribe or gave them feedback about how they prescribed. Restrictive interventions put a limit on how they prescribed; for example, physicians had to have approval from an infection specialist in order to prescribe an antibiotic. We standardized the results of some ITS studies so that they are on the same scale (percent change in outcome), thereby facilitating comparisons of different interventions. To do this, we used the change in level and change in slope to estimate the effect size with increasing time after the intervention (one month, six months, one year, etc) as the percent change in level at each time point. We did not extrapolate beyond the end of data collection after the intervention. The meta-regression was performed using standard weighted linear regression with the standard errors of the coefficients adjusted where necessary. MAIN RESULTS: For this update we included 89 studies that reported 95 interventions. Of the 89 studies, 56 were ITSs (of which 4 were controlled ITSs), 25 were RCT (of which 5 were cluster-RCTs), 5 were CBAs and 3 were CCTs (of which 1 was a cluster-CCT).Most (80/95, 84%) of the interventions targeted the antibiotic prescribed (choice of antibiotic, timing of first dose and route of administration). The remaining 15 interventions aimed to change exposure of patients to antibiotics by targeting the decision to treat or the duration of treatment. Reliable data about impact on antibiotic prescribing data were available for 76 interventions (44 persuasive, 24 restrictive and 8 structural). For the persuasive interventions, the median change in antibiotic prescribing was 42.3% for the ITSs, 31.6% for the controlled ITSs, 17.7% for the CBAs, 3.5% for the cluster-RCTs and 24.7% for the RCTs. The restrictive interventions had a median effect size of 34.7% for the ITSs, 17.1% for the CBAs and 40.5% for the RCTs. The structural interventions had a median effect of 13.3% for the RCTs and 23.6% for the cluster-RCTs. Data about impact on microbial outcomes were available for 21 interventions but only 6 of these also had reliable data about impact on antibiotic prescribing.Meta-analysis of 52 ITS studies was used to compare restrictive versus purely persuasive interventions. Restrictive interventions had significantly greater impact on prescribing outcomes at one month (32%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2% to 61%, P = 0.03) and on microbial outcomes at 6 months (53%, 95% CI 31% to 75%, P = 0.001) but there were no significant differences at 12 or 24 months. Interventions intended to decrease excessive prescribing were associated with reduction in Clostridium difficile infections and colonization or infection with aminoglycoside- or cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. Meta-analysis of clinical outcomes showed that four interventions intended to increase effective prescribing for pneumonia were associated with significant reduction in mortality (risk ratio 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97), whereas nine interventions intended to decrease excessive prescribing were not associated with significant increase in mortality (risk ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.06). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results show that interventions to reduce excessive antibiotic prescribing to hospital inpatients can reduce antimicrobial resistance or hospital-acquired infections, and interventions to increase effective prescribing can improve clinical outcome. This update provides more evidence about unintended clinical consequences of interventions and about the effect of interventions to reduce exposure of patients to antibiotics. The meta-analysis supports the use of restrictive interventions when the need is urgent, but suggests that persuasive and restrictive interventions are equally effective after six months.
TI  - Identification of pathogens in mastitis milk samples with fluorescent in situ hybridization.
AB  - Traditionally, the bacteriological examination of mastitis milk samples is performed by culture followed by biochemical tests on the cultured bacteria to allow identification of the causative pathogen. Depending on the species involved, this classic identification is time-consuming compared to other techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), a culture-independent method that utilizes oligonucleotides (labeled with a fluorophore) that are specific to a string of target DNA/RNA. In the current study, the applicability of FISH was evaluated for the detection of mastitis pathogens directly in milk samples. To remove interfering lipids and proteins from mastitis milk samples prior to FISH, a previously published enzymatic treatment with savinase was evaluated. FISH was performed using oligonucleotides specific for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, and Trueperella (Arcanobacterium) pyogenes. The enzymatic pretreatment and the sensitivity of FISH were evaluated using spiked whole milk samples and mastitis milk samples with bacterial loads of less than 10(3) up to 10(8) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml. Bacteria were reliably detected in milk samples with bacterial numbers of 10(6) CFU/ml or higher. However, bacteria present in numbers below 10(6) CFU/ml were not detectable in all cases. The ability of FISH to identify mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples, and therefore earlier than classical culture methods, can supplement the classic diagnostic procedures for mastitis milk samples.
TI  - Surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in Indian.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. METHODS: Urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (UTI)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. RESULTS: From wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during April 2011 to September 2012. Two Gram-positive, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), and nine Gram-negative bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. Both S. aureus and E. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. Particularly, all Gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for UTI. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiograms of 11 UTI-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and S. aureus. Moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis is a matter of concern.
TI  - Probing the role of the vancomycin e-ring aryl chloride: selective divergent synthesis and evaluation of alternatively substituted E-ring analogues.
AB  - The selective functionalization of vancomycin aglycon derivatives through conversion of the E-ring aryl chloride to a reactive boronic acid and its use in the synthesis of a systematic series of vancomycin E-ring analogues are described. The series was used to examine the E-ring chloride impact in binding d-Ala-d-Ala and on antimicrobial activity. In contrast to the reduced activity of the unsubstituted E-ring derivatives, hydrophobic and relatively nonpolar substituents approach or match the chloro-substituted vancomycin and were insensitive to the electronic character of the substituent (e.g., Cl vs CN/OMe), whereas highly polar substituents fail to provide the enhancements. Moreover, the active permethylated vancomycin aglycon derivatives exhibit VanB VRE antimicrobial activity at levels that approach (typically within 2-fold) their activity against sensitive bacteria. The robust borylation reaction also enabled the functionalization of a minimally protected vancomycin aglycon (N-Boc-vancomycin aglycon) and provides a direct method for the preparation of previously inaccessible analogues.
TI  - Screening for polyphenols, antioxidant and antimicrobial activitiesof extracts from eleven Helianthemum taxa (Cistaceae) used in folk medicine in south-eastern Spain.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The Helianthemum genus contains approximately one hundred taxa. Some of them are important medicinal plants used in several countries for many different purposes. However, studies addressing the phytochemistry of many of these species or their biological activities are currently nonexistent. AIM OF THE STUDY: To perform a comparative analysis of the qualitative composition of secondary metabolites and biological activities of the leaves of the most commonly distributed and used Spanish Helianthemum taxa in order to find a relationship between chemotype, biological activity and uses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: water and 80% methanolic extracts derived from 11 different Helianthemum taxa were analyzed for their phytochemical composition using standard methods. Furthermore, HPLC analysis was performed for the estimation of gallic acid, ellagic acid, tannins and flavonols as marker compounds. The antioxidant activity was measured by employing the scavenging activity on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (2,2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) radicals. The 80% methanolic extracts were evaluated for antibacterial (Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes and Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica) activity using the micro dilution technique. RESULTS: The total polyphenolic content and antioxidant capabilities differed significantly among the Helianthemum leaf extracts. A strong correlation between total phenolic content, antioxidant properties and antimicrobial activity was found. The polyphenolic profile was specific for each taxon. Whereas Helianthemum alypoides, Helianthemum cinereum subsp. rotundifolium, Helianthemum hirtum, Helianthemum asperum, and Helianthemum marifolium subsp. marifolium were characterized by the presence of gallic acid, egallic derivatives and ellagitannins; the polyphenolic profile of Helianthemum apenninum subsp. cavanillesianum, Helianthemum syriacum and Helianthemum polygonoides was mostly based on flavonoids. Helianthemum cinereum, Helianthemum alypoides and Helianthemum marifolium consistently presented the strongest radical scavenging activity (in water extracts EC50 ranges from 29.88 to 38.1 against DPPH and from 8.11 to 20.8 against ABTS, and in 80% MeOH extracts from 25.3 to 31.8 against DPPH and from 6.15 to 8.6 against ABTS), total phenol content (>117mg GAE/l) and antimicrobial activities. CONCLUSION: The Helianthemum taxa used in folk medicine did not cluster in a unique section, being equally distributed in two out of the four sections analysed. There was not a clear relationship between the chemotype, based on the polyphenolic composition of the taxa, and their taxonomical classification. However, the composition of the methanolic and water extracts from the leaves of plants belonging to the Helianthemum genus was strongly related to their medicinal uses.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis inhibits superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1-induced  interleukin-8 from human vaginal epithelial cells through tetramic acids.
AB  - The vaginal mucosa can be colonized by many bacteria including commensal organisms and potential pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus. Some strains of S. aureus produce the superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, which can penetrate the vaginal epithelium to cause toxic shock syndrome. We have observed that a female was mono-colonized with Enterococcus faecalis vaginally as tested in aerobic culture, even upon repeated culture for six months, suggesting this organism was negatively influencing colonization by other bacteria. In recent studies, we demonstrated an "outside-in" mechanism of cytokine signaling and consequent inflammation that facilitates the ability of potential pathogens to initiate infection from mucosal surfaces. Thus, we hypothesized that this strain of E. faecalis may make anti-inflammatory factors which block disease progression of more pathogenic organisms. E. faecalis MN1 inhibited interleukin-8 production from human vaginal epithelial cells in response to the vaginal pathogens Candida albicans, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, as well as to toxic shock syndrome toxin-1. We further demonstrated that this organism secretes two tetramic acid compounds which appear responsible for inhibition of interleukin-8 production, as well as inhibition of T cell proliferation due to toxic shock syndrome toxin-1. Microbicides that include anti-inflammatory molecules, such as these tetramic acid compounds naturally produced by E. faecalis MN1, may be useful in prevention of diseases that develop from vaginal infections.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antimicrobial activity of 1-methyl-3-sulfonylthio-4-aminoquinolinium chlorides.
AB  - Synthesis and in vitro antimicrobial activity (MIC) of novel 1-methyl-3-sulfonylthio-4-aminoquinolinium chlorides 2 are described. Compounds 2 were obtained in the reaction of 1-methyl-4-aminoquinolinium 3-thiolates 1 with sulfonyl chlorides. Antimicrobial activity of compounds 2 was investigated using Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium pseudodiphtericum and Gram-negative Escherichia coil, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains as well as Candida albicans. The investigated compounds exhibited growth-inhibitory activity towards Gram-positive bacteria in the 4-64 microg/mL range whereas that towards Gram-negative bacteria covered the 128-1024 microg/mL range. The highest activity was shown by compound 2c, featuring a phenylsulfonylthio substituent in the 3-quinoline position and a 4-chlorophenylamine group in the position 4. All of the investigated compounds 2 showed antifungal activity in the 32-128 microg/mL range. Correlations between antimicrobial activity and chemical structure of the tested compounds were observed.
TI  - Evaluation of biological value and appraisal of polyphenols and glucosinolates from organic baby-leaf salads as antioxidants and antimicrobials against important human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The present investigation has been carried out to investigate the biological role of four different types of baby-leaf salads and to study their potential as natural sources of antioxidants and antimicrobials against several isolates from important human pathogenic bacteria. Four single types of salads (green lettuce, red lettuce, rucola and watercress) and two mixtures [(1) red lettuce+green lettuce; (2) green lettuce + red lettuce + watercress + rucola] were assayed. The HPLC analysis revealed interesting levels of polyphenols and glucosinolates. The results showed a significant variation (p < 0.05) of polyphenols and glucosinolates with plant material. Nine different types of polyphenols grouped in three major classes were found: gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid and dicaffeoyltartaric acid (phenolic acids); quercitin-3-O-rutinoside, quercitin-3-O-rhamnoside, luteolin-7-O-glucoside and isorhamnetin (flavonoids); and cyanidin-3-glucoside (anthocyanins). Only three different glucosinolates were found: glucoraphanin; gluconasturtiin and 4-methoxy-glucobrassicin. A positive correlation was detected between polyphenol contents and antioxidant activity. Red lettuce and mixture 1 were the baby-leaf salads with the highest antioxidant potential. As for the antimicrobial activity, the results showed a selective effect of chemicals against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus were the bacteria most affected by the phytochemicals. Based on the results achieved baby-leaf salads represent an important source of natural antioxidants and antimicrobial substances.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of pleurocidin is retained in Plc-2, a C-terminal 12-amino acid fragment.
AB  - An analysis of a series of five peptides composed of various portions of the pleurocidin (Plc) sequence identified a l2-amino acid fragment from the C-terminus of Plc, designated Plc-2, as the smallest fragment that retained a antimicrobial activity comparable to that of the parent compound. MIC tests in vitro with low-ionic-strength medium showed that Plc-2 has potent activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus but not against Enterococcus faecalis. The antifungal activity of the synthetic peptides against phytopathogenic fungi, such as Fusarium oxysporum, Colletotrichum sp., Aspergillus niger and Alternaria sp., also identified Plc-2 as a biologically active peptide. Microscopy studies of fluorescently stained fungi treated with Plc-2 demonstrated that cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes were compromised in all strains of phytopathogenic fungi tested. Together, these results identify Plc-2 as a potential antimicrobial agent with similar properties to its parent compound, pleurocidin. In addition, it demonstrated that the KHVGKAALTHYL residues are critical for the antimicrobial activity described for pleurocidin.
TI  - Targeting agr- and agr-Like quorum sensing systems for development of common therapeutics to treat multiple gram-positive bacterial infections.
AB  - Invasive infection by the Gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is controlled by a four gene operon, agr that encodes a quorum sensing system for the regulation of virulence. While agr has been well studied in S. aureus, the contribution of agr homologues and analogues in other Gram-positive pathogens is just beginning to be understood. Intriguingly, other significant human pathogens, including Clostridium perfringens, Listeria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis contain agr or analogues linked to virulence. Moreover, other significant human Gram-positive pathogens use peptide based quorum sensing systems to establish or maintain infection. The potential for commonality in aspects of these signaling systems across different species raises the prospect of identifying therapeutics that could target multiple pathogens. Here, we review the status of research into these agr homologues, analogues, and other peptide based quorum sensing systems in Gram-positive pathogens as well as the potential for identifying common pathways and signaling mechanisms for therapeutic discovery.
TI  - Investigation of chemical compounds, antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of  teucrium arduini L. (lamiaceae).
AB  - In this paper chemical composition of the essential oil (analysed by GC and GC-MS), the content of phenolic compounds (analysed by HPLC), quantity of total phenols and total flavonoids (analysed by UV/Vis spectrophotometer), antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of ethanolic extracts were investigated in endemic Teucrium arduini L. in population of Mt Biokovo (Croatia). The oil was characterized by a high concentration of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (70.4%) of which beta-caryophyllene (35.2%) and germacrene D (18.7%) being the major compounds. Three phenolic compounds (quercetin, ferulic acid and rosmarinic acid) were identified and quantified in ethanolic extract of T. arduini using HPLC. The results also showed that T. arduini is a source of polyphenolic and other antioxidants with radical-scavenging and chelating properties. The ethanol extracts prepared from the leaf of T. arduini showed broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity on Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Aspergillus brasiliensis, which are susceptible on concentration below or equal to 4.00 mg/mL, whilst Microsporum gypseum was resistant at investigated concentrations.
TI  - Evaluation of the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test for rapid detection of bacteria and resistance determinants.
AB  - Rapid identification of pathogens from blood cultures can decrease lengths of stay and improve patient outcomes. We evaluated the accuracy of the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) nucleic acid test for investigational use only (Nanosphere, Inc., Northbrook, IL) for the identification of Gram-positive bacteria from blood cultures. The detection of resistance genes (mecA in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and vanA or vanB in Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis) by the BC-GP assay also was assessed. A total of 186 positive blood cultures (in BacT/Alert FA bottles) with Gram-positive cocci observed with Gram staining were analyzed using the BC-GP assay. The BC-GP results were compared with the identification and susceptibility profiles obtained with routine methods in the clinical laboratory. Discordant results were arbitrated with additional biochemical, cefoxitin disk, and repeat BC-GP testing. The initial BC-GP organism identification was concordant with routine method results for 94.6% of the blood cultures. Only 40% of the Streptococcus pneumoniae identifications were correct. The detection of the mecA gene for 69 blood cultures with only S. aureus or S. epidermidis was concordant with susceptibility testing results. For 3 of 6 cultures with multiple Staphylococcus spp., mecA detection was reported but was correlated with oxacillin resistance in a species other than S. aureus or S. epidermidis. The detection of vanA agreed with susceptibility testing results for 45 of 46 cultures with E. faecalis or E. faecium. Comparison of the mean times to results for each organism group showed that BC-GP results were available 31 to 42 h earlier than phenotypic identifications and 41 to 50 h earlier than susceptibility results.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria collected from countries in Eastern Europe: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) 2004-2010.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) commenced in 2004 to longitudinally monitor global changes in bacterial susceptibility to a suite of antimicrobial agents. The current study examined the activity of tigecycline and comparators against isolates collected across Eastern Europe between 2004 and 2010. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution methodologies. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using CLSI interpretive criteria, and tigecycline susceptibility was established using European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints. This study included 10 295 Gram-negative and 4611 Gram-positive isolates from 42 centres. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were reported among 15.3% of Escherichia coli and 39.3% of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates; the highest rates were observed in Turkey (30.9%) and Bulgaria (53.8%), respectively. Imipenem-non-susceptible K. pneumoniae were identified only in Turkey. ESBL-positive E. coli were highly susceptible to imipenem (95.1%), meropenem (98.0%) and tigecycline (98.5%). Most antimicrobials showed poor activity against Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Vancomycin resistance was noted among 0.9% of Enterococcus faecalis and 11.7% of Enterococcus faecium isolates. High rates of susceptibility were reported for linezolid (99.7%) and tigecycline (100%) against E. faecium. One-quarter of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), with the highest rate in Romania (51.5%); all MRSA were susceptible to linezolid, tigecycline and vancomycin. Antimicrobial resistance is high in much of Eastern Europe, with considerable variation seen among countries. Tigecycline and the carbapenems retain excellent activity against many pathogens from Eastern Europe; linezolid and vancomycin are active against most Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - In situ synthesis and antibacterial activity of copper nanoparticle loaded natural montmorillonite clay based on contact inhibition and ion release.
AB  - Copper nanoparticle based clay composite has been synthesized by in situ reduction of a copper ammonium complex ion and characterized by different analytical instruments. The copper nanoparticles were both intercalated and adsorbed on the surface with diameters of <5nm (for intercalated) and 25-30nm (for adsorbed). The composite showed good stability for over 3 months in air. Excellent antimicrobial activity of the composite was observed on Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis with mortality rates >90% after 12h. Cellular membrane damage permeated by direct attachment of the composite and indirect damage caused by released copper ion are the primary sources of antibacterial action. Cytotoxicity measurements showed minimal adverse effect on the two human cell lines beyond the M.B.C. value for the microorganisms studied. In the present form the clay composite shows good promise for use in therapeutic applications.
TI  - Design, synthesis, and antibacterial activity of demethylvancomycin analogues against drug-resistant bacteria.
AB  - Five novel N-substituted demethylvancomycin derivatives were rationally designed  and synthesized by using a structure-based approach. The in vitro antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), gentamicin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (GRE), methicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MRS), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) were evaluated. One of the compounds, N-(6-phenylheptyl)demethylvancomycin (12 a), was found to exhibit more potent antibacterial activity than vancomycin and demethylvancomycin. Compound 12 a was also found to be ~18-fold more efficacious than vancomycin against MRSA; however, the two compounds were found to have similar efficacy against MRS. Furthermore, compound 12 a exhibited a favorable pharmacokinetic profile with a half-life of 5.11+/-0.52 h, which is longer than that of vancomycin (4.3+/-1.9 h). These results suggest that 12 a is a promising antibacterial drug candidate for further preclinical evaluation.
TI  - Design, synthesis and antimicrobial activity of novel benzothiazole analogs.
AB  - In an attempt to design and synthesize a new class of antimicrobials, dialkyne substituted 2-aminobenzothiazole was reacted with various substituted aryl azides to generate a small library of 20 compounds (3a-t) by click chemistry. Structures of the newly synthesized compounds were established on the basis of spectral data. These compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against Gram+ bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis), Gram- bacteria (Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella boydii) and antifungal activity against Candida tropicalis, Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Cryptococcus neoformans) as well as molds (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus). The compound 3e showed maximum potency against all Gram+/gram- bacterial strains with MIC value 3.12 mug/ml, which is two fold more active as compared to standard drug ciprofloxacin (MIC 6.25 mug/ml). However, all compounds were found ineffective against S. boydii (clinical isolate). Further, only one compound 3n was found to be the most active against all fungal strains with MIC value in the range of 1.56 mug/ml-12.5 mug/ml while the remaining compounds showed moderate to weak antifungal activity.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of new 2-azetidinones with sulfonamide structures.
AB  - New series of N-(arylidene)hydrazinoacetyl sulfonamides 4a1-6, 4b1-6 and N-(4-aryl-3-chloro-2-oxoazetidin-1-yl)aminoacetyl sulfonamides 5a1-6, 5b1-6 were synthesized. The structures of the new derivatives was confirmed using spectral methods (FT-IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR). The antibacterial activities of these compounds against Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6583, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 25912) and Gram negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae CIP 53153, Proteus vulgaris CIP 104989, Citrobacter freundii CIP 5732, Enterobacter cloacae CIP 103475, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa CIP 82118) bacterial strains were evaluated using the broth micro-dilution method. Compound 4a2 displayed the highest antibacterial activity, especially against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antioxidant potential of the synthesized compounds was also investigated according to ferric reducing power, total antioxidant activity and DPPH radical scavenging assays. All tested compounds showed excellent antioxidant activity in comparison with sulfadiazine and sulfisoxazole which were used as parent sulfonamides. Moreover, some of them showed an antioxidant activity comparable with that of ascorbic acid. In general, the compounds designed based on a sulfadiazine skeleton (compounds 4a1-6, 5a1-6) are more active than those obtained from sulfisoxazole (compounds 4b1-6, 5b1-6), and the N-(arylidene)hydrazinoacetyl sulfonamide derivatives 4a1-6, 4b1-6 are more active than their azetidionone analogues 5a1-6, 5b1-6.
TI  - Combined treatments of enterocin AS-48 with biocides to improve the inactivation  of methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus planktonic and sessile cells.
AB  - Control of staphylococci during cleaning and disinfection is important to the food industry. Broad-spectrum bacteriocins with proved anti-staphylococcal activity, such as enterocin AS-48, could open new possibilities for disinfection in combination with biocides. In the present study, enterocin AS-48 was tested singly or in combination with biocides against a cocktail of six Staphylococcus aureus strains (including three methicillin-resistant strains) in planktonic state as well as in biofilms formed on polystyrene microtiter plates. Cells were challenged with enterocin, biocides or enterocin/biocide combinations. Inactivation of planktonic cells increased significantly (p<0.05) when enterocin AS-48 (25mg/l) was tested in combination with benzalkonium chloride (BC), cetrimide (CT) and hexadecylpyridinium chloride (HDP), and non-significantly in combination with didecyldimethylammonium bromide (AB), triclosan (TC), hexachlorophene (CF), polyhexamethylen guanidinium chloride (PHMG), chlorhexidine (CH) or P3-oxonia (OX). In the sessile state (24h biofilms), staphylococci required higher biocide concentrations in most cases, except for OX. Inactivation of sessile staphylococci increased remarkably when biocides were applied in combination with enterocin AS-48, especially when the bacteriocin was added at 50mg/l. During storage, the concentrations of sessile as well as planktonic cells in the treated samples decreased remarkably for BC, TC and PHMG, but OX failed to inhibit proliferation of the treated biofilms as well as growth of planktonic cells. The observed inhibitory effects during storage were potentiated when the biocides were combined with 50 mg/l enterocin AS-48. Results from this study suggest that selected combinations of enterocin AS-48 and biocides offer potential use against planktonic and sessile, methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
TI  - CD137 expressed on neutrophils plays dual roles in antibacterial responses against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections.
AB  - Severe sepsis and septic shock caused mainly by bacterial infections are life-threatening conditions that urge the development of novel therapies. However, host responses to and pathophysiology of sepsis have not been clearly understood, which remains a major obstacle for the development of effective therapeutics. Recently, we have shown that stimulation of a costimulatory molecule, CD137, enhanced survival of mice infected with the Gram-positive (G(+)) intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes but decreased survival in a polymicrobial sepsis model. Herein, we report that CD137 deficiency or blocking of CD137 signaling decreased antibacterial responses of mice infected with G(+) bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis) but increased these responses in mice infected with Gram-negative (G(-)) bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium). Consistent with these findings, stimulation of CD137 by administration of agonistic antibody enhanced responses against G(+) bacteria, whereas it decreased these responses against G(-) bacteria. Neutrophils were responsible for CD137-mediated opposite roles in control of G(+) and G(-) bacterial infections. Stimulation of CD137 enhanced activities of neutrophils against S. aureus but decreased these activities against E. coli, while CD137 blocking produced opposite results with the stimulation of CD137 in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we found that combined signaling of CD137 and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) induced synergistic production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by neutrophils, but combined signaling of CD137 and TLR4 did not. Our data strongly suggest that CD137 may play a dual role in sepsis in association with TLRs.
TI  - In vitro assessment of functional properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from faecal microbiota of healthy dogs for potential use as probiotics.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified in the faeces of Chinese Crested and Yorkshire terrier pups and their probiotic features were investigated in vitro. Thirty seven isolates were identified as Lactobacillus or Enterococcus. Out of these isolates, 31 were lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and belonged to the species Lactobacillus reuteri (16/37; 43.3%), Lactobacillus animalis (7/37; 18.9%), Lactobacillus acidophilus (3/37; 8.1%), Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (2/37; 5.4%), Lactobacillus murinus (2/37; 5.4%), and Lactobacillus paraplantarum (1/37; 2.7%), while six other LAB isolates were Enterococcus spp. (6/37; 16.2%). Strains were tested for resistance to gastric acidity (pH 2.5 for 3 h) and bile salts (0.3% ox gall), cell surface hydrophobicity by microbial adhesion to solvents, antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes), production of hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotic susceptibility. Thirty four strains were highly resistant to acidic conditions with slight (18 strains) to moderate (16 strains) growth inhibition by bile salts. Seven isolates had highly hydrophobic cellular surfaces and 28 strains exhibited strong antagonism against the bacterial pathogens tested, although 8 isolates tested against Leptospira interrogans had no effect on pathogen growth. All isolates produced low rates of hydrogen peroxide. Based on these results, two Lactobacillus strains showed promising probiotic-related features and merit investigation as probiotics for dogs.
TI  - Nasal and perirectal colonization of vancomycin sensitive and resistant enterococci in patients of paediatrics ICU (PICU) of tertiary health care facilities.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enterococci normally inhabit the intestinal tract of humans and are also a potential pathogen in causing nosocomial infections. The increase in antibiotic resistance and transfer of antibiotic resistance gene to Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) due to co-colonization has increased its importance in research. The aim of the study was to evaluate local epidemiology of nasal and rectal colonization with Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) and Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) in patients of Paediatrics Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and correlation with clinical and socioeconomic factors. METHODS: The nasal and perirectal swab samples were collected from 110 patients admitted in PICUs of three tertiary care hospitals of Rawalpindi Medical College, Pakistan. The identification of enterococci was done by biochemical tests and by PCR for ddl, vanA and vanB genes. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by disc diffusion and MICs were determined for vancomycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and oxacillin only. RESULTS: Out of 220 nasal and perirectal samples, 09 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and 76 vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (VSE), consisting of 40 E. faecalis and 45 E. faecium were isolated. PCR successfully identified both species with ddl primers and VRE with vanA primer. With disc diffusion method, all isolates were resistant to most of the antibiotics tested except linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin and vancomycin. VRE showed resistance to teicoplanin and vancomycin both and none was resistant to linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin. Generally, E. faecium isolates were more resistant than E. faecalis. MICs of vancomycin for nasal and perirectal VRE were 512 mg/L and 64 to 512 mg/L respectively. VRE were more in patients with prolonged hospitalization, from urban localities and those having pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Present study reveals high colonization and antibiotic resistance in enterococcal isolates from nasal and perirectal area. Nasal colonization by enterococci in PICU is more alarming as VRE may cause infection and can transfer this resistance gene to other microorganisms like S. aureus.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of daptomycin tested against Gram-positive pathogens collected in Europe, Latin America, and selected countries in the Asia-Pacific Region (2011).
AB  - We report the results of the international daptomycin surveillance programs for Europe, Latin America, and selected Asia-Pacific nations. A total of 7948 consecutive Gram-positive organisms of clinical significance were collected in 2011 and susceptibility tested against daptomycin and various comparator agents by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. M07-A9. Methods for dilution antimicrobial susceptibility tests for bacteria that grow aerobically; approved standard: ninth edition Wayne, PA: CLSI. 2012.; Cubicin Package Insert 2012. Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Lexington, MA. Available at http://www.cubicin.com/pdf/PrescribingInformation.pdf. Accessed January 1, 2012.) broth microdilution methods. The test medium was adjusted to contain physiological levels of calcium (50 mg/L) when testing daptomycin. Daptomycin exhibited potent activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus overall and for each region (MIC(50/90), 0.25-0.5/0.5 mug/mL), with susceptibility rates at 100.0% in Latin America, Australia/New Zealand, and India, and at 99.9% in Europe. The daptomycin MIC(50/90) for coagulase-negative staphylococci was also at 0.25-0.5/0.5 mug/mL, and only 1 isolate was considered nonsusceptible with a MIC value at 2 mug/mL. Daptomycin was also highly active against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(50/90), 1/1-2 mug/mL) and E. faecium (MIC(50/90), 2/2 mug/mL for both vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant isolates). All enterococcal isolates were susceptible to daptomycin (MIC, </=4 mug/mL) and tigecycline. Susceptibility to linezolid for E. faecalis was at 100.0%, while for E. faecium regional susceptibility rates were at 100.0% except in Europe (99.0%). Viridans group streptococci (MIC(50/90), 0.25/1 mug/mL) and beta-haemolytic streptococci (MIC(50/90), </=0.06/0.25 mug/mL) continue to be very susceptible to daptomycin. In summary, the results of this investigation document the high potency and wide spectrum of daptomycin when tested against a large resistance-surveillance collection of Gram-positive pathogens and indicate that daptomycin nonsusceptibility remains rare among indicated species after many years of clinical use worldwide.
TI  - Substituted 1,6-diphenylnaphthalenes as FtsZ-targeting antibacterial agents.
AB  - Bacterial cell division occurs in conjunction with the formation of a cytokinetic Z-ring structure comprised of FtsZ subunits. Agents that disrupt Z-ring formation have the potential, through this unique mechanism, to be effective against several of the newly emerging multidrug-resistant strains of infectious bacteria. Several 1-phenylbenzo[c]phenanthridines exhibit notable antibacterial activity. Based upon their structural similarity to these compounds, a distinct series of substituted 1,6-diphenylnaphthalenes were synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. In addition, the effect of select 1,6-diphenylnaphthalenes on the polymerization dynamics of S. aureus FtsZ and mammalian beta-tubulin was also assessed. The presence of a basic functional group or a quaternary ammonium substituent on the 6-phenylnaphthalene was required for significant antibacterial activity. Diphenylnaphthalene derivatives that were active as antibiotics, did exert a pronounced effect on bacterial FtsZ polymerization and do not appear to cross-react with mammalian tubulin to any significant degree.
TI  - New water-soluble polypyridine silver(I) derivatives of 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane (PTA) with significant antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities.
AB  - The new series of silver(I) coordination polymers [Ag(N-N)(mu-PTA)]n(X)n (1, 2, 4-8, 10, 11) and discrete monomers [Ag(N-N)(PTA)2](X) (3, 9) {N-N = bpy (1-3), dtbpy (4), neocup (5, 6), phen (7-9), dione (10, 11); X = NO3 (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10), PF6 (2, 4, 6, 8, 11)} were generated by self-assembly reactions, in MeOH at ~25 degrees C, of AgNO3 or AgPF6 with 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane (PTA) and the corresponding polypyridines, namely 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy), 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (dtbpy), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (neocup) and 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione (dione). The compounds were obtained as air and light stable solids and characterized by IR, (1)H and (31)P{(1)H} NMR spectroscopy, ESI(+)-MS and elemental analyses. The crystal structure of 1 was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, revealing infinite one-dimensional (1D) linear chains driven by mu-PTA N,P-linkers. Apart from representing the first examples of the metal-PTA derivatives bearing polypyridine ligands, 1-11 also feature solubility in water (S(25 degrees C) approximately 4-18 mg mL(-1)). Selected compounds (1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 10) were thus tested for their biological properties and found to exhibit significant antibacterial and antifungal activities, screened in vitro against the standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus sanguinis, Staphylococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. Furthermore, the compounds 5, 7, 9 and 10 show a pronounced antiproliferative activity against human malignant melanoma (A375), and the effects on the inhibition of tumor cells in vitro are in agreement with the DNA-binding studies.
TI  - Broad-spectrum antibacterial activity of carbon nanotubes to human gut bacteria.
AB  - Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) hold promise in manufacturing, environmental, and biomedical applications, as well as food and agricultural industries. Previous observations have shown that CNTs have antimicrobial activity; however, the impact of CNTs to human gut microbes has not been investigated. Here, the antibacterial activity of CNTs against the microbes commonly encountered in the human digestion system--L. acidophilus, B. adolescentis, E. coli, E. faecalis, and S. aureus--are evaluated. The bacteria studied include pathogenic and non-pathogenic, gram-positive and negative, and both sphere and rod strains. In this study, CNTs, including single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs, 1-3 mum), short and long multi-walled CNTs (s-MWCNTs: 0.5-2 mum; l-MWCNTs: >50 mum), and functionalized multi-walled CNTs (hydroxyl- and carboxyl-modification, 0.5-2 mum), all have broad-spectrum antibacterial effects. Notably, CNTs may selectively lyse the walls and membranes of human gut microbes, depending on not only the length and surface functional groups of CNTs, but also the shapes of the bacteria. The mechanism of antibacterial activity is associated with their diameter-dependent piercing and length-dependent wrapping on the lysis of microbial walls and membranes, inducing release of intracellular components DNA and RNA and allowing a loss of bacterial membrane potential, demonstrating complete destruction of bacteria. Thin and rigid SWCNT show more effective wall/membrane piercing on spherical bacteria than MWCNTs. Long MWCNT may wrap around gut bacteria, increasing the area making contact with the bacterial wall. This work suggests that CNTs may be broad-spectrum and efficient antibacterial agents in the gut, and selective application of CNTs could reduce the potential hazard to probiotic bacteria.
TI  - In vitro biological effects of two anti-diabetic medicinal plants used in Benin as folk medicine.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extracts from Polygonum senegalensis (Polygonaceae) and Pseudocedrela kotschyi (Meliaceae) are two important traditionally used medicinal plants in rural Benin to treat many diseases and notably type 2 diabetes. The aim of the study was to investigate the alpha-glucosidase inhibition, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of those plants extract: Polygonum senegalensis leaves, and Pseudocedrela kotschyi root. METHODS: Hydro-alcoholic (50%) extracts were analyzed for their phytochemical content and tested for their inhibition potency on alpha-glucosidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Antioxidant activities were assessed using the DPPH, ORAC, FRAP and DCFH-DA (cell based) assay. Finally, the antibacterial activity was evaluated using MIC determination on four Gram-positive cocci (Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium difficile, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus), three Gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae), and the yeast Candida albicans. RESULTS: Each extract presented significant alpha-glucosidase inhibition and antioxidant activities. Polygonum senegalensis leaf extracts were the most active in each in vitro assay with an IC50 = 1.5 mug/ml for alpha-glucosidase inhibition and an IC50 = 6.8 mug/ml for DPPH scavenging, - 4.5 mumol Fe II/g of dry matter - 9366 mumol Trolox / g DW - for FRAP and ORAC values, respectively. IC50 = 2.3 mug GA / ml for DCFH-DA assay. Concerning its antibacterial activity, a growth inhibitory effect was observed only against three Gram negative bacilli: B. subtilis, E. faecalis, S. aureus and the yeast C. albicans at high concentration. CONCLUSION: The results showed that the semi alcoholic extract of the two studied plants possess alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity, antioxidant potency, and low antibacterial effect.
TI  - [Microbial and pharmacological characteristics of VancogenX].
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Prosthetic joint infection is a feared complication in total hip arthroplasty. The use of antibiotic-impregnated bone cement is the important part of preventive and therapeutic strategies. At present a number of commercial bone cements are available and support of their use by the results of experimental trials and clinical studies has varied. In relation to this issue we studied essential microbiological and pharmacological characteristics of VancogenX in comparison with gentamicin-loaded bone cement used conventionally. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Based on a previously described protocol, we tested pellets of four commercial bone cements, namely, Hi-Fatigue G, Palacos R+G, VancogenX, and Palacos R as a control. Bone cement was prepared in a vacuum-mixing system. The strains used for bacterial load included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Each cement was tested for its antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities and the results were evaluated by standard methods. In addition, we investigated time-related release of gentamicin and vancomycin from the bone cements tested. RESULTS: All antibiotic-loaded cement pellets were able to prevent growth of the bacterial strains tested. The bactericidal effect lasted for several days in relation to the bacterial species and cement used, with the exception of S. epidermidis whose growth was inhibited by gentamicin-loaded cement only for one day. The antibiotic-loaded pellets also prevented the formation of a biofilm for 24 hours at least. The major amount of vancomycin (32.915 mg/l) was released from VancogenX to MH medium within 24 hours and the last measureable amount (4.327 mg/l) was recorded at 48 hours after the start of the experiment. In physiological saline the highest level of vancomycin was 139.852 mg/ml measured at 24 hours, and the antibiotic was detectable at a level of 2.334 mg/ml as late as 8 days after the experiment started. Release of gentamicin from VancogenX was as follows: the 24-hour level was higher in MH medium than physiological saline (178 versus 131.4 mg/ml); however, gentamicin was still detectable in physiological saline at 192 hours after the start of the experiment while no gentamicin was found in MH medium after 72 hours. DISCUSSION: The antimicrobial effect of VancogenX bone cement was not an unexpected finding since both gentamicin and vancomycin have been used with bone cement for a long time and their combination is optimal in terms of preventing prosthetic joint infection. However, there is a disputable issue of poor release of vancomycin from bone cement. In MH medium we were able to detect the vancomycin released from VancogenX only for two days after the initial rapid elution while its release into physiological saline seemed to be slower but much longer. It is possible that more vancomycin is released from bone cement, but this amount is immediately bound to proteins in the cement vicinity and this process is not detectable by any analytical method. CONCLUSIONS: The bone cement VancogenX showed excellent antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties and can be recommended for use in orthopaedic practice. Therapy of prosthetic joint infection is the main indication. Extension of the indication to the prevention of prosthetic joint infection in high-risk patients should be preceded by biomechanical studies demonstrating that the cement is appropriate for long-term implant fixation.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils from Mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the Portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar diffusion method. The essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative strains (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For most essential oils examined, S. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while P. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. Among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. Most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. Thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. In general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.
TI  - Bactericidal Activity of Methanol Extracts of Crabapple Mangrove Tree (Sonneratia caseolaris Linn.) Against Multi-Drug Resistant Pathogens.
AB  - The crabapple mangrove tree, Sonneratia caseolaris Linn. (Family: Sonneratiaceae), is one of the foreshore plants found in estuarine and tidal creek areas and mangrove forests. Bark and fruit extracts from this plant have previously been shown to have an anti-oxidative or cytotoxic effect, whereas flower extracts of this plant exhibited an antimicrobial activity against some bacteria. According to the traditional folklore, it is medicinally used as an astringent and antiseptic. Hence, this investigation was carried out on the extract of the leaves, pneumatophore and different parts of the flower or fruit (stamen, calyx, meat of fruit, persistent calyx of fruit and seeds) for antibacterial activity using the broth microdilution method. The antibacterial activity was evaluated against five antibiotic-sensitive species (three Gram-positive and two Gram-negative bacteria) and six drug-resistant species (Gram-positive i.e. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Gram-negative i.e. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-Escherichia coli, multidrug-resistant-Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acenetobacter baumannii). The methanol extracts from all tested parts of the crabapple mangrove tree exhibited antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, but was mainly a bactericidal against the Gram-negative bacteria, including the multidrug-resistant strains, when compared with only bacteriostatic on the Gram-positive bacteria. Using Soxhlet apparatus, the extracts obtained by sequential extraction with hexane, dichloromethane and ethyl acetate revealed no discernable antibacterial activity and only slightly, if at all, reduced the antibacterial activity of the subsequently obtained methanol extract. Therefore, the active antibacterial compounds of the crabapple mangrove tree should have a rather polar structure.
TI  - Infectious risk assessment of unsafe handling practices and management of clinical solid waste.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to determine the bacterial agents present in various clinical solid wastes, general waste and clinical sharp waste. The waste was collected from different wards/units in a healthcare facility in Penang Island, Malaysia. The presence of bacterial agents in clinical and general waste was determined using the conventional bacteria identification methods. Several pathogenic bacteria including opportunistic bacterial agent such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes were detected in clinical solid wastes. The presence of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in clinical sharp waste was determined using 16s rDNA analysis. In this study, several nosocomial pathogenic bacteria strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Lysinibacillus sphaericus, Serratia marcescens, and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in clinical sharp waste. The present study suggests that waste generated from healthcare facilities should be sterilized at the point of generation in order to eliminate nosocomial infections from the general waste or either of the clinical wastes.
TI  - Comparative potencies of contemporary generic vancomycin lot: in vitro assay results from nine products and a reference reagent-grade sample.
AB  - Numerous studies of generic vancomycin (GV) lots have emerged since the 1980s, casting some doubt on product quality. Publications question the in vivo activity, even when concurrent in vitro and chemical assays meet regulatory guidelines. This study assessed contemporary GV lots by an in vitro assay capable of measuring small variations from target-benchmark (BM) activity. Nine GV lots (Hospira [6 lots; 0.5- or 1.0-g vials], Akorn [1 lot; 1.0-g vial], APP [2 lots; 1.0-g vials]) were obtained from local United States distributors. A reagent-grade lot (Sigma lot 080M1341V) was tested as BM component due to the inability to purchase branded product vials in the USA. All lots of GV did not vary significantly from the analytical control when testing the 3 Staphylococcus aureus (wild-type 4B25, ATCC 25923, and 29213) and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) strains. These MIC end points were read at 18 h of incubation, and Hospira lots averaged +3.5% potency (range, -3% to +8%), and Akorn and APP at 0% variance, e.g., acceptable performance. In conclusion, with a validated, precise multi-organism assay, current GV lots marketed in the USA showed minimal activity variations from a selected BM control lot. Generic antimicrobial products, in general, should be regularly monitored for potency, chemical purity, and in vivo activity before routine use in medical centers.
TI  - Preparation of Some Eco-friendly Corrosion Inhibitors Having Antibacterial Activity from Sea Food Waste.
AB  - Chitosan is one of the important biopolymers and it is extracted from exoskeletons of crustaceans in sea food waste. It is a suitable eco-friendly carbon steel corrosion inhibitor in acid media; the deacetylation degree of prepared chitosan is more than 85.16 %, and the molecular weight average is 109 kDa. Chitosan was modified to 2-N,N-diethylbenzene ammonium chloride N-oxoethyl chitosan (compound I), and 12-ammonium chloride N-oxododecan chitosan (compound II) as soluble water derivatives. The corrosion inhibition efficiency for carbon steel of compound (I) in 1 M HCl at varying temperature is higher than for chitosan and compound (II). However, the antibacterial activity of chitosan for Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans is higher than for its derivatives, and the minimum inhibition concentration and minimum bacterial concentration of chitosan and its derivatives were carried out with the same strain.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial and allelopathic activity of Tunisian Conyza sumatrensis (Retz.) E.WALKER essential oils.
AB  - Conyza sumatrensis (Retz.) E.WALKER (Asteraceae) is a spontaneous annual herb, fairly widespread throughout Tunisia, which has rarely been studied or valued in any sector. Essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation of different parts (flower heads, leaves, stems, and roots) of C. sumatrensis plants, which were collected in autumn (November 2007) at the flowering stage in the area of Monastir, Tunisia. In total, 98 compounds, representing 88.1-99.3% of the oil composition, were identified by GC-FID and GC/MS analyses. The root essential oil was distinguished by its high content in acetylenes (matricaria ester, 4; 74.3%), while those from flower heads and leaves were dominated by oxygenated sesquiterpenes (61.1 and 50.3%, resp.). The oils of C. sumatrensis from Tunisia belonged to a matricaria ester/caryophyllene oxide chemotype. All the oils were evaluated for antibacterial, antifungal, and allelopathic activities. The results indicate that the leaf oil exhibited significant in vitro antibacterial activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Proteus mirabilis and that the C. sumatrensis oils isolated from the aerial parts presented high mycelia-growth inhibition of Candida albicans and the filamentous fungi tested. Moreover, the essential oils of the different plant parts inhibited the shoot and root growth of Raphanus sativus (radish) seedlings. Indeed, the inhibition of the hypocotyl growth varied from 28.6 to 90.1% and that of the radicle from 42.3 to 96.2%.
TI  - Assessment of a semi-automated protocol for multiplex analysis of sepsis-causing  bacteria with spiked whole blood samples.
AB  - Sepsis is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. Rapid and reliable diagnostic methods are needed for efficient and evidence-based treatment of septic patients. Recently, new molecular tools have emerged to complement the conventional culture-based diagnostic methods. In this study, we used spiked whole blood samples to evaluate together two ready-to-use molecular solutions for the detection of sepsis-causing bacteria. We spiked whole blood with bacterial species relevant in sepsis and extracted bacterial DNA with the NorDiag Arrow device, using the SelectNA Blood pathogen DNA isolation kit. DNA extracts were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- and microarray-based Prove-it Bone and Joint assay, resulting in correctly identified bacterial species with detection limits of 11-600 colony-forming unit/mL (CFU/mL). To understand the recovery losses of bacterial DNA during the sample preparation step and the capability of the PCR- and microarray-based platform to respond to the sensitivity requirements, we also determined the analytical sensitivity of the PCR and microarray platform to be 1-21 genome equivalents for the tested bacterial species. In addition, the inclusivity of the Prove-it Bone and Joint assay was demonstrated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clones carrying SCCmec types I, II, IV, or V and a nontypable SCCmec type. The proof-of-concept for accurate multiplex pathogen and antibacterial resistance marker detection from spiked whole blood samples was demonstrated by the selective bacterial DNA extraction method combined with the high-throughput PCR- and microarray-based platform. Further investigations are needed to study the promising potential of the concept for sensitive, semi-automated identification of sepsis-causing pathogens directly from whole blood.
TI  - Biological approach to synthesize TiO2 nanoparticles using Aeromonas hydrophila and its antibacterial activity.
AB  - Nanosized materials have been an important subject in basic and applied sciences. A novel, low-cost, green and reproducible bacteria, Aeromonas hydrophila mediated biosynthesis of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) was reported. The resulting nanoparticles were characterized by FTIR, XRD, AFM and FESEM with EDX. FTIR showed characteristic bands (1643 and 3430 cm(-1)) finds the role of carboxyl group OH stretching amine NH stretch in the formation of TiO2 NPs. The XRD spectrum confirmed that the synthesized TiO2 NPs were in the form of nanocrystals, as evidenced by the peaks at 2theta values of 27.47 degrees , 31.77 degrees , 36.11 degrees , 41.25 degrees , 54.39 degrees , 56.64 degrees and 69.54 degrees were identified as 110, 100, 101, 111, 211, 220 and 301 reflections, respectively. The crystallite sizes were calculated using Scherrer's formula applied to the major intense peaks and found to be the size of 40.50 nm. The morphological characterization was analyzed by FESEM and the analysis showed the NPs smooth shaped, spherical and uneven. GC-MS analysis showed the main compounds found in A. hydrophila were uric acid (2.95%), glycyl-L-glutamic acid (6.90%), glycyl-L-proline (74.41%) and L-Leucyl-D-leucine (15.74%). The potential glycyl-L-proline could have played an important role as a capping agent. A possible mechanism for the biosynthesis of TiO2 NPs has been proposed. The antibacterial activity of the synthesized TiO2 NPs was assessed by well diffusion method toward A. hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis and showed effective inhibitory activity against S. aureus (33 mm) and S. pyogenes (31 mm).
TI  - Ochnaflavone and ochnaflavone 7-O-methyl ether two antibacterial biflavonoids from Ochna pretoriensis (Ochnaceae).
AB  - The acetone extract of Ochna pretoriensis was evaluated for antibacterial activity using bioautography and serial microplate dilution methods against four nosocomial bacterial pathogens namely: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A bioassay-guided fractionation of the crude extract led to the isolation of two antibacterial biflavonoids, ochnaflavone and ochnaflavone 7-O-methyl ether. Gram-negative bacteria were more sensitive to the isolated compounds than the Gram-positive bacteria (MIC values: 31.3 microg/mL for P. aeruginosa and 62.5 microg/mL for S. aureus). In addition, the isolated compounds were assessed for their potential toxic effects in the MTT toxicity assay using monkey kidney vero cells and Ames genotoxicity test using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98. LC50 values were 125.9 microg/mL for ochnaflavone and 162.0/microg/mL for ochnaflavone 7-O-methyl ether. The isolated compounds have selectivity index values ranging from 1.29 to 4.03. Selectivity index values higher than one indicate that test samples are less toxic to the host cells than to the pathogens. The biflavonoids did not have any mutagenic effects in the Salmonella/microsome assay without metabolic activation.
TI  - Comparison of antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation and conjugative transfer of Staphylococcus and Enterococcus isolates from International Space Station and Antarctic Research Station Concordia.
AB  - The International Space Station (ISS) and the Antarctic Research Station Concordia are confined and isolated habitats in extreme and hostile environments. The human and habitat microflora can alter due to the special environmental conditions resulting in microbial contamination and health risk for the crew. In this study, 29 isolates from the ISS and 55 from the Antarctic Research Station Concordia belonging to the genera Staphylococcus and Enterococcus were investigated. Resistance to one or more antibiotics was detected in 75.8 % of the ISS and in 43.6 % of the Concordia strains. The corresponding resistance genes were identified by polymerase chain reaction in 86 % of the resistant ISS strains and in 18.2 % of the resistant Concordia strains. Plasmids are present in 86.2 % of the ISS and in 78.2 % of the Concordia strains. Eight Enterococcus faecalis strains (ISS) harbor plasmids of about 130 kb. Relaxase and/or transfer genes encoded on plasmids from gram-positive bacteria like pIP501, pRE25, pSK41, pGO1 and pT181 were detected in 86.2 % of the ISS and in 52.7 % of the Concordia strains. Most pSK41-homologous transfer genes were detected in ISS isolates belonging to coagulase-negative staphylococci. We demonstrated through mating experiments that Staphylococcus haemolyticus F2 (ISS) and the Concordia strain Staphylococcus hominis subsp. hominis G2 can transfer resistance genes to E. faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively. Biofilm formation was observed in 83 % of the ISS and in 92.7 % of the Concordia strains. In conclusion, the ISS isolates were shown to encode more resistance genes and possess a higher gene transfer capacity due to the presence of three vir signature genes, virB1, virB4 and virD4 than the Concordia isolates.
TI  - Effectiveness of flexible gastrointestinal endoscope reprocessing.
AB  - The practice of reprocessing endoscopes and its effectiveness was evaluated in 37 services. Contamination of at least 1 endoscope could be identified in 34 (91.6%) of 37 services. Bacteria, fungi, and/or mycobacteria were isolated from 84.6% (33/39) of the colonoscopes (110-32,000 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL) and from 80.6% (50/62) of the gastroscopes (100-33,000 CFUs/mL). Not all services followed recommended guidelines. Therefore, patients who underwent gastrointestinal endoscopies were exposed to diverse pathogens.
TI  - Detection and new genetic environment of the pleuromutilin-lincosamide-streptogramin A resistance gene lsa(E) in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus of swine origin.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the genetic basis of pleuromutilin resistance in porcine methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and to map the genetic environment of the identified plasmid-borne resistance gene. METHODS: Seventy porcine MRSA isolates, which exhibited high MICs of tiamulin, valnemulin and retapamulin, were investigated for pleuromutilin resistance genes and mutations. They were characterized by staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing, spa typing and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Plasmid DNA was extracted from the lsa(E)-positive strains and transferred to S. aureus RN4220 for selection of resistance plasmids. The plasmid-borne lsa(E) gene region was sequenced and 10 overlapping PCR assays for the analysis of the genetic environment of lsa(E) were developed. RESULTS: All 70 MRSA isolates were ST9 (MLST)-t899 (spa)-IVa (SCCmec). Sixteen isolates carried the lsa(E) gene; all others were negative for known pleuromutilin resistance mechanisms. An lsa(E)-carrying plasmid of approximately 41 kb was detected in a single isolate. Sequence analysis revealed that the lsa(E) gene was located in a multiresistance gene cluster, which showed partial homology to clusters identified in MRSA, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and Enterococcus faecalis. PCR analysis of the remaining isolates revealed a partly deleted multiresistance gene cluster in 6/15 isolates and solely the lsa(E) gene without the known flanking regions in 9/15 isolates. CONCLUSIONS: We identified the pleuromutilin-lincosamide-streptogramin A resistance gene lsa(E) in porcine MRSA isolates. The multiresistance gene cluster in which lsa(E) was located differed from the previously described ones found in human MRSA/MSSA or in E. faecalis. The location of lsa(E) on a multiresistance plasmid facilitates its persistence and dissemination.
TI  - Effect of Ottoman Viper (Montivipera xanthina (Gray, 1849)) Venom on Various Cancer Cells and on Microorganisms.
AB  - Cytotoxic and antimicrobial effects of Montivipera xanthina venom against LNCaP,  MCF-7, HT-29, Saos-2, Hep3B, Vero cells and antimicrobial activity against selected bacterial and fungal species: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, E. coli O157H7, Enterococcus faecalis 29212, Enterococcus faecium DSM 13590, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, S. typhimirium CCM 5445, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 6957 and Candida albicans ATCC 10239 were studied for evaluating the potential medical benefit of this snake venom. Cytotoxicity of venom was determined using MTT assay. Snake venom cytotoxicity was expressed as the venom dose that killed 50 % of the cells (IC50). The antimicrobial activity of venom was studied by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and disc diffusion assay. MIC was determined using broth dilution method. The estimated IC50 values of venom varied from 3.8 to 12.7 or from 1.9 to 7.2 mug/ml after treatment with crude venom for 24 or 48 h for LNCaP, MCF-7, HT-29 and Saos-2 cells. There was no observable cytotoxic effect on Hep3B and Vero cells. Venom exhibited the most potent activity against C. albicans (MIC, 7.8 mug/ml and minimal fungicidal concentration, 62.5 mug/ml) and S. aureus (MIC, 31.25 mug/ml). This study is the first report showing the potential of M. xanthina venom as an alternative therapeutic approach due to its cytotoxic and antimicrobial effects.
TI  - Bacteriocin PJ4 active against enteric pathogen produced by Lactobacillus helveticus PJ4 isolated from gut microflora of wistar rat (Rattus norvegicus): partial purification and characterization of bacteriocin.
AB  - The increase of multidrug-resistant pathogens and the restriction on the use antibiotics due to its side effects have drawn attention to the search for possible alternatives. Bacteriocins are small antimicrobial peptides produced by numerous bacteria. Much interest has been focused on bacteriocins because they exhibit inhibitory activity against pathogens. Lactic acid bacteria possess the ability to synthesize antimicrobial compounds (like bacteriocin) during their growth. In this study, an antibacterial substance (bacteriocin PJ4) produced by Lactobacillus helveticus PJ4, isolated from rat gut microflora, was identified as bacteriocin. It was effective against wide assay of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria involved in various diseases, including Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. The antimicrobial peptide was relatively heat-resistant and also active over a wide pH range of 2-10. It has been partially purified to homogeneity using ammonium sulfate precipitation and size exclusion chromatography and checked on reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of bacteriocin PJ4 purified through size exclusion chromatography resolved ~6.5 kDa protein with bacteriocin activity. The peptide is inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, trypsin, and lipase but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, and pepsin. It showed a bactericidal mode of action against the indicator strains E. coli MTCC443, Lactobacillus casei MTCC1423, and E. faecalis DT48. Such characteristics indicate that this bacteriocin may be a potential candidate for alternative agents to control important pathogens.
TI  - [Analysis of bactericidal material generated by electrical devices advertising bactericidal ability against bacteria on the agar gel plates].
AB  - Several Japanese companies sell electrical devices advertised as effective in inactivating viruses and killing bacteria by releasing special materials, e.g., Plasmacluster ions, Nanoe particle and minus ions, into the air. These companies claim that their devices killed bacteria on plates in their own experiments. We tested device effectiveness using the same experiments from the Plasmacluster ioniser SHARP Co., Japan, the Nanoe generator Panasonic Co., Japan, and the Vion KING JIM Co., Japan, to test their advertising claims. Bactericidal ability on agar plate was tested, using Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis as follows: the medium containing a certain amount of each bacterium was put onto an agar plate and smeared. Plates were kept in a closed chamber (inner volume 14.4 m3) or a glove box (inner volume 0.2 m), with one of the devices run for 2 hours. Plates not exposed to any device were used as controls. Each plate was retrieved and put in an incubator to count the number of bacterial colonies formed on the plate. There was no significant difference in the number of colonies on plates exposed to devices compared to control, in the number for all devices, or in all bacteria tested in experiments in the 14.4 m3 chamber. These results strongly suggest that these devices have almost no bactericidal effect, at least in space exceeding this volume. Colony formation was suppressed in the glove box in all devices and in all bacteria tested except P. aeruginosa, although the degree of suppression differed among experiments. The colony formation suppression mechanism was analyzed, and indicated that:colony formation did not change even after the removal of Plasmacluster ions, Nanoe particles, or negative ions from the air, while colony formation was decreased drastically by the removal of ozone from space, which was revealed to be generated inevitably during device operation. These results strongly suggest that the bactericidal effect seen only on the agar plate in narrow space was explained by ozone released in space as a by-product, not by special materials as advertising claimed. It is thus important to analyze the effect of special materials such as those done in this study and to suggest the involvement of ozone as the true cause, as have been done in this study, in evaluating bactericidal effect or viral inactivation as advertised by these companies.
TI  - Evidence for bacteria-independent hatching of Trichuris muris eggs.
AB  - Hatching of infective larvae from embryonated eggs in the intestine is an essential first step in Trichuris infections. There are three isolates of the murine parasitic nematode Trichuris muris: E, E-J (the E isolate maintained in Japan), and S. Incubation of T. muris embryonated eggs with the intestinal bacteria Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus induced in vitro hatching of the eggs, but Enterococcus faecalis failed to induce hatching. Bacteria-induced in vitro hatching of embryonated eggs occurred in the E and E-J isolates, whereas the S isolate was unresponsive to bacteria. T. muris worms recovered from infected mice showed no significant difference between the E-J and S isolates in their infectivity to susceptible B10.BR mice (P>0.05). In vivo hatching of embryonated eggs occurred at 30 min post-infection in the upper and lower halves of the small intestine of ddY mice infected with the E-J or S isolates, and on average, 65% of embryonated eggs recovered from the upper half of the small intestine were hatched in both the E-J and S isolates. In comparison with Enterococcus, the bacteria E. coli and S. aureus represent relatively minor components of the flora of the upper half of the small intestine of mice. These observations point to the possibility that bacteria-independent hatching might also occur in vivo, at least for the S isolate, and imply the existence of a very different system of induction of hatching in vivo.
TI  - Update of dalbavancin spectrum and potency in the USA: report from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (2011).
AB  - Dalbavancin (DAL) is an investigational lipoglycopeptide with a prolonged serum half-life allowing once weekly dosing. DAL potency was assessed in the 2011 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program among 1555 isolates sampled from all 9 US Census regions. Monitored Gram-positive cocci included Staphylococcus aureus (SA; 1,036/50.4% MRSA), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 115), Enterococcus faecalis (25), E. faecium (31), Streptococcus pyogenes (155), Streptococcus agalactiae (153), and viridans group streptococci (VGS; 40). All susceptibility (S) testing used Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute reference broth microdilution methods and interpretations. DAL (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.06 mug/mL) was 8- and 16-fold more active than daptomycin (DAP) and vancomycin (VAN), respectively against SA, with MSSA and MRSA having the same MIC(90) results. CoNS was slightly more DAL-S (MIC(50), </=0.03mug/mL). The highest staphylococcal DAL MIC was only 0.25 mug/mL. beta-Haemolytic streptococci (betaHS) and VGS had DAL MIC results ranging from </=0.03 to 0.25 mug/mL (MIC(90), 0.06-0.12 mug/mL), and only enterococci showed elevated DAL MIC results. VanA phenotype-resistant E. faecalis or E. faecium had DAL MIC values at >/=1 mug/mL; VanB strains were DAL-S (MIC, </=0.25 mug/mL). All cited DAL quantitative values were consistent with earlier surveillance data (2006-2009), without evidence of MIC creep. In conclusion, year 2011 SENTRY Program data for DAL documents sustained potent activity against SA, CoNS, betaHS, VGS, and VAN-S enterococci, which averaged 4- to 32-fold greater than VAN, DAP, or linezolid.
TI  - Microparticles containing propolis and metronidazole: in vitro characterization,  release study and antimicrobial activity against periodontal pathogens.
AB  - Ethylcellulose microparticles containing metronidazole and propolis extractive solution were prepared and evaluated in vitro against periodontal pathogens. Scanning electron microscopy, particle size analysis, drug entrapment efficiency and drug release of microparticles were determined. The antimicrobial activity of microparticles was evaluated against microorganisms of periodontal importance (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli). It was obtained particles with regular morphology, mean diameter of 1.23 microm, and entrapment efficiency for propolis and metronidazole were 91.41% and 22.23%, respectively. In vitro release studies of propolis and metronidazole from microparticles showed prolonged drug release and controlled by Fickian diffusion. Both propolis and metronidazole displayed activity against the tested strains. Moreover, the results showed that the strains of E. faecalis, S. pyogenes and S. mutans were more susceptible to the propolis and E. faecalis to the metronidazole. It was also observed that the amount of metronidazole to inhibit the microorganism strains in the physical mixture with propolis was smaller than in the metronidazole alone, suggesting potentiation effect between propolis and metronidazole. These microparticles would be useful for developing intermediary or eventual dosage form to be administered into the periodontal pocket more easily and safely.
TI  - Glucose triggers ATP secretion from bacteria in a growth-phase-dependent manner.
AB  - ATP modulates immune cell functions, and ATP derived from gut commensal bacteria  promotes the differentiation of T helper 17 (Th17) cells in the intestinal lamina propria. We recently reported that Enterococcus gallinarum, isolated from mice and humans, secretes ATP. We have since found and characterized several ATP-secreting bacteria. Of the tested enterococci, Enterococcus mundtii secreted the greatest amount of ATP (>2 muM/10(8) cells) after overnight culture. Glucose, not amino acids and vitamins, was essential for ATP secretion from E. mundtii. Analyses of energy-deprived cells demonstrated that glycolysis is the most important pathway for bacterial ATP secretion. Furthermore, exponential-phase E. mundtii and Enterococcus faecalis cells secrete ATP more efficiently than stationary-phase cells. Other bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus, also secrete ATP in exponential but not stationary phase. These results suggest that various gut bacteria, including commensals and pathogens, might secrete ATP at any growth phase and modulate immune cell function.
TI  - Independent risk factors for the co-colonization of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the region most endemic for vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolation.
AB  - In the majority of cases of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VR E. faecalis) served as the vanA donor to S. aureus. Previous studies that evaluated the risk factors for co-colonization with VRE and MRSA did not differentiate between VR E. faecalis and VR E. faecium. This study aimed to identify variables associated with VR E. faecalis and MRSA co-colonization. A retrospective case-control study from January 2008 to December 2009 was conducted at the Detroit Medical Center. Data were extracted from charts and pharmacy records. Unique patients co-colonized with VR E. faecalis and MRSA (defined as isolation of MRSA within 7 days of VR E. faecalis isolation) were compared with patients with VR E. faecalis who were not co-colonized with MRSA. A total of 546 patients with VR E. faecalis isolation were identified. 85 (15.6 %) VR E. faecalis patients were co-colonized with MRSA and 461 (84.4 %) VR E. faecalis patients were not co-colonized with MRSA. The mean age of the study cohort was 65.9 +/- 16.4 years, 424 (77.7 %) were African-American, and 270 (49.5 %) were residing in long-term care institutions. Independent predictors of co-colonization of VR E. faecalis and MRSA were male gender, impaired consciousness, ICU stay prior to VR E. faecalis isolation, indwelling devices, and isolation of VR E. faecalis from wounds. MRSA was frequently isolated from the same culture specimen as VR E. faecalis (n = 39, 45.9 %), most commonly from wounds. This large study of patients with VR E. faecalis identified the severity of illness, indwelling devices, and chronic wounds as independent predictors of co-colonization with VR E. faecalis and MRSA.
TI  - Propeptide processing and proteolytic activity of proenzymes of the staphylococcal and enterococcal GluV8-family protease.
AB  - Proenzymes with various lengths of propeptides have been observed in GluV8 from Staphylococcus aureus and GluSE from S. epidermidis. However, the production mechanism of these proenzymes and roles of truncated propeptides have yet to be elucidated. Here we demonstrate that shortening of propeptide commonly occurs in an auto-catalytic manner in GluV8-family members, including those from coagulase negative Staphylococci and Enterococcus faecalis. Accompanied with propeptide shortening, the pro-mature junction (Asn/Ser_1-Val1) becomes more susceptible towards the hetero-catalytic maturation enzymes. The auto-catalytic propeptide truncation is not observed in Ser169Ala inert molecules of GluV8-family members. A faint proteolytic activity of proenzymes from Staphylococcus caprae and E. faecalis is detected. In addition, proteolytic activity of proenzyme of GluV8 carrying Arg-3AlaAsn.1 is demonstrated with synthetic peptide substrates LLE/Q-MCA. These results suggest that GluV8-family proenzymes with shortened propeptides intrinsically possess proteolytic activity and are involved in the propeptide shortening that facilitates the final hetero-catalytic maturation.
TI  - Verigene(R) gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test.
AB  - Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and impose considerable costs on healthcare systems. A key predictor of clinical outcomes in patients with BSIs is the early initiation of appropriate targeted antimicrobial therapy. However, with conventional blood culture methods, the gold standard, there is a significant time delay of approximately 2-3 days before clinical results are available, with many patients receiving inappropriate and/or unnecessary antimicrobial therapy in the interim. During the past two decades, the use of in vitro assays that utilize nucleic acid amplification-based detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns has led to a significant reduction in the time (hours vs. days with blood culture) to detection and identification of several of the causative pathogens of BSIs and, potentially, earlier initiation of targeted antimicrobial therapy. This review focuses on the properties and clinical use of one of these molecular diagnostic assays, the Verigene((R)) Gram-Positive Blood Culture Nucleic Acid Test (BC-GP), which detects many of the potentially pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria associated with BSIs, including Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Listeria spp., and Enterococcus spp., and specific resistance markers (mecA, vanA, and vanB). Based on more than 1,600 samples, there was a high degree of agreement between BC-GP test results and those obtained using conventional blood culture and assay methods, irrespective of whether samples were fresh or frozen, and a high degree of agreement for identification of mecA-mediated meticillin resistance in S. aureus and S. epidermidis organisms and vanA- or vanB-mediated vancomycin resistance in E. faecalis and E. faecium organisms.
TI  - Preferable timing of therapeutic drug monitoring in patients with impaired renal  function treated with once-daily administration of vancomycin.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the timing of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in patients with impaired renal function treated with once-daily administration of vancomycin (VCM). Once-daily administration was selected for patients whose creatinine clearance (Ccr) was <80 ml/min. TDM was conducted on day 3 or on day 4. Adult patients whose VCM dosage was not altered according to initial C min and for whom subsequent follow-up TDM was performed within 1 week were entered into the study. Patients whose renal function deteriorated at follow-up TDM were excluded. One hundred sixty-five patients were eligible for analysis. Among patients with once-daily dosing, relative increases of C min at follow-up TDM compared with initial TDM were 34.5 +/- 39.2 % in TDM on day 3 and 16.6 +/- 20.6 % in TDM on day 4 (P = 0.016). In contrast, there was no significant difference in the relative increase of C min between TDM on days 3 and 4 (26.1 +/- 39.6 vs. 18.4 +/- 25.6 %, P = 0.551) in the twice-daily regimen. On multivariate analysis, TDM on day 3 alone (odds ratio, 4.93; 95 % confidence interval, 1.71-14.2) was selected as an independent risk factor associated with a relative increase of C min by >30 % in the once-daily regimen. Steady-state VCM serum concentration was not achieved on day 3 in the once-daily regimen in patients with impaired renal function, and TDM on day 3 caused underestimation of C min.
TI  - An in vitro evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy of primary root canal filling materials.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to evaluate and compare six different materials commonly used for filling the root canals of primary teeth for antimicrobial efficacy against some of the microorganisms commonly found in infected root canals. STUDY DESIGN: In this experimental in vitro study six root canal filling materials were tested for antimicrobial efficacy against eight microbial strains using the agar diffusion method. RESULTS: Zinc oxide eugenol paste exhibited the strongest antimicrobial potential followed by Endoflas, zinc oxide-calcium hydroxide-sodium fluoride mixture, zinc oxide-calcium hydroxide mixture and calcium hydroxide paste (Apexcal). The addition of sodium fluoride to the zinc oxide-calcium hydroxide mixture enhanced the antimicrobial efficacy. Metapex demonstrated minimal inhibition and Vaseline was non-inhibitory. CONCLUSIONS: All the test filling materials demonstrated varying antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms tested. Zinc oxide eugenol paste and materials containing zinc oxide were found to be more effective against the microorganisms compared to materials without zinc oxide.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of 5-halogenomethylsulfonyl- benzimidazole and benzotriazole derivatives.
AB  - A series of 5-halogenomethylsulfonylbenzimidazole and benzotriazole derivatives was synthesized as potential antibacterial agents. A new method of synthesis of benzimidazoles was developed. The antimicrobial activities of these compounds were tested against a series of reference and clinical strains. The reference strains include Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, B. subtilis, B. cereus, E. hirae, M. luteus) and Gram-negative rods (E. coli, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, B. bronchiseptica). The clinical strains include six methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and two methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) S. aureus strains, one methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, three E. faecalis and two E. faecium strains. Compound with trifluoromethyl- substituent at C-2 position (4) displayed significant antibacterial activities comparable with nitrofurantoin against four strains, and higher against Micrococcus luteus. MIC values for clinical Staphylococci strains (MRSA) were 12.5-25 mug/mL; for Enterococcus strains these values were 50-100 mug/mL. MIC values for reference and clinical strains of Staphylococcus and Enterococcus group were similar, respectively.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (bLf), but the results are inconsistent. Moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-bLf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield bLf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-bLf. However, whether bLf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. Therefore, various probiotic strains in Taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate in vitro. Thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, Lactobacillus salivarius ATCC 11741, Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103, Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707, and Bifidobacterium lactis BCRC 17394 were inhibited by both apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate. The growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate, including L. rhamnosus ATCC 7469, Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 23272, Lactobacillus fermentum ATCC 11739, Lactobacillus coryniformis ATCC 25602, L. acidophilus BCRC 14065, Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC 15697, Bifidobacterium bifidum ATCC 29521, and Pediococcus acidilactici ATCC 8081. However, apo-bLf and its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Moreover, the supernatants produced by L. fermentum, B. lactis, and B. longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. Importantly, a combination of apo-bLf or bLf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. In conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-bLf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.
TI  - Comparing effects of freezing at -196 degrees C and -20 degrees C on the viability of mastitis pathogens.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the effects of cryopreservation at approximately -196 degrees C in liquid nitrogen (N) and freezing at approximately -20 degrees C in a freezer, on the viability and survival of eight different mastitogenic bacteria inoculated in milk. Bacteria were frozen at approximately -20 degrees C in a freezer and cryopreserved at approximately -196 degrees C in liquid nitrogen. An effective preservation method was needed for follow-up samples from cows identified in the South African National Milk Recording Scheme (NMRS) with somatic cell counts above 250 000 cells/mL milk. The organisation responsible for sample collection of the NMRS milk samples also provides producers with liquid nitrogen for their semen flasks at the collection sites. This existing mode of storage and transport could therefore be utilised.Ten samples of each organism were thawed and cultured bi-weekly until week 18 for both temperature treatments. An additional sampling was performed at week 30 for samples frozen at approximately -20 degrees C. Freezing and cryopreservation did not impair subsequent isolation of Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus (STH) (phage type lytic group III) or Sta. aureus (STA) (phage typed, other than lytic group III). Survival was indicated by the isolation of bacteria from samples, and viability by the strength of growth of the bacteria isolated. The survival of Streptococcus agalactiae decreased after week 12 and Escherichia coli after week 16 of freezing, but both organisms survived under cryogenic preservation until week 18. Coagulase-negative staphylococci survived until week 18 for both freezing and cryogenic preservation.Both storage methods could thus contribute to the improvement of a pro-active approach towards udder health management in South African dairy herds.
TI  - Antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of 7-hydroxy-calamenene-rich essential oils from Croton cajucara Benth.
AB  - Croton cajucara is a shrub native to the Amazon region locally known as "sacaca". Two morphotypes are known: white and red "sacaca". The essential oils (EO) obtained by hydrodistillation from leaves of the red morphotype were, in general, rich in 7-hydroxycalamenene (28.4%-37.5%). The effectiveness of these EO regarding the antimicrobial activity against pathogenic microorganisms was initially investigated by the drop test method, showing significant inhibition zones. Among the microorganisms tested, the essential oils rich in 7-hydroxycalamenene were more effective against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. smegmatis, Mucor circinelloides and Rhizopus oryzae. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the oils were determined using the broth dilution assay. It was possible to observe that 7-hydroxycalamenene-rich oils presented high antimicrobial activity, with MIC of 4.76 x 10(-)(3) mug/mL for MRSA, 4.88 mug/mL for M. tuberculosis, 39.06 mug/mL for M. smegmatis, and 0.152 mug/mL for R. oryzae and 3.63 x 10(-)(8) mug/mL for M. circinelloides. The antioxidant activity of this EO suggests that 7-hydroxycalamenene provides more antioxidant activity according with EC(50) less than 63.59 mug/mL. Considering the bioactive potential of EOs and 7-hydroxycalamenene could be of great interest for development of antimicrobials for therapeutic use in treatment of bacterial and fungal infections in humans and/or veterinary practice.
TI  - American Journal of Gastroenterology Lecture: Intestinal microbiota and the role  of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) in treatment of C. difficile infection.
AB  - The vital roles that intestinal flora, now called microbiota, have in maintaining our health are being increasingly appreciated. Starting with birth, exposure to the outside world begins the life-long intimate association our microbiota will have with our diet and environment, and initiates determination of the post-natal structural and functional maturation of the gut. Moreover, vital interactions of the microbiota with our metabolic activities, as well as with the immunological apparatus that constitutes our major defense system against foreign antigens continues throughout life. A perturbed intestinal microbiome has been associated with an increasing number of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal diseases including Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). It has become recognized that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can correct the dysbiosis that characterizes chronic CDI, and effect a seemingly safe, relatively inexpensive, and rapidly effective cure in the vast majority of patients so treated. In addition, FMT has been used to treat an array of other gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disorders, although experience in these other non-CDI diseases is in its infancy. More work needs to be done with FMT to ensure its safety and optimal route of administration. There is a conceptual sea change that is developing in our view of bacteria from their role only as pathogens to that of being critical to health maintenance in a changing world. Future studies are certain to narrow the spectrum of organisms that need to be given to patients to cure disease. FMT is but the first step in this journey.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of various 4- and 5-substituted 1-phenylnaphthalenes.
AB  - Bacterial cell division occurs in conjunction with the formation of a cytokinetic Z-ring structure comprised of FtsZ subunits. Agents that can disrupt Z-ring formation have the potential, through this unique mechanism, to be effective against several of the newly emerging multi-drug resistant strains of infectious bacteria. 1- and 12-Aryl substituted benzo[c]phenanthridines have been identified as antibacterial agents that could exert their activity by disruption of Z-ring formation. Substituted 4- and 5-amino-1-phenylnaphthalenes represent substructures within the pharmacophore of these benzo[c]phenanthridines. Several 4- and 5-substituted 1-phenylnaphthalenes were synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. The impact of select compounds on the polymerization dynamics of S. aureus FtsZ was also assessed.
TI  - Antibacterial and antimycotic activities of Slovenian honeys.
AB  - In the present study, Slovenian honey samples produced from different floral sources are evaluated for their antibacterial and antifungal properties. The peroxide contribution to antibacterial activity is also determined. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the honeys was assessed against four bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus) and against eight fungal species (Aspergillus niger, Aureobasidium pullulans, Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Penicillium chrysogenum and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa). Honey at concentrations between 1% and 50% (v/v) were tested. Although all of the bacterial species were inhibited by the different honey samples, the chestnut and pasture honeys showed the highest antibacterial activities. The antifungal activities were concentration-dependent, with five (Aureobasidium pullulans, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa) inhibited only at honey concentrations greater than 50%. The fungi Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans and Penicillium chrysogenum were not inhibited by any of the tested honeys, even at the highest concentrations. The lowest MICs seen were 2.5% (v/v) for the chestnut, fir and forest honeys against Staphylococcus aureus, and 10.0% (v/v) for the chestnut and pasture honeys against Cladosporium cladosporioides. The non-peroxide action of chestnut honey was tested against Escherichia coli. The MIC of the catalase-treated chestnut honey was 50% (v/v). The antibacterial effect of Slovenian honeys is mostly due to peroxide action. These data support the concept that Slovenian honeys are effective antibacterials and antifungals, and can thus be applied for medicinal purposes.
TI  - In vitro activity of telavancin and comparators against selected groups of Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Telavancin is a novel, rapidly cidal, dual-action glycopeptide. This study examined its in vitro activity against relevant Gram-positive pathogens, comprising 99 meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 40 meticillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), 79 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 45 Enterococcus faecalis, 60 Enterococcus faecium, 40 beta-haemolytic streptococci and 60 Streptococcus pneumoniae. Except with VanA enterococci, telavancin MICs were tightly clustered and unimodal. Telavancin MICs for staphylococci ranged from </=0.03 mg/L to 0.5mg/L, with no shift for MRSA or MSSA in relation to vancomycin MIC. Nevertheless, and independently of species, CoNS with raised vancomycin MICs had reduced susceptibility to telavancin, however this was much more marked for teicoplanin. Modal telavancin MICs were 0.5mg/L and </=0.03 mg/L for glycopeptide-susceptible E. faecalis and E. faecium, respectively, with no rise for VanB isolates, but ranges rose to 4-16 mg/L and 1-4 mg/L for VanA isolates, respectively. Streptococci were consistently susceptible, with MICs of </=0.06 mg/L. Telavancin MICs by Etest agreed within 1 doubling dilution with those found previously by BSAC agar dilution in 96.2% of cases, although with slight bias towards lower values. In the few cases (13/345) where telavancin MICs by Etest were >/=2 doubling dilutions different from those by agar dilution, the Etest value was always lower; this effect was greater for the other antibiotics tested. Telavancin had excellent activity, except against enterococci with VanA, with no erosion of this activity against MRSA with raised vancomycin MICs. MICs by Etest were nearly always within 1 dilution of those by BSAC agar dilution.
TI  - Purification and biochemical characterization of a highly thermostable bacteriocin isolated from Brevibacillus brevis strain GM100.
AB  - A bacteriocin-producing (11,000 AU mL(-1)) strain was isolated from the rhizosphere of healthy Algerian plants Ononis angustissima Lam., and identified as Brevibacillus brevis strain GM100. The bacteriocin, called Bac-GM100, was purified to homogeneity from the culture supernatant, and, based on MALDI-TOF/MS analysis, was a monomer protein with a molecular mass of 4375.66 Da. The 21 N-terminal residues of Bac-GM100 displayed 65% homology with thurincin H from Bacillus thuringiensis. Bac-GM100 was extremely heat-stable (20 min at 120 degrees C), and was stable within a pH range of 3-10. It proved sensitive to various proteases, which demonstrated its protein nature. It was also found to display a bactericidal mode of action against gram-negative (Salmonella enteric ATCC 43972, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 49189, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58) and gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis ENSAIA 631 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538) bacteria, and a fungistatic mode of action against the pathogenic fungus Candida tropicalis R2 CIP 203.
TI  - Circulating microRNA signatures in mice exposed to lipoteichoic acid.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previously, we had identified a specific whole blood-derived microRNAs (miRNAs) signature in mice following in vivo injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) originated from Gram-negative bacteria. This study was designed to profile the circulating miRNAs expression in mice exposed to lipoteichoic acid (LTA) which is a major component of the wall of Gram-positive bacteria. RESULTS: C57BL/6 mice received intraperitoneal injections of 100 mug of LTA originated from Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus were killed 6 h and the whole blood samples were obtained for miRNA expression analysis using a miRNA array (Phalanx miRNA OneArray(R) 1.0). Up-regulated expression of miRNA targets in the whole blood, serum and white blood cells (WBCs) of C57BL/6 and Tlr2-/- mice upon LTA treatment in 10, 100, or 1000 ug concentrations was quantified at indicated time (2, 6, 24, and 72 h) using real-time RT-PCR and compared with that in the serum of C57BL/6 mice injected with 100 ug of LPS. A significant increase of 4 miRNAs (miR-451, miR-668, miR-1902, and miR-1904) was observed in the whole blood and the serum in a dose- and time-dependent fashion following LTA injection. Induction of miRNA occurred in the serum after 2 h and persisted for at least 6 h. No increased expression of these 4 miRNAs was found in the WBCs. Higher but not significant expression level of these 4 miRNAs were observed following LTA treatment in the serum of Tlr2-/-against that of C57BL6 mice. In contrast, LPS exposure induced moderate expression of miR-451 but not of the other 3 miRNA targets. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a specific circulating miRNA signature in mice exposed to LTA. That expression profile is different from those of mice exposed to LPS. Those circulating miRNAs induced by LTA or LPS treatment may serve as promising biomarkers for the differentiation between exposures to Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - [Predictive ability of clinical parameters of bacteremia in hemodialysed patients].
AB  - BACKGROUND: No clinical events to differentiate bacteteremia from other pathologies in hemodialysis patients therefore the physicians makes diagnosis and treatment decisions based on clinical evidence an local epidemiology. OBJECTIVE: the aim of this work was to study the frequency of microorganism isolated from blood culture of hemodialysis patients with suspected bacteraemia and evaluate Sensitivity (S) and Specificity (E) of medical diagnostic orientation in this cases of suspected Materials and methods: we performed an observational and prospective study for one year in hemodialysis patient with suspected bacteremia. We evaluated blood pressure, temperature (T masculine), altered conscious state (AEC), respiratory frequency (FR), chills (ESC),diarrhea (DIARR), blood culture results and microbiological identification. We work with the mean +/- standar desviation for continuous variables and frequencies for categorical variables We analyzed S, E, negative predictive value (VPN), positive predictive value (VPP) RESULTADOS: a total of 87 events with suspected bacteremia 34 (39%) were confirmed with positive blood culture the most common microorganisms were cocci Gram positive (CGP) 65%, Most relevant clinical variables were PCP >/= 2 (VPN 81%), T masculine >/= 38 (VPN 76%) and AEC (E 98% y VPP 80%). CONCLUSIONS: CGP were the most prevalent microorganisms None of the clinical variables shows high S and E indicating low usefulness as a predictive tool of bacteremia Excepting AEC with E98% and VPP 80% but it would be necessary to evaluate this variable with a more number patient. Results justify to routine HC use like diagnostic tool.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of novel azaphenothiazine derivatives.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity in vitro of a series of novel azaphenothiazine derivatives containing a quinoline moiety was investigated using Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) strains as well as in Candida albicans yeast. The examined compounds showed the highest activity against Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli whereas activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the lowest. Compound 1d demonstrates the highest activity against all tested bacterial strains. Compounds 1c, 1h and 1k with various substituents (CH3, OH, NH2) at C11 position of the quinobenzothiazine ring, did not exhibit activity against any tested bacterial strain. Only compounds 1m and 1n with long aliphatic chains at the quinoline nitrogen atom showed antifungal activity. Correlations between antimicrobial activity and chemical structure of the tested compounds were observed.
TI  - [A model of intestinal infiltrate in conditions of chronic experiment].
AB  - A chronic intestinal infiltrate model, aiming at a typical inflammatory process simulation, was elaborated in experiment. As a result of experiment on 30 rabbits the quantity of colonies of various causative agents was established, which did not cause the abscess and peritonitis formation. While doing the operation in 60 rabbits chronic infiltrate was formed between abducting and adducting small intestine loops, its mesentery and big omentum; between abducting and adducting large intestine loops, its mesentery and big omentum. The infiltrate formation process was studied up on the 3, 7, 14th and 28th day. Dynamics of changes in microorganisms species and quantity were studied, using microbiological investigations data. The stages of chronic intestinal infiltrate formation were followed up, using histological investigations. Application of the method proposed have permitted to form a chronic infiltrate owing predicted course to reduce the experiment duration and the investigated animals quantity.
TI  - Zn(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) complexes of tridentate asymmetrical Schiff base ligands: synthesis, characterization, properties and biological activity.
AB  - New asymmetrical tridentate Schiff base ligands were synthesized using 1,2-phenylenediamine, 4-methyl-1,2-phenylenediamine, 2-hydroxy-1-napthaldehyde, 9-anthracenecarboxaldehyde. Schiff base ligands and their metal complexes were synthesised and characterized by using FT-IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, UV-Vis, XRD, ESR, elemental analysis and fluorescence studies. The antimicrobial activity of the ligands and their metal complexes were studied against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, S. aureus ATCC 25923, Streptococcus mutans RSHM 676, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853. The determination of the antibacterial activity was done using the broth microdilution methods. In general, it has been determined that the studied compounds have MIC values similar to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It has been found that Ni, Pb, Zn derivatives of HL1A and ZnL(2)A has lower MIC values than ampicillin for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 strain.
TI  - Infective endocarditis in non-HIV immunosuppressed patients.
AB  - Infective endocarditis is a septic illness with sudden or insidious onset that causes heart lesions or aggravates the preexisting ones; during its course it can affect other organs, mortality being high. AIM: To identify non-HIV immunosuppressed patients with infective endocarditis, namely those with associated diabetes, hepatitis, cancer, or old age with multiple comorbidities, and to assess the nosocomial risk by Carmeli score. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study using epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and treatment data from 56 patients admitted to and diagnosed with infective endocarditis at the lasi Infectious Diseases Hospital in the interval January 2008 - May 2012. To these patients we looked for non-HIV immunosuppressed character, having in their pathology association diabetes, chronic hepatitis, malignancy, or other comorbidities. RESULTS: From the infective endocarditis patients, 92.8% were found non-HIV immunosuppressed, 25% of them presenting renal failure, and 21.1% having diabetes. The most common Carmeli score obtained was score 2 in 57.1% of the cases. In these patients, the most frequent etiologic agent of infective endocarditis was Enterococcus faecalis (16%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (10.7%). CONCLUSIONS: It was noted that in addition to endocardial damage due to the multiple etiologic agents involved, non-HIV immunosuppression in these patients plays an important role. The association of Carmeli score in patients diagnosed with infective endocarditis is significant, especially in case of adequate therapy initiation for a right treatment of this pathology.
TI  - Molecular recognition of live cells using DNA aptamers.
AB  - AIM: To generate DNA-aptamers binding to Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). METHODS: The Cell-Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) technology was used to run the selection against MRSA bacteria and develop target-specific aptamers. MRSA bacteria were targeted while Enterococcus faecalis bacteria were used for counter selection during that process. Binding assays to determine the right aptamer candidates as well as binding assays on clinical samples were performed through flow cytometry and analyzed using the FlowJo software. The characterization of the aptamers was done by determination of their Kd values and determined by analysis of flow data at different aptamer concentration using SigmaPlot. Finally, the recognition of the complex Gold-nanoparticle-aptamer to the bacteria cells was observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). RESULTS: During the cell-SELEX selection process, 17 rounds were necessary to generate enrichment of the pool. While the selection was run using fixed cells, it was shown that the binding of the pools with live cells was giving similar results. After sequencing and analysis of the two last pools, four sequences were identified to be aptamer candidates. The characterization of those aptamers showed that based on their Kd values, DTMRSA4 presented the best binding with a Kd value of 94.61 +/- 18.82 nmol/L. A total of ten clinical samples of MRSA , S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis were obtained to test those aptamers and determine their binding on a panel of samples. DTMRSA1 and DTMRSA3 showed the best results regarding their specificity to MRSA , DTMRSA1 being the most specific of all. Finally, those aptamers were coupled with gold-nanoparticle and their binding to MRSA cells was visualized through TEM showing that adduction of nanoparticles on the aptamers did not change their binding property. CONCLUSION: A total of four aptamers that bind to MRSA were obtained with Kd values ranking from 94 to 200 nmol/L.
TI  - Use of nanoparticulate zinc oxide as intracanal medication in endodontics: pH and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the pH and antimicrobial activity of micro  or nanoparticulate zinc oxide (ZnO) pastes with or without calcium hydroxide (CH). The following medications were evaluated: microparticulate ZnO + polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400; nanoparticulate ZnO + PEG 400; PEG 400; CH + microparticulate ZnO + PEG 400 and CH + nanoparticulate ZnO + PEG 400. The pH was assessed between 12 hours and 28 days, using a digital pH meter. The antimicrobial activity against Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC-9212), Candida albicans (ATCC-10231), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC-27853), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC-6538) and Kocuria rhizophila (ATCC-9341) was determined in triplicate using agar diffusion test. The results were submitted to Kruskal-Wallis/Dunn and ANOVA/Tukey tests with 5% significance. The highest pH values were found for CH+ZnO, with higher values for nanoparticulate ZnO after 12 hours and 21 days (p < 0.05). CH+ZnO medication promoted higher growth inhibition against P. aeruginosa and lower against E. faecalis. Calcium hydroxide pastes have higher pH and antimicrobial activity when associated with either micro- or nanoparticulate zinc oxide.
TI  - Design and synthesis of 16-membered cyclopeptides active against vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE).
AB  - The design, synthesis and antibiotic activities of the modified carboxylate binding pocket (D-O-E ring) of vancomycin (1) are summarized in this short account. The preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies indicated that both the structure of the 16-membered macrocycle including the absolute configuration of the modified AA4 unit and the presence of a hydrophobic chain were important for anti-VRE activities of these series of synthetic analogues. Compounds 9c and 9d in which the central amino acid (AA4) of vancomycin was replaced by (2R,3R)-alpha-hydroxy-beta-amino acid and (2R,3R)-alpha,beta-diamino acid, respectively, were found to be useful templates in searching for active compounds against both vancomycin-sensitive and -resistant strains. Two of these compounds (16d and 16n) having an elongated peptide chain at the C-terminal were found to be active against a broad spectrum of both vancomycin-sensitive (Staphylococcus aureus) and -resistant strains (E. faecium, E. faecalis).
TI  - The insect Galleria mellonella as a powerful infection model to investigate bacterial pathogenesis.
AB  - The study of bacterial virulence often requires a suitable animal model. Mammalian models of infection are costly and may raise ethical issues. The use of insects as infection models provides a valuable alternative. Compared to other non-vertebrate model hosts such as nematodes, insects have a relatively advanced system of antimicrobial defenses and are thus more likely to produce information relevant to the mammalian infection process. Like mammals, insects possess a complex innate immune system(1). Cells in the hemolymph are capable of phagocytosing or encapsulating microbial invaders, and humoral responses include the inducible production of lysozyme and small antibacterial peptides(2,3). In addition, analogies are found between the epithelial cells of insect larval midguts and intestinal cells of mammalian digestive systems. Finally, several basic components essential for the bacterial infection process such as cell adhesion, resistance to antimicrobial peptides, tissue degradation and adaptation to oxidative stress are likely to be important in both insects and mammals(1). Thus, insects are polyvalent tools for the identification and characterization of microbial virulence factors involved in mammalian infections. Larvae of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella have been shown to provide a useful insight into the pathogenesis of a wide range of microbial infections including mammalian fungal (Fusarium oxysporum, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans) and bacterial pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes or Enterococcus faecalis(4-7). Regardless of the bacterial species, results obtained with Galleria larvae infected by direct injection through the cuticle consistently correlate with those of similar mammalian studies: bacterial strains that are attenuated in mammalian models demonstrate lower virulence in Galleria, and strains causing severe human infections are also highly virulent in the Galleria model(8-11). Oral infection of Galleria is much less used and additional compounds, like specific toxins, are needed to reach mortality. G. mellonella larvae present several technical advantages: they are relatively large (last instar larvae before pupation are about 2 cm long and weight 250 mg), thus enabling the injection of defined doses of bacteria; they can be reared at various temperatures (20 degrees C to 30 degrees C) and infection studies can be conducted between 15 degrees C to above 37 degrees C(12,13), allowing experiments that mimic a mammalian environment. In addition, insect rearing is easy and relatively cheap. Infection of the larvae allows monitoring bacterial virulence by several means, including calculation of LD50(14), measurement of bacterial survival(15,16) and examination of the infection process(17). Here, we describe the rearing of the insects, covering all life stages of G. mellonella. We provide a detailed protocol of infection by two routes of inoculation: oral and intra haemocoelic. The bacterial model used in this protocol is Bacillus cereus, a Gram positive pathogen implicated in gastrointestinal as well as in other severe local or systemic opportunistic infections(18,19).
TI  - Environmental contamination by dog&#8217;s faeces: a public health problem?
AB  - The risk to public health from the large number of dog stools present on streets  of urban areas is cause for concern. Dog faeces may be a serious hazard because they may contain microorganisms that are both pathogenic to humans and resistant to several classes of antibiotics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential for zoonotic infections and for the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in canine faeces which contaminates the urban environment. A total of 418 canine faecal samples were collected from streets in seven areas of Bari, Southern Italy. We have isolated multi-drug resistant Enterococci and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from these dog faecal samples. The presence of the resistant bacteria in an urban environment may represent a public health hazard which requires control measures by competent authorities. No Salmonella, Yersinia or Campylobacter species were isolated. Giardia cysts were detected in 1.9% of the samples. The predominant Enterococcus species were E. faecium (61.6%), E. gallinarum (23.3%) and E. casseliflavus (5.5%). Other species, including E. faecalis were also isolated. These strains were resistant to clindamycin (86.3%), tetracycline (65.7%), erythromycin (60.27%) and ampicillin (47.9%). High-level aminoglycoside resistance (HLAR) was found in 65.7% of enterococci. Resistance to three or more antibiotics and six or more antibiotics were observed in 67.12% and 38.4% of Enterococcus spp., respectively. Resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin was not detected in any of the Enterococcus spp. isolated. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 0.7% of the faecal samples. Canine faeces left on the streets may represent a risk factor for transmission of microorganisms and a reservoir of multidrug- resistant bacteria thus contributing to the spread of resistance genes into an urban area.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of AH Plus, EndoREZ and Epiphany against microorganisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of endodontic sealers against microorganisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The agar diffusion method was used. A double base layer of Mueller Hinton agar was done. The microorganisms used were: Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The wells were obtained by removing a standardized portion of the agar. After the distribution of the sealers, Petri plates were incubated for 24 h. Inhibition halos formed around the wells were measured. RESULTS: Epiphany did not show any antimicrobial activity on the tested microorganisms (without inhibition halo). The AH Plus showed the greatest inhibition halo on C. albicans followed by EndoREZ on S. aureus. EndoREZ also showed greater inhibition halo in comparison to AH Plus on E. faecalis and E. coli. CONCLUSION: It could be concluded that AH Plus and EndoREZ showed antimicrobial activity against all the tested microorganisms. No antimicrobial activity was observed for Epiphany.
TI  - Effect of low-dose gaseous ozone on pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of chronically infected wounds is a challenge, and bacterial environmental contamination is a growing issue in infection control. Ozone may have a role in these situations. The objective of this study was to determine whether a low dose of gaseous ozone/oxygen mixture eliminates pathogenic bacteria cultivated in Petri dishes. METHODS: A pilot study with 6 bacterial strains was made using different concentrations of ozone in an ozone-oxygen mixture to determine a minimally effective dose that completely eliminated bacterial growth. The small and apparently bactericidal gaseous dose of 20 mug/mL ozone/oxygen (1:99) mixture, applied for 5 min under atmospheric pressure was selected. In the 2nd phase, eight bacterial strains with well characterized resistance patterns were evaluated in vitro using agar-blood in adapted Petri dishes (105 bacteria/dish). The cultures were divided into 3 groups: 1--ozone-oxygen gaseous mixture containing 20 mug of O(3)/mL for 5 min; 2--100% oxygen for 5 min; 3--baseline: no gas was used. RESULTS: The selected ozone dose was applied to the following eight strains: Escherichia coli, oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter baumannii susceptible only to carbapenems, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa susceptible to imipenem and meropenem. All isolates were completely inhibited by the ozone-oxygen mixture while growth occurred in the other 2 groups. CONCLUSION: A single topical application by nebulization of a low ozone dose completely inhibited the growth of all potentially pathogenic bacterial strains with known resistance to antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Tissue distribution, expression, and antimicrobial activity of Anas platyrhynchos avian beta-defensin 6.
AB  - In this study, a novel avian beta-defensin (AvBD) was isolated from the Chaohu duck. The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene contained a 204-bp open reading frame that encoded 67 amino acids (aa), including a signal peptide of 20 aa, a propiece of 5 aa, and a mature peptide of 42 aa. The homology, characterization, and comparison of this gene with AvBD from other avian species confirmed that it was duck AvBD6. Also, the preproprotein of AvBD6 from chicken, goose, and duck was highly conserved with 100% aa homology. The AvBD6 mRNA was widely expressed in the investigated tissues of healthy 5-mo-old ducks, with the exception of the skin, kidney, and bursa. The AvBD6 mRNA was highly expressed in the spleen, lung, stomach, tongue, and egg yolk, successively; moderately expressed in the bone marrow and liver; and expressed to lower degrees in the trachea, heart, intestine, muscle, esophagus, and testis. We produced recombinant AvBD6 by expressing the gene in Escherichia coli. The yield of soluble glutathione S-transferees (GST)-AvBD6 in the inclusion bodies increased significantly as the incubation temperature was decreased from 37 to 30 degrees C. As expected, the GST-AvBD6 exhibited strong bactericidal properties [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 0.5 to 2 muM] against the Aeromonas veronii biovar sobria strain BJCP-5, E. coli, and Enterococcus faecalis [ATCC 29212); it possessed medium bactericidal properties (MIC = 4 to 8 muM) against Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enteritidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), and Bacillus subtilis (CMCC 63501;; and it possessed low bactericidal properties (MIC = 16 muM) against Candida albicans (ATCC 10231). Additionally, the antimicrobial activity of GST-AvBD6 proved to be the same as that of synthetic AvBD6. The A. veronii biovar sobria strain BJCP-5 cells that were treated with GST-AvBD6 showed lysis and shrinkage under scanning electron microscopy. The mechanisms of AvBD6-mediated killing of A. veronii biovar sobria involved both cell lysis and nonlysis. Our results indicate that AvBD6 plays an important role in the innate immunity of the Chaohu duck.
TI  - Comparison of Rosco Neo-Sensitabs with Oxoid paper disks in EUCAST disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility testing on Mueller-Hinton agar.
AB  - This study compared Neo-Sensitabs with Oxoid paper disks using the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility test on Mueller-Hinton agar. The EUCAST-recommended quality control strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212) (Part I) and clinical isolates (Part II) were investigated. In Part I of the study, 27 combinations of antimicrobial agents were tested on four quality control strains repeatedly up to 60 times and zone diameters of tablets and disks were compared. In Part II of the study, 351 clinical isolates were included to cover a broad range of species, as well as resistance mechanisms. In Part I, four major deviations (>1 mm outside quality control ranges) were observed with Neo-Sensitabs. In one case with P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (meropenem), there was a corresponding major deviation (2 mm) with the Oxoid disk. The three remaining major deviations with Neo-Sensitabs were observed with meropenem (2 mm) in E. coli ATCC 25922 and with ciprofloxacin (2 mm) and gentamicin (3 mm) in P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. For Oxoid disks, there were only minor deviations (=1 mm outside quality control ranges) in these three cases. In Part II, there were six discrepancies, susceptible versus resistant, in 3,533 comparisons between the two methods with the clinical isolates. The Rosco Neo-Sensitabs appear to be a possible alternative to Oxoid paper disks for EUCAST disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility testing on Mueller-Hinton agar.
TI  - Persistence of bacteria like Pseudomonas aeruginosa in non-healing venous ulcers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is evidence that chronic inflammation due to bacterial wound colonization delays wound healing. OBJECTIVE: In this study, in a Leipzig (Germany) cohort of chronic wound patients, the microbiological spectrum in 2005 and in 2010 was evaluated, as were patients with continuous ulceration sequentially over a decade from 2001-2011. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed the microbial swabs of 126 patients with chronic leg ulcers caused by chronic venous insufficiency. RESULTS: In the cross-sectional analysis in both 2005 and 2010, as well as in the longitudinal analysis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis were respectively the most common pathogens colonizing chronic leg ulcers. In the longitudinal analysis from 2001-2011, the same bacterial species could be identified >/= 3 years consecutively in 20/35 patients. Normally only one or two species could persistently be demonstrated over the years. The subgroup of patients with >/= 3 x confirmation of P. aeruginosa in their swabs showed a longer wound duration compared to all patients in the longitudinal group. CONCLUSION: We registered the persistence of bacteria like P. aeruginosa or S. aureus in consecutive bacterial swabs over the years in individual patients with non-healing venous ulcerations.
TI  - Retrospective study of microorganisms associated with vascular access infections  in hemodialysis patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess microorganisms associated with vascular access-associated infections (VAIs) in hemodialysis patients, with respect to possible origin from the mouth. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective and comparative analysis of the microbes associated with VAI in hemodialysis patients treated during a 10-year period was performed with the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD). RESULTS: Of 218 patient records identified, 65 patients collectively experienced 115 VAI episodes. The most common microorganisms involved were Staphylococcus aureus (49.6% of infections), Staphylococcus epidermidis (10.4%), Serratia marcescens (10.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.6%), and Enterococcus faecalis/fecum (8.7%). None of these was found in >/=1% of HOMD clone libraries, indicating that they very rarely colonize the teeth or plaque. CONCLUSIONS: Most VAIs were associated with microorganisms more likely to originate from other body sites than from the oral cavity. The risk of a VAI being caused by microorganisms originating from the oral cavity is very small.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial and time-kill evaluation of the Erythrina caffra Thunb. extract against bacteria associated with diarrhoea.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of stem bark ethanolic extract of Erythrina caffra Thunb. against bacteria in diarrhoea was determined in vitro by the agar diffusion and dilution, macrobroth dilution, and time-kill assay methods. The result showed that the extract produced inhibition zones ranging between 15 +/- 1.0 mm and 23 +/- 1.0 mm, and the bacteria were susceptible at concentrations ranging between </=100 and </=1000 mug/mL. While the MICs of the extract ranged between 39.1 and 625 mug/mL, and the MBCs ranged between 78.1 and 625 mug/mL, the MICs of Micrococcus luteus, Proteus vulgaris CSIR 0030, Enterococcus faecalis KZN, and Staphylococcus aureus OK(3) were less than 100 mug/mL, and the mechanisms of antibiosis indicated that the crude ethanolic extract was highly bactericidal against the entire test bacteria isolates. In the time-kill assay, the average log reduction of the viable cell count ranged between 0.916 log(1)(0) and 1.851 log(1)(0) cfu/mL on incubating the bacteria for 4 h at the MICs, while the reduction ranged between 0.183 log(1)(0) and 1.105 log(1)(0) cfu/mL after 8 h of incubation. Incubating the bacteria for 4 h at 2 x MICs resulted in the reduction of the viable cell count to between -0.264 log(1)(0) and 0.961 log(1)(0) cfu/mL, while the average log reduction ranged between -3.968 log(1)(0) and -0.425 log(1)(0) cfu/mL after 8 h of incubation with Micrococcus luteus, Proteus vulgaris CSIR 0030, and Staphylococcus aureus OK(3) being the most highly affected bacteria. The result showed that the extract exhibited broader-spectrum antibacterial activity and justifies the use of Erythrina caffra in the folkloric medicine for treating gastrointestinal infections in South Africa.
TI  - Bloodstream infections in immunocompromised hosts.
AB  - Immunocompromised hosts are at high risk for bloodstream infections (BSIs); the outcome is unpredictable (even with adequate therapy), frequently severe (mortality 27%). A 26 months survey in a haematology/oncology hospital was set-up; it comprised 158 patients and detected 171 positive blood cultures. The origin of the infections was primitive in 27.22% and secondary in 72.78% of the cases; the most frequent cause was the presence of a vascular catheter (23.41%). The second most important cause were the respiratory infections (19.62%), followed by the urinary tract infections (UTIs) (11.39%). Gram negative bacilli represented 59.4%, the enterobacteriaceae were predominant (35.59%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.73%) and species like Serratia marcescens and Acinetobacter baumannii. Although isolated at low level, they worry by an increasing frequency. Among Gram positive cocci (43.51%) coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) were the most frequent (25.42%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (18.08%); Enterococcus faecalis (5.65%) was isolated from polymicrobial (associated) infections. The strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa were constantly susceptible to carbapenems, demonstrating otherwise various susceptibility patterns, generally elevated to the antibiotics we tested. The production of extended spectrum betalactamase (ESBL) was 22.58%. The methicillin resistance was 54.4% in S. aureus strains; the susceptibility was variable among 7 other antibiotics tested. One Staphylococcus strain had reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. A multidisciplinary survey is necessary for the control of the multidrug resistant organisms (MDRO).
TI  - Twenty-five years of shared life with vancomycin-resistant enterococci: is it time to divorce?
AB  - Twenty-five years ago, isolation of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREm) was reported both in the UK and in France. Since then, VREm has spread worldwide in hospitals. Hospital outbreaks appeared to be related to the evolution since the end of 1980s of a subpopulation of E. faecium highly resistant to ampicillin and fluoroquinolones (the so-called clonal complex CC17) that later acquired resistance to vancomycin. CC17 isolates are presumably better adapted than other E. faecium isolates to the constraints of the hospital environment and most contain mobile genetic elements, phage genes, genes encoding membrane proteins, regulatory genes, a putative pathogenicity island and megaplasmids. Colonization and persistence are major features of VREm. Inherent characteristics of E. faecium including a remarkable genome plasticity, in part due to acquisition of IS elements, in particular IS16, have facilitated niche adaptation of this distinct E. faecium subpopulation that is multiply resistant to antibiotics. Quinupristin/dalfopristin and linezolid are licensed for the treatment of VREm infections, with linezolid often used as a first-line treatment. However, the emergence of plasmid-mediated resistance to linezolid by production of a Cfr methyltransferase in Enterococcus faecalis is worrying. Daptomycin has not been extensively evaluated for the treatment of VREm infections and resistant mutants have been selected under daptomycin therapy. Although control of VRE is challenging, a laissez-faire policy would result in an increased number of infections and would create an irreversible situation. Although so far unsuccessful, dissemination of glycopeptide-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with van genes acquired from resistant enterococci cannot be ruled out.
TI  - Clinical identification of bacteria in human chronic wound infections: culturing  vs. 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic wounds affect millions of people and cost billions of dollars in the United States each year. These wounds harbor polymicrobial biofilm communities, which can be difficult to elucidate using culturing methods. Clinical molecular microbiological methods are increasingly being employed to investigate the microbiota of chronic infections, including wounds, as part of standard patient care. However, molecular testing is more sensitive than culturing, which results in markedly different results being reported to clinicians. This study compares the results of aerobic culturing and molecular testing (culture-free 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing), and it examines the relative abundance score that is generated by the molecular test and the usefulness of the relative abundance score in predicting the likelihood that the same organism would be detected by culture. METHODS: Parallel samples from 51 chronic wounds were studied using aerobic culturing and 16S DNA sequencing for the identification of bacteria. RESULTS: One hundred forty-five (145) unique genera were identified using molecular methods, and 68 of these genera were aerotolerant. Fourteen (14) unique genera were identified using aerobic culture methods. One-third (31/92) of the cultures were determined to be < 1% of the relative abundance of the wound microbiota using molecular testing. At the genus level, molecular testing identified 85% (78/92) of the bacteria that were identified by culture. Conversely, culturing detected 15.7% (78/497) of the aerotolerant bacteria and detected 54.9% of the collective aerotolerant relative abundance of the samples. Aerotolerant bacterial genera (and individual species including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis) with higher relative abundance scores were more likely to be detected by culture as demonstrated with regression modeling. CONCLUSION: Discordance between molecular and culture testing is often observed. However, culture-free 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing and its relative abundance score can provide clinicians with insight into which bacteria are most abundant in a sample and which are most likely to be detected by culture.
TI  - ZAAPS Program results for 2010: an activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid using clinical isolates from 75 medical centres in 24 countries.
AB  - The Zyvox(R) Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum (ZAAPS) Program monitors the in vitro activities of linezolid and comparator agents for Gram-positive organisms in Latin America, Europe, Canada, and the Asia-Pacific. For the 2010 Program a total of 6305 Gram-positive strains were collected from 75 medical centres on five continents (24 countries). Reference broth microdilution susceptibility tests were performed on organisms from the following groups: Staphylococcus aureus (2875), coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) (855), enterococci (787), Streptococcus pneumoniae (926), viridans group and other streptococci (325), and beta-haemolytic streptococci (507). Linezolid demonstrated a 99.81% susceptibility rate among 6305 strains tested from 24 nations. Of the resistant isolates, four linezolid-resistant strains of enterococci (two each for Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium) were found in four nations (China, Thailand, Germany, and Brazil). Eight CoNS (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis) isolates were observed to be resistant to linezolid (MIC, >/=8 mug/ml). Two strains from Mexico were determined to be from an ongoing epidemic, and investigations showed that isolates from Italy and Brazil were also from circulating resistant clones discovered in earlier years. MRSA rates varied by region and between nations, as did resistances to other potential therapeutic agent options frequently listed for MRSA therapy such as clindamycin, fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. In summary, the 2010 ZAAPS Program demonstrated that linezolid activity remains stable around the world with >99% susceptibility.
TI  - Cardiac device-related endocarditis: 31-Years' experience.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac device-related endocarditis (CDE) is a major complication of  the implantation of a pacemaker and defibrillator. The experience in a single high-volume tertiary center is reported. METHODS: Thirty one years (1980-2011) of cases of CDE were analyzed retrospectively and compared to overall insertion data; the clinical course and management strategies of these patients have been reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 23 cases (16 male, median age 72 years) were identified, 20 of these cases were determined at our institution where 5287 procedures were performed (endocarditis rate 0.38%). Thirteen patients were determined to have a cardiac device pocket infection. Infection in 7 cases (30%) was caused by lead(s). However, in 16 cases (70%) both leads and the pocket of devices were the reason of infection. Median time was 13.5 months for presentation. Patients who had undergone the last procedure within 6 months were admitted earlier than those with longer post procedure time (p<0.05). Transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated lead vegetations in 13 of the 16 cases (81%). Organisms were identified in 18 cases (78%)-78% Staphylococci (56% Staphylococcus aureus). Leads of the device were removed in 17 cases (74%); seven cases by percutaneous simple traction and 10 cases by sternotomy. Six major complications attributable to device-related endocarditis were observed: four deaths (mortality 17.4%); one splenic abscess requiring splenectomy; and one septic pulmonary embolism; median follow-up 49 months. CONCLUSION: A CDE endocarditis rate of 0.38% was demonstrated. It remains a rare but potentially lethal complication of device implantation.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel water-soluble nocathiacin analogs.
AB  - Semi-synthetic water-soluble analogs were synthesized from nocathiacin I through  the formation of a versatile intermediate nocathiacin amine 5, and subsequent transformation via reductive amination, acylation or urea formation. Several of the novel analogs displayed much improved aqueous solubility over 1, while retained antibacterial activity. Compound 15 and 16 from the amide series, demonstrated excellent in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity.
TI  - Chemical composition and biological activities of essential oil from Hyptis crenata growing in the Brazilian cerrado.
AB  - Essential oils from species of the genus Hyptis are well-known for their significant biological properties, including antimicrobial and acaricidal activities. The essential oil from the aerial parts of H. crenata was obtained by hydrodistillation; bomeol (17.8%), 1,8-cineol (15.6%) and p-cimene (7.9%) were characterized by GC-MS as its major constituents. The essential oil was evaluated in vitro for its antimicrobial activities against six fungal and five bacterial strains, by measuring the respective MICs, MFCs and MBCs, using broth microdilution methods. The strongest bactericidal activities were shown against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, while the strongest fungicidal activities were against Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida glabrata and Candida tropicalis. The oil was also assessed for its anti-tick properties and, at a concentration of 2.5%, it significantly inhibited in vivo oviposition of engorged females of the cattle tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, using the adult immersion test., with an effectiveness of 94.4%.
TI  - [Daptomycin for the treatment of gram-positive infections after cardiac surgery].
AB  - BACKGROUND AND METHOD: Surgical infection remains a main cause of death after heart surgery, despite advances in pharmacological therapy. Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic, useful in gram-positive organisms resistant to standard treatment, including vancomycin. The aim of this study was to describe the use of daptomycin regarding efficacy, efficiency and safety in patients with gram-positive infections after heart surgery using a retrospective analysis on 49 adult patients. CONCLUSION: Daptomycin shows excellent in vitro and in vivo activity against gram-positive organisms, such as Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, especially MRSA. Daptomycin is also effective against increasing vancomycin-resistant or vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus.
TI  - Novel carbapenem antibiotics for parenteral and oral applications: in vitro and in vivo activities of 2-aryl carbapenems and their pharmacokinetics in laboratory animals.
AB  - SM-295291 and SM-369926 are new parenteral 2-aryl carbapenems with strong activity against major causative pathogens of community-acquired infections such as methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains), and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (including ciprofloxacin-resistant strains), with MIC(90)s of </= 1 mug/ml. Unlike tebipenem (MIC(50), 8 mug/ml), SM-295291 and SM-369926 had no activity against hospital pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC(50), >/= 128 mug/ml). The bactericidal activities of SM-295291 and SM-369926 against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren. The therapeutic efficacies of intravenous administrations of SM-295291 and SM-369926 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren, respectively, reflecting their in vitro activities. SM-295291 and SM-369926 showed intravenous pharmacokinetics similar to those of meropenem in terms of half-life in monkeys (0.4 h) and were stable against human dehydropeptidase I. SM-368589 and SM-375769, which are medoxomil esters of SM-295291 and SM-369926, respectively, showed good oral bioavailability in rats, dogs, and monkeys (4.2 to 62.3%). Thus, 2-aryl carbapenems are promising candidates that show an ideal broad spectrum for the treatment of community-acquired infections, including infections caused by penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae, have low selective pressure on antipseudomonal carbapenem-resistant nosocomial pathogens, and allow parenteral, oral, and switch therapies.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of pathogens isolated from surgical site infections (SSI) in Japan.
AB  - To investigate the trends of antimicrobial resistance in pathogens isolated from  surgical site infections (SSI), a Japanese surveillance committee conducted the first nationwide survey. Seven main organisms were collected from SSI at 27 medical centers in 2010 and were shipped to a central laboratory for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. A total of 702 isolates from 586 patients with SSI were included. Staphylococcus aureus (20.4 %) and Enterococcus faecalis (19.5 %) were the most common isolates, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.4 %) and Bacteroides fragilis group (15.4 %). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus among S. aureus was 72.0 %. Vancomycin MIC 2 mug/ml strains accounted for 9.7 %. In Escherichia coli, 11 of 95 strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0/53 strains). Of E. coli strains, 8.4 % were resistant to ceftazidime (CAZ) and 26.3 % to ciprofloxacin (CPFX). No P. aeruginosa strains produced metallo-beta-lactamase. In P. aeruginosa, the resistance rates were 7.4 % to tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC), 10.2 % to imipenem (IPM), 2.8 % to meropenem, cefepime, and CPFX, and 0 % to gentamicin. In the B. fragilis group, the rates were 28.6 % to clindamycin, 5.7 % to cefmetazole, 2.9 % to TAZ/PIPC and IPM, and 0 % to metronidazole (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron; 59.1, 36.4, 0, 0, 0 %). MIC(9)(0) of P. aeruginosa isolated 15 days or later after surgery rose in TAZ/PIPC, CAZ, IPM, and CPFX. In patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score >/=3, the resistance rates of P. aeruginosa to TAZ/PIPC and CAZ were higher than in patients with ASA </=2. The data obtained in this study revealed the trend of the spread of resistance among common species that cause SSI. Timing of isolation from surgery and the patient's physical status affected the selection of resistant organisms.
TI  - Rapid identification of Gram-positive pathogens and their resistance genes from positive blood culture broth using a multiplex tandem RT-PCR assay.
AB  - The early initiation of targeted antibiotic therapy in patients with bacteraemia  and septic shock impacts favourably on outcomes. Rapid methods are therefore increasingly employed for bacterial identification directly from positive blood culture bottles, but with variable success. We evaluated the performance of the Gram Positive 12 multiplex tandem PCR (MT-PCR) assay (AusDiagnostics; catalogue no. 6202, version 07) containing targets for the identification of staphylococci including Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococci including Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium and their common antibiotic resistance genes (mecA, vanA, vanB). A total of 673 aerobic and anaerobic blood culture broths demonstrating Gram-positive cocci on microscopy were analysed in parallel with traditional phenotypic methods. Amplification of the internal control was inhibited in 79/673 (11.7 %) samples; however, MT-PCR identification was in concordance with phenotypic identification to the genus level in 96.6 % (537/556) of the remaining monomicrobial specimens and to the species level, where applicable, in 100 % (172/172) of samples. MT-PCR identification for 94.7 % (36/38) of polymicrobial samples matched traditional phenotypic identification. Meticillin and vancomycin susceptibility results determined by MT-PCR in blood culture broths demonstrated complete agreement with those determined by phenotypic methods in all 143 Staphylococcus aureus isolates and eight E. faecium isolates, respectively. Gram-positive pathogens and their key antibiotic resistance markers were reliably identified with the MT-PCR assay within 3 h of a positive blood culture result.
TI  - 3-Phenyl substituted 6,7-dimethoxyisoquinoline derivatives as FtsZ-targeting antibacterial agents.
AB  - The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria has created an urgent need for antibiotics with a novel mechanism of action. The bacterial cell division protein FtsZ is an attractive target for the development of novel antibiotics. The benzo[c]phenanthridinium sanguinarine and the dibenzo[a,g]quinolizin-7-ium berberine are two structurally similar plant alkaloids that alter FtsZ function. The presence of a hydrophobic functionality at either the 1-position of 5-methylbenzo[c]phenanthridinium derivatives or the 2-position of dibenzo[a,g]quinolizin-7-ium derivatives is associated with significantly enhanced antibacterial activity. 3-Phenylisoquinoline represents a subunit within the ring-systems of both of these alkaloids. Several 3-phenylisoquinolines and 3-phenylisoquinolinium derivatives have been synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, including multidrug-resistant strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (VRE). A number of derivatives were found to have activity against both MRSA and VRE. The binding of select compounds to S. aureus FtsZ (SaFtsZ) was demonstrated and characterized using fluorescence spectroscopy. In addition, the compounds were shown to act as stabilizers of SaFtsZ polymers and concomitant inhibitors of SaFtsZ GTPase activity. Toxicological assessment of select compounds revealed minimal cross-reaction mammalian beta-tubulin as well as little or no human cytotoxicity.
TI  - Molecular structure, Normal Coordinate Analysis, harmonic vibrational frequencies, Natural Bond Orbital, TD-DFT calculations and biological activity analysis of antioxidant drug 7-hydroxycoumarin.
AB  - In this work, we report harmonic vibrational frequencies, molecular structure, NBO and HOMO, LUMO analysis of Umbelliferone also known as 7-hydroxycoumarin (7HC). The optimized geometric bond lengths and bond angles obtained by computation (monomer and dimmer) shows good agreement with experimental XRD data. Harmonic frequencies of 7HC were determined and analyzed by DFT utilizing 6-311+G(d,p) as basis set. The assignments of the vibrational spectra have been carried out with the help of Normal Coordinate Analysis (NCA) following the Scaled Quantum Mechanical Force Field Methodology (SQMFF). The change in electron density (ED) in the sigma* and pi* antibonding orbitals and stabilization energies E(2) have been calculated by Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis to give clear evidence of stabilization originating in the hyperconjugation of hydrogen-bonded interaction. The energy and oscillator strength calculated by Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) complements with the experimental findings. The simulated spectra satisfactorily coincides with the experimental spectra. Microbial activity of studied compounds was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Psuedomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi and Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - Proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. Bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. The objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. METHOD: Bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. Proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an ELISA plate reader and zymography. RESULTS: We identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. Of these, six were Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium, and Streptococcus bovis) and seven were Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Serratia marcescens) organisms. Two of these, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, are recognized wound pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. Matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.
TI  - Triterpene saponins of Maesa lanceolata stem wood.
AB  - Phytochemical analysis of aqueous MeOH extract of Maesa lanceolata stem wood has  led to the isolation of four new triterpene saponins characterized as 16alpha,21beta-diacetoxy-22alpha-angeloyl-28-hydroxyolean-12-ene 3-O-[alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-(1'''' --> 6''')-beta-glucopyranosyl-(1''' --> 3')][beta-glucopyranosyl-(1'' --> 2')]-beta-glucuronopyranoside (1), 16alpha-acetoxy-21beta-hydroxy-22alpha-angeloyl-13beta,28-oxydoolean-28alpha-ol 3-O-[alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-(1'''' --> 6''')-beta-glucopyranosyl-(1''' --> 4')][beta-glucopyranosyl-(1'' --> 2')]-alpha-arabinopyranoside (2), 16alpha-acetoxy-21beta,22alpha-diangeloyl-13beta,28-epoxyoleanane 3-O-[alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-(1'''' --> 6''')-beta-glucopyranosyl-(1''' --> 4')][beta-glucopyranosyl-(1'' --> 2')]-beta-xylopyranoside (3), and 16alpha,22alpha-diacetoxy-13beta,28-oxydoolean-28alpha-ol 3-O-[beta-glucopyranosyl-(1'' --> 2')][beta-glucopyranosyl-(1''' --> 3')]-beta-glucuronopyranoside (4), together with the known compounds beta-acetylamyrin, physcion, emodin, chrysophanol, ursolic acid, 16alpha-hydroxy-12-oleanene 3-O-glucoside, beta-amyrin, sitosterol 3-O-beta-glucoside, stigmasterol, and 3beta,28-dihydroxyolean-12-ene. Their structural elucidation was accomplished by homo- and heteronuclear 2D NMR technique as well as comparison with data from known compounds. The in vitro antibacterial activity of the aqueous MeOH extract was also investigated and zones of inhibition ranging from 32 +/- 1.1 to 14 +/- 0.2 mm were observed. Among the isolates, compound 1 was the most active with an minimum inhibitory concentration value of 25 mug/ml against Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - pSK41-like plasmid is necessary for Inc18-like vanA plasmid transfer from Enterococcus faecalis to Staphylococcus aureus in vitro.
AB  - Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) is thought to result from the in vivo conjugative transfer of a vanA plasmid from an Enterococcus sp. to S. aureus. We studied bacterial isolates from VRSA cases that occurred in the United States to identify microbiological factors which may contribute to this plasmid transfer. First, vancomycin-susceptible, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates from five VRSA cases were tested for their ability to accept foreign DNA by conjugation in mating experiments with Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 containing pAM378, a pheromone-response conjugative plasmid. All of the MRSA isolates accepted the plasmid DNA with similar transfer efficiencies ( approximately 10(-7)/donor CFU) except for one isolate, MRSA8, for which conjugation was not successful. The MRSA isolates were also tested as recipients in mating experiments between an E. faecalis isolate with an Inc18-like vanA plasmid that was isolated from a VRSA case patient. Conjugative transfer was successful for 3/5 MRSA isolates. Successful MRSA recipients carried a pSK41-like plasmid, a staphylococcal conjugative plasmid, whereas the two unsuccessful MRSA recipients did not carry pSK41. The transfer of a pSK41-like plasmid from a successful MRSA recipient to the two unsuccessful recipients resulted in conjugal transfer of the Inc18-like vanA plasmid from E. faecalis at a frequency of 10(-7)/recipient CFU. In addition, conjugal transfer could be achieved for pSK41-negative MRSA in the presence of a cell-free culture filtrate from S. aureus carrying a pSK41-like plasmid at a frequency of 10(-8)/recipient CFU. These results indicated that a pSK41-like plasmid can facilitate the transfer of an Inc18-like vanA plasmid from E. faecalis to S. aureus, possibly via an extracellular factor produced by pSK41-carrying isolates.
TI  - Human serum albumin stabilized gold nanoclusters as selective luminescent probes  for Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - In this work, human serum albumin (HSA) stabilized gold nanoclusters (HSA-AuNCs)  with reddish photoluminescence were used as sensing probes for pathogenic bacteria including Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli J96, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, pandrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (PDRAB), Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). We discovered that HSA-AuNCs have unique affinity with S. aureus and MRSA. In addition to demonstrating the selective sensing ability of HSA-AuNCs toward S. aureus and MRSA, the binding peptide motifs identified from HSA-AuNCs were characterized by mass spectrometry. The identified binding peptides were further used as the reducing and stabilizing agents for generation of peptide-bound AuNCs (Pep-AuNCs). The generated Pep-AuNCs were demonstrated to have the binding affinities with S. aureus and MRSA.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the venom of Heterometrus xanthopus.
AB  - Heterometrus xanthopus (Scorpion) is one of the most venomous and ancient arthropods. Its venom contains anti-microbial peptides like hadrurin, scorpine, Pandinin 1, and Pandinin 2 that are able to effectively kill multidrug-resistant pathogens. The present study was conducted to evaluate the anti-bacterial activity of H. xanthopus venom. Six Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains were tested against 1/100, 1/10, and 1/1 fractions of distilled water diluted and crude venom. 1/100 and 1/10 dilutions were not successful in any of the six bacterial strains studied while the 1/1 dilution was effective on Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 with highest zone of inhibition were obtained on B. subtilis. Crude venom was effective against Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 14506, B. subtilis, S. typhimurium, and P. aeruginosa. The most effective results were observed on B. subtilis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of substituted 5-methylbenzo[c]phenanthridinium derivatives.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance has prompted efforts to discover antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action. FtsZ is an essential protein for bacterial cell division, and has been viewed as an attractive target for the development of new antibiotics. Sanguinarine is a benzophenanthridine alkaloid that prevents cytokinesis in bacteria by inhibiting FtsZ self-assembly. In this study, a series of 5-methylbenzo[c]phenanthridinium derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. The data indicate that the presence of a 1- or 12-phenyl substituent on 2,3,8,9-tetramethoxy-5-methylbenzo[c]phenanthridinium chloride significantly enhances antibacterial activity relative to the parent compound or sanguinarine.
TI  - False daptomycin-nonsusceptible MIC results by Microscan panel PC 29 relative to  Etest results for Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci.
AB  - This study correlated the daptomycin MIC results obtained by Microscan and by Etest in Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci and found that the Microscan panel GP 29 had a high rate of false nonsusceptible results. Of the isolates interpreted as nonsusceptible by Microscan, 87% of Staphylococcus aureus, 90% of Enterococcus faecalis, and 88% of Enterococcus faecium isolates were interpreted as susceptible by Etest. In turn, Etest also has false nonsusceptible results compared to reference methods.
TI  - Study of photodynamic effects on NIH 3T3 cell line and bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a constantly growing challenge. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) offers a new approach to the treatment of bacterial and viral diseases. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of photosensitizers used in PDT applied to cell lines and bacterial strains. METHODS: We tested the cytotoxicity and phototoxicity of 3 photosensitizers: TPPS4, ZnTPPS4 and TMPyP applied to the NIH3T3 cell line using two established methods for measuring ROS production and, MTT viability assay. Bacterial viability was determined spectrophotometrically over 24 h following PDT. RESULTS: The most efficient photosensitiser was TMPyP as it reduced the viability of the NIH3T3 cell line by more than 85%. In general, the photosensitisers were more phototoxic to the two Gram-positive bacterial strains, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. The viability of E. faecalis was reduced to 78 % by a dose radiation 0.5 J/cm(2) and concentration of TMPyP 1.562 micromol/L. The viability of bacterium S. aureus was reduced to 23 % when exposed to a radiation dose 0.5 J/cm(2) and 100 micromol/L concentration of ZnTPPS4. The highest viability decrease (15 %) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was caused by 0.5 J/cm(2) radiation dose and 50 micromol/L TMPyP concentration. Escherichia coli proved to be PDT resistant as the bacterial viability was higher than 90%. CONCLUSIONS: The goal of the present study was to test the efficiency of photosensitizers on the NIH 3T3 cell line and bacterial cells. Subsequently we would like to study effectiveness of photosensitizers bound to carriers (for example cyclodextrins) on other cell line and bacterial strain.
TI  - Antibiotic producing microorganisms from River Wiwi, Lake Bosomtwe and the Gulf of Guinea at Doakor Sea Beach, Ghana.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microorganisms have provided a wealth of metabolites with interesting activities such as antimicrobial, antiviral and anticancer. In this study, a total of 119 aquatic microbial isolates from 30 samples (taken from water bodies in Ghana) were screened by the agar-well diffusion method for ability to produce antibacterial-metabolites. RESULTS: Antibacterial activity was exhibited by 27 of the isolates (14 bacteria, 9 actinomycetes and 4 fungi) against at least one of the indicator microorganisms: Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Bacillus thuringiensis (ATCC 13838), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Proteus vulgaris (NCTC 4635) and Bacillus Subtilis (NCTC 10073). A sea isolate MAI2 (identified as a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa) exhibited the highest antibacterial activity (lowest zone of inhibition = 22 mm). The metabolites of MAI2 extracted with chloroform were stable to heat and gave minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging between 250 and 2000 mug/ml. Bioautography of the extract revealed seven active components. CONCLUSION: This study has therefore uncovered the potential of water bodies in the West African sub-region as reservoirs of potent bioactive metabolite producing microorganisms.
TI  - Species-level analysis of DNA sequence data from the NIH Human Microbiome Project.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections emphasize the  importance of surveillance of potentially pathogenic bacteria. Genomic sequencing of clinical microbiological specimens expands our capacity to study cultivable, fastidious and uncultivable members of the bacterial community. Herein, we compared the primary data collected by the NIH's Human Microbiome Project (HMP) with published epidemiological surveillance data of Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS: The HMP's initial dataset contained microbial survey data from five body regions (skin, nares, oral cavity, gut and vagina) of 242 healthy volunteers. A significant component of the HMP dataset was deep sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, which contains variable regions enabling taxonomic classification. Since species-level identification is essential in clinical microbiology, we built a reference database and used phylogenetic placement followed by most recent common ancestor classification to look at the species distribution for Staphylococcus, Klebsiella and Enterococcus. MAIN RESULTS: We show that selecting the accurate region of the 16S rRNA gene to sequence is analogous to carefully selecting culture conditions to distinguish closely related bacterial species. Analysis of the HMP data showed that Staphylococcus aureus was present in the nares of 36% of healthy volunteers, consistent with culture-based epidemiological data. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis were found less frequently, but across many habitats. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates that large 16S rRNA survey studies can be used to support epidemiological goals in the context of an increasing awareness that microbes flourish and compete within a larger bacterial community. This study demonstrates how genomic techniques and information could be critically important to trace microbial evolution and implement hospital infection control.
TI  - Comparative genomics of community-acquired ST59 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Taiwan: novel mobile resistance structures with IS1216V.
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with ST59/SCCmecV and Panton-Valentine leukocidin gene is a major community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) lineage in Taiwan and has been multidrug-resistant since its initial isolation. In this study, we studied the acquisition mechanism of multidrug resistance in an ST59 CA-MRSA strain (PM1) by comparative genomics. PM1's non-beta-lactam resistance was encoded by two unique genetic traits. One was a 21,832-bp composite mobile element structure (MES(PM1)), which was flanked by direct repeats of enterococcal IS1216V and was inserted into the chromosomal sasK gene; the target sequence (att) was 8 bp long and was duplicated at both ends of MES(PM1). MES(PM1) consisted of two regions: the 5'-end side 12.4-kb region carrying Tn551 (with ermB) and Tn5405-like (with aph[3']-IIIa and aadE), similar to an Enterococcus faecalis plasmid, and the 3'-end side 6,587-bp region (MES(cat)) that carries cat and is flanked by inverted repeats of IS1216V. MES(cat) possessed att duplication at both ends and additional two copies of IS1216V inside. MES(PM1) represents the first enterococcal IS1216V-mediated composite transposon emerged in MRSA. IS1216V-mediated deletion likely occurred in IS1216V-rich MES(PM1), resulting in distinct resistance patterns in PM1-derivative strains. Another structure was a 6,025-bp tet-carrying element (MES(tet)) on a 25,961-bp novel mosaic penicillinase plasmid (pPM1); MES(tet) was flanked by direct repeats of IS431, but with no target sequence repeats. Moreover, the PM1 genome was deficient in a copy of the restriction and modification genes (hsdM and hsdS), which might have contributed to the acquisition of enterococcal multidrug resistance.
TI  - Epidemiology of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis: a case-case-control study.
AB  - Although much is known about vancomycin-resistant (VR) Enterococcus faecium, little is known about the epidemiology of VR Enterococcus faecalis. The predilection of VR E. faecalis to transfer the vancomycin resistance determinant to Staphylococcus aureus is much greater than that of VR E. faecium. The epidemiology of VR E. faecalis has important implications regarding the emergence of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA); 8 of 13 reported VRSA cases have been from Michigan. A retrospective case-case-control study was conducted at the Detroit Medical Center, located in southeastern Michigan. Unique patients with VR E. faecalis infection were matched to patients with strains of vancomycin-susceptible (VS) E. faecalis and to uninfected controls at a 1:1:1 ratio. Five hundred thirty-two VR E. faecalis cases were identified and were matched to 532 VS E. faecalis cases and 532 uninfected controls. The overall mean age of the study cohort (n = 1,596) was 63.0 +/- 17.4 years, and 747 (46.8%) individuals were male. Independent predictors for the isolation of VR E. faecalis (but not VS E. faecalis) compared to uninfected controls were an age of >/=65 years, nonhome residence, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, exposure to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones in the prior 3 months, and immunosuppressive status. Invasive procedures and/or surgery, chronic skin ulcers, and indwelling devices were risk factors for both VR E. faecalis and VS E. faecalis isolation. Cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone exposures were unique, independent predictors for isolation of VR E. faecalis. A majority of case patients had VR E. faecalis present at the time of admission. Control of VR E. faecalis, and ultimately VRSA, will likely require regional efforts focusing on infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship.
TI  - A comparative study to determine the recovery rate of microorganisms of bloodstream infections: two versus three blood culture specimens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There has been a development of automated and continuous-monitoring blood culture systems that are more sensitive than conventional systems for the detection of microorganisms. Whether two or three blood culture specimens obtained during a 24-hour period using these automated systems achieving a higher recovery rate of microorganism remains to be determined. The present study was aimed to compare the recovery rates of microorganism of blood-stream infections (BSIs) using two and three blood culture specimens. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective investigator-blinded study was carried out in patients who needed to have blood cultures in medicine wards and intensive care units as well as an emergency room of King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between October 1, 2010 and March 31, 2011. Three blood culture specimens were obtained from each patient during a 24-hour period. Each specimen was inoculated into an aerobic bottle of blood culture broth (TREK Diagnostics, Cleveland, OH, US), and then incubated at 37 degrees C for seven days. RESULTS: Of 568 patients, there were 116 (20.4%) unimicrobial episodes with three blood cultures obtained during a 24-hour period. There were 70 (12.3%) and 46 (8.1%) episodes of true pathogen and contaminant, respectively. The recovery rates of true pathogen were 75.7% (53 isolates), 87.1% (61 isolates), and 100% (70 isolates) with the first, second, and third blood culture specimens, respectively (p < 0.05 between the recovery rate with the first two and the third blood culture specimens). There were 25 (35.7%), 38 (58.6%) isolates, and four (5.7%) of Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi, respectively. Among 25 Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus was the most common isolate (10, 14.3%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (5, 7.1%) and Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (3, 10% each). Among 38 Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most common isolate (13, 18. 6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8, 11.4%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6, 8.6%). The sensitivity and specificity of the recovery rate of microorganisms using two blood culture specimens were 85.7% and 92.3%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the recovery rate of microorganisms using three blood culture specimens were 100% and 90.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: To the best of the authors'knowledge, the present study is the first prospective study to compare the recovery rate of microorganisms of BSIs between the two and three blood culture specimens using the VersaTREK blood culture system. Three blood culture specimens are required to achieve the recovery rate of more than 99%.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of substituted dibenzo[a,g]quinolizin-7-ium derivatives.
AB  - Berberine is a substituted dibenzo[a,g]quinolizin-7-ium derivative whose modest antibiotic activity is derived from its disruptive impact on the function of the essential bacterial cell division protein FtsZ. The present study reveals that the presence of a biphenyl substituent at either the 2- or 12-position of structurally-related dibenzo[a,g]quinolizin-7-ium derivatives significantly enhances antibacterial potency versus Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Studies with purified S. aureus FtsZ demonstrate that both 2- and 12-biphenyl dibenzo[a,g]quinolizin-7-ium derivatives act as enhancers of FtsZ self-polymerization.
TI  - Antifungal activity and composition of essential oils of Conyza canadensis herbs  and roots.
AB  - Essential oils from herbs and roots of Conyza canadensis (horseweed), collected in Hungary, were obtained by hydrodistillation. The chemical compositions of the oils were analysed by combination of GC and GC/MS. The major constituent of the oil obtained from the aerial parts of horseweed was limonene (78%), while the main component of root oil was 2Z,8Z-matricaria ester. The antimicrobial activities of the oils were tested on Gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes), Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria, reference fungal strains, and fungal strains isolated from patients (Candida, Cryptococcus, Trichophyton, Rhodotorula, and Aspergillus) by agar disc diffusion and broth dilution methods. None of the oils showed any activity against the tested bacterial strains, but exhibited moderate-to-strong activity against all fungi with the only exception of A. fumigatus. The highest zone of inhibition was observed in case of Cryptococcus neoformans and Trichophyton interdigitalis.
TI  - The changing epidemiology of bacteraemias in Europe: trends from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System.
AB  - We investigated bacteraemia trends for five major bacterial pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, and determined how expanding antimicrobial resistance influenced the total burden of bacteraemias in Europe. Aetiological fractions of species and antibiotic phenotypes were extracted from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS) database for laboratories, which consistently reported between 2002 and 2008. Trend analyses used generalized linear models. Robustness of results was assessed by iterative analysis for different geographic regions. From 2002 to 2008, the overall number of reports increased annually by 6.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.2-6.5%), from 46 095 to 67 876. In the subset of laboratories providing denominator information, the overall incidence increased from 0.58/1000 patient-days to 0.90/1000 patient-days (7.2% per year; 95% CI 6.9-7.5%). The frequency of reported bacteraemia isolates of S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae increased moderately, while increase in E. coli and Enterococcus faecium was more pronounced. Bacteraemias caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus increased until 2005 (7.6% per year; 95% CI 6.1-9.1%), and then decreased (-4.8% per year; 95% CI -6.1 to -3.5%), whereas the number attributable to methicillin-sensitive S. aureus increased continuously (3.4% per year; 95% CI 3.0-3.7). Increasing rates of E. coli were mainly caused by antibiotic-resistant phenotypes. Our data suggest that the burden of bacterial bloodstream infection has been increasing for all species during EARSS surveillance. Trends were mainly driven by resistant strains and clearly dissociated between resistant and susceptible isolates. It appears that infections with resistant clones add to rather than replace infections caused by susceptible bacteria. As a consequence, expansion of antibiotic resistance creates an additional strain on healthcare systems.
TI  - The effect of a wound care solution containing polyhexanide and betaine on bacterial counts: results of an in vitro study .
AB  - Polyhexanide and betaine topical solution is used in the management of infected wounds as a cleaning agent. An in vitro study was conducted to examine the antimicrobial effects of a solution containing 0.1% of the antimicrobial agent polyhexanide and 0.1% of the surfactant betaine. Three batches of each product were tested, and culture results of 13 microorganisms were evaluated after 7, 14, and 28 days using USP <51> methodology. Growth reduction was identical at each day following exposure to the solution in all micro-organisms except Aspergillus brasiliensis. A range of 5.3-log to 5.8-log reduction was seen for the following micro-organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Candida albicans, S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, and E. faecalis. For A. brasiliensis, reductions were 2.1-log, 2.3-log and 2.8-log at 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively. The results of this study indicate a 4+ log inhibition of activity in 12 of 13 micro-organisms exposed to the solution. Research to elucidate the potential clinical effects of these observations is needed.
TI  - Impact of pH on activity of trimethoprim, fosfomycin, amikacin, colistin and ertapenem in human urine.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although major impairment of activity at lower pH values has been reported for fluoroquinolones, acidification is a widely recommended practice for the prophylaxis and treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). Until now, there is little evidence for the influence of pH on the activity on other antimicrobial classes in urine. METHODS: Bacterial growth curves of Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Klebsiella oxytoca (ATCC 700324), Proteus mirabilis (ATCC 14153), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) were performed in Mueller-Hinton broth and in pooled human urine with a pH of between 5.0 and 8.0. Bacterial killing of trimethoprim, fosfomycin, amikacin, colistin and ertapenem against the five strains (where appropriate) was determined consecutively at concentrations equal to the MIC. RESULTS: While no difference in the bacterial growth of E. coli, S. aureus, P. mirabilis and K. oxytoca was observed at different pH values, bacterial growth of E. faecalis was significantly reduced at low pH. Acidification to pH 5 impaired the antimicrobial activity of all investigated antibiotics, i.e. the net effect of bacterial growth and killing resulted in increased colony-forming units/ml at the end of the experiment. CONCLUSION: The present in vitro findings indicate that acidification of urine during the treatment of UTIs should be carefully considered. While growth curves of one strain supports the concept of therapeutic or prophylactic acidification during UTIs, the most common pathogen, E. coli, was not affected by low pH. Independent of the investigated strain or antibiotic, pH values below 6 lead to a reduction of antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Computer keyboard covers impregnated with a novel antimicrobial polymer significantly reduce microbial contamination.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Contaminated computer keyboards have been acknowledged as a potential source for bacterial transmission between health care providers and patients. Biosafe HM 4100 is an antimicrobial polymer that can be incorporated into the polyurethane material used to make keyboard covers. This study aimed to determine whether plastic keyboard covers containing HM 4100 effectively minimize the survival of bacterial species commonly present on health care environmental surfaces. METHODS: Polyurethane material that contained 0.5% HM 4100, 1% HM 4100, and 1% HM 4100 with spray coating of 1% HM 4100 were tested. In 2 separate experiments, the surfaces of test materials were inoculated with suspensions of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VREF), Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Viability was assessed on the materials at 0, 10, 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes after inoculation. RESULTS: Maximum reductions in viability were observed for all 4 organisms at the longest tested time period on each test material. Mean reductions on the 0.5% HM 4100 material at 240 minutes were 99.99% for E coli, 97.8% for MRSA, 95.0% for VREF, and 92.1% for P aeruginosa. Mean reductions on the 1% HM 4100 at 120 minutes were 99.9% for VREF, 99.9% for MRSA, 99.9% for P aeruginosa, and 99.5% for E coli. Mean reductions on the 1% HM 4100 plus spray coating at 30 minutes were 99.9% for E coli, 99.8% for VREF, 98.8% for P aeruginosa, and 97.2% for MRSA. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporation of the HM 4100 antimicrobial polymer into polyurethane keyboard material may reduce the hand carriage of bacteria between health care providers and patients.
TI  - The furan route to tropolones: probing the antiproliferative effects of beta-thujaplicin analogs.
AB  - A direct route to analogs of the naturally occurring tropolone beta-thujaplicin has been developed in just four steps from furan. Using this method, a series of derivatives were synthesized and evaluated. Several of these compounds demonstrated very high levels of potency against bacterial and fungal pathogens with good selectivity over mammalian cells.
TI  - A case of daptomycin-induced immune thrombocytopenia.
AB  - We report a case of severe daptomycin-induced immune thrombocytopenia in a patient treated for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia acquired in an intensive care unit. Serum antibodies bound to platelets in the presence of daptomycin on flow cytometry. There was no evidence of other causes of thrombocytopenia. The patient died of brain herniation complicating extensive cerebral hemorrhage. To our knowledge, this is the first described case of daptomycin-induced thrombocytopenia.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Lippia grandis Schauer (Verbenaceae) from the western Amazon.
AB  - Lippia grandis Schauer is an aromatic plant that has been used as a spice in Brazilian culinary and in traditional medicine to treat liver disease, disorders of the stomach and throat infections. We determined the chemical composition of the essential oil of L. grandis and evaluated its potential for the treatment of clinically-important pathogenic micro-organisms. The essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), giving carvacrol (37.12%), rho-cymene (11.64%), and thymol (7.83%) as the main components. The agar disk diffusion method of the essential oil was effective against 75% of the micro-organisms analyzed, in particular, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Escherichia coli. The minimum inhibitory concentration was 0.57 mg/ml for E. faecalis and 1.15 mg/ml for all the other strains. The results indicate that the essential oil of L. grandis contains chemical compounds with good potential for the treatment of infections.
TI  - Antibacterial mechanisms of rhodomyrtone against important hospital-acquired antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial mechanisms of rhodomyrtone, a member of the acylphloroglucinols isolated from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa leaves, against important hospital-acquired antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria were assessed. The results indicated that rhodomyrtone exhibited pronounced antibacterial activity against key antibiotic-resistant pathogens including epidemic meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (EMRSA), vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcal strains. The strains EMRSA-16, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and VRE-3 demonstrated a significant decrease in survival ability after treatment with rhodomyrtone at 1x (0.5 microg ml(-1)), 2x, 4x and 8x MIC for 24 h. Moreover, the compound was observed in the cytoplasmic fraction of rhodomyrtone-treated S. aureus, and only a very fine band of the compound was seen following separation of the cell-wall and cell-membrane fractions of the treated cells. In addition, exposure of S. aureus to rhodomyrtone at 4x, 2x and 1x MIC for 24 h produced no significant effect on the bacterial cell membrane and cell lysis, suggesting that neither of these is the main target of rhodomyrtone action in these organisms. Stepwise isolation of the bacterial cells with increasing resistance to rhodomyrtone was not induced in either S. aureus or EMRSA-16 after 45 passages on Luria-Bertani agar supplemented with rhodomyrtone. In addition, in vitro toxicity of rhodomyrtone at 128x MIC on human erythrocytes was not observed. These results provide evidence to support therapeutic challenges of rhodomyrtone against Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Synergistic bactericidal activity between hyperosmotic stress and membrane-disrupting nanoemulsions.
AB  - There is a clear clinical need for alternative types of non-antibiotic biocides due to the rising global health concern of microbial drug resistance. In this work, a novel antibacterial concept was delineated that utilized hyperosmotic stress (H) in concert with membrane-disrupting nanoemulsions (NEs). The antibacterial effects of either H or a NE, as well as in combination (H+NE), were assessed in vitro using an Escherichia coli model. It was found that exposure to H or NE alone produced dose-dependent bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects, respectively. However, the bactericidal action of NE was significantly amplified in the presence of H. Outcomes following H+NE exposure included rapid efflux of K(+) and nucleic acids, increased membrane permeability and a reduction in both intracellular ATP and cell viability. Further inspection of morphology by electron microscopy highlighted cell shrinkage, membrane dissolution and bacteriolysis. Pathogen inactivation occurred immediately upon contact with H+NE. The effects of H, NE and H+NE against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and meticillin-resistant S. aureus isolates were also examined. Similar to the Escherichia coli model, H+NE showed antibacterial synergism in these organisms when classified by the Chou-Talalay combination index for two-agent interactions. This synergistic interaction suggests that the H+NE platform may potentially serve as a new paradigm in disinfectants, antiseptics and antibacterial wound dressings. The H+NE mechanism of action was termed osmopermeation, as a descriptor for the underlying inactivation process.
TI  - Retention of antimicrobial activity after reconstitution of doxycycline gel.
AB  - Doxycycline gel is licensed for the treatment of periodontal disease in dogs. Package labeling indicates the product is stable after reconstitution of antibiotic with polymer gel for up to 3-days when stored at room temperature. The purpose of this study was to determine if reconstituted doxycycline gel retained antimicrobial activity for greater than 3-days. The antibiotic activity of reconstituted doxycycline gel was evaluated against antimicrobial testing strains of bacteria and bacteria collected from throat swabs of 2 dogs using a standard disc diffusion assay. Our results showed that reconstituted doxycycline gel retained undiminished antimicrobial activity for a minimum of 8-weeks.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oil of different parts of Seseli rigidum.
AB  - The chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of the Balkan endemic species Seseli rigidum Waldst. & Kit. (Apiaceae) was investigated. The monoterpene alpha-pinene was predominant in the volatile oil from aerial parts (57.4%) and fruit (23.3%). In the essential oil of the aerial parts limonene (6.7%), camphene (5.8%) and sabinene (5.5%) were also present in high amounts, and in the fruit oil, beta-phellandrene (17.4%) and sabinene (12.9%). On the contrary, the root essential oil was composed almost entirely of the polyacetylene falcarinol (88.8%). The antimicrobial activity of the root essential oil was significant against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis (MICs 6.25-25.00 microg/mL). Volatile constituents from the root strongly inhibited the growth of methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus (MICs 6.25-50.00 microg/mL). Anti-staphylococcal activity can be attributed to the main volatile constituent ofS. rigidum root, falcarinol.
TI  - Phytochemical profiles of volatile constituents from Centaurea ragusina leaves and flowers and their antimicrobial effects.
AB  - The volatile oils obtained from the leaves and flowers of the Croatian endemic plant Centaurea ragusina L. were evaluated for antimicrobial activity. The chemical compositions, determined by GC and GC-MS, were complex, with sesquiterpenes the most abundant class of compound. Nonterpene hydrocarbons were also identified in high quantities, while acids and ketones were found in high quantities only in the leaf volatile oil. Aldehydes, alcohols, esters and other compounds were identified in lower quantities. Antimicrobial effects of the volatile samples were investigated by using the disc diffusion and microdilution assays. They were found to inhibit a wide range of bacteria and fungi, causing in vitro growth inhibition at a concentration of 250 microg/mL. The volatile oils displayed great antibacterial potential with MIC values ranging from 16 to 128 microg/mL against the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus, and lesser activity against the Gram-negative bacteria Cronobacter sakazakii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as fungal strains (MIC = 32-128 microg/mL).
TI  - Coordination of thiosemicarbazones and bis(thiosemicarbazones) to bismuth(III) as a strategy for the design of metal-based antibacterial agents.
AB  - Complexes [Bi(2Fo4Ph)Cl(2)] (1), [Bi(2Ac4Ph)Cl(2)] (2), [Bi(2Bz4Ph)Cl(2)] (3), [Bi(H(2)Gy3DH)Cl(3)] (4), [Bi(H(2)Gy4Et)(OH)(2)Cl] (5), and [Bi(H(2)Gy4Ph)Cl(3)] (6) were prepared with pyridine-2-carbaldehyde 4-phenylthiosemicarbazone (H2Fo4Ph), 1-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanone 4-phenylthiosemicarbazone (H2Ac4Ph), phenyl(pyridin-2-yl)methanone 4-phenylthiosemicarbazone (H2Bz4Ph), as well as with glyoxaldehyde bis(thiosemicarbazone) (H(2)Gy4DH) and its 4-Et (H(2)Gy4Et) and 4-Ph (H(2)Gy4Ph) derivatives. The complexes exhibited antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Coordination to Bi(III) proved to be an effective strategy to increase the antibacterial activity of the thiosemicarbazones and bis(thiosemicarbazones).
TI  - Structural and functional characterization of VanG D-Ala:D-Ser ligase associated  with vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - d-Alanyl:d-lactate (d-Ala:d-Lac) and d-alanyl:d-serine ligases are key enzymes in vancomycin resistance of Gram-positive cocci. They catalyze a critical step in the synthesis of modified peptidoglycan precursors that are low binding affinity targets for vancomycin. The structure of the d-Ala:d-Lac ligase VanA led to the understanding of the molecular basis for its specificity, but that of d-Ala:d-Ser ligases had not been determined. We have investigated the enzymatic kinetics of the d-Ala:d-Ser ligase VanG from Enterococcus faecalis and solved its crystal structure in complex with ADP. The overall structure of VanG is similar to that of VanA but has significant differences mainly in the N-terminal and central domains. Based on reported mutagenesis data and comparison of the VanG and VanA structures, we show that residues Asp-243, Phe-252, and Arg-324 are molecular determinants for d-Ser selectivity. These residues are conserved in both enzymes and explain why VanA also displays d-Ala:d-Ser ligase activity, albeit with low catalytic efficiency in comparison with VanG. These observations suggest that d-Ala:d-Lac and d-Ala:d-Ser enzymes have evolved from a common ancestral d-Ala:d-X ligase. The crystal structure of VanG showed an unusual interaction between two dimers involving residues of the omega loop that are deeply anchored in the active site. We constructed an octapeptide mimicking the omega loop and found that it selectively inhibits VanG and VanA but not Staphylococcus aureus d-Ala:d-Ala ligase. This study provides additional insight into the molecular evolution of d-Ala:d-X ligases and could contribute to the development of new structure-based inhibitors of vancomycin resistance enzymes.
TI  - Carnosic acid is an efflux pumps modulator by dissipation of the membrane potential in Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Bacterial resistance to antibiotics has become a serious problem of public health. Along with the controlled permeability by the cell-wall, active efflux systems can provide resistance by extruding antibiotics. Carnosic acid is capable to potentiate the antimicrobial activity of several antibiotics. However, the underlying molecular mechanism governing this effect remains unclear. The present study aims to investigate the effect of carnosic acid on the transport of ethidium bromide, on the permeability or the membrane potential in Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. By using fluorimetric assays it was demonstrated that in E. faecalis, carnosic acid is a modulator of the uptake and efflux of ethidium bromide which does not induce cell membrane permeabilization phenomena. Such effect was sensitive to the inhibition caused by both the proton-motive force carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and the calcium antagonist verapamil, but not to vanadate, an ATPase inhibitor. In this work it was demonstrated, for the first time, that the activity of carnosic acid on the uptake/efflux of ethidium bromide is correlated with its capacity to change the membrane potential gradient in S. aureus and E. faecalis. In conclusion, carnosic acid is a natural compound, structurally unrelated to known antibiotics, which can function as an efflux pump modulator by dissipation of the membrane potential. Therefore, carnosic acid would be a good candidate to be employed as a novel therapeutic agent to be used in combination therapies against drug-resistant enterococci and S. aureus infections.
TI  - Killer toxin from a novel killer yeast Pichia kudriavzevii RY55 with idiosyncratic antibacterial activity.
AB  - The killer phenomenon of yeast may have technological implications in many areas  like beverage fermentation, food technology, biological control in agriculture, and in medicine. In the present study the killer phenomenon in Pichia kudriavzevii (P. kudriavzevii RY55) is being reported for the first time. The P. kudriavzevii RY55 toxin exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against several pathogens of human health significance such as Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas alcaligenes. Killer toxin was purified to homogeneity by using ammonium sulphate precipitation and ion exchange chromatography and characterized for few properties. P. kudriavzevii RY55 killer toxin may be of vast significance in the development of novel antimicrobial chemotherapeutic agents, new bio-based safer candidates for food preservation and biocontrol, and starter cultures for fermentation industries.
TI  - Device-associated infection rates, device utilization, and antimicrobial resistance in long-term acute care hospitals reporting to the National Healthcare Safety Network, 2010.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate national data on healthcare-associated infections (HAIs),  device utilization, and antimicrobial resistance in long-term acute care hospitals (LTACHs). DESIGN AND SETTING: Comparison of data from LTACHs and from medical and medical-surgical intensive care units (ICUs) in short-stay acute care hospitals reporting to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) during 2010. METHODS: Rates of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) as well as device utilization ratios were calculated. For each HAI, pathogen profiles and antimicrobial resistance prevalence were evaluated. Comparisons were made using Poisson regression and the mood median and chi2 tests. RESULTS: In 2010, 104 LTACHs reported CLABSIs and 57 reported CAUTIs and VAP to the NHSN. Median CLABSI rates in LTACHs (1.25 events per 1,000 device-days reported; range, 0.0-5.96) were comparable to rates in major teaching ICUs and were higher than those in other ICUs. CAUTI rates in LTACHs (median, 2.61; range, 0.0-9.92) were higher and VAP rates (median, 0.0; range, 0.0-3.29) were generally lower than those in ICUs. Central line utilization in LTACHs was higher than that in ICUs, whereas urinary catheter and ventilator utilization was lower. Methicillin resistance among Staphylococcus aureus CLABSIs (83%) and vancomycin resistance among Enterococcus faecalis CAUTIs (44%) were higher in LTACHs than in ICUs. Multidrug resistance among Pseudomonas aeruginosa CAUTIs (25%) was higher in LTACHs than in most ICUs. CONCLUSIONS: CLABSIs and CAUTIs associated with multidrug-resistant organisms present a challenge in LTACHs. Continued HAI surveillance with pathogen-level data can guide prevention efforts in LTACHs.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a range of probiotics against pathogens: evidence for the effects of organic acids.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial properties of fifteen  selected strains belonging to the Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Lactococcus, Streptococcus and Bacillus genera against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. In vitro antibacterial activity was initially investigated by an agar spot method. Results from the agar spot test showed that most of the selected strains were able to produce active compounds on solid media with antagonistic properties against Salmonella Typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile. These results were also confirmed when cell-free culture supernatants (CFCS) from the putative probiotics were used in an agar well diffusion assay. Neutralization of the culture supernatants with alkali reduced the antagonistic effects. These experiments are able to confirm the capacity of potential probiotics to inhibit selected pathogens. One of the main inhibitory mechanisms may result from the production of organic acids from glucose fermentation and consequent lowering of culture pH. This observation was confirmed when the profile of organic acids was analysed demonstrating that lactic and acetic acid were the principal end products of probiotic metabolism. Furthermore, the assessment of the haemolytic activity and the susceptibility of the strains to the most commonly used antimicrobials, considered as basic safety aspects, were also studied. The observed antimicrobial activity was mainly genus-specific, additionally significant differences could be observed among species.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of filamentous fungi isolated from highly antibiotic-contaminated river sediment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Filamentous fungi are well known for their production of substances with antimicrobial activities, several of which have formed the basis for the development of new clinically important antimicrobial agents. Recently, environments polluted with extraordinarily high levels of antibiotics have been documented, leading to strong selection pressure on local sentinel bacterial communities. In such microbial ecosystems, where multidrug-resistant bacteria are likely to thrive, it is possible that certain fungal antibiotics have become less efficient, thus encouraging alternative strategies for fungi to compete with bacteria. METHODS: In this study, sediment of a highly antibiotic-contaminated Indian river was sampled in order to investigate the presence of cultivable filamentous fungi and their ability to produce substances with antimicrobial activity. RESULTS: Sixty one strains of filamentous fungi, predominantly various Aspergillus spp. were identified. The majority of the Aspergillus strains displayed antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans. Bioassay-guided isolation of the secondary metabolites of A. fumigatus led to the identification of gliotoxin. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated proof of principle of using bioassay-guided isolation for finding bioactive molecules.
TI  - Activity of oritavancin against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and beta-haemolytic streptococci collected from western European countries in 2011.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the activity of oritavancin against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and beta-haemolytic streptococci recently isolated from acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections or bacteraemia in western Europe. METHODS: Forty-one centres in Spain (8), Italy (9), Germany (8), France (8) and the UK (8) submitted 866 isolates [204 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 177 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS), 101 VRE, 193 Streptococcus agalactiae and 191 Streptococcus pyogenes] that were collected during the first 6 months of 2011. These were re-identified and susceptibilities to oritavancin and comparators were determined. RESULTS: Oritavancin was very active against MRSA (MIC(50)/MIC(90) 0.03/0.06 mg/L), MRCoNS (0.06/0.12 mg/L), VRE (0.03/0.06 mg/L), S. agalactiae (0.03/0.06 mg/L) and S. pyogenes (0.06/0.25 mg/L). The highest oritavancin MIC observed was 0.25 mg/L (species were S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis). CONCLUSIONS: These data from recently collected Gram-positive bacteria in western Europe confirm the potent in vitro activity of oritavancin against a wide range of resistant MRSA, MRCoNS and VRE isolates, including ones resistant to newer agents.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  - The aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella enterica ser. Enteritidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. The tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. In the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. Due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the pH values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. The inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. Phosphates obviously made the development of most Gram-positive bacteria impossible. Especially Micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. On the other hand, Gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. The exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. It should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates HEXA68 and HEXA70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. By comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on pH values.
TI  - Possible ecological role of pseudopterosins G and P-U and seco-pseudopterosins J  and K from the gorgonian Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae from Providencia Island (SW Caribbean) in regulating microbial surface communities.
AB  - The gorgonian Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae collected at Providencia Island (Colombia) has an unfouled surface, free of obvious algal and invertebrate growth. This gorgonian produces significant amounts of the glycosilated diterpenes pseudopterosins and seco-pseudopterosins (Ps and seco-Ps). Our previous experiments have shown activity of these compounds against eukaryotic (human cancer cell lines and Candida albicans) and prokaryotic cells (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis). However, the potential role of pseudopterosins on the regulation of the fouling process is still under study. We evaluated the activity of these compounds against bacteria isolated from heavily fouled marine surfaces as an indicator of antifouling activity. Additionally, we assessed their activity against bacteria isolated from P. elisabethae to determine whether potentially they play a role in preventing surface bacterial colonization, thus impairing presumptively the establishment of further successional stages of fouling communities. Results showed that Ps and seco-Ps seem to modulate bacterial growth (controlling Gram-positive bacterial growth and inducing Gram-negative bacterial associations). We thus hypothesized that Ps and seco-Ps may play a role in controlling microbial fouling communities on the surface of this gorgonian. By using bTEFAP and FISH we showed that the most abundant bacteria present in the microbial communities associated with P. elisabethae are Gram-negative bacteria, with Proteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria the most representative. To evaluate whether Ps and seco-Ps have a direct effect on the structure of the bacterial community associated with P. elisabethae, we tested these compounds against culturable bacteria associated with the surface of P. elisabethae, finding remarkable selectivity against Gram-positive bacteria. The evidence presented here suggests that Ps and seco-Ps might have a role in the selection of organisms associated with the gorgonian surface and in the regulation of the associated bacterial community composition.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of conventional root canal medicaments vs propolis against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate and compare antimicrobial effect of various root canal medicaments against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six root canal medicaments: 2% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), 2% chlorhexidine (CHX) Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2), EDTA, MTAD and propolis and three microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans were used. These strains were inoculated in brain heart infusion (BHI) and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. For the agar diffusion test (ADT), petri plates with 20 ml of BHI agar were inoculated with 0.1 ml of the microbial suspensions, using sterile swabs that were spread on the medium, obtaining growth injunction. Paper disks were immersed in the experimental solutions for 1 minute. Subsequently, four papers disks containing one of the substances were placed on the BHI agar surface in each agar plate. The plates were incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. The diameter of microbial inhibition was measured around the papers disks containing the substances. One way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc test were used. p-value >0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Propolis and other irrigants were found to be effective on C. albicans, S. aureus and E. faecalis. CHX and MTAD were found to be most effective amongst all the materials tested followed by propolis. CONCLUSION: Propolis showed antimicrobial activity against E. faecalis, S. aureus, C. albicans. It appears that propolis is an effective intracanal irrigant in eradicating E. faecalis and C. albicans. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Propolis is an effective intracanal irrigant in eradicating E. faecalis and C. albicans. It could be used as an alternative intracanal medicament.
TI  - The antimicrobial, antioxidative, anti-inflammatory activity and cytotoxicity of  different fractions of four South African Bauhinia species used traditionally to treat diarrhoea.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE: Many Bauhinia species, including those indigenous to South Africa, are used in traditional medicine across the world for treating ailments such as gastrointestinal tract (GIT) disorders, diabetes, infectious diseases and inflammation. AIMS: Several relevant aspects of different fractions of leaf extracts of Bauhinia bowkeri (BAB), Bauhinia galpinii (BAG), Bauhinia petersiana (BAP), and Bauhinia variegata (BAV) used in South African traditional medicine to alleviate diarrhoea related symptoms were evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antioxidative activities of the extracts were determined using the 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2, 2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS(+)) radical scavenging and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) methods. In vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts were determined against bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis) and clinical isolates of the opportunistic fungal strains (Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, and Cryptococcus neoformans) using a serial dilution microplate method. The polyphenolic contents were quantified using standard methods, and anti-inflammatory activities of the crude extracts were determined using the cyclooxygenase and soybean 15-lipoxygenase enzyme inhibitory assays. The safety of the extracts was evaluated by determining the cytotoxicity against Vero cell lines. RESULTS: The acidified 70% acetone crude extract and their fractions had good antiradical potency against the DPPH and ABTS radicals. The methanol soluble portions of the butanol fractions were more potent (EC(50) ranges from 0.64 +/- 0.05 to 1.51 +/- 0.07 and 0.88 +/- 0.18 to 1.49 +/- 0.09 mug/ml against DPPH and ABTS radical respectively) compared to the standard, trolox and ascorbic acid (EC(50) ranges from 1.47 +/- 0.24 to 1.70 +/- 0.27 mug/ml) for both DPPH and ABTS. The crude extracts contained variable quantities of phenolic content. The crude extracts and their fractions had weak to good antimicrobial activities, inhibiting the growth of the organisms at concentrations ranging from 39 to 2500 mug/ml. The BAG crude extract and its fractions were the most active against the fungi (MICs ranging from 39 to 625 mug/ml) while the BAB extract and its fractions were the least active with the MICs ranging between 39 and 2500 mug/ml. Aspergillus fumigatus was the least susceptible fungus while Cryptococcus neoformans was the most susceptible. The phenolic-rich crude extracts of BAB, BAG, and BAP had moderate to good dose-dependent cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme inhibitory activity with inhibitions between 22.8% and 71.4%. The extracts were however, inactive against cyclooxygenase-2. The extracts had some level of cytotoxicity towards Vero cell lines, reducing cell viability to less than 10% at concentrations more than 50 mug/ml. CONCLUSION: The biological activities observed in Bauhinia species provide a scientific basis for the use of the plants in traditional medicines to treat diseases with multi-factorial pathogenesis such as diarrhoea, with each aspect of activity contributing to the ultimate therapeutic benefit of the plants. However, the use of the phenolic-rich extracts of these plants to treat diarrhoea or any other ailments in traditional medicine needs to be monitored closely because of potential toxic effects and selective inhibition of COX-1 with the associated GIT injury.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Linum pubescens growing wild in Jordan.
AB  - The volatile constituents of the aerial flowering parts of Linum pubescens were collected by hydro-distillation and analysed by GC and GC/MS. Analysis allowed the identification of 68 components of which, geranyl isovalerate (18.93%), lauric acid (12.07%), germacrene D (10.61%), decanoic acid (8.07%), 6,10,14-trimethyl-2-pentadecanone (5.02%) and 1-hexanol (4.99%) were detected as major constituents. The isolated essential oil of the plant exhibited high antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus ATCC11778, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 2923) and showed moderate antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 13048 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 10031).
TI  - Microbiological profile of orbital abscess.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the culture and sensitivity pattern is necessary, for the institution of appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy in orbital abscess. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to describe culture and sensitivity patterns of specimens from the orbit and surrounding structures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospectively the medical records of 56 cases of orbital abscess were reviewed. RESULTS: Cultures were positive in 38/56 (68.8%) orbital specimens and the organisms included Staphylococcus aureus 18, Streptococci 7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3, 2 each of Enterobactersp, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter sp. and 1 each of Actinomyces israelii, Diptheroids, Coagulase negative Staphylococcus, Citrobacter freundii, Methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Four had polymicrobial infection. Culture of purulent nasal discharge, swabs taken from foci of infection on the face, and blood cultures were done in 26/56, and positive cultures were obtained in 16/26 (61.5%) specimens. In 12 patients, there was a concurrence in the organism cultured from the orbit and from cultures from other sites. Gram-negative organisms were associated with increased ocular morbidity. CONCLUSION: Gram-positive cocci, especially S. aureus are the most common organisms isolated from orbital abscesses. Infections by Gram-negative organisms were associated with more complications. Empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy should have a broad spectrum of activity effective against a wide range of Staphylococcal organisms and Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - The constituents of essential oil: antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of Micromeria congesta Boiss. & Hausskn. ex Boiss. from East Anatolia.
AB  - The chemical composition, antimicrobial activity, total phenol content, total antioxidant activity, and total oxidant status of the essential oil from Micromeria congesta Boiss. & Hausskn. ex Boiss. were investigated. Steam distillation was used to obtain the essential oil, and the chemical analyses were performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The antimicrobial activity was tested by an agar disc diffusion method against the tested microorganisms: Bacillus subtilis NRRL B-744, Bacillus cereus NRRL B-3711, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12598, S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. aureus ATCC 25933, Escherichia coli 0157H7, E. coli ATCC25922, Micrococcus luteus NRLL B-4375, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Proteus vulgaris RSKK 96026, and Yersinia enterecolitica RSKK 1501. The major compounds found in volatiles of M. congesta were piperitone oxide, linalool oxide, veratrole, pulegone, dihydro carvone, naphthalene, iso-menthone, para-menthone, and cyclohexanone. Compared to that of reference antibiotics, the antibacterial activity of the essential oil is considered as significant. Results showed that M. congesta has the potential for being used in food and medicine depending on its antioxidant and antibacterial activity.
TI  - Targeted protein engineering provides insights into binding mechanism and affinities of bacterial collagen adhesins.
AB  - The collagen-binding bacterial proteins, Ace and Cna, are well characterized on the biochemical and structural level. Despite overall structural similarity, recombinant forms of the Ace and Cna ligand-binding domains exhibit significantly different affinities and binding kinetics for collagen type I (CI) in vitro. In this study, we sought to understand, in submolecular detail, the bases for these differences. Using a structure-based approach, we engineered Cna and Ace variants by altering specific structural elements within the ligand-binding domains. Surface plasmon resonance-based binding analysis demonstrated that mutations that are predicted to alter the orientation of the Ace and Cna N(1) and N(2) subdomains significantly affect the interaction between the MSCRAMM (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecule) and CI in vitro, including affinity, association/dissociation rates and binding ratio. Moreover, we utilized this information to engineer an Ace variant with an 11,000-fold higher CI affinity than the parent protein. Finally, we noted that several engineered proteins that exhibited a weak interaction with CI recognized more sites on CI, suggesting an inverse correlation between affinity and specificity.
TI  - Determination of the total phenolic and anthocyanin contents and antimicrobial activity of Viburnum opulus fruit juice.
AB  - Viburnum opulus is a plant with fruits that are rich in biologically active substances, making it valuable to the food and pharmaceutical industries. Here, we present our study of the total phenolic and anthocyanin contents and antimicrobial activity in the fruit juice of six V. opulus L. accessions. The cultivar 'Krasnaya Grozd' was notable for its exceptionally large amount of total phenolics, 1168 mg/100 g, with anthocyanins comprising 3-5 % of the total phenolic content. The evaluation of the antimicrobial properties confirmed that the juice of V. opulus fruits strongly inhibited the growth of a wide range of human pathogenic bacteria, both Gram-negative (Salmonella typhimurium and S. agona) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Lysteria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis) organisms. Conversely, the yeasts Debaryomyces hansenii and Torulaspora delbrueckii showed complete resistance to the fruit juice, whereas a low sensitivity was demonstrated by Trichosporon cutaneum, Kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, S. cerevisiae 12R, and Candida parapsilosis.
TI  - Stimulation of cadaverine production by foodborne pathogens in the presence of Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Streptococcus spp.
AB  - The effect of Lactobacillus plantarum (FI8595), Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG 1363), Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (IL 1403), and Streptococcus thermophilus on cadaverine and other biogenic amine production by foodborne pathogens was investigated lysine decarboxylase broth. Both of lactic acid bacteria and foodborne pathogens used (especially Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Lb. plantarum) had an ability to convert aminoacids into biogenic amine. The conversion of lysine into cadaverine was the highest (167.11 mg/L) by Lactobacillus spp. Gram-positive bacteria generally had a greater ability to produce cadaverine with corresponding value of 46.26, 53.76, and 154.54 mg/L for Enterococcus faecalis, S. aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes, respectively. Significant variations on biogenic amine production were observed in the presence of lactic acid bacteria strains (P < 0.05). The role of lactic acid bacteria on biogenic amine production by foodborne pathogens varied depending on strains and specific amine. Cadaverine accumulation by Enterobactericeae was increased in the presence of lactic acid bacteria strains except for St. thermophilus, which induced 2-fold lower cadaverine production by S. Paratyphi A. Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris induced 10-fold higher increases in histamine for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Lactic acid bacteria resulted in strong increases in cadaverine production by P. aeruginosa, although remarkable decreases were observed for histamine, spermidine, dopamine, agmatine, and TMA in the presence of lactic acid bacteria in lysine decarboxylase broth . The result of the study showed that amine positive lactic acid bacteria strains in fermented food led to significant amine accumulation by contaminant bacteria and their accumulation in food product may be controlled by the use of proper starters with amine-negative activity.
TI  - Rapid identification of ESKAPE bacterial strains using an autonomous microfluidic device.
AB  - This article describes Bacteria ID Chips ('BacChips'): an inexpensive, portable,  and autonomous microfluidic platform for identifying pathogenic strains of bacteria. BacChips consist of a set of microchambers and channels molded in the elastomeric polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). Each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried. Pressing the layer of PDMS into contact with a glass coverslip forms the device; the footprint of the device in this article is approximately 6 cm(2). After assembly, BacChips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. To use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased PDMS draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. After the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air is drawn into the BacChip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. A pH indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. Importantly, BacChips operate without external equipment or instruments. By visually detecting the growth of bacteria using ambient light after approximately 4 h, we demonstrate that BacChips with ten microchambers containing different saccharides can reproducibly detect the ESKAPE panel of pathogens, including strains of: Enterococcus faecalis, Enteroccocus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae. This article describes a BacChip for point-of-care detection of ESKAPE pathogens and a starting point for designing multiplexed assays that identify bacterial strains from clinical samples and simultaneously determine their susceptibility to antibiotics.
TI  - Biological activities of extracts from Chenopodium ambrosioides Lineu and Kielmeyera neglecta Saddi.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chenopodium ambrosioides and Kielmeyera neglecta are plants traditionally used in Brazil to treat various infectious diseases. The study of the biological activities of these plants is of great importance for the detection of biologically active compounds. METHODS: Extracts from these plants were extracted with hexane (Hex), dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and ethanol (EtOH) and assessed for their antimicrobial properties, bioactivity against Artemia salina Leach and antifungal action on the cell wall of Neurospora crassa. RESULTS: Extracts from C. ambrosioides (Hex, DCM and EtOH) and K. neglecta (EtOAc and EtOH) showed high bioactivity against A. salina (LD50 < 1000 mug/mL), which might be associated with cytotoxic activity against cancer cells. C. ambrosioides Hex and DCM showed specific activity against yeasts, highlighting the activity of hexanic extract against Candida krusei (MIC = 100 mug/mL). By comparing the inhibitory concentration of 50% growth (IC 50%) with the growth control, extracts from K. neglecta EtOAc and EtOH have shown activities against multidrug-resistant bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 51299 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43300), with IC 50% of 12.5 mug/mL The assay carried out on N. crassa allowed defining that extracts with antifungal activity do not have action through inhibition of cell wall synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Generally speaking, extracts from C. ambrosioides and K. neglecta showed biological activities that have made the search for bioactive substances in these plants more attractive, illustrating the success of their use in the Brazilian folk medicine.
TI  - Standardization of isothermal microcalorimetry in urinary tract infection detection by using artificial urine.
AB  - PURPOSE: Isothermal microcalorimetry (IMC) has recently been reported as a new method to rapidly detect urinary tract pathogens (UTP). However, further application of microcalorimetry in the clinical setting requires a standardized procedure. An important step toward such standardization is to use a reproducible growth medium. In this study, we investigated the potential of artificial urine in combination with microcalorimetry for detection of common UTP. METHODS: A microcalorimeter equipped with 48 channels was used. Detection was accomplished, and growth was monitored for four bacterial strains in artificial urine at 37 degrees C by measuring metabolic heat flow (muW = muJ/s) as a function of time. The strains were Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. RESULT: Bacterial growth was detected after 3-32 h with decreasing inoculums down to 1 CFU. The gram-negative strains grew and were detected faster than their gram-positive counterparts. The growth rates the different strains were 0.75 +/- 0.11 for E. coli, 0.74 +/- 0.10 for E. faecalis, 1.31 +/- 0.04 for P. mirabilis, and 0.56 +/- 0.20 for S. aureus. The shape of individual heat flow curves was characteristic for each species independent of its initial concentration. CONCLUSIONS: IMC allows rapid detection of UTP in artificial urine. Clearly, different heat flow patterns enable accurate pathogen differentiation. UTP detection after only 4 h is realistic. The rapid detection of UTP tested in standardized artificial urine proves the diagnostic potential of IMC and warrants further microcalorimetric studies in the clinical setting of urinary tract infections.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activities of oximes derived from O-benzylhydroxylamine as FabH inhibitors.
AB  - Forty-three oxime derivatives were synthesized by allowing O-benzylhydroxylamines to react with primary benzaldehydes or salicylaldehydes; these products were gauged as potential inhibitors of beta-ketoacyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) synthase III (FabH). Among the 43 compounds, 38 are reported herein for the first time. These compounds were assayed for antimicrobial activities against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Compounds with prominent antibacterial activities were tested for their E. coli FabH inhibitory activities. 3-((2,4-Dichlorobenzyloxyimino)methyl)benzaldehyde O-2,4-dichlorobenzyl oxime (44) showed the best antibacterial activity, with minimum inhibitory concentrations of 3.13-6.25 mug mL(-1) against the tested bacterial strains, exhibiting the best E. coli FabH inhibitory activity, with an IC(50) value of 1.7 mM. Docking simulations were performed to position compound 44 into the E. coli FabH active site in order to determine the most probable binding conformation.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2008].
AB  - The activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic Gram-positive cocci (25 genus or species, 1029 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (21 genus or species, 187 strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2008 at 16 clinical facilities in Japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. The ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was 59.6% and 81.2%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. Vancomycin (VCM), linezolid (LZD) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (QPR/DPR) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, with MIC90s of < or = 2 microg/mL. The ratio of penicillin (PC) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of PC-binding proteins among Streptococcus pneumoniae was 92.0% that was highest among our previous reports. Cefpirome, carbapenems, VCM, teicoplanin (TEIC), LZD and QPR/DPR had MIC90s of < or = 1 microg/mL against PC-intermediate and resistant S. pneumoniae strains. Against all strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, the MICs of VCM and TEIC were under 2 microg/mL, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 15.9% of E. faecalis strains and 1.2% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate to LZD. 17.1% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to QPR/DPR. Against all strains of Clostridium difficile, the MIC of VCM was under 1 microg/mL, suggesting that VCM had excellent activity. Carbapenems showed good activity against Clostridiales, Bacteroides spp., and Prevotella spp., but one strain of Bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems. And so, the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future at detecting continuously.
TI  - Nonculture-based identification of bacteria in milk by protein fingerprinting.
AB  - Traditional methods for bacterial identification include Gram staining, culturing, and biochemical assays for phenotypic characterization of the causative organism. These methods can be time-consuming because they require in vitro cultivation of the microorganisms. Recently, however, it has become possible to obtain chemical profiles for lipids, peptides, and proteins that are present in an intact organism, particularly now that new developments have been made for the efficient ionization of biomolecules. MS has therefore become the state-of-the-art technology for microorganism identification in microbiological clinical diagnosis. Here, we introduce an innovative sample preparation method for nonculture-based identification of bacteria in milk. The technique detects characteristic profiles of intact proteins (mostly ribosomal) with the recently introduced MALDI Sepsityper(TM) Kit followed by MALDI-MS. In combination with a dedicated bioinformatics software tool for databank matching, the method allows for almost real-time and reliable genus and species identification. We demonstrate the sensitivity of this protocol by experimentally contaminating pasteurized and homogenized whole milk samples with bacterial loads of 10(3) -10(8) colony-forming units (cfu) of laboratory strains of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. For milk samples contaminated with a lower bacterial load (10(4) cfu mL(-1) ), bacterial identification could be performed after initial incubation at 37 degrees C for 4 h. The sensitivity of the method may be influenced by the bacterial species and count, and therefore, it must be optimized for the specific application. The proposed use of protein markers for nonculture-based bacterial identification allows for high-throughput detection of pathogens present in milk samples. This method could therefore be useful in the veterinary practice and in the dairy industry, such as for the diagnosis of subclinical mastitis and for the sanitary monitoring of raw and processed milk products.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline and comparator antimicrobials against European and Middle East isolates from complicated skin and skin-structure infections collected in 2008-2009.
AB  - The activities of ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the pro-drug ceftaroline  fosamil, a novel anti-meticillin-resistant staphylococcal cephalosporin, and nine comparators were determined against surveillance isolates collected in 2008-2009. Over 3000 isolates associated with complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSIs) were collected from 106 centres in 19 countries. MICs were determined using CLSI broth microdilution methodology. Clonal relatedness of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with raised ceftaroline MICs (2 mg/L) was assessed by MLST, PFGE and mec typing. The presence of Panton-Valentine leukocidin in these isolates was also determined. Ceftaroline was active against 500 MRSA and 479 meticillin-susceptible S. aureus, with MIC(50/90) values of 0.5/2 mg/L and 0.25/0.25 mg/L, respectively. For coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), the ceftaroline MIC(50/90) values for meticillin-resistant strains (n=159) were the same as those seen for MRSA. Meticillin-susceptible CoNS (n=113) had the same MIC(90) as that seen with S. aureus, but the MIC(50) was lower at 0.06 mg/L. Ceftaroline was also active against beta-haemolytic streptococci (n=526; MIC(50/90)=0.004/0.015 mg/L), other streptococci (n=75; 0.015/0.06 mg/L), common Enterobacteriaceae (n=897; 0.25/>/=128 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (n=329; 1/16 mg/L). Those MRSA with ceftaroline MICs of 2mg/L were found to be from four clonal groups associated with the country of origin. These data confirm the broad-spectrum in vitro activity of ceftaroline against cSSSI pathogens. Ceftaroline is unique among clinically available cephalosporins, having good in vitro activity against MRSA and meticillin-resistant CoNS and moderate activity against Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Use of multiparameter flow cytometry to determine the effects of monoterpenoids and phenylpropanoids on membrane polarity and permeability in staphylococci and enterococci.
AB  - Monoterpenoids and phenylpropanoids are major components of many plant essential  oils and are relatively simple, low-molecular-weight compounds with antimicrobial activity. This study used multiparameter flow cytometry to examine changes in membrane polarity and permeability in Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis following exposure to the monoterpenoids carvacrol, 1,8-cineole and terpinen-4-ol and the phenylpropanoids eugenol and cinnamaldehyde. Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) essential oil was also investigated. The fluorescent dyes DiOC(2)(3) (3,3'-diethyloxacarbocyanine oxide) and TO-PRO((R))-3 were used to assess membrane potential and permeability, respectively, following treatment with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each test compound for 5 min and 30 min. Four subpopulations of cells were identified based on polarity and permeability. Eugenol treatment resulted in the greatest depolarisation and permeabilisation at 5 min, followed by carvacrol. Cinnamaldehyde, whilst having the lowest MICs (0.006-0.1%, v/v), did not induce changes in polarity or permeability at the MIC, and substantially higher concentrations were required to induce significant effects. At 30 min, treatment with all six compounds resulted in significant depolarisation (60.9-99.3% of cells), whereas fewer compounds (ranging from two to five per organism) resulted in significant permeabilisation. The extent of permeabilisation was always less than depolarisation, with overall means for all treatments of 46.1% and 89.4% of cells permeabilised and depolarised, respectively, at 30 min. These data demonstrate that several monoterpenoids and phenylpropanoids as well as tea tree oil alter membrane properties by decreasing polarity and increasing permeability in a time- and concentration-dependent manner.
TI  - Monitoring of antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated from laboratory animals.
AB  - The drug resistance of microorganisms isolated from laboratory animals never treated with antibiotics is being reported consistently, while the number of laboratory animals used in medicine, pharmacy, veterinary medicine, agriculture, nutrition, and environmental and health science has increased rapidly in Korea. Therefore, this study examined the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from laboratory animals bred in Korea. A total of 443 isolates (7 species) containing 5 Sphingomonas paucimobilis, 206 Escherichia coli, 60 Staphylococcus aureus, 15 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 77 Enterococcus faecalis, 27 Citrobacter freundii, 35 Acinetobacter baumannii were collected from the nose, intestine, bronchus and reproductive organs of ICR mice and SD rats. Of these species, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterococcus faecalis showed significant antimicrobial resistance according to the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) in E-test. In case of Acinetobacter baumannii, several isolates showed MIC values 16-128 microg/mL for cefazolin and cefoxitin, and higher resistance (128-512 microg/mL) to nitrofurantoin than that of standard type. Resistance to cefazolin, cefoxitin and nitrofurantoin was detected in 17.14, 20.00, and 8.57% of the Acinetobacter baumannii isolates, respectively. In addition, 44.1% of the Enterococcus faecalis isolates collected from the laboratory animals were resistant to oxacillin concentration of 16-32 microg/mL range, while MIC value of standard type was below oxacillin concentration of 6 microg/mL. These results suggest that in rodent species of laboratory animals, Acinetobacter baumannii are resistance to cefazolin, cefoxitin and nitrofurantoin, whereas those of Enterococcus faecalis were resistance to oxacillin.
TI  - Antimicrobial and synergistic effects of silver nanoparticles synthesized using soil fungi of high altitudes of eastern himalaya.
AB  - Fifty three fungi isolated from soils of different microhabitats of eastern Himalayan range (3,400~3,600 msl) were screened for mycosynthesis of silver nanaoparticles (AgNPs) and their efficacy as antimicrobials were assessed in combination with commonly used antibiotics. Three isolates Aspergillus terreus SP5, Paecilomyces lilacinus SF1 and Fusarium sp. MP5 identified based on morphological and 18S rRNA gene sequences were found to synthesize AgNPs. These nanoparticles were characterized by visual observation followed by UV-visible spectrophotometric analysis. The AgNPs synthesized by Aspergillus terreus SP5, Paecilomyces lilacinus SF1 and Fusarium sp. MP5 showed absorbance maxima at 412, 419, and 421 nm respectively in the visible region. Transmission electron microscopy micrograph showed formation of spherical AgNPs of 5~50 nm size. The antimicrobial activity of the mycosynthesized nanoparticles were investigated alone and in combination with commonly used antibiotics for analysis of growth inhibition zone against test organisms, namely, Staphylococcus aureus MTCC96, Streptococcus pyogenes MTCC1925, Salmonella enterica MTCC735 and Enterococcus faecalis MTCC2729. The mycosynthesized nanoparticles showed potent antibacterial activity and interestingly their syngergistic effect with erythromycin, methicillin, chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin was significantly higher as compared to inhibitions by AgNPs alone. The present study indicates that silver nanoparticles synthesized using soil borne indigenous fungus of high altitudes show considerable antimicrobial activity, deserving further investigation for potential applications.
TI  - Volatile organic compound analysis by ion molecule reaction mass spectrometry for Gram-positive bacteria differentiation.
AB  - Approximately 50 % of all clinically proven infections in critically ill patients are caused by Gram-positive bacteria. The timely and appropriate treatment of these infections is vital in order to avoid negative outcomes. Hence, fast and reliable methods are needed for the early detection and identification of microorganisms. Recently, direct mass spectrometry-based analysis of volatile organic compounds emitted by microorganisms has been employed to study Gram-negative bacteria. Here, we report a feasibility study of ion molecule reaction mass spectrometry (IMR-MS) for in vitro growth detection and species differentiation of selected Gram-positive bacteria that are frequently isolated in blood culture samples, namely, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Ion molecule reaction mass spectrometry was used to analyze the headspace above cultures containing Gram-positive bacteria incubated at 37 degrees C starting with 10(2) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml. Measurements to determine the presence of volatile organic compounds were performed 4, 8, and 24 h after incubation, respectively. The detection of microbial growth was accomplished already after 8 h in cultures containing E. faecalis. After 24 h of incubation, characteristic mass spectra were obtained for all species. Processing these mass spectra by hierarchic clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) enabled us to differentiate between bacterial species. IMR-MS in conjunction with a cumulative end-point model provides the means for rapid growth detection and differentiation of Gram-positive bacteria on the species level, typically within an analysis time of less than 3 min per sample.
TI  - [Analysis of distribution characteristics and drug resistance of 2748 strains of  pathogens isolated from burn patients].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide epidemiological data of the distribution characteristics and drug resistance of the pathogens isolated from burn patients in recent years for guiding rational use of antibiotics in clinic. METHODS: Totally 2748 strains of pathogens were isolated from 1977 specimens (blood, catheter, wound excretion, etc.) collected from 478 patients hospitalized in Institute of Burn Research of Southwest Hospital from March 2003 to June 2011. After being identified by API strips, drug resistance of the 2748 isolated pathogens to 55 commonly-used antibiotics including gentamicin, tobramycin, piperacillin, amikacin, etc. was tested by K-B paper disk diffusion method. The WHONET 5.3 software was used to analyze the following subjects: the distribution of the pathogens with different types and different sources each year, the changes in drug-resistant rates of Gram negative bacilli, Gram positive cocci, and fungi to several antibiotics, and the changes in sensitive rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), Staphylococcus aureus (SA), Acinetobacter baumannii (AB), Candida albicans (CA) to several antibiotics. RESULTS: Among 2748 strains of pathogens, 1879 strains of Gram negative bacilli accounted for 68.38%, 628 strains of Gram positive cocci accounted for 22.85%, and 241 strains of fungi accounted for 8.77%. The isolation rate of strains from wound excretion ranked the first (1022 strains accounted for 37.19%), followed by those from respiratory tract (995 strains accounted for 36.21%) and blood (421 strains accounted for 15.32%). Strains isolated from other types of specimens were rare. Isolation rate of PA ranked the first (996 strains accounted for 36.24%), followed by SA (495 strains accounted for 18.01%) and AB (395 strains accounted for 14.37%). Isolation rate of AB showed a trend of increase year by year, but that of SA presented the opposite trend. Isolation rate of PA was quite stable. There were 484 strains of methicillin resistant SA among Staphylococci, accounting for 17.61%. Resistant rates of PA and AB to polymyxin B and polymyxin E were below 30.00%, and those of PA and AB to other antibiotics, such as the third generation cephalosporins, beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and quinolones, were from 57.91% to 100.00%. Resistant rate of AB to minocycline was 39.68%. From 2004 to 2011, sensitive rate of PA to quinolone antibiotics showed an increasing trend year by year, but that of AB to minocycline, netilmicin, imipenem, meropenem, tobramycin, and cefoperazone/sulbactam presented the opposite trend. Resistant rates of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and SA to teicoplanin and linezolid were less than 10.00%. Resistant rate of SA, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium to vancomycin was 0. Resistant rates of SA to quinupristin/dalfopristin, minocycline, fusidic acid, and compound sulfamethoxazole were low, respectively 0.82%, 9.35%, 2.21%, and 31.85%. Sensitive rates of SA to erythromycin, clindamycin, compound sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and minocycline showed an increasing trend year by year. Both infection rate and resistant rate of fungi were low. The resistant rates of CA to 5 kinds of antibiotics were less than 15.00%. The sensitive rate of CA to 5-flucytosine declined slightly, and those of CA to the other 4 antibiotics showed an increasing trend year by year. CONCLUSIONS: The three dominant pathogens that cause infection in burn patients hospitalized in Institute of Burn Research of Southwest Hospital in recent years are PA, SA, and AB in order. PA and AB are outstandingly multidrug-resistant among the isolated strains. AB might replace PA as the main pathogenic bacterium that cause the death of burn patients with infection.
TI  - Ceftaroline fosamil in the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections.
AB  - Ceftaroline fosamil is a cephalosporin antibacterial approved by the US Food and  Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). After intravenous administration, ceftaroline fosamil is rapidly converted to its bioactive metabolite, ceftaroline. Ceftaroline has broad-spectrum in vitro activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including contemporary resistant Gram-positive phenotypes, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Because of its unique spectrum of activity, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) designated ceftaroline as a member of a new subclass of beta-lactam antimicrobials, cephalosporins with anti-MRSA activity. The activity of ceftaroline against S. aureus extends to heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-resistant and daptomycin-nonsusceptible isolates. Ceftaroline has low minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for all tested species of streptococci, and has potent activity against S. pneumoniae isolates with varying degrees of penicillin resistance. The activity of ceftaroline is limited against Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium and against anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis. The in vitro activity of ceftaroline includes many Gram-negative pathogens, but does not extend to bacteria that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, class B metallo-beta-lactamases or AmpC cephalosporinases, or to most nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli. Ceftaroline fosamil has been studied for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in phase III randomized, double-blind, international, multicentre noninferiority clinical trials. Two identical trials (CANVAS 1 and CANVAS 2) compared the efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil with that of vancomycin plus aztreonam in 1378 adults with cSSSI. Results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam, with 91.6% in the ceftaroline fosamil group (pooled analysis) achieving clinical response compared with 92.7% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam group (difference -1.1%, 95% CI -4.2, 2.0). An additional analysis evaluated clinical cure in a subgroup of patients who met the FDA guidance definition of ABSSSI at treatment day 3. Clinical response, defined as cessation of lesion spread and absence of fever, was 74.0% in the ceftaroline fosamil group compared with 66.2% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam group (treatment difference 7.8%, 95% CI 1.3, 14.0). Clinical efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil in 1240 hospitalized adults with CAP was compared with that of ceftriaxone in two additional phase III trials (FOCUS 1 and FOCUS 2). Of note, because ceftriaxone does not have activity against MRSA, patients with confirmed or suspected MRSA CAP were excluded from the FOCUS trials. Results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to ceftriaxone, with 84.3% in the ceftaroline fosamil group achieving clinical cure compared with 77.7% in the ceftriaxone group (difference 6.7%, 95% CI 1.6, 11.8). An additional analysis of the trials was conducted in patients with moderate to severe CAP and at least one proven typical bacterial pathogen at baseline (i.e. CABP). Day 4 clinical response rates were 69.5% for ceftaroline and 59.4% for ceftriaxone (difference 10.1%, 95% CI -0.6, 20.6). In the phase III trials, adverse event rates were similar between groups. Overall, ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. In summary, ceftaroline fosamil is a broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin with excellent in vitro activity against resistant Gram-positive pathogens, including MRSA, as well as many common Gram-negative organisms. It is a welcome treatment option for ABSSSI and CABP.
TI  - Infected total knee arthroplasty treatment outcome analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Infected total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a topic of great importance, because its diagnosing and treatment requires a lot of resources, and often has an unsatisfactory outcome. The aim of this study was to analyze the outcome of the treatment of infection developed following TKA. METHODS: This retrospective study of infected TKAs was performed in the period from 1998 to 2008 in the Orthopedics & Traumatology Clinic of the Military Medical Academy (MMA) in Belgrade. A total of 654 primary and revised TKAs were performed in the said period. We registered and surgically treated 28 infected TKAs (primary TKAs: MMA--22, other institutions--6). The incidence of TKA infection in the MMA was 3.36%. The most common pathogens were: Staphylococcus aureus--14 (50%) cases, and Staph. epidermidis--3 (10.7%) cases. Other isolated pathogens were: Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneum., Klebsiella spp., Streptoccocus viridans, Seratia spp, Micrococcus luteus and Peptostreptococcus spp. In one case we had mixed anaerobic flora, and in 3 cases cultures were negative. We analyzed diagnostic challenges, risk factors (such as age and previous viscosupplementation) and treatment outcomes in our series of infected TKAs. RESULTS: In our series 2 infections healed after iv antibiotics and debridement, 1 patient responded to open debridement with component retention, 4 patients responded fully to one-stage reimplantation, 10 cases responded fully to two-stage reimplantation, 11 patients ended with arthrodesis and we had 1 patient withabove knee amputation. CONCLUSION: Two-stage reimplantation remains gold standard for treatment of infected TKA, and we recommend it as treatment of choice for eradication of infection. The antibiotic loaded spacer prothesis concept in most cases allows infection eradication, good function and high patient satisfaction.
TI  - Nosocomial infections in a pediatric intensive care unit of a developing country: NHSN surveillance.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to determine the epidemiology of the three most common nosocomial infections (NI), namely, sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection (UTI), in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in a developing country and to define the risk factors associated with NI. METHODS: We performed a prospective study on the incidence of NI in a single PICU, between August 2009 and August 2010. Active surveillance by National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) was conducted in the unit and children with NI (cases) were compared with a group (matched controls) in a case-control fashion. RESULTS: We analyzed 172 patients; 22.1% had NI, 71.1% of whom acquired it in the unit. The incidence densities of sepsis, pneumonia, and UTI per 1,000 patients/day were 17.9, 11.4, and 4.3, respectively. The most common agents in sepsis were Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli (18% each); Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 13% of cases. In pneumonias Staphylococcus aureus was the most common cause (3.2%), and in UTI the most frequent agents were yeasts (33.3%). The presence of NI was associated with a long period of hospitalization, use of invasive devices (central venous catheter, nasogastric tube), and use of antibiotics. The last two were independent factors for NI. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of NI acquired in this unit was high and was associated with extrinsic factors.
TI  - Type I and Type II mechanisms of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy: an in vitro  study on gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (APDT) employs a non-toxic photosensitizer (PS) and visible light, which in the presence of oxygen produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as singlet oxygen ((1) O(2), produced via Type II mechanism) and hydroxyl radical (HO(.), produced via Type I mechanism). This study examined the relative contributions of (1) O(2) and HO(.) to APDT killing of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fluorescence probes, 3'-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-fluorescein (HPF) and singlet oxygen sensor green reagent (SOSG) were used to determine HO(.) and (1) O(2) produced by illumination of two PS: tris-cationic-buckminsterfullerene (BB6) and a conjugate between polyethylenimine and chlorin(e6) (PEI-ce6). Dimethylthiourea is a HO(.) scavenger, while sodium azide (NaN(3)) is a quencher of (1) O(2). Both APDT and killing by Fenton reaction (chemical generation of HO(.)) were carried out on Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). RESULTS: Conjugate PEI-ce6 mainly produced (1) O(2) (quenched by NaN(3)), while BB6 produced HO(.) in addition to (1) O(2) when NaN(3) potentiated probe activation. NaN(3) also potentiated HPF activation by Fenton reagent. All bacteria were killed by Fenton reagent but Gram-positive bacteria needed a higher concentration than Gram-negatives. NaN(3) potentiated Fenton-mediated killing of all bacteria. The ratio of APDT killing between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was 2 or 4:1 for BB6 and 25:1 for conjugate PEI-ce6. There was a NaN(3) dose-dependent inhibition of APDT killing using both PEI-ce6 and BB6 against Gram-negative bacteria while NaN(3) almost failed to inhibit killing of Gram-positive bacteria. CONCLUSION: Azidyl radicals may be formed from NaN(3) and HO(.). It may be that Gram-negative bacteria are more susceptible to HO(.) while Gram-positive bacteria are more susceptible to (1) O(2). The differences in NaN(3) inhibition may reflect differences in the extent of PS binding to bacteria (microenvironment) or differences in penetration of NaN(3) into cell walls of bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activities of antimicrobial cationic peptides; melittin and nisin, alone or in combination with antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The In vitro activities of two antimicrobial cationic peptides, melittin and nisin alone and in combination with frequently used antibiotics (daptomycin, vancomycin, linezolid, ampicillin, and erythromycin), were assessed against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Using the broth microdilution method, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranges of melittin and nisin against all strains were 2-8 mug/ml and 2-32 mug/ml respectively. In combination studies performed with the microdilution checkerboard method using a fractional inhibitory concentration index of </= 0.5 as borderline, synergistic interactions occurred more frequently with nisin-ampicillin combination against MSSA and nisin-daptomycin combination against E. faecalis strains. The results of the time-killing curve analysis demonstrated that the concentration dependent rapid bactericidal activity of nisin, and that synergism or early synergism was detected in most strains when nisin or melittin was used in combination with antibiotics even at concentrations of 0.5 x MIC.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance among Gram-positive pathogens in Saudi Arabia.
AB  - Several species of Gram-positive cocci are major nosocomial or community pathogens associated with morbidity and mortality. Here, we review the antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens in Saudi Arabia. In the last decades, antimicrobial resistance has increased among Staphylococcus aureus in the Kingdom with a growing prevalence of both nosocomial and community methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates. As yet, no vancomycin-resistant MRSA have been reported, although isolates with reduced susceptibility to the drug have been noted. Currently, the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant entrococci (VRE) is low; however, VRE has been described in the Kingdom as well as Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium isolates with high-level resistance to penicillin, sulfamethoxazole, macrolides, tetracycline, and aminoglycosides. In recent decades, the prevalence and rate of penicillin resistance and non-susceptibility among Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates have increased in Saudi Arabia. The organism remains, however, susceptible to other beta-lactams and to quinolones. On the other hand, resistance to co-trimoxazole and tetracyclines is high and resistance to macrolides is on the increase.
TI  - Antimicrobial phenylpropanoids from the Argentinean highland plant Parastrephia lucida (Meyen) Cabrera.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The Argentinean highland plant Parastrephia lucida (Meyen) Cabrera is used in traditional medicine as an antiseptic and anti-inflammatory crude drug. AIM OF THE STUDY: To relate the antimicrobial effect of the crude drug with the constituents of the active fractions and traditional use. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Assay-guided isolation of the methanol (MeOH) plant extract was carried out using bacteria and yeasts as target organisms. Both ATCC and local strains were included in the study. The antimicrobial fractions and compounds were detected by bioautographic assays. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of each extract and fraction were determined and compared with reference antibiotics. Fractions were analyzed by HPLC-DAD, GC-MS, (1)H NMR and (13)C NMR. RESULTS: From the MeOH extract of the plant, assay-guided isolation of the antimicrobial constituents led to 12 phenylpropanoids and two simple phenolics. Most of the compounds occurring in the active fractions were E-caffeoyl or E-cinnamoyl esters including prenyl and phenethyl derivatives. The MIC values of the most active fractions ranged between 12.5 and 200 mug/mL against reference strains and local isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: The antimicrobial effect found in the crude drug was associated with mixtures of phenylpropanoids, including prenyl and phenethyl esters of caffeic and cinnamic acids. The results support at least in part the traditional use of the plant as local antiseptic.
TI  - Characterization of the antibacterial activity and the chemical components of the volatile oil of the leaves of Rubus parvifolius L.
AB  - Rubus parvifolius L. (Rp) is a medicinal herb that possesses antibacterial activity. In this study, we extracted the volatile oil from the leaves of Rp to assess its antibacterial activity and analyze its chemical composition. A uniform distribution design was used to optimize the extraction procedure, which yielded 0.36% (w/w) of light yellowish oil from the water extract of Rp leaves. We found that the extracted oil effectively inhibited the growth of a wide range of Gram positive and negative bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii, Bacillus cloacae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. We further analyzed the components contained in the hydro-distillated Rp volatile oil by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Twenty nine compounds were identified, including 4-hydroxy-3-methoxystyrene (66%), 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol (10%) and 4-tert-butylbenzoic acid (2%). Our results suggest that one or multiple constituents contained in Rp volatile oil may account for its antibacterial activity.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity analysis of halistanol trisulphate from marine sponge Petromica citrina.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: An aqueous extract and fraction from the marine sponge Petromica citrina have antibacterial activity. We performed a chemical and biological characterization of the antibiotic substance from P. citrina and investigated its mode of action on Staphylococcus aureus cells. METHODS: The inhibitory activity of the aqueous extract of P. citrina was determined against 14 bacteria belonging to type strains and clinical antibiotic-resistant strains. The aqueous extract was fractionated under bioassay guidance and the bioactive substance was identified by its (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR and mass spectra. The MIC and the MBC of this substance were determined. This substance was also subjected to cytotoxic bioassays. The mode of action on S. aureus cells was investigated by light and transmission electron microscopy analysis. RESULTS: P. citrina showed a large spectrum of activity against type strains and resistant-bacteria such as S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium fortuitum and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The aqueous extract was fractionated and halistanol trisulphate (24epsilon,25-dimethylcholestane-2beta,3alpha,6alpha-triol trisodium sulphate) was isolated for the first time from P. citrina. Halistanol trisulphate had a bactericidal effect on exponentially growing S. aureus cells at the MIC (512 mg/L). Cytotoxicity biossays showed moderate toxicity against cancer cell line L929 (fibrosarcoma). This substance apparently acts by damaging the cell membrane, with subsequent cell lysis. CONCLUSIONS: Halistanol trisulphate is a broad-spectrum antibiotic isolated from P. citrina with a mode of action involving disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane. It is a new candidate for research on antibacterial substances.
TI  - Role of mprF1 and mprF2 in the pathogenicity of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enterococcus faecalis is one of the leading causes of nosocomial infections. Due to its innate and acquired resistance to most antibiotics, identification of new targets for antimicrobial treatment of E. faecalis is a high priority. The multiple peptide resistance factor MprF, which was first described in Staphylococcus aureus, modifies phosphatidylglycerol with lysin and reduces the negative charge of the membrane, thus increasing resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides. We studied the effect of mprF in E. faecalis regarding influence on bacterial physiology and virulence. RESULTS: Two putative mprF paralogs (mprF1 and mprF2) were identified in E. faecalis by BLAST search using the well-described S. aureus gene as a lead. Two deletion mutants in E. faecalis 12030 were created by homologous recombination. Analysis of both mutants by thin-layer chromatography showed that inactivation of mprF2 abolishes the synthesis of three distinct amino-phosphatidylglycerols (PGs). In contrast, deletion of mprF1 did not interfere with the biosynthesis of amino-PG. Inactivation of mprF2 increased susceptibility against several antimicrobial peptides and resulted in a 42% increased biofilm formation compared to wild-type mprF. However, resistance to opsonic killing was increased in the mutant, while virulence in a mouse bacteremia model was unchanged. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that only mprF2 is involved in the aminoacylation of PG in enterococci, and is probably responsible for synthesis of Lys-PG, Ala-PG, and Arg-PG, while mprF1 does not seem to have a role in aminoacylation. As in other Gram-positive pathogens, aminoacylation through MprF2 increases resistance against cationic antimicrobial peptides. Unlike mprF found in other bacteria, mprF2 does not seem to be a major virulence factor in enterococci.
TI  - Activation of type III interferon genes by pathogenic bacteria in infected epithelial cells and mouse placenta.
AB  - Bacterial infections trigger the expression of type I and II interferon genes but little is known about their effect on type III interferon (IFN-lambda) genes, whose products play important roles in epithelial innate immunity against viruses. Here, we studied the expression of IFN-lambda genes in cultured human epithelial cells infected with different pathogenic bacteria and in the mouse placenta infected with Listeria monocytogenes. We first showed that in intestinal LoVo cells, induction of IFN-lambda genes by L. monocytogenes required bacterial entry and increased further during the bacterial intracellular phase of infection. Other Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis, also induced IFN-lambda genes when internalized by LoVo cells. In contrast, Gram-negative bacteria Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Shigella flexneri and Chlamydia trachomatis did not substantially induce IFN-lambda. We also found that IFN-lambda genes were up-regulated in A549 lung epithelial cells infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and in HepG2 hepatocytes and BeWo trophoblastic cells infected with L. monocytogenes. In a humanized mouse line permissive to fetoplacental listeriosis, IFN-lambda2/lambda3 mRNA levels were enhanced in placentas infected with L. monocytogenes. In addition, the feto-placental tissue was responsive to IFN-lambda2. Together, these results suggest that IFN-lambda may be an important modulator of the immune response to Gram-positive intracellular bacteria in epithelial tissues.
TI  - Lantibiotic production by pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  - Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesised, post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides produced by Gram positive bacteria, many which have broad-ranging antimicrobial activities. Lantibiotics have long been the subject of investigation with a view to their application as food preservatives or chemotherapeutic agents for clinical and veterinary medicine, while the associated biosynthetic machinery has been employed for peptide engineering purposes. However, although many lantibiotics are produced by generally regarded as safe or food-grade bacteria, it is increasingly apparent that a number of Gram positive pathogens, including strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus uberis and Enterococcus faecalis, also produce these compounds. It is proposed that production of these antimicrobials may provide the associated microorganisms with a competitive advantage when colonizing/infecting a host, thereby enhancing the virulence of the producing strain. Here we review the production of lantibiotics by these pathogens and discuss how their production may contribute to their disease-causing potential.
TI  - Costs of healthcare- and community-associated infections with antimicrobial-resistant versus antimicrobial-susceptible organisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We compared differences in the hospital charges, length of hospital stay, and mortality between patients with healthcare- and community-associated bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia due to antimicrobial-resistant versus -susceptible bacterial strains. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of an electronic database compiled from laboratory, pharmacy, surgery, financial, and patient location and device utilization sources was undertaken on 5699 inpatients who developed healthcare- or community-associated infections between 2006 and 2008 from 4 hospitals (1 community, 1 pediatric, 2 tertiary/quaternary care) in Manhattan. The main outcome measures were hospital charges, length of stay, and mortality among patients with antimicrobial-resistant and -susceptible infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. RESULTS: Controlling for multiple confounders using linear regression and nearest neighbor matching based on propensity score estimates, resistant healthcare- and community-associated infections, when compared with susceptible strains of the same organism, were associated with significantly higher charges ($15,626; confidence interval [CI], $4339-$26,913 and $25,573; CI, $9331-$41,816, respectively) and longer hospital stays for community-associated infections (3.3; CI, 1.5-5.4). Patients with resistant healthcare-associated infections also had a significantly higher death rate (0.04; CI, 0.01-0.08). CONCLUSIONS: With careful matching of patients infected with the same organism, antimicrobial resistance was associated with higher charges, length of stay, and death rates. The difference in estimates after accounting for censoring for death highlight divergent social and hospital incentives in reducing patient risk for antimicrobial resistant infections.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some new hydrazone-bridged thiazole-pyrrole derivatives.
AB  - In this work, we synthesized fourteen different compounds which contain hydrazone bridged thiazole and pyrrole rings. For this purpose, pyrrole-2-carboxaldehydes were reacted directly with thiosemicarbazide in ethanol and then obtained thiosemicarbazones were condensed with alpha-bromoacetophenone derivatives (Hantzsch reaction) to give 1-substituted pyrrole-2-carboxaldehyde [4-(4-substituted phenyl)-1,3-thiazol-2-yl] hydrazones. The structures of the obtained compounds were elucidated by using IR, (1)H-NMR and FAB(+)-MS spectral data and elemental analyses results. All of the compounds were screened for their antibacterial and antifungal activities against twelve different microorganisms by using microbroth dilution method. Ketoconazole and chloramphenicol were used as standard drugs. All of the compounds showed good activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - Comparison of the WST-8 colorimetric method and the CLSI broth microdilution method for susceptibility testing against drug-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) obtained from the susceptibility testing of various bacteria to antibiotics were determined by a colorimetric microbial viability assay based on reduction of a tetrazolium salt {2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazoli um, monosodium salt (WST-8)} via 2-methyl-1,4-napthoquinone as an electron mediator and compared with those obtained by the broth microdilution methods approved by the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI). Especially for drug-resistant bacteria, the CLSI method at an incubation time of 24h tended to give lower MICs. The extension of incubation time was necessary to obtain consistent MICs for drug-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococi (VRE) and multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) in the broth microdilution method. There was excellent agreement between the MICs determined after 24h using the WST-8 colorimetric method and those obtained after 48-96 h using the broth microdilution method. The results suggest that the WST-8 colorimetric assay is a useful method for rapid determination of consistent MICs for drug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of the appetite peptide hormone ghrelin.
AB  - The present study examined the antimicrobial activity of the peptide ghrelin. Both major forms of ghrelin, acylated ghrelin (AG) and desacylated ghrelin (DAG), demonstrated the same degree of bactericidal activity against Gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), while bactericidal effects against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) were minimal or absent, respectively. To elucidate the bactericidal mechanism of AG and DAG against bacteria, we monitored the effect of the cationic peptides on the zeta potential of E. coli. Our results show that AG and DAG similarly quenched the negative surface charge of E. coli, suggesting that ghrelin-mediated bactericidal effects are influenced by charge-dependent binding and not by acyl modification. Like most cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs), we also found that the antibacterial activity of AG was attenuated in physiological NaCl concentration (150mM). Nonetheless, these findings indicate that both AG and DAG can act as CAMPs against Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of wild mushroom extracts against clinical isolates resistant to different antibiotics.
AB  - AIMS: This work aimed to screen the antimicrobial activity of aqueous methanolic  extracts of 13 mushroom species, collected in Braganca, against several clinical isolates obtained in Hospital Center of Tras-os-Montes and Alto Douro, Portugal. METHODS AND RESULTS: Microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). MIC results showed that Russula delica and Fistulina hepatica extracts inhibited the growth of gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Morganella morganni and Pasteurella multocida) and gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes) bacteria. A bactericide effect of both extracts was observed in Past. multocida, Strep. agalactiae and Strep. pyogenes with MBC of 20, 10 and 5 mg ml(-)(1), respectively. Lepista nuda extract exhibited a bactericide effect upon Past. multocida at 5 mg ml(-)(1) and inhibited Proteus mirabilis at 20 mg ml(-)(1). Ramaria botrytis extract showed activity against Enterococcus faecalis and L. monocytogenes, being bactericide for Past. multocida, Strep. agalactiae (MBCs 20 mg ml(-)(1)) and Strep. pyogenes (MBC 10 mg ml(-)(1)). Leucopaxillus giganteus extract inhibited the growth of E. coli and Pr. mirabilis, being bactericide for Past. multocida, Strep. pyogenes and Strep. agalactiae. CONCLUSIONS: Fistulina hepatica, R. botrytis and R. delica are the most promising species as antimicrobial agents. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Mushroom extracts could be an alternative as antimicrobials against pathogenic micro-organisms resistant to conventional treatments.
TI  - Total synthesis and biological evaluation of transvalencin Z.
AB  - The emerging global epidemic of drug-resistant tuberculosis has created an urgent need to identify novel therapeutic approaches for disease treatment. Transvalencin Z (1) is a natural product from Nocardia transvalensis with relatively potent and selective antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis, making it an attractive target for structure-activity and mechanism of action studies. The total synthesis of the four possible diastereomers of transvalencin Z was completed (1a-d), and the absolute configurations were defined using chemical synthesis, HPLC retention times, and optical rotation measurements. Surprisingly, none of the transvalencin Z diastereomers exhibited any inhibitory activity against a panel of microbial pathogens, including several species of mycobacteria.
TI  - Structural characterization and antimicrobial evaluation of atractyloside, atractyligenin, and 15-didehydroatractyligenin methyl ester.
AB  - We report the first complete structure elucidation of the ent-kaurane diterpenoid glycoside atractyloside (1) by means of NMR and X-ray diffractometry techniques. Extensive one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments were employed to assign the proton and carbon signals of 1, and crystallography experiments established the configurations of all stereogenic centers. Furthermore, we present a novel semisynthetic route for the preparation of the highly cytotoxic aglycone derivative of 1, 15-didehydroatractyligenin methyl ester (3). All compounds were tested for their antibiotic activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and several strains of Staphylococcus aureus, including fluoroquinolone-resistant (SA1199B) and two epidemic MRSA (EMRSA-15 and -16) strains. Compound 3 exhibited moderate activity against all of the Staph. aureus strains with an MIC value of 128 mg/L.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens related to chronic suppurative otitis media in individuals with cleft palate: bacteriological culture and polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the microbial etiology of chronic suppurative otitis media comparing the methods of classical bacteriological culture and polymerase chain reaction. DESIGN/SETTING/PATIENTS: Bacteriological analysis by classical culture and by molecular polymerase chain reaction of 35 effusion otitis samples from patients with cleft lip and palate attending the Hospital for Rehabilitation of Craniofacial Anomalies of the University of Sao Paulo, Bauru, Brazil. INTERVENTIONS: Collection of clinical samples of otitis by effusion through the external auditory tube. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Otolaryngologic diagnosis of chronic suppurative otitis media. RESULTS: Positive cultures were obtained from 83% of patients. Among the 31 bacterial lineages the following were isolated. In order of decreasing frequency: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (54.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (25.9%), and Enterococcus faecalis (19.2%). No anaerobes were isolated by culture. The polymerase chain reaction was positive for one or more bacteria investigated in 97.1% of samples. Anaerobe lineages were detected by the polymerase chain reaction method, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum , Bacteroides fragilis , and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius . CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cleft lip and palate with chronic suppurative otitis media presented high frequency of bacterial infection in the middle ear. The classical bacteriological culture did not detect strict anaerobes, whose presence was identified by the polymerase chain reaction method.
TI  - Caenorhabditis elegans immune conditioning with the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus strain NCFM enhances gram-positive immune responses.
AB  - Although the immune response of Caenorhabditis elegans to microbial infections is well established, very little is known about the effects of health-promoting probiotic bacteria on evolutionarily conserved C. elegans host responses. We found that the probiotic Gram-positive bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM is not harmful to C. elegans and that L. acidophilus NCFM is unable to colonize the C. elegans intestine. Conditioning with L. acidophilus NCFM significantly decreased the burden of a subsequent Enterococcus faecalis infection in the nematode intestine and prolonged the survival of nematodes exposed to pathogenic strains of E. faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus, including multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates. Preexposure of nematodes to Bacillus subtilis did not provide any beneficial effects. Importantly, L. acidophilus NCFM activates key immune signaling pathways involved in C. elegans defenses against Gram-positive bacteria, including the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (via TIR-1 and PMK-1) and the beta-catenin signaling pathway (via BAR-1). Interestingly, conditioning with L. acidophilus NCFM had a minimal effect on Gram-negative infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and had no or a negative effect on defense genes associated with Gram-negative pathogens or general stress. In conclusion, we describe a new system for the study of probiotic immune agents and our findings demonstrate that probiotic conditioning with L. acidophilus NCFM modulates specific C. elegans immunity traits.
TI  - Syntheses and biological studies of novel spiropiperazinyl oxazolidinone antibacterial agents using a spirocyclic diene derived acylnitroso Diels-Alder reaction.
AB  - Several novel oxazolidinone antibiotics with a spiropiperazinyl substituent at the 4'-position of the phenyl ring were synthesized through nitroso Diels-Alder chemistry and the in vitro antibacterial activities were evaluated against various Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and mycobacteria (Mycobacterium vaccae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis). Analogs (8a and 12) were active against selected drug resistant microbes, like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and had no mammalian toxicity in a Hep-2 cellular assay (CC(50) >100 muM).
TI  - Investigation of antimicrobial activity and statistical optimization of Bacillus  subtilis SPB1 biosurfactant production in solid-state fermentation.
AB  - During the last years, several applications of biosurfactants with medical purposes have been reported. Biosurfactants are considered relevant molecules for applications in combating many diseases. However, their use is currently extremely limited due to their high cost in relation to that of chemical surfactants. Use of inexpensive substrates can drastically decrease its production cost. Here, twelve solid substrates were screened for the production of Bacillus subtilis SPB1 biosurfactant and the maximum yield was found with millet. A Plackett-Burman design was then used to evaluate the effects of five variables (temperature, moisture, initial pH, inoculum age, and inoculum size). Statistical analyses showed that temperature, inoculum age, and moisture content had significantly positive effect on SPB1 biosurfactant production. Their values were further optimized using a central composite design and a response surface methodology. The optimal conditions of temperature, inoculum age, and moisture content obtained under the conditions of study were 37 degrees C, 14 h, and 88%, respectively. The evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of this compound was carried out against 11 bacteria and 8 fungi. The results demonstrated that this biosurfactant exhibited an important antimicrobial activity against microorganisms with multidrug-resistant profiles. Its activity was very effective against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus xylosus, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumonia, and so forth.
TI  - First study on antimicriobial activity and synergy between isothiocyanates and antibiotics against selected Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from clinical and animal source.
AB  - The emergence of new diseases and the resurgence of several infections that were  controlled in the past, associated with recent increase of bacterial resistance have created the necessity for more studies towards to the development of new antimicrobials and new treatment strategies. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro synergy between different classes of important glucosinolates hydrolysis products-isothiocyanates with antibiotics (gentamycin and vancomycin), against important pathogenic bacteria: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. A disc diffusion method was used to evaluate the antibacterial activity. The antimicrobial activity of phytochemicals and combinations between gentamycin, vancomycin and phytochemicals were quantitatively assessed by measuring the inhibitory halos. The results showed a selective antimicrobial effect of isothiocyanates, and this effect was strictly related with their chemical structure. In general the benzylisothiocyanate was the most effective compound against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus were the bacteria most affected either by the phytochemicals alone or by the combination phytochemical-antibiotic. The bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the less affected pathogen. The most important synergism detected occurred between the commercial antibiotics with benzylisothiocyanate and 2-phenylethylisothiocyanate. In conclusion, some isothiocyanates are effective inhibitors of in vitro bacterial growth, and they can act synergistically with antibiotics.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of signermycin B, an antibiotic that targets the dimerization domain of histidine kinase WalK.
AB  - The WalK (histidine kinase)/WalR (response regulator) two-component signal transduction system is a master regulatory system for cell wall metabolism and growth. This system is conserved in low G+C Gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus mutans. In this study, we found the first antibiotic that functions as a WalK inhibitor (signermycin B) by screening 10,000 Streptomyces extracts. The chemical structure (C(23)H(35)NO(4); molecular weight, 389.5) comprises a tetramic acid moiety and a decalin ring. Signermycin B exhibited antimicrobial activity, with MIC values ranging from 3.13 mug/ml (8 muM) to 6.25 mug/ml (16 muM) against Gram-positive bacteria that possess the WalK/WalR two-component signal transduction system, including the drug-resistant bacteria methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of signermycin B against WalK in these organisms ranged from 37 to 61 muM. To determine the mechanism of action of signermycin B, surface plasmon resonance response analysis with the two WalK domains of Bacillus subtilis and competition assay with ATP were performed. The results showed that signermycin B binds to the dimerization domain but not the ATP-binding domain of WalK. In the presence of the cross-linker glutaraldehyde, signermycin B did not cause protein aggregation but interfered with the cross-linking of WalK dimers. These results suggest that signermycin B targets the conserved dimerization domain of WalK to inhibit autophosphorylation. In Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, signermycin B preferentially controlled the WalR regulon, thereby inhibiting cell division. These phenotypes are consistent with those of cells starved for the WalK/WalR system.
TI  - Profile of antibiotic consumption, sensitivity and resistance in an urban area of Andhra Pradesh, India.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antibiotics are an important category of drugs in which indiscriminate use can affect the susceptibility patterns among infectious organisms, resulting in antibiotic resistance. METHODS: Data on antibiotic usage and susceptibility patterns were collected from public and private health centres in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, India, through the use of questionnaires. The data collected were then coded, tabulated, computed and evaluated using statistical analysis. RESULTS: The consumption profile of the different categories of drugs used in public and private hospitals was as follows: nutrition and metabolism products 19.0%; gastrointestinal disorder-related drugs 18.5%; antibiotics 16.8%; anti-pyretics and anti-analgesics 20.6%. These drugs were found to be in high demand. Among the antibiotics, aminoglycosides (amikacin), quinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin), tetracyclines (doxycycline), penicillin (ampicillin) and sulphonamides (co-trimoxazole) were the most commonly prescribed drugs for antibiotic therapy. 46% of the culture laboratory reports were positive with the following organism profile: Escherichia coli (36%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (16%), Staphylococcus aureus (29%), Enterococcus faecalis (9%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%). In terms of the sensitivity profile of antibacterials, amikacin (66.9%) was the only antibiotic showing sensitivity patterns, while the majority of antibiotics, such as cotrimoxazole, nalidixic acid, amoxicillin, gentamycin and norfloxacin, had acquired a resistance rate of 55.1%-80.6%. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that indiscriminate prescription and consumption of new broad-spectrum antibiotics against sensitive organisms results in the development of antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, there is an urgent need to curb the excessive use of antibiotics in local hospitals in order to control the trend of increasing antimicrobial resistance to antibiotics.
TI  - Worldwide appraisal and update (2010) of telavancin activity tested against a collection of Gram-positive clinical pathogens from five continents.
AB  - A total of 15,480 Gram-positive pathogens were collected from 89 sites in the United States, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and Latin America in 2010. Telavancin was active against indicated Staphylococcus aureus (MIC(50/90), 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(50/90), 0.5/0.5 mug/ml), and beta-hemolytic (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.12 mug/ml) and viridans group streptococcus (MIC(50/90), 0.03/0.06 mug/ml) isolates. These MIC results showed potency for telavancin equal to or greater than that of comparators. These in vitro data confirm a continued potent activity of telavancin when tested against contemporary Gram-positive clinical isolates.
TI  - Microbial spectrum and resistance patterns in endophthalmitis: a 21-year (1988-2008) review in northeast United States.
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the microbial spectrum and antibacterial susceptibility of vitreous cultures in a tertiary referral center in Northeast United States. METHODS: All vitreous samples sent to the microbiology laboratory at a tertiary referral center from January 1988 to December 2008 were included in the study. The distribution and antibiotic susceptibility of all isolates from culture-positive samples were compared across 3 equal time periods 1988-1994, 1995-2001, and 2002-2008. RESULTS: One hundred forty-three positive cultures, where 11.9% (n=17) were polymicrobial, yielded a total of 160 isolates that consisted of 80.6% (n=129) gram-positive isolates, 12.5% (n=20) gram-negative isolates, and 6.9% (n=11) fungal isolates. The most prevalent organisms were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) (37.5%, n=60), Viridans Streptococcus (11.3%, n=18), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (6.9%, n=11). Other common gram-positive isolates include Propionibacterium acnes (5.6%, n=9), other Streptococcus species (4.4%, n=7), Staphylococcus aureus (4.4%, n=7), and Enterococcus faecalis (3.8%, n=6). The most common gram-negative isolates were Klebsiella species (3.1%, n=5), Moraxella species (3.1%, n=5), and Haemophilus species (2.5%, n=4). Vancomycin was effective against all CoNS, Sta. aureus, Viridans Streptococcus, and E. faecalis tested, and all Sta. aureus isolates were oxacillin sensitive. Of all CoNS isolates, 83.3% during 1988-1994, 73.1% during 1995-2001, and 100% during 2002-2008 were resistant to at least 1 of the antibiotics tested in the study with the last time period showing an increase in resistance (P=0.021, adjusted standard residual=2.0). CoNS showed a decreasing resistance over time to chloramphenicol and gentamicin (P=0.010, P=0.007, respectively) and an increase in resistance to penicillin and tetracycline during 2002-2008 (P=0.003, P=0.040, respectively). Susceptibility to other antibiotics did not show significant dependence on time. CONCLUSION: Bacteria causing endophthalmitis showed variable resistance to antibiotics over time. The importance of adequately treating endophthalmitis in the setting of these resistance pattern changes stresses the importance of periodic evaluation of causative organisms to ensure appropriate empiric treatment.
TI  - Cytotoxicity and antimicrobial activity of the methanol extract and compounds from Polygonum limbatum.
AB  - The present study was designed to investigate the antimicrobial activity and the  cytotoxicity of the methanol extract (PLA) as well as fractions (PLA1-4) and compounds [cardamomin (1), (+/-)-polygohomoisoflavanone (2), (S)-(-)-pinostrobin (3), 2',4'-dihydroxy-3',6'-dimethoxychalcone (4), (2S)-(-)-5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavanone (5), and (2S)-(-)-5,7-dimethoxyflavanone (6)] obtained from leaves of Polygonum limbatum. The microbroth dilution was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the samples against 11 microbial strains including Candida albicans, C. krusei, C. tropicalis, Aspergillus fumigatus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), S.epidermidis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. The sulphorhodamine B cell growth inhibition assay was used to assess the cytotoxicity of the above samples on lung A549 adenocarcinoma, breast carcinoma MCF-7, prostate carcinoma PC-3, cervical carcinoma HeLa, and the acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1. The results of the MIC determination indicated that, apart from fraction PLA3, all other fractions as well as PLA and compound 3 were selectively active. MIC values were noted on 100 % of the 11 tested microorganisms for fraction PLA3, 72.7 % for PLA, fraction PLA2, and compound 4, 63.6 % for PLA1, and 54.5 % for fraction PLA4. The results of the cytotoxicity assay revealed that, except for A459 cells, more than 50 % inhibition of the proliferation was obtained with each of the tested samples on at least one of the four other cell lines. IC(5)(0) values below 4 microg/mL were obtained with 1 and 4 on THP-1 cells. The overall results of the present study provided baseline information for the possible use of Polygonum limbatum as well as some of the isolated compounds for the control of cancer diseases and mostly leukemia.
TI  - Transferable plasmid-mediated resistance to linezolid due to cfr in a human clinical isolate of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Nonmutational resistance to linezolid is due to the presence of cfr, which encodes a methyltransferase responsible for methylation of A2503 in the 23S rRNA. The cfr gene was first described in animal isolates of staphylococci, and more recently, it has been identified in Staphylococcus aureus from human clinical infections, including in an outbreak of methicillin-resistant S. aureus. In enterococci, cfr has been described in an animal isolate of Enterococcus faecalis from China. Here, we report an isolate of linezolid-resistant E. faecalis (603-50427X) recovered from a patient in Thailand who received prolonged therapy with the antibiotic for the treatment of atypical mycobacterial disease. The isolate lacked mutations in the genes coding for 23S rRNA and L3 and L4 ribosomal proteins and belonged to the multilocus sequence type (MLST) 16 (ST16), which is commonly found in enterococcal isolates from animal sources. Resistance to linezolid was associated with the presence of cfr on an ~97-kb transferable plasmid. The cfr gene environment exhibited DNA sequences similar to those of other cfr-carrying plasmids previously identified in staphylococci (nucleotide identity, 99 to 100%). The cfr-carrying plasmid was transferable by conjugation to a laboratory strain of E. faecalis (OG1RF) but not to Enterococcus faecium or S. aureus. The cfr gene was flanked by IS256-like sequences both upstream and downstream. This is the first characterization of the potential horizontal transferability of the cfr gene from a human linezolid-resistant isolate of E. faecalis.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of rare Streptomyces species against clinical resistant bacteria].
AB  - In the search for new antibiotics from Steptomyces, investigating extremes habitats enhances the probability of isolating novel producers. In this context, the antibacterial activity of four Streptomyces strains isolated from Ezzmoul saltpans was studied. Two of them showed antibacterial activity against antibiotic's resistant bacteria (Bacillus cereus: beta-lactamines and sulfamides resistant, Streptococcus faecalis: penicillin, tetracycline and cotrimoxazole resistant, and Staphylococcus aureus Mu 50: vancomycine resistant). The most active Streptomyces strain produces one type of polar bioactive molecules that resists to temperature variation and light exposition. Its activity appears in the first culture day and reaches its maximal value in the fourth day. The second strain presents themoresistant activity that reaches its maximal value in the first culture day. It produces two types of bioactive molecules, one is polar and the second is non polar (according to thin layer chromatography technique results).
TI  - Phage endolysins with broad antimicrobial activity against Enterococcus faecalis  clinical strains.
AB  - Increasing antibiotic resistance of bacterial pathogens has drawn the attention to the potential use of bacteriophage endolysins as alternative antibacterial agents. Here we have identified, characterized, and studied the lytic potential of two endolysins, Lys168 and Lys170, from phages infecting Enterococcus faecalis. Lys168 and Lys170 belong to the cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolases/peptidases (CHAP) and amidase-2 protein families, respectively. Lys168 is quite a unique enterococcal phage endolysin. It shares 95% amino acidic identity with the endolysin of Staphylococcus aureus phage SAP6, which in turn is distantly related to all known CHAP endolysins of S. aureus phages. Lys170 seems to be a natural chimera assembling catalytic and cell-wall-binding domains of different origin. Both endolysins showed a clear preference to act against E. faecalis and they were able to lyse a high proportion of clinical isolates of this species. Specifically, Lys168 and Lys170 lysed more than 70% and 90% of the tested isolates, respectively, which included a panel of diverse and typed strains representative of highly prevalent clonal complexes. Lys170 was active against all tested E. faecalis VRE strains. The quasi specificity toward E. faecalis is discussed considering the nature of the enzymes' functional domains and the structure of the cell wall peptidoglycan.
TI  - Isolation and lytic activity of the Listeria bacteriophage endolysin LysZ5 against Listeria monocytogenes in soya milk.
AB  - The endolysin gene (lysZ5) from the genome of the Listeria monocytogenes phage FWLLm3 was cloned in Escherichia coli and characterized. Comparative sequence analysis revealed that lysZ5 resembled the murein hydrolase ply511 encoded by L. monocytogenes phage A511. The encoded protein LysZ5 had a predicted molecular mass of 35.8 kDa and was expressed in E. coli as an N-terminal fusion protein of 41.5 kDa. Addition of purified fusion protein to lawns of indicator bacteria showed that LysZ5 could lyse L. monocytogenes, Listeria innocua and Listeria welshimeri, but not Staphylococcus aureus or Enterococcus faecalis. The purified protein was able to kill L. monocytogenes growing in soya milk, with the pathogen concentration reduced by more than 4 log(1)(0) CFU ml(-)(1) after 3 h incubation at 4 degrees C. As far as we know, this is the first report of a Listeria phage endolysin to control pathogens in soya milk and to demonstrate endolysin activity in foods at refrigeration temperatures. Moreover, LysZ5 may also be useful for biocontrol in other ready-to-eat foods.
TI  - Bioactivity of the essential oil of an argentine collection of Acanthospermum hispidum (Asteraceae).
AB  - The essential oil of an Argentine collection of the annual herb Acanthospermum hispidum DC. (Asteraceae), which contains the sesquiterpenoids beta-caryophyllene (35.2%), alpha-bisabolol (11.4%), and germacrene D (11.1%) as major constituents, displayed molluscicidal effects on an adult population of Biomphalaria peregrina Orbigny (LD50 37.8 microg/mL) and produced alteration of the feeding and oviposition behavior of the polyphagous insect Spodoptera frugiperda Smith when incorporated in the larval diet at 250 microg/g. In addition, a selective antibacterial activity was observed against pathogenic strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis (MICs 62.5 and 125 microg/mL), but was inactive at 125 microg/mL against three beneficial lactic acid bacteria. Synergistic interactions were further validated by FIC index determination of the combination of the antibiotics oxacillin and gentamicin and the essential oil on the four pathogenic strains evaluated.
TI  - Essential oil composition and antibacterial activity of Monticalia greenmaniana (Asteraceae).
AB  - The essential oils from fresh aerial parts of Monticalia greenmaniana (Hieron) C. Jeffrey (Asteraceae) collected in March, were analyzed by GC/MS. Oil yields (w/v) of 0.1% (flowers), 0.07%, (stems) and 0.1% (leaves) were obtained by hydrodistillation. Thirteen, sixteen and eighteen components, respectively, were identified by comparison of their mass spectra with those in the Wiley GC-MS Library data base. The major components of the flower and stem oils were 1-nonane (38.8% flowers; 33.5% stems), alpha-pinene (29.0% flowers; 14.8% stems) and germacrene D (15.6% flowers; 18.6% stems). However, in the leaf oil, germacrene D was observed at 50.7%, followed by beta-cedrene at 8.4%. The leaf essential oil showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against the important human pathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 19433), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 25955) with MIC values ranging from 75 to 6000 ppm.
TI  - Evaluation of standard- and high-dose daptomycin versus linezolid against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus isolates in an in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model with simulated endocardial vegetations.
AB  - Daptomycin MICs for enterococci are typically 1- to 2-fold higher than those for  Staphylococcus aureus, and there is an imminent need to establish the optimal dose for appropriate treatment of enterococcal infections. We investigated the bactericidal activity of daptomycin at various dose exposures compared to that of linezolid against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) in an in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model utilizing simulated endocardial vegetations over 96 h. Daptomycin at doses of 6, 8, 10, and 12 mg/kg of body weight/day and linezolid at a dose of 600 mg every 12 h were evaluated against two clinical vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium strains (EFm11499 and 09-184D1051), one of which was linezolid resistant (09-184D1051), and one clinical vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis strain (EFs11496). Daptomycin MICs were 4, 2, and 0.5 mug/ml for EFm11499, 09-184D1051, and EFs11496, respectively. Bactericidal activity, defined as a >/= 3 log(10) CFU/g reduction from the initial colony count, was demonstrated against all three isolates with all doses of daptomycin; however, bactericidal activity was not sustained with the daptomycin 6- and 8-mg/kg/day regimens. Linezolid was bacteriostatic against EFm11499 and displayed no appreciable activity against 09-184D1051 or EFs11496. Concentration-dependent killing was displayed with more sustained reduction in colony count (3.58 to 6.46 and 5.89 to 6.56 log(10) CFU/g) at 96 h for the simulated regimen of daptomycin at doses of 10 and 12 mg/kg/day, respectively (P </= 0.012). No E. faecium mutants with reduced susceptibility were recovered at any dosage regimen; however, the E. faecalis strain developed reduced daptomycin susceptibility with daptomycin at 6, 8, and 10 but not at 12 mg/kg/day. Daptomycin displayed a dose-dependent response against three VRE isolates, with high-dose daptomycin producing sustained bactericidal activity. Further research is warranted.
TI  - Validation of direct plating of a stool sample as a method for Listeria monocytogenes detection.
AB  - The aim of current studies was to validate the direct plating of a stool sample for Listeria monocytogenes detection, using selective medium Palcam agar with Palcam selective supplement. Validation was performed using stool samples collected from healthy humans inoculated with Listeria sp. strains. Stool samples were frozen to determine the influence of freezing on method robustness. The presented research defines the Listeria monocytogenes limit of detection (LOD) as 10(3) cfu/g of stools for fresh and frozen samples. Repeatability and reproducibility of the method has been confirmed using statistical methods. We show the effectiveness of direct plating of stool samples on Palcam agar with Palcam selective supplement collected for Listeria monocytogenes detection. This method could be useful for this pathogen detection in stool samples collected from patients with diarrhoea.
TI  - In vitro study of elution kinetics and bio-activity of meropenem-loaded acrylic bone cement.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Use of antibiotic-loaded acrylic bone cement to treat orthopaedic infections continues to remain popular, but resistance to routinely used antibiotics has led to the search for alternative, more effective antibiotics. We studied, in vitro, the elution kinetics and bio-activity of different concentrations of meropenem-loaded acrylic bone cement. METHODS: Meropenem-loaded bone cement cylinders of different concentrations were serially immersed in normal saline. Elution kinetics was studied by measuring the drug concentration in the eluate, collected at pre-determined intervals, by high-performance liquid chromatography. Bio-activity of the eluate of two different antibiotic concentrations was tested for a period of 3 weeks against each of the following organisms: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 2593 (MSSA), Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, S. aureus ATCC 43300 (MRSA) and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 700603 (ESBL). RESULTS: Meropenem elutes from acrylic bone cement for a period of 3-27 days depending on the concentration of antibiotic. Higher doses of antibiotic concentration resulted in greater elution of the antibiotic. The eluate was found to be biologically active against S. aureus ATCC 2593 (MSSA), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, E. coli ATCC 25922 and K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 (ESBL) for a period of 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The elution of meropenem is in keeping with typical antibiotic-loaded acrylic bone cement elution characteristics. The use of high-dose meropenem-loaded acrylic bone cement seems to be an attractive option for treatment of resistant Gram-negative orthopaedic infections but needs to be tested in vivo.
TI  - Antioxidant/antibacterial activities of a topical phytopharmaceutical formulation containing a standardized extract of Baccharis incarum, an extremophile plant species from Argentine Puna.
AB  - The antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of standardized extracts of Baccharis incarum in 60 degrees and 80 degrees ethanol and of a phytopharmaceutical formulation obtained from them were measured. Baccharis tinctures showed antimicrobial activity against clinically isolated antibiotic resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, with MIC values of 40-80 microg GAE/mL. Both tinctures exhibited ABTS(+) scavenging activity with SC(50) values between 1.6 and 4.0 microg GAE/mL. The tinctures were not genotoxic in the Salmonella assay. For this reason, the tincture in 60 degrees ethanol was incorporated into a topical pharmaceutical formulation (Hydrogel/ Carbopol(R) 934). The phytopharmaceutical formulation also showed antibacterial and antioxidant activities in the in vitro assays. The hydrogel showed microbiological, chemical, physical and functional stability during storage at room temperature. Studies that measure drug release as a determination of bioavailability were also carried out using the Franz diffusion cell (FC). The results demonstrated the release of two bioactive compounds (chlorogenic acid and 4',5-dihydroxy-3',3,6,7,8-pentamethoxyflavone) from the phytotherapic preparation in HPLC studies of FC receptor solution. In consequence, the phytopreparation applied topically could be used to treat skin and soft tissue infection produced by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Enterococcus faecalis and opens new opportunities for the use of active natural ingredients in the cosmeceutical field as antiacne and antioxidant.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of wine phenolic compounds and oenological extracts against potential respiratory pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effect of seven wine phenolic compounds and six oenological phenolic extracts on the growth of pathogenic bacteria associated with respiratory diseases (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sp Group F, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae). METHODS AND RESULTS: Antimicrobial activity was determined using a microdilution method and quantified as IC(50) . Mor. catarrhalis was the most susceptible specie to phenolic compounds and extracts. Gallic acid and ethyl gallate were the compounds that showed the greatest antimicrobial activity. Regarding phenolic extracts, GSE (grape seed extract) and GSE-O (oligomeric-rich fraction from GSE) were the ones that displayed the strongest antimicrobial effects. CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the antimicrobial properties of wine phenolic compounds and oenological extracts against potential respiratory pathogens. The antimicrobial activity of wine phenolic compounds was influenced by the type of phenolic compounds. Gram-negative bacteria were more susceptible than Gram-positive bacteria to the action of phenolic compounds and extracts; however, the effect was species-dependent. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: The ability to inhibit the growth of respiratory pathogenic bacteria as shown by several wine phenolic compounds and oenological extracts warrants further investigations to explore the use of grape and wine preparations in oral hygiene.
TI  - In silico discovery and biophysical evaluation of novel 5-(2-hydroxybenzylidene)  rhodanine inhibitors of DNA gyrase B.
AB  - Bacterial DNA gyrase is an established and validated target for the development of novel antibacterials. In our previous work, we identified a novel series of bacterial gyrase inhibitors from the class of 4-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl) thiazoles. Our ongoing effort was designated to search for synthetically more available compounds with possibility of hit to lead development. By using the virtual screening approach, new potential inhibitors were carefully selected from the focused chemical library and tested for biological activity. Herein we report on a novel class of 5-(2-hydroxybenzylidene) rhodanines as gyrase B inhibitors with activity in low micromolar range and moderate antibacterial activity. The binding of the two most active compounds to the enzyme target was further characterised using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and differential scanning fluorimetry methods (DSF).
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria from farmed seabass Dicentrarchus labrax.
AB  - The use of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the prevention or reduction of fish diseases is receiving increasing attention. In the present study, 47 LAB strains were isolated from farmed seabass ( Dicentrarchus labrax ) and were phenotypically and phylogenetically analysed by 16S rDNA and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA - polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR). Their antimicrobial effect was tested in vitro against a wide variety of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. Most of the strains isolated were enterococci belonging to the following species: Enterococcus faecium (59%), Enterococcus faecalis (21%), Enterococcus sanguinicola (4 strains), Enterococcus mundtii (1 strain), Enterococcus pseudoavium (1 strain), and Lactococcus lactis (1 strain). An Aerococcus viridans strain was also isolated. The survey of their antimicrobial susceptibility showed that all isolates were sensitive to vancomycin and exhibited resistance to between 4 and 10 other antibiotics relevant for therapy in human and animal medicine. Different patterns of resistance were noted for skin and intestines isolates. More than 69% (32 strains) of the isolates inhibited the growth of the majority of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria tested, including Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas salmonicida, Vibrio anguillarum, and Carnobacterium sp. To our knowledge, this is the first report of bioactive enterococcal species isolated from seabass that could potentially inhibit the undesirable bacteria found in food systems.
TI  - Novel chimerical endolysins with broad antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Due to their bacterial lytic action, bacteriophage endolysins have recently gained great attention as a potential alternative to antibiotics in the combat of Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, particularly those displaying multidrug resistance. However, large-scale production and purification of endolysins is frequently impaired due to their low solubility. In addition, a large number of endolysins appear to exhibit reduced lytic efficacy when compared with their action during phage infection. Here, we took advantage of the high solubility of two recently characterized enterococcal endolysins to construct chimeras targeting Staphylococcus aureus. The putative cell wall binding domain of these endolysins was substituted by that of a staphylococcal endolysin that showed poor solubility. Under appropriate conditions the resulting chimeras presented the high solubility of the parental enterococcal endolysins. In addition, they proved to be broadly active against a collection of the most relevant methicillin-resistant S. aureus epidemic clones and against other Gram-positive pathogens. Thus, fusion of endolysin domains of heterologous origin seems to be a suitable approach to design new potent endolysins with changed and/or extended lytic spectrum that are amenable to large-scale production.
TI  - Action of linezolid or vancomycin on biofilms in ventriculoperitoneal shunts in vitro.
AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts used to treat hydrocephalus have an overall infection rate of about 10% of operations. The commonest causative bacteria are Staphylococcus epidermidis, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci. Major difficulties are encountered with nonsurgical treatment due to biofilm development in the shunt tubing and inability to achieve sufficiently high CSF drug levels by intravenous administration. Recently, three cases of S. epidermidis CSF shunt infection have been treated by intravenous linezolid without surgical shunt removal, and we therefore investigated vancomycin and linezolid against biofilms of these bacteria in vitro. A continuous-perfusion model of shunt catheter biofilms was used to establish mature (1-week) biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis (both methicillin resistant [MRSA and MRSE]), Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium. They were then "treated" with either vancomycin or linezolid in concentrations achievable in CSF for 14 days. The biofilms were then monitored for 1 week for eradication and for regrowth. Enterococcal biofilms were not eradicated by either vancomycin or linezolid. Staphylococcal biofilms were eradicated by both antibiotics after 2 days and did not regrow. No resistance was seen. Linezolid at concentrations achievable by intravenous or oral administration was able to eradicate biofilms of both S. epidermidis (MRSE) and S. aureus (MRSA). Neither vancomycin at concentrations achievable by intrathecal administration nor linezolid was able to eradicate enterococcal biofilms. It is hoped that these in vitro results will stimulate further clinical trials with linezolid, avoiding surgical shunt removal.
TI  - [Antibiotic treatment of enterococcal infections in gastroenterology with daptomycin - first experiences from the EU-CORE registry study (European Cubicin(R) Outcomes Registry and Experience)].
AB  - Enterococci are a frequent cause of nosocomial infections in gastroenterology. The increase of Enterococcus faecium infections with development of resistance to gentamicin and vancomycin as well as possible linezolid resistance require alternative antibiotic therapies. Study data show that daptomycin, a highly bactericidal antibiotic is effective in enterococcal infections. However, in Germany daptomycin is so far only approved for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections, bacteremia and infective endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus aureus. In the Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Halle (Saale) from May 2 009 to April 2 010 all gastroenterological patients with evidence of invasive enterococcal infection received intravenous daptomycin treatment at inclusion in the European Cubicin(R) Outcomes Registry and Experience (EU-CORE). Gastroenterological diseases treated were necrotising pancreatitis, infected pancreatic pseudocysts, abscesses, obstructive cholangitis and sepsis. The clinical outcome was retrospectively detected by protocol-defined criteria. A total of 13 patients (8 male, 5 female, median age 59 years) with microbiologically assured enterococcal infections (10 x E. faecium, including 1 x VRE, 6 x E. faecalis, including double infections) were treated with intravenous daptomycin (6 mg per kg body weight). In the presence of polymicrobial infections (10 of 13 patients), an additional anti-infective therapy was initiated according to sensitivity testing. Concomitantly a direct focus approach with stenting, puncture or drainage was performed. The clinical cure rate was 92 % (12 of 13 patients). One patient died from a non-surgically uncontrollable malignancy (Klatskin tumour Bismuth IIIb). There were no adverse events. These results allow us to conclude that antibiotic therapy with daptomycin in invasive or bacteraemic enterococcal infections leads to high cure rates (up to 90 % and more) when concomitant and adequate focus relief is performed. Larger clinical studies to obtain an extended drug approval are desirable.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance pattern of uropathogenic Escherichia coli in South West Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Various studies have indicated Escherichia coli to be the most prevalent pathogen isolated in urine specimens. OBJECTIVES: This study was therefore conducted to find out whether the same holds in this environment. The study will also determine the resistance pattern of uropathogenic Escherichia coli isolates to available antibiotics. METHODS: Two hundred consecutive urine samples collected from patients with clinical diagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTI) and which have significant bacteriuria were included in this study. These were analysed using standard bacteriological techniques. Escherichia coli isolated from the urine specimens were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing because many cases of resistance to commonly available antibiotics here have been encountered in the course of management of patients with UTI. RESULTS: Klebsiella species (40%) were found to be the most prevalent uropathogen in this environment, followed by E. coli (25%), Staphylococcus aureus (25%), Proteus species (4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%), and Enterococcus faecalis (3.5%). Resistance of E. coli to antibiotics commonly used in our environment for UTI, namely, amoxicillin/ clavulanate, cotrimoxazole and amoxicillin were 100% each. Resistance rates to other antibiotics such as ofloxacin, gentamycin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline were 70%, 92%, 96% and 88% respectively. CONCLUSION: The high antibiotic resistance rates recorded in this study therefore calls for urgent review of existing and implementation of effective antibiotic policy in this community.
TI  - Antibacterial and antimycobacterial lignans and flavonoids from Larrea tridentata.
AB  - Three lignans and four flavonoids were isolated and characterized from Larrea tridentata and compounds were tested against 16 bacterial species/strains. Results showed that: dihydroguaiaretic acid (1) had activity towards methicillin resistant (MR) Staphylococcus aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 50 microg/mL) and multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MIC 12.5-50 microg/mL); 4-epi-larreatricin (2) was active against Enterobacter cloacae (MIC 12.5 microg/mL), as well as sensitive (MIC 50 microg/mL) and MDR strains of M. tuberculosis (MIC 25 microg/mL). 3'-Demethoxy-6-O-demethylisoguaiacin (3) displayed activity against sensitive and resistant S. aureus (MIC 25 microg/mL), Enterococcus faecalis (MIC 12.5 microg/mL), Escherichia coli (MIC 50 microg/mL), E. cloacae (MIC 12.5 microg/mL) and MDR strains of M. tuberculosis (MIC 12.5 microg/mL). 5,4'-Dihydroxy-3,7,8,3'-tetramethoxyflavone (4) and 5,4'-dihydroxy-3,7,8-trimethoxyflavone (5) were active against M. tuberculosis MDR strains having MIC values of 25 and 25-50 microg/mL, respectively, while 5,4'-dihydroxy-7-methoxyflavone (6) was active against S. aureus (MIC 50 microg/mL) and E. faecalis (MIC 50 microg/mL). We concluded that lignan 3 is the main compound responsible for the antibacterial activity of L. tridentata. Lignans 1 and 2 as well as flavonoid 6 contribute with some degree of antibacterial activity. On the other hand, compounds 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 contributed to the antimycobacterial activity found in L. tridentata.
TI  - Inhibition of Candida albicans yeast-hyphal transition and biofilm formation by Solidago virgaurea water extracts.
AB  - Xerostomia is a decrease of saliva secretion, which can unbalance the oral microflora, mainly to the benefit of Candida albicans. The aim of the present study was to find a plant extract that could create an unfavourable environment for Candida, and would, therefore, be appropriate for use in a dry-mouth daily-care mouthwash. Water extract from the herbaceous plant Solidago virgaurea (Goldenrod) was selected due to its saponin content (plant detergents). Saponin concentrations reached 0.7 and 0.95 mg ml(-1) in S. virgaurea subsp. virgaurea and S. virgaurea subsp. alpestris extracts, respectively. C. albicans was grown in liquid medium and cells were counted by microscopic examination after 0, 4 and 24 h of incubation. Solidago extracts did not inhibit the growth of C. albicans (four strains), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius or Enterococcus faecalis. When inocula were incubated with Solidago extract for 4 and 24 h, we observed a decrease in Candida yeast-hyphal transition. Candida biofilms were then prepared in microtitre plates and treated with plant extracts at 0 h, to estimate biofilm formation, or at 18 h to estimate the effect of the saponin on pre-formed biofilms. Biofilm formation and pre-formed biofilms were both strongly inhibited. In conclusion, the S. virgaurea extract was efficient against two key virulence factors of C. albicans: the yeast-hyphal transition phase and biofilm formation.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of alcohol-based hand gels with a 30-s application.
AB  - AIMS: The objective of this study was to assess the antimicrobial efficacy of alcohol-based hand gels according to European Norm 1500 (EN 1500). METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed the antimicrobial efficacy of 12 alcohol-based hand gels produced in Brazil, containing 70% w/w or v/v ethyl alcohol as the active ingredient, according to EN 1500, with a 30-s application. In addition, 70% w/w ethyl alcohol and three alcohol-based hand rubs commonly used in Europe and effective according to EN 1500 were also tested. Eight of 12 (67%) alcohol-based hand gels produced in Brazil failed by EN 1500. In contrast, 70% w/w ethyl alcohol and European alcohol-based hand rubs were approved by EN 1500. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the majority of Brazilian alcohol-based hand gels showed limited efficacy on hand hygiene within 30 s. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The findings of this study may be used as an important argument to motivate Brazilian manufacturers to improve the antimicrobial efficacy of alcohol-based hand gels, because it is prudent to suppose that alcohol-based hand gels can be recommended for use in healthcare settings only if they show antimicrobial activity at least similar to that of alcohol-based liquid preparations, including the traditional 70% w/w ethyl alcohol.
TI  - Correlation between chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential  oils from fifteen Eucalyptus species growing in the Korbous and Jbel Abderrahman arboreta (North East Tunisia).
AB  - The essential oils of fifteen Eucalyptus species harvested from the Jbel Abderrahman and Korbous arboreta (North East Tunisia) were screened for their antibacterial activities by the agar disc diffusion method. Eighteen major components as identified by GC/FID and GC/MS were selected for a study of the chemical and biological activity variability. The main one was 1,8-cineole, followed by spathulenol, trans-pinocarveol, alpha-pinene, p-cymene, globulol, cryptone, beta-phellandrene, viridiflorol, borneol, limonene and isospathulenol. The chemical principal component analysis identified five species groups and subgroups, where each group constituted a chemotype, however that of the values of zone diameter of the inhibition (zdi) identified six groups of Eucalyptus oils, characterized by their antibacterial inhibition ability. The strongest activity was shown by E. platypus oil against Enterococcus faecalis and by E. lamannii oil against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. A correlation between the levels of some major components and the antibacterial activities was observed.
TI  - Microbiological aspects of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls.
AB  - This study aimed to establish the vaginal introitus microbial flora in girls with and without symptoms of vulvovaginitis, and to present the distribution of isolated microorganisms by age groups in girls with vulvovaginitis. We enrolled 500 girls with vulvovaginitis symptoms, aged 2-12 years, referred by their pediatricians for microbiological examination of the vaginal introitus swabs, and 30 age-matched asymptomatic girls. Similar microbial flora was isolated in both groups, but the symptomatic girls had significantly more common positive microbiological findings compared to controls (p < 0.001). In symptomatic girls, the following pathogenic bacteria were isolated: Streptococcus pyogenes (4.2%), Haemophilus influenzae (0.4%), and Staphylococcus aureus (5.8%). Bacteria of fecal origin were found in vaginal introitus swabs in 33.8% of cases, most commonly Proteus mirabilis (14.4%), Enterococcus faecalis (12.2%), and Escherichia coli (7.0%). The finding of fecal flora was more common compared to controls, reaching a statistical significance (p < 0.05), as well as in girls aged up to 6 years (p < 0.001). Candida species were found in 2.4% of girls with vulvovaginitis symptoms. CONCLUSION: The microbial ecosystem in girls with clinical signs of vulvovaginitis is complex and variable, and the presence of a microorganism does not necessarily imply that it is the cause of infection. The diagnosis of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls requires a complex and comprehensive approach, and microbiological findings should be interpreted in the context of clinical findings.
TI  - Development of 4H-pyridopyrimidines: a class of selective bacterial protein synthesis inhibitors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We have identified a series of compounds that inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria. Initial IC50's in aminoacylation/translation (A/T) assays ranged from 3 to14 muM. This series of compounds are variations on a 5,6,7,8-tetrahydropyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidin-4-ol scaffold (e.g., 4H-pyridopyrimidine). METHODS: Greater than 80 analogs were prepared to investigate the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Structural modifications included changes in the central ring and substituent modifications in its periphery focusing on the 2- and 6-positions. An A/T system was used to determine IC50 values for activity of the analogs in biochemical assays. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined for each analog against cultures of Enterococcus faecalis, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli tolC mutants and E. coli modified with PMBN. RESULTS: Modifications to the 2-(pyridin-2-yl) ring resulted in complete inactivation of the compounds. However, certain modifications at the 6-position resulted in increased antimicrobial potency. The optimized compounds inhibited the growth of E. faecalis, M. catarrhalis, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, E. coli tolC, mutants and E. coli modified with PMBN with MIC values of 4, </= 0.12, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1 mug/ml, respectively. IC50 values in biochemical assay were reduced to mid-nanomolar range. CONCLUSION: 4H-pyridopyrimidine analogs demonstrate broad-spectrum inhibition of bacterial growth and modification of the compounds establishes SAR.
TI  - Efficient synthesis and biological evaluation of proximicins A, B and C.
AB  - A quick and efficient synthesis and the biological evaluation of promising antitumor-antibiotics proximicins A, B and C are reported. The characteristic repetitive unit of these molecules, the methyl 4-Boc-aminofuran-2-carboxylate 15, was prepared in three synthetic steps in good yield using an optimised copper-catalysed amidation method. The proximicins were evaluated for their antitumor activity using cellular methods. Proximicin B induced apoptosis in both Hodgkin's lymphoma and T-cell leukemia cell lines and proximicin C exhibited significantly high cytotoxicity against glioblastoma and breast carcinoma cells. The proximicins were also screened against Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and several strains of methicillin-and multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Proximicin B showed noteworthy activity against antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Kinetics and morphology of polymicrobial biofilm formation on polypropylene mesh.
AB  - We examined the ability of three clinical bacterial isolates to form mixed biofilms on surgical polypropylene mesh (PPM) in vitro. The three strains--Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterobacter cloacae--were isolated from a patient with an infected PPM. Staphylococcus aureus and E. faecalis (alone and in combination) were inoculated into culture containing squares of PPM and allowed to attach and propagate into mature biofilms. Enterococcus faecalis initially attached to the mesh in greater numbers; however, 7 days postinoculation, there were more S. aureus cells attached, indicating that in vitro S. aureus is the out-competing species. All three isolates were then co-cultured to form mature biofilms on mesh, and the biofilms were examined by confocal microscopy using both Live/Dead staining and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Imaging revealed a dense biofilm structure with interstitial voids and channels; rods and cocci were interspersed throughout the biofilm, indicating bacterial coexistence in close proximity. FISH revealed staphylococci and enterococci adjacent to each other and also to the Enterobacter, distinguishable by its rod morphology. These studies show that different species can co-operatively form mature biofilms on mesh but that the relative abundance of a species within the biofilm may vary over time.
TI  - Protection against Staphylococcus aureus by antibody to the polyglycerolphosphate backbone of heterologous lipoteichoic acid.
AB  - Type 1 lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is present in many clinically important gram-positive bacteria, including enterococci, streptococci, and staphylococci, and antibodies against LTA have been shown to opsonize nonencapsulated Enterococcus faecalis strains. In the present study, we show that antibodies against E. faecalis LTA also bind to type 1 LTA from other gram-positive species and opsonized Staphylocccus epidermidis and Staphylcoccus aureus strains as well as group B streptococci. Inhibition studies using teichoic acid oligomers indicated that cross-reactive opsonic antibodies bind to the teichoic acid backbone. Passive immunization with rabbit antibodies against E. faecalis LTA promoted the clearance of bacteremia by E. faecalis and S. epidermidis in mice. Furthermore, passive protection also reduced mortality in a murine S. aureus peritonitis model. The effectiveness of rabbit antibody against LTA suggests that this conserved bacterial structure could function as a single vaccine antigen that targets multiple gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Rapid detection of urinary tract pathogens using microcalorimetry: principle, technique and first results.
AB  - What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Microcalorimetry has been applied in several microbiological studies, but never in a clinical urological context. In addition, basic knowledge on the growth of urinary pathogens in urine is still scarce and data regarding the growth rate of many urinary pathogens in urine are still not available. The study demonstrates that this innovative application of microcalorimetry is useful in (i) investigating the growth of urinary pathogens in sterilized urine and (ii) as a rapid tool for diagnosis of urinary infection as well as for further identification of the causative infectious agent. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the value of isothermal microcalorimetry (IMC) in the detection and differentiation of common urinary tract pathogens in urine. IMC is a non-specific analytical tool for the measurement of heat in the microwatt range. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A microcalorimeter equipped with 48 channels was used. Detection was accomplished, and growth was monitored for four bacterial strains in sterilized urine at 37 degrees C by measuring metabolic heat flow (microW = microJ/s) as a function of time. The strains were Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was detected after 3.1 to 17.1 h with decreasing inocula. The detection limit was 1 colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL for E. coli, 10 CFU/mL for P. mirabilis and E. faecalis and 10(3) CFU/mL for S. aureus. The total heat was highest in P. mirabilis ranging from 10 to 12 J, followed by E. coli (3-4 J), S. aureus (2-3 J) and E. faecalis (1.3-1.5 J). The shape of the heat flow curves was characteristic for each species independent of its initial concentration. CONCLUSIONS: IMC allows rapid detection of bacteriuria, much faster than conventional culture. Urinary tract pathogen detection after only 3.1 h is realistic. Clearly different heat flow patterns enable accurate pathogen differentiation. Due to expeditious identification of urine samples that contain only low colony counts (i.e. less than 10(3) CFU/mL), IMC may become a valuable screening tool for detecting the presence of significant bacteriuria.
TI  - Novel bacterial lipoprotein structures conserved in low-GC content gram-positive  bacteria are recognized by Toll-like receptor 2.
AB  - Bacterial lipoproteins/lipopeptides inducing host innate immune responses are sensed by mammalian Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). These bacterial lipoproteins are structurally divided into two groups, diacylated or triacylated lipoproteins, by the absence or presence of an amide-linked fatty acid. The presence of diacylated lipoproteins has been predicted in low-GC content gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasmas based on the absence of one modification enzyme in their genomes; however, we recently determined triacylated structures in low-GC gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, raising questions about the actual lipoprotein structure in other low-GC content gram-positive bacteria. Here, through intensive MS analyses, we identified a novel and unique bacterial lipoprotein structure containing an N-acyl-S-monoacyl-glyceryl-cysteine (named the lyso structure) from low-GC gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus. Two of the purified native lyso-form lipoproteins induced proinflammatory cytokine production from mice macrophages in a TLR2-dependent and TLR1-independent manner but with a different dependence on TLR6. Additionally, two other new lipoprotein structures were identified. One is the "N-acetyl" lipoprotein structure containing N-acetyl-S-diacyl-glyceryl-cysteine, which was found in five gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis. The N-acetyl lipoproteins induced the proinflammatory cytokines through the TLR2/6 heterodimer. The other was identified in a mycoplasma strain and is an unusual diacyl lipoprotein structure containing two amino acids before the lipid-modified cysteine residue. Taken together, our results suggest the existence of novel TLR2-stimulating lyso and N-acetyl forms of lipoproteins that are conserved in low-GC content gram-positive bacteria and provide clear evidence for the presence of yet to be identified key enzymes involved in the bacterial lipoprotein biosynthesis.
TI  - Garlic ointment inhibits biofilm formation by bacterial pathogens from burn wounds.
AB  - When thermal injury damages the skin, the physical barrier protecting underlying  tissues from invading micro-organisms is compromised and the host's immune system becomes supressed, facilitating colonization and infection of burn wounds with micro-organisms. Within the wound, bacteria often develop biofilms, which protect the bacteria from the immune response and enhance their resistance to antibiotics. As the prophylactic use of conventional antibiotics drives selection of drug-resistant strains, the use of novel agents to prevent biofilm formation by wound pathogens is essential. In the present study, we utilized our recently developed in vitro wound biofilm model to examine the antibiofilm activity of garlic (Allium sativum). Wound pathogens were inoculated on sterile cellulose discs, exposed to formulated garlic ointment (GarO) or ointment base, and incubated to allow biofilm development. Biofilms were quantified and visualized microscopically. GarO prevented biofilm development by Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and caused a 2-5 log reduction of the bioburden within Enterococcus faecalis biofilms. Additionally, GarO disrupted partially developed biofilms produced by S. aureus, S. epidermidis and A. baumannii. The antistaphylococcal activity of GarO was stable for over 3 months at room temperature. Thus, GarO could be used as a prophylactic therapy to prevent wound biofilms caused by both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria from forming, and may be a potential therapy for disrupting established staphylococcal biofilms.
TI  - The effect of various concentrations of iodine potassium iodide on the antimicrobial properties of mineral trioxide aggregate--a pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) is a multi-purpose dental material with various uses in dentistry. Iodine potassium iodide (IKI) is the most commonly used iodine compound in endodontics. We aimed to assess the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored ProRoot MTA combined with IKI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of IKI was assessed at three concentrations (1%, 2%, and 4%) as the mixing agents combined with MTA against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. For each microorganism, three plates were inoculated with 100 mul of a microbial suspension (McFarland 0.5). Four wells were prepared in each plate. MTA (70 mg) was mixed with any of the three concentrations of IKI (25 mul) or sterile distilled water (25 mul) and placed in each well. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees C. Zones of inhibition (ZOI) were measured in millimeters by a blinded observer. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance and the Dunnett t-test. RESULTS: All MTA mixtures with water or IKI solutions showed inhibitory zones. The mean ZOI of each MTA/IKI mixture was not significantly different from MTA/water mixture (P > 0.05). MTA/1% IKI had smaller ZOI than MTA/water against E. coli, E. faecalis, and C. albicans. MTA/2% IKI showed larger ZOI only against P. aeruginosa. MTA/4% IKI showed larger ZOI against P. aeruginosa and E. coli (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Substitution of IKI solutions (1%, 2%, and 4%) for water did not significantly increase the antimicrobial activity of MTA.
TI  - Indirect rapid prototyping of antibacterial acid anhydride copolymer microneedles.
AB  - Microneedles are needle-like projections with microscale features that may be used for transdermal delivery of a variety of pharmacologic agents, including antibacterial agents. In the study described in this paper, an indirect rapid prototyping approach involving a combination of visible light dynamic mask micro-stereolithography and micromolding was used to prepare microneedle arrays out of a biodegradable acid anhydride copolymer, Gantrez((R)) AN 169 BF. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry and nanoindentation studies were performed to evaluate the chemical and mechanical properties of the Gantrez((R)) AN 169 BF material. Agar plating studies were used to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial performance of these arrays against Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Large zones of growth inhibition were noted for Escherichia coli, S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and B. subtilis. The performance of Gantrez((R)) AN 169 BF against several bacteria suggests that biodegradable acid anhydride copolymer microneedle arrays prepared using visible light dynamic mask micro-stereolithography micromolding may be useful for treating a variety of skin infections.
TI  - Post-operative wound infection in salvage laryngectomy: does antibiotic prophylaxis have an impact?
AB  - Salvage laryngectomy carries a high risk of post-operative infection with reported rates of 40-61%. The purpose of this study was to analyse infections in our own patients and review the potential impact of our current antibiotic prophylaxis (AP). A retrospective analysis of infection in 26 consecutive patients between 2000 and 2010 undergoing salvage total laryngectomy (SL) following recurrent laryngeal cancer after failed radiotherapy or chemo-radiation was undertaken. The antibiotic prophylaxis was intravenous teicoplanin, cefuroxime and metronidazole at induction and for the following 24 h. Infection was defined by Tabet and Johnson's grade 5, categorized as pharyngocutaneous fistula. Fifteen patients (58%) developed a post-operative wound infection, which occurred on average at 12 days after surgery. Univariate analysis demonstrated three risk variables that had a significant correlation with infection: alcohol consumption (p = 0.01), cN stage of tumour (p < 0.01), and pre-operative albumin levels <3.2 g/L (p = 0.012). There was a trend, though not significant, for increased infection in patients with high or low BMIs. The most common organisms isolated from clinical samples from infected patients were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA (43%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (36%), Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis (7% each). All these organisms are typical hospital-acquired pathogens. Pseudomonas and Serratia were not covered by the prophylactic regime we used. The current antibiotic regime following SL is inadequate as the rate of infection is high. It would therefore seem logical to trial a separate antibiotic protocol of AP for patients undergoing SL that would include an extended course of antibiotics after the standard prophylaxis. In addition, infection rates may also be reduced by improving the metabolic state of patients pre-operatively by multi-disciplinary action. Steps should also be taken to reduce cross-infection with nosocomial pathogens in these patients. Other aspects of surgical management should be also taken in consideration.
TI  - Antibacterial effect and cytotoxicity of beta-1,3-1, 4-glucanase from endophytic  Bacillus subtilis SWB8.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We studied the antibiotic activity and selective cytotoxicity of beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase from endophytic Bacillus subtilis SWB8. METHODS: Based on gel permeation chromatography, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods, protein fragments of beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase from endophytic Bacillus subtilis strain SWB8 were purified and identified. Then, beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase was used to evaluate the antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi A, Shigella dysenteriae, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans and cytotoxicity against human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells (A549) and human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) by using the disc diffusion, methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium and flow cytometry methods, respectively. RESULTS: Bacterial beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase showed broad antimicrobial spectrum against all nine bacterial and fungal strains. Furthermore, beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase possessed significant anticancer activity against A549 cells that the IC50 and IC90 values were 11.5 and 20.1 microg/mL, respectively. The percentage of apoptotic A549 cells treated with different concentrations of beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase was significantly increased from 4.43% of the control to 43.1% of 19.2 microg/mL glucanase in a dose dependent manner. In contrast, these changes could not be observed in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. CONCLUSION: Beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase could be a potential source of desirable antimicrobial agent, or anticancer compounds with higher efficiency and lower toxicity.
TI  - [Septic complications after multilocal fractures and multiple traumatic injury].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The increase of the number of the multiple traumatic injuries is related to social factors, such as: the development of industry, the change of life style and the conditions of work, the manner and the speed of relocation and the biological factors related with the elongation of life time. According to the World Health Organization data the injuries are one of the main health problems in the world. AIM: The clinical analysis of multitrauma patients treated due to the septic complications of the fractures. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The material consists of 34 multitrauma patients treated in The Osteomyelitis and Septic Complications Unit in Prof. A. Gruca Orthopedic and Trauma Hospital in Otwock, Poland between 2005 and 2010. The cause of trauma, the timing of arrival to our unit, the number of the days of treatment, the number and the specificity of bone and internal injuries, the bacteriology of bone infections and operative techniques and pharmacologic treatment were analyzed. RESULTS: The causes of the injuries were: road accident (79%), fall from the height (8.8%), others (12.2%). The first stay in our unit was 21 months after the injury on average (1-129 months), the number of stays in the unit was 2,8 on average (1-6), the length of stay was 25.7 days on average (4-108 days). In analyzed group of 34 patients, we found: 12 opened fractures of single bone, 11 opened fractures of more than one bone, 22 closed fractures of single bone, 12 closed fracture of more than one bone. Central nervous system (55.9%), abdominal organs (35.3%) and thorax (29.4%) were the most common internal organs ocuppied with the injury. Osteomyelitis was the most frequently diagnosed in femur (50%) and tibia (41.2%). The main reasons of bone infection were: Methycylin-Sensitive Staphylococcus Aureus (35,3%), Methycylin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (17,3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23,5%), Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumani, Enterococcus faecalis. The following treatment was undertaken: the debridement of septic bone, usually together with the removal of the hardware stabilization (73,5%), the removal of the damaged or improperly fixed stabilization (44%), the conversion of the internal fixation into the external fixation(62%). All the patients were taken intravenous antibiotics according to The Hospital Commission for Preventing of Infections, i.e. 2nd generation cephalosporin and gentamycin. Culture directed antibiotics were started after receiving the bacteriology results. The outcomes. The control of infection in 14 patients (41.3%), 18 patients (52.9%) still remain under the treatment, bad outcome (persistent infection, amputation of a extremity) we had in 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple traumatic injury and its immunologic consequences predispose to systemic infections including bone infections. Posttraumatic osteomyelitis is the indication to chronic treatment. Surgical management of the wound and external fixation of the fractures of the long bones according to the control damage surgery is the most important in prevention of posttraumatic osteomyelitis.
TI  - Repeat 2-stage exchange for infected total hip arthroplasty: a viable option?
AB  - We investigated whether performing a repeat 2-stage exchange eradicates infection in patients who previously underwent 2-stage treatment for an infected total hip arthroplasty. We identified 15 patients who had failed a 2-stage total hip arthroplasty and underwent a planned repeat 2-stage between 2000 and 2009. Of the 15 patients, 8 were treated with a complete 2-stage procedure, whereas the remaining 7 patients were treated only with a first-stage resection of the infected implant. Of the 8 patients who underwent complete 2-stage exchange, 1 died because of in-hospital complications, and 1 had a recurrent infection. Repeat infection is highly associated with resistant organisms, obesity, and poor patient health. Of the 7 patients who underwent resection without reimplantation, 3 had a recurrent infection. Our data suggest that if infection can be adequately controlled after repeat resection of the joint prosthesis, reimplantation is a reasonable option.
TI  - Environmental DNA-encoded antibiotics fasamycins A and B inhibit FabF in type II  fatty acid biosynthesis.
AB  - In a recent study of polyketide biosynthetic gene clusters cloned directly from soil, we isolated two antibiotics, fasamycins A and B, which showed activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. To identify the target of the fasamycins, mutants with elevated fasamycin A minimum inhibitory concentrations were selected from a wild-type culture of E. faecalis OG1RF. Next-generation sequencing of these mutants, in conjunction with in vitro biochemical assays, showed that the fasamycins inhibit FabF of type II fatty acid biosynthesis (FASII). Candidate gene overexpression studies also showed that fasamycin resistance is conferred by fabF overexpression. On the basis of comparisons with known FASII inhibitors and in silico docking studies, the chloro-gem-dimethyl-anthracenone substructure seen in the fasamycins is predicted to represent a naturally occurring FabF-specific antibiotic pharmacophore. Optimization of this pharmacophore should yield FabF-specific antibiotics with increased potencies and differing spectra of activity. This study demonstrates that culture-independent antibiotic discovery methods have the potential to provide access to novel metabolites with modes of action that differ from those of antibiotics currently in clinical use.
TI  - Antioxidant, antimicrobial activities and fatty acid components of flower, leaf,  stem and seed of Hypericum scabrum.
AB  - The hexane extracts of flower, leaf, stem, and seed of Hypericum scabrum, which were collected from northwestern Iran, were obtained by extraction in a Soxhlet apparatus. The fatty acids were converted to methyl esters and determined by gas chromatography/flame ionization detector (GC/FID) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) systems. The hexane extract from the flower, leaf, stem, and seed contained 39.1%, 43.2%, 29.0%, and 37.6% of omega-3 fatty acids, respectively. The other main components of the flower extract were tetracosane (12.2%) and palmitic acid (9.3%), and that of the leaf extract was palmitic acid (7.4%). The stem and seed extracts contained bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (18.7% and 35.7%), nonacosane (11.7% and 3.9%) and linoleic acid (6.5% and 6.9%) as major components. The hexane extracts of different parts from H. scabrum represent an important source of omega-3 fatty acids in several Hypericum species. The antioxidant activity of all hexane extracts was evaluated by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging method. The results indicate that hexane extracts from different parts of H. scabrum possess considerable antioxidant activity. The highest radical scavenging activity was detected in seed, which had an IC50 = 165 microg/mL. The antimicrobial activity of the extracts of those samples were determined against seven Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae), as well as three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Aspergillus niger). The bioassay showed that the oil exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity. This study reveals that the all parts of this plant are attractive sources of fatty acid components, especially the essential ones, as well as of effective natural antioxidants.
TI  - Chemical and biological diversity in fourteen selections of four Ocimum species.
AB  - Biomass, essential oil yield, essential oil composition diversity, and antibacterial and antifungal activities of 14 selections of 4 Ocimum species [Ocimum basilicum L. (selections: T1-T10), O. gratissimum L. (selections: T11-T12), O. tenuiflorum L.f., syn. O. sanctum L. (selection: T13) and O. kilimandscharicum Baker ex. Guerke (selection: T14)] were investigated. O. basilicum selections T9 (methyl chavicol: 87.0%) and T10 {(Z)- and (E)-methyl cinnamate: 69.1%} produced higher biomass (67.8 and 56.7 t/ha) and oil (203.4 and 141.7 kg/ha) yields relative to 8 (T1-T8) linalool (up to 58.9%), or methyl chavicol (up to 61.8%) rich selections. O. gratissimum selection T12 (eugenol: 84.1%, 254.6 kg/ha oil yield) was significantly superior to T11 (62.1% eugenol and 18.4% camphor). O. tenuiflorum (T13, methyl eugenol: 72.5%) and O. kilimandscharicum (T14, camphor: 51.7%) produced 171.7 and 96.2 kg/ha essential oil, respectively. The essential oils exhibited broad spectrum antibacterial (against 5 Gram-positive and 7 Gram-negative bacteria) and antifungal (against 10 fungi) activities. The bacterial species Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, and Enterococcus faecalis, and the fungal species Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum gypseum, and Sporothrix schenckii were more sensitive to the essential oils.
TI  - Influence of terminal substitution on structural, DNA, protein binding, anticancer and antibacterial activities of palladium(II) complexes containing 3-methoxy salicylaldehyde-4(N) substituted thiosemicarbazones.
AB  - The variable chelating behavior of 3-methoxysalicylaldehyde-4(N)-substituted thiosemicarbazones was observed in equimolar reactions with [PdCl(2)(PPh(3))(2)]. The new complexes were characterized by various analytical, spectroscopic techniques (mass, (1)H-NMR, absorption, IR). All the new complexes were structurally characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Crystallographic results showed that the ligands H(2)L(1) and H(2)L(4) are coordinated as binegative tridentate ONS donor ligands in the complexes 1 and 4 by forming six and five member rings. However, the ligands H(2)L(2) and H(2)L(3) bound to palladium in 2 and 3 as uninegative bidentate NS donors by forming a five member chelate ring. From this study, it was found that the substitution on terminal 4(N)-nitrogen may have an influence on the chelating ability of thiosemicarbazone. The presence of hydrogen bonding in 2 and 3 might be responsible for preventing the coordination of phenolic oxygen to the metal ion. The interaction of the complexes with calf-thymus DNA (CT-DNA) has been explored by absorption and emission titration methods. Based on the observations, an electrostatic binding mode of DNA has been proposed. The protein binding studies were monitored by quenching of tryptophan and tyrosine residues in the presence of complexes using Lysozyme as model protein. Antibacterial activity studies of the complexes have been screened against pathogenic bacteria such as Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. MIC50 values of the complexes showed that they exhibited significant activity against the pathogens and among them, 3 exhibited higher activity. Further, anticancer activity of the complexes on the lung cancer cell line A549 has also been studied.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of chinfloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone antibiotic.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the in vivo antibacterial efficacy of chinfloxacin, a novel fluoroquinolone, in murine systemic and local infection models. METHODS: The efficacy of chinfloxacin in systemic infection was evaluated in a mouse peritonitis model using isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, n = 3), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 1), penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP; n = 1), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP; n = 2), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (VSE; n = 1), vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (VRE; n = 2), Escherichia coli (n = 3) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2). The local infections included mouse pulmonary infections caused by penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP; n = 1), PRSP (n = 1) and K. pneumoniae (n = 2). RESULTS: In the mouse systemic infection model, chinfloxacin demonstrated potent activity against MSSA [50% effective dose (ED(50)) 2.28-4.15 mg/kg], MRSA (ED(50) 14.75 mg/kg), PISP (ED(50) 6.20 mg/kg), PRSP (ED(50) 3.51-5.03 mg/kg), VSE (ED(50) 25.02 mg/kg), VRE (ED(50) 5.18-15.39 mg/kg), E. coli (ED(50) 1.25-1.90 mg/kg) and K. pneumoniae (ED(50) 2.92-8.28 mg/kg). The therapeutic efficacy of chinfloxacin was generally similar to (P > 0.05) that of moxifloxacin, significantly higher (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05) than that of levofloxacin in Gram-positive isolate infections (MSSA, MRSA, PISP, PRSP, VSE and VRE), and less than that of levofloxacin against E. coli and K. pneumoniae infections (P < 0.01). In the mouse pulmonary infection model, chinfloxacin showed potent activity towards S. pneumoniae (higher than levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) and K. pneumoniae (lower than levofloxacin and similar to or higher than ciprofloxacin) infections. CONCLUSIONS: The results validated the potent efficacy of chinfloxacin in vivo. The high efficacy of chinfloxacin in murine systemic and local infections warrants investigation of its clinical use.
TI  - Colicin M hydrolyses branched lipids II from Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Lipids II found in some Gram-positive bacteria were prepared in radioactive form  from l-lysine-containing UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide. The specific lateral chains of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus (di-L-alanine, D-isoasparagine, and pentaglycine, respectively) were introduced by chemical peptide synthesis using the Fmoc chemistry. The branched nucleotides obtained were converted into the corresponding lipids II by enzymatic synthesis using the MraY and MurG enzymes. All of the lipids were hydrolysed by Escherichia coli colicin M at approximately the same rate as the meso-diaminopimelate-containing lipid II found in Gram-negative bacteria, thereby opening the way to the use of this enzyme as a broad spectrum antibacterial agent.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Carpolobia lutea extracts and fractions.
AB  - Carpolobia lutea (G. Don) (Polygalaceae) is a tropical medicinal plant putative in traditional medicines against gonorrhea, gingivitis, infertility, antiulcer and malaria. The present study evaluated the antimicrobial, antifungal and antihelicobacter effects of extracts C. lutea leaf, stem and root. The extracts were examined using the disc-diffusion and Microplates of 96 wells containing Muller-Hinton methods against some bacterial strains: Eschericia coli (ATCC 25922), E. coli (ATCC10418), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Staphyllococus aureus (ATCC 6571), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) and Bacillus subtilis (NCTC 8853) and four clinical isolates: one fungi (Candida albican) and three bacteria (Salmonella, Sheigella and staphylococcus aureus). The Gram-positive bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 19659) and the Gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Candida albicans (ATCC 18804) and Helicobacter pylori (ATCC 43504). Some of these extracts were found to be active against some tested strains but activity against H. pylori was >1000mg/ml and good fungistatic activity against C. albican. The MIC against C. albican is in the order n-HF > CHF > ETF= EAF.The order of potency of fraction was the ethanol root > n-HF leaf > ethanol fraction stem > chloroform fraction leaf = ethyl acetate fraction leaf. Polyphenols were demonstrated in ethanol fraction, ethyl acetate fraction, crude ethyl acetate extract and ethanol extract, respectively. These polyphenols isolated may partly explain and support the use of C. lutea for the treatment of infectious diseases in traditional Ibibio medicine of Nigeria.
TI  - Endocarditis in a large district general hospital: A study of the microbiological spectrum between 2000 and 2011.
AB  - Infective endocarditis is one of three common cardiac infections in the United Kingdom, in addition to myocarditis and pericarditis, with a reported incidence of 1.7 to 6.2 cases per 100,000 patient years. Infective endocarditis can often have serious consequences and a wide variety of organisms may be the causative pathogen. There are little published data regarding the exact spectrum of organisms that cause endocarditis in the United Kingdom and whether organisms such as streptococci still dominate. In the present study, all cases of endocarditis at the authors' institution, representing a typical nontertiary centre, were retrospectively examined and audited to provide a snapshot of the organism spectrum in these patients. The cases of more than 120 patients who were coded as having endocarditis by the institution's clinical coding department during the period between December 2000 and January 2011 were examined. Microbiological tests and clinical case notes of all patients were reviewed. Of the 101 patients diagnosed with and treated for endocarditis, 64 were male, with a mean age of 60.57 years. The most common organisms identified were Streptococcus species (31%), Staphylococcus aureus (27%) and Enterococcus faecalis (21%). The organisms with the highest associated mortality rate were S aureus and the 'other organism' group, which included non-HACEK group (Haemophilus species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens and Kingella species) pathogens such as Candida albicans. Streptococcus species and S aureus remain the main cause of endocarditis in a typical hospital setting in the United Kingdom, although in a smaller proportion of cases than historical data suggests. Overall, mortality remains high, and the clinician should remain vigilant to endocarditis in any patient with a positive blood culture because the number of cases of endocarditis caused by less typical organisms are increasing.
TI  - An evaluation of the processing conditions, structure, and properties (biaxial flexural strength and antibacterial efficacy) of sintered strontium-zinc-silicate glass ceramics.
AB  - The use of artificial bone grafts has increased in order to satisfy a growing demand for bone replacement materials. Initial mechanical stability of synthetic bone grafts is very advantageous for certain clinical applications. Coupled with the advantage of mechanical strength, a material with inherent antibacterial properties would be very beneficial. A series of strontium-doped zinc silicate (Ca-Sr-Na-Zn-Si) glass ceramics have been characterized in terms of their crystalline structure, biaxial flexural strength and antibacterial efficacy based on the identification of optimum sintering conditions. All three glass ceramics, namely, BT110, BT111, and BT112 were found to be fully crystalline, with BT111 and BT112 comprising of biocompatible crystalline phases. The biaxial flexural strengths of the three glass ceramics ranged from 70 to 149 MPa and were shown to be superior to those of clinically established ceramics in dry conditions and following incubation in simulated physiological conditions. The bacteriostatic effect for each glass ceramic was also established, where BT112 showed an inhibitory effect against three of the most common bacteria found at implantation sites, namely, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The results of the evaluation suggest that the materials studied offer advantages over current clinical materials and indicate the potential suitability of the glass ceramics as therapeutic bone grafts.
TI  - Evaluation of residual antimicrobial effects and surface changes of gutta-percha  disinfected with different solutions.
AB  - AIM: To determine the possible residual antibacterial effects and possible surface changes caused by 5.25% NaOCl, 2.5% NaOCl, 2% CHX and 0.05% Octenisept on in vitro gutta-percha points after different disinfection protocols. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 121 standard # 40, 0.2% gutta-percha cones were cut 10 mm from the tip, sterilized with ethylene oxide. The samples were divided into five groups, and each group was divided into three subgroups according to immersion periods of gutta-percha cones into solutions. One gutta-percha cone from each group was selected for SEM evaluation. RESULTS: All of the tested solutions were effective on the selected microorganisms when compared with the control solution. No surface alterations were detected on the gutta-percha cones. CONCLUSION: In the limits of this study, immersion of gutta-percha into 2% CHX for one minute was found the most effective method to eliminate the selected microorganisms. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Although gutta-percha points are aseptic in their package, once opened and used, gutta-percha cones may be contaminated. In order to eliminate bacteria and not to cause surface changes on gutta-percha cones, disinfection solution must be selected carefully.
TI  - Influence of NaCl and NaNO3 on sinigrin hydrolysis by foodborne bacteria.
AB  - The glucosinolate sinigrin (SNG) is converted by endogenous plant myrosinase or by bacterial myrosinase-like activity to form the potent antimicrobial allyl isothiocyanate. In order to use SNG as a natural antimicrobial precursor in food, it became important to better understand the ability of bacteria to synthesize the enzyme(s) and understand factors influencing this synthesis at a constant SNG concentration. Eight spoilage, pathogenic, or starter culture bacteria were grown separately in medium containing individual or combined salts with SNG. SNG degradation by the bacteria and the formation of its major degradation product, allyl isothiocyanate, were followed for 12 days at 30 or 35 degrees C. The bacterial strains varied in their ability to metabolize SNG, and this was enhanced by NaCl and/or NaNO(3). SNG hydrolysis took place after 4 days, and the greatest amount occurred by day 12. At 12 days, Escherichia coli O157:H7 showed the greatest capacity to hydrolyze SNG (45.3% degradation), followed by Staphylococcus carnosus (44.57%), while Pseudomonas fluorescens was not active against SNG. The ability of tested strains to metabolize SNG, in decreasing order, was as follows: Escherichia coli O157:H7 > Staphylococcus carnosus > Staphylococcus aureus > Pediococcus pentosaceus > Salmonella Typhimurium > Listeria monocytogenes > Enterococcus faecalis > Pseudomonas fluorescens.
TI  - Anti-bacterial studies on Hemigraphis colorata (Blume) H.G. Hallier and Elephantopus scaber L.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the ethanol, aqueous, chloroform, benzene, acetone and petroleum ether extracts of, Hemigraphis colorata (H. colorata) leaves and stem and Elephantopus scaber (E. scaber) leaves, root and flower for the presence of phyto-constituents and screened the anti-bacterial activity against the selected pathogens. METHODS: The fresh materials were shade dried and powdered using the tissue blender. The dried and powered materials (50 g) were extracted successively with 200 mL of aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether by using Soxhlet extractor for 8 h at a temperature not exceeding the boiling point of the solvent. Aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts were prepared from powdered materials were used for preliminary phytochemical and antimicrobial studies using standard methods. RESULTS: The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root and H. colorata leaves and stem demonstrated that out of (5x6x12 = 360) tests for the presence or absence of the above compounds, 188 tests gave positive results and the remaining 172 gave negative results. The results of the phytochemical screening revealed that phenol (12/12), carbohydrates (9/12), steroids (8/12), saponins and coumarins (7/12), tannins (6/12), proteins (5/12), carboxylic acid and flavonoids (4/12), xanthoproteins (3/12) and alkaloids (2/12) presence in the crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts of H. colorata leaves and stem. The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root displayed the presence of phenol (18/18), tannin (17/18), carbohydrates (16/18), steroids (14/18), carboxylic acid and coumarins (12/18), saponins (10/18), xanthoprotein (9/18), flavonoids (7/18), protein (4/18) and alkaloids (2/18). The root ethanolic extracts of E. scaber illustrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (24 mm), Escherichia coli (E. coli) (16 mm) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) (13 mm). The chlorofrom extracts of E. scaber showed the highest zone of inhibition against Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) (12 mm), The leaves ethanolic extracts of E. scaber demonstrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) (18 mm), Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) (17 mm), Salmonella Typhi (S. typhi) (14 mm) and Enterobacter sp. (11 mm) While the benzene extracts of H. colorata demonstrated maximum zone of inhibition against the pathogen Acinetobacter sp. (14 mm) and S. aureus (12 mm). CONCLUSIONS: It is hoped that this study would direct to the establishment of some compounds that could be used to invent new and more potent antimicrobial drugs of natural origin.
TI  - Chemical constituents of the methanolic extract of leaves of Leiothrix spiralis Ruhland and their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Chemical fractionation of the methanolic extract of leaves of Leiothrix spiralis  Ruhland afforded the flavonoids luteolin-6-C-beta-D-glucopyranoside (1), 7-methoxyluteolin-6-C-beta-D-glucopyranoside (2), 7-methoxyluteolin-8-C-beta-D-glucopyranoside (3), 4'-methoxyluteolin-6-C-beta-D-glucopyranoside (4), and 6-hydroxy-7-methoxyluteolin (5), and the xanthones 8-carboxymethyl-1,5,6-trihydroxy-3-methoxyxanthone (6), 8-carboxy-methyl-1,3,5,6-tetrahydroxyxanthone (7). Methanolic extract, fractions, and isolated compounds of the leaves of L. spiralis were assayed against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella setubal and Helicobacter pylori) and fungi (the yeasts Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, C. krusei and C. parapsilosis). We observed the best minimum inhibitory concentration values for the methanolic extract against Candida parapsilosis, for the fraction 5 + 6 against Gram-negative bacteria E. coli and P. aeruginosa, and compound 7 against all tested Candida strains. The methanolic extract contents suggest that this species may be a promising source of compounds to produce natural phytomedicines.
TI  - In vitro activity and in vivo efficacy of tigecycline alone and in combination with daptomycin and rifampin against Gram-positive cocci isolated from surgical wound infection.
AB  - The aim of this work was to determine the in vitro activity of tigecycline and its bactericidal effect for a large number of Gram-positive cocci, as well as to investigate its in vitro interaction with six clinically used antibiotics. In vivo, a wound model was established through the panniculus carnosus of BALB/c mice, and then inoculated with 5 x 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU) of Staphylococcus aureus or Enterococcus faecalis. For each bacterial strain, the study included an infected or non-infected group that did not receive any treatment, three groups singly treated with tigecycline, rifampin, and daptomycin, and two groups that received tigecycline treatment plus rifampin or daptomycin. In the in vitro studies, tigecycline, daptomycin, and teicoplanin were active against all of the 48 Gram-positive isolates. The combination of tigecycline with rifampicin and daptomycin was synergistic against S. aureus and Enterococcus spp. In the in vivo studies, all groups treated with single drugs showed statistically significant results compared to the control group. The two groups treated with a combination of drugs showed the highest antimicrobial efficacy. In conclusion, our results suggested a strong activity of tigecycline alone and in combination with other antimicrobial agents against multi-resistant Gram-positive organisms isolated from wound infections.
TI  - Pharmacological, genotoxic and phytochemical properties of selected South African medicinal plants used in treating stomach-related ailments.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The evaluated medicinal plants are used in South  African traditional medicine in treating stomach-related ailments. AIMS OF THE STUDY: The study aimed at evaluating the pharmacological, genotoxic and phytochemical properties of the seven selected medicinal plants used for treating stomach-related ailments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethyl acetate (EtOAc), ethanol (EtOH) 70% and water extracts of the selected plant parts were evaluated for their antimicrobial and anthelmintic activities using microdilution assays. Gram-positive bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus), Gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia coli) and Candida albicans were used for antimicrobial assays. Caenorhabditis elegans was used for the anthelmintic assay. Plant extracts were also assayed for their cyclooxygenase-inhibitory activity against cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 enzymes. The Ames test was used to evaluate the genotoxicity of the plant extracts. A spectrophotometric method was used to determine the total phenolics, gallotannins, flavonoids and saponins. RESULTS: Twelve extracts exhibited minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) <1 mg/mL against the bacterial test strains, and five extracts exhibited MIC <1 mg/mL against Candida albicans. The EtOAc extract of Tetradenia riparia had the best minimum lethal concentration (MLC) value (0.004 mg/mL) against Caenorhabditis elegans. All the EtOAc extracts exhibited percentage inhibition in the range of 50.7-94.7% against COX-1 and -2 enzymes at 250 mug/mL. All the plant extracts were non-mutagenic towards Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98, TA100 and TA1537 without metabolic activation. Phytochemical analysis revealed relatively high amounts of total phenolics, gallotannins and flavonoids in the evaluated plant extracts. CONCLUSIONS: The general pharmacological activities exhibited by some of the plant extracts in this study support the traditional uses of the selected plants in treating stomach-related ailments. The Ames test showed that all the plant extracts were non-mutagenic but cytotoxicity tests are needed to ascertain the safety for long-term consumption.
TI  - [Antibiotic resistance dynamics and isolation rate of staphylococci and enterococci from patients of reconstructive surgery units].
AB  - The dynamics of isolation of staphylococci and enterococci from clinical material of patients and their antibiotic susceptibility within a 5-year period (2005-2009) was analysed. 5990 isolates were tested: 1250 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 3268 isolates of S. epidermidis, 1005 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis and 467 isolates of E. faecium. Grampositive infections were shown to be prevailing within the last 2-3 years, the nosocomial epidermal staphylococci more and more replacing S. aureus (the ratio of S. epidermidis and S. aureus in 2009 was 3.3). The isolation rate of E. faecalis significantly increased (by 3.5 times) and the ratio of E. faecalis and E. faecium in 2009 was 4.3. The microflora composition with respect to the isolation source was analysed and its clinical significance was estimated. The study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that oxacillin had its own specific niche, while antibiotics active against resistant grampositive cocci, such as rifampicin, fusidic acid, fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin), cefoxitin, as well as amoxicillin/clavulane in infections due to E. faecalis, might be considered as the drugs of choice. In the treatment of nosocomial infections, when the etiological role of MRSA or VRE is suspected or confirmed, the complex therapy should obligatory include the most active antibiotics (vancomycin or linezolid among them).
TI  - Platelet and neutrophil responses to Gram positive pathogens in patients with bacteremic infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many Gram-positive pathogens aggregate and activate platelets in vitro and this has been proposed to contribute to virulence. Platelets can also form complexes with neutrophils but little is however known about platelet and platelet-neutrophil responses in bacterial infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We added isolates of Gram-positive bacteria from 38 patients with a bacteremic infection to blood drawn from the same patient. Aggregometry and flow cytometry were used to assess platelet aggregation and to quantify activation of platelets, neutrophils, and platelet-neutrophils complexes (PNCs) induced by the bacteria. Fifteen healthy persons served as controls. Most isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, beta hemolytic streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis induced aggregation of platelets from their respective hosts, whereas pneumococci failed to do so. S. aureus isolates induced platelet aggregation more rapidly in patients than in controls, whereas platelet activation by S. aureus was lower in patients than in controls. PNCs were more abundant in baseline samples from patients than in healthy controls and most bacterial isolates induced additional PNC formation and neutrophil activation. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: We have demonstrated for the first time that bacteria isolated from patients with Gram-positive bacteremia can induce platelet activation and aggregation, PNC formation, and neutrophil activation in the same infected host. This underlines the significance of these interactions during infection, which could be a target for future therapies in sepsis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of some African medicinal plants used traditionally against infectious diseases.
AB  - CONTEXT: Plants are known to play a crucial role in African traditional medicine  for the treatment of infection diseases. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the claimed antimicrobial properties of plants traditionally used in African countries, providing scientific validation for their use. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-three polar and non-polar extracts from 22 medicinal plants were screened for their antibacterial activity against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and Mycobacterium smegmatis using the broth microdilution method. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In vitro antibacterial activity against one or more tested bacteria was shown by 83% of the extracts. The highest activity was obtained with the methanol extracts of the aerial parts of Acacia karroo Hayne (Fabaceae) and Anacardium occidentale L. (Anacardiaceae) and the roots of Bridelia cathartica G. Bertol (Euphorbiaceae), against S. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 7.5 microg/mL). The same MIC values were exhibited against E. faecalis by the methanol extract of A. occidentale, the dichloromethane and methanol extracts of B. cathartica and the ethyl acetate extract of Momordica balsamina l. (Curcubitaceae) leaves. Gram-negative bacteria were less sensitive; the growth of P. aeruginosa was significantly inhibited (MIC = 31 microg/mL) by the n-hexane and methanol extracts of Gomphocarpus fruticosus (l.) Ait. (Asclepiadaceae) fruits and by the dichloromethane extract of Trichilia emetica Vahl (Meliaceae) seeds. Most of the active extracts were rich in fenols/flavonoids. CONCLUSION: This study supports the use of most of the studied plants in traditional medicine, for the treatment of infectious diseases. Some of them are worthy of further investigation.
TI  - Vancomycin tolerance in Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Vancomycin, a glycopeptide antimicrobial agent, represents the last line of defence against a wide range of multi-resistant Gram-positive pathogens such as enterococci, staphylococci and streptococci. However, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and staphylococci, along with vancomycin-tolerant clinical isolates, are compromising the therapeutic efficacy of vancomycin. It is conceivable that tolerance may emerge during prolonged vancomycin use. It has not been until recently, however, that the molecular basis of this tolerance began to be understood. Superoxide anions might be involved in the bactericidal activity of vancomycin in enterococci, and recent evidence suggests that the stringent response is partly responsible for vancomycin tolerance in Enterococcus faecalis. The mechanism of vancomycin tolerance in Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae is sometimes associated with a reduction of autolysin activity. Vancomycin tolerance in S. aureus and S. pneumoniae also appears to be somehow related with the two-component regulatory systems linked to cell envelope stress, although the precise molecular regulatory pathways remain poorly defined.
TI  - In vitro activity effects of twelve antibiotics alone and in association against  twenty-seven Enterococcus faecalis strains isolated from Italian patients with infective endocarditis: high in vitro synergistic effect of the association ceftriaxone-fosfomycin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2004-2008, the epidemiological and clinical Infective Endocarditis Study Group (SEI) evaluated 852 cases of infective endocarditis. Staphylococcus aureus was the main involved pathogen (24.5%) and Enterococcus faecalis etiology was described in 11% of the cases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of 12 antibiotics alone and in association against 27 strains of E. faecalis isolated from blood cultures of patients with infective endocarditis. RESULTS: The results showed high in vitro activity of tigecycline, daptomycin and linezolid. A high synergistic effect was obtained with the association ceftriaxone-fosfomycin [fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC)(50) = 0.34, FIC(90) = 0.78]. Furthermore, ceftriaxone plus ampicillin presented additive results (FIC(50) = 0.66, FIC(90) = 1.00), and ceftriaxone plus fosfomycin and ceftriaxone plus ampicillin were significantly more active in vitro than each drug alone. The efficacy of ceftriaxone plus fosfomycin was confirmed by the association testing using the broth dilution technique. CONCLUSION: Fosfomycin seems particularly significant and its association with ceftriaxone could be considered as a useful therapeutic option in medical treatment of E. faecalis infective endocarditis.
TI  - Evaluation of wound healing and antimicrobial potentials of Ixora coccinea root extract.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the wound healing and antimicrobial activity of root extracts of Ixora coccinea (I. coccinea). METHODS: To investigate the wound healing efficacy of root extract of I. coccinea Linn, five groups of animals were divided each containing six animals. Two wound models including incision and excision wound models were used in this study. The parameters studied were tensile strength on incision wound model and in terms of wound contraction for excision wound model were compared with standard Nitrofurazone (NFZ) ointment (0.2% w/w). Six extracts (ethanol, aqueous, petroleum ether, benzene, chloroform and ethyl acetate) of I. coccinea were screened for in vitro growth inhibiting activity against different bacterial strains viz, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus pumilius, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and fungi Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger were compared with the standard drugs ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol for antibacterial and griseofulvin for antifungal screening. The serial dilution and cup (or) well plate methods were used for the antimicrobial study and MIC was determined. RESULTS: The ethanolic extract showed significant (P<0.001) wound healing activity when compared to standard drug NFZ with respect to normal control group. Amongst all, ethanolic extract showed highly significant antibacterial activity against all bacterial strains used in this study when compared to standard. The aqueous extract showed moderate significant inhibition against all bacterial strains when compared to standard. All the extracts were shown negligible activity against the fungal strains used in this study. CONCLUSIONS: The ethanolic root extract of I. coccinea showed pronounced wound healing and antibacterial activity. The probable reason to heal the wound was that the external application of the extract prevented the microbes to invade through the wound thus the protection of wound occurs against the infection of the various organisms.
TI  - Activity of tigecycline and comparators against skin and skin structure pathogens: global results of the Tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial, 2004-2009.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This analysis from the global Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) reports on 24 784 isolates collected from integumentary culture sources between 2004 and 2009. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and susceptibility were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines (US Food and Drug Administration breakpoints applied against tigecycline). RESULTS: All methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid, and vancomycin. MIC(90)s for tigecycline against Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium ranged between 0.12 mg/l and 0.25mg/l. Resistance to the carbapenems and tigecycline was low among the Enterobacteriaceae, with resistance at </= 2.0% between 2004 and 2009 for tigecycline against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp, and Serratia marcescens, for imipenem against E. coli and Enterobacter spp, and for meropenem against E. coli, Enterobacter spp, and S. marcescens. Against the Acinetobacter baumannii collected in 2009, resistance to amikacin, ceftazidime, levofloxacin, meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam was >30%; between 2004 and 2009 resistance to minocycline varied between 1.4% and 4.8%, and tigecycline MIC(90)s were </= 2mg/l. Against the Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected, MIC(90)s were greater than the susceptibility breakpoint for cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, levofloxacin, and meropenem. CONCLUSIONS: The problem of antimicrobial resistance is demonstrated by the data presented. T.E.S.T. continues to provide valuable information on antimicrobial resistance globally.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of six endodontic sealers.
AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to perform an in vitro evaluation of the antibacterial properties of 6 endodontic sealers (Endomethasone C, Argoseal, Bioseal Normal, Acroseal, AH Plus, Sicura Seal). METHODS: The agar diffusion test (well and paper disc methods) with Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans was used. For the well method, Petri dishes were inoculated with bacterial suspensions. Each well was completely filled with freshly mixed endodontic sealer. For the paper disc method, sterile paper discs were immersed in freshly mixed sealers and put on agar plates. Diameters of halos formed around the sealers were measured after 24 h and 48 h. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The effects of well method and of paper disc method were analyzed by 1-way ANOVA. RESULTS: Endomethasone C, Argoseal and Bioseal showed the largest inhibition halos for all the tested microorganisms, while Sicura Seal and AH Plus showed low antibacterial effects. Moreover, the comparison of well method and paper disc methods showed significant statistical differences (P<0,01) for all sealers and indicated a dose-dependent antimicrobial effect.
TI  - Extracellular DNA in biofilms.
AB  - Extracellular DNA (eDNA) is an important biofilm component that was recently discovered. Its presence has been initially observed in biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, then Enterococcus faecalis and staphylococci. Autolysis is the common mechanism by which eDNA is released. In P. aeruginosa eDNA is generated by lysis of a bacterial subpopulation, under control of quorum sensing system. In E. faecalis autolysis proceeds in a fratricide mode, resulting from a process similar to necrosis of eukaryotic cells. In Staphylococcus aureus autolysis originates by an altruistic suicide, i.e., a programmed cell death similar to apoptosis of eukaryotic cells. In S. aureus autolysis is mediated by murein hydrolase, while in S. epidermidis by the autolysin protein AtlE. In P. aeruginosa eDNA is located primarily in the stalks of mushroom-shaped multicellular structures. In S. aureus the crucial role of eDNA in stabilizing biofilm is highlighted by the disgregating effect of DNase I. eDNA represents an important mechanism for horizontal gene transfer in bacteria. eDNA and other microbial structural motifs are recognized by the innate immune system via the TLR family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs).
TI  - Role of antibiofilm-antimicrobial agents in controlling device-related infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on organism viability in planktonic and biofilm phases, biofilm thickness, and extracellular polysaccharide content. METHODS: We performed time-kill curves and broth macrodilution assays of bacterial and fungal clinical isolates with varying concentrations of NAC. We also created in vitro bacterial biofilms, incubated them with NAC or control, and then stained with propidium iodide and FITC-labeled concanavalin A. We measured biofilm thickness, number of non-viable cells, and fluorescent intensity as a marker of extracellular matrix via a confocal laser scanning microscope. All experiments were conducted in triplicate. Tested organisms included methicillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, MRSA), S. epidermidis, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans and C. krusei. RESULTS: NAC 80 mg/ml was uniformly bactericidal (>99.9% reduction) against all tested bacteria with no recoverable organisms after 30 minutes of incubation, but was fungistatic against candida species. Minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of NAC ranged from 5-10 mg/ml. Biofilm thickness was significantly decreased in NAC-treated biofilms for all organisms except VRE. The number of non-viable cells in NAC-treated Gram-positive biofilms was increased (p<0.05 for MRSA and VRE). NAC-treated Gram-negative biofilms had scant cellularity and lacked complex 3-dimensional structures that were characteristic of controls. Fluorescent intensity was similar in the experimental and control arms. CONCLUSIONS: NAC is bactericidal against clinically relevant and drug-resistant bacteria and also leads to biofilm disruption. NAC has the potential for use as a novel agent for prevention or treatment of biofilm-related infections.
TI  - Mechanistic analysis of muraymycin analogues: a guide to the design of MraY inhibitors.
AB  - The systematic structure-activity relationship (SAR) of the muraymycins (MRYs) using an Ugi four-component reaction (U4CR) was investigated. The impact of the lipophilic substituent on antibacterial activity was significant, and the analogues 8 and 9 having a lipophilic side chain exhibited good activity against a range of Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including MRSA and VRE. Further investigation of compounds 8 and 9 revealed these analogues to be selective inhibitors of the MraY transferase and nontoxic to HepG2 cells. The SAR of the accessory urea-peptide moiety indicated that it could be simplified. Our SAR study of the MRYs suggests a probable mechanism for inhibition of the MraY, where the inner moiety of the urea-dipeptide motif interacts with the carbohydrate recognition domain in the cytoplasmic loop 5. The predicted binding model would provide further direction toward the design of potent MraY inhibitors. This study has set the stage for the generation of novel antibacterial "lead" compounds based on MRYs.
TI  - Development of an antibiogram in a long-term care facility.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To create an antibiogram-a profile of an organism's susceptibility/resistance to a panel of antibiotics- for a long-term care facility to assess the prevalence of resistance of bacteria present at the facility. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of culture and sensitivity data from July 1, 2009, through June 30, 2010. SETTING: A long-term care facility in Huntsville, Alabama. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Residents of the long-term care facility that had one or more culture and sensitivity test performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Susceptibility of bacteria to each antimicrobial tested. RESULTS: Results were compiled and reported according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute Analysis and Presentation of Cumulative Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Data. The most commonly seen bacteria in our long-term care facility were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis. Resistance rates for these bacteria were high and included the presence of methicillinresistant S. aureus and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. CONCLUSION: Resistance rates were high among all organisms reported. This poses a serious threat to the health care team's ability to effectively treat residents of this facility. Development of an antibiogram to assist physicians in antimicrobial selection will be beneficial in helping evaluate trends in drug resistance to current available treatments. Implementing clinical pathways for empiric treatment of infections could improve the ability to provide consistent treatment for all residents in the facility.
TI  - Telavancin activity tested against a contemporary collection of Gram-positive pathogens from USA Hospitals (2007-2009).
AB  - This study updates the activity of telavancin against Gram-positive pathogens collected from USA hospitals (2007-2009). Telavancin (MIC(50/90), 0.12/0.25 mug/mL) was active against coagulase-negative staphylococci and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (100% susceptible), for which only daptomycin (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mug/mL; 99% susceptible) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (MIC(50/90), </= 0.25-0.5/0.5 mug/mL; 99% susceptible) exhibited similar activity. Telavancin (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mug/mL) inhibited 96.5% of Enterococcus faecalis at the Food and Drug Administration breakpoint (MIC, </= 1 mug/mL), where ampicillin (99.9% susceptible), daptomycin (99.9% susceptible), and linezolid (100% susceptible) also demonstrated high-level coverage. Telavancin inhibited, respectively, 100.0% and 91.7% of VanB-phenotype E. faecalis and E. faecium at </= 1 mug/mL, whereas it was less active against VanA strains. Telavancin was uniformly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae and resistant subsets, and demonstrated good potency (MIC(90), 0.06-0.12 mug/mL) against other streptococci, regardless of resistance to other drugs. This assessment reveals potent activity of telavancin against Gram-positive isolates collected from USA hospitals with no evidence of emergence of resistance.
TI  - Susceptibility to tigecycline and linezolid among gram-positive isolates collected in the United States as part of the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (TEST) between 2004 and 2009.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) was initiated in 2004 to chart the activity of tigecycline and comparator antimicrobial agents against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms globally. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to provide an analysis of the antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive organisms collected from the 9 census regions of the United States between 2004 and 2009. METHODS: The MICs and antimicrobial susceptibility were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute methodology. For tigecycline, US Food and Drug Administration susceptibility criteria were used. RESULTS: A total of 8782 Staphylococcus aureus isolates (54.5% methicillin-resistant S aureus) were collected, with the highest percentage of MRSA isolates collected from the South Central region (67.9%). All S aureus isolates were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid, and vancomycin. Overall, 4.6% of Enterococcus faecalis (n = 3753) and 69.1% of Enterococcus faecium (n = 1417) isolates were vancomycin resistant, with the highest rates in the East North Central region for E faecalis (7.1%) and the South Atlantic region for E faecium (79.5%). Small numbers of linezolid nonsusceptible E faecalis (n = 13) were identified. MIC(90) values for tigecycline were </=0.25 mg/L against E faecalis and 0.12 mg/L against E faecium. Of the Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates collected (n = 4541), 1.1% were penicillin resistant. All S pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to linezolid and vancomycin; susceptibility to tigecycline varied between 80.9% (Pacific region) and 95.2% (West North Central region). CONCLUSIONS: The rates of MRSA and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp varied among the 9 census regions; however, susceptibility to linezolid, vancomycin, and tigecycline remained consistent, with low MIC(90) values and high rates of antimicrobial susceptibility.
TI  - DNA, protein binding, cytotoxicity, cellular uptake and antibacterial activities  of new palladium(II) complexes of thiosemicarbazone ligands: effects of substitution on biological activity.
AB  - The coordination propensities of 4(N,N')-diethylaminosalicylaldehyde-4(N)-substituted thiosemicarbazones (H(2)L(1-4)) were investigated by reacting with an equimolar amount of [PdCl(2)(PPh(3))(2)]. The new complexes were characterized by various spectroscopic techniques. The structure determination of the complexes [Pd(DeaSal-tsc)(PPh(3))] (1), [Pd(DeaSal-mtsc)(PPh(3))] (2) and [Pd(DeaSal-etsc)(PPh(3))] (3) by X-ray crystallography showed that ligands are coordinated in a dibasic tridentate ONS donor fashion forming stable five and six membered chelate rings. The binding ability of complexes (1-4) to calf-thymus DNA (CT DNA) has been explored by absorption and emission titration methods. Based on the observations, an electrostatic and an intercalative binding mode have been proposed. The protein binding studies have been monitored by quenching of tryptophan and tyrosine residues in the presence of complexes using lysozyme as a model protein. As determined by MTT assays, complex 3 exhibited a higher cytotoxic effect towards human lung cancer cell line (A549) and liver cancer cells (HepG2). LDH, NO assay and cellular uptake of the complexes have been studied. Further, antibacterial activity studies of the complexes have been screened against the pathogenic bacteria such as Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MIC50 values of the complexes showed that the complexes exhibited significant activity against the pathogens and among the complexes, 3 exhibited higher activity.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of different endodontic irrigants.
AB  - AIM: The objective of this study was to compare in vitro the antibacterial activity of Tetraclean (mixture of doxycycline, citric acid and polypropylene glycol), Niclor 5 (5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution), Cloreximid (0.2% chlorhexidine and 0.2% cetrimide solution) and hydrogen peroxide 12 volumes on three endodontic pathogens associated with primary endodontic infections. Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans and Staphylococcus aureus strains were selected to evaluate the antibacterial activity of endodontic irrigants by the agar disc-diffusion test. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Paper discs were saturated with each one of the test solutions (at room temperature and preheating at 50 degrees C) and placed onto culture agar-plates preadsorbed with bacterial cells and further incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees C. The growth inhibition zones around each irrigant were recorded and compared for each bacterial strain. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests were applied to compare the various groups. RESULTS: At room temperature, Tetraclean showed significantly higher inhibition of bacteria growth than all other irrigants tested. Preheating at 50 degrees C significantly increased growth inhibition for all the groups tested. At 50 degrees C, hydrogen peroxide 12 volumes and Tetraclean showed significantly higher efficacy than all other irrigants tested. CONCLUSIONS: 50 degrees C-preheated hydrogen peroxide 12 volumes and Tetraclean showed highest inhibition of the bacterial growth.
TI  - Do dental impression materials play a role in cross contamination?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dentists are required to institute infectious control procedures. Dental impression materials possessing antimicrobial properties may aid in reducing the risk of cross contamination since impression materials might play a role as carriers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of four impression materials. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Four impression materials--Orthoprint, Impregum Penta, Aquasil Ultra Monophase, and Permlastic--were evaluated by the direct contact test. The materials were tested in contact with Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Candida albicans. The materials were mixed; allowed to set; and examined immediately and after aging for 24, 48, and 72 hours and 1 week. Two-way ANOVA, one-way ANOVA, and Tukey multiple comparison procedures were applied to the results. RESULTS: Impregum Penta presented the broadest antibacterial spectrum of all the materials tested. There was a complete growth inhibition of S aureus and S epidermidis, and it sustained this ability for at least 7 days. It also showed an antifungal effect by partially inhibiting the growth of C albicans, a quality that was seen only immediately after setting. Aquasil Ultra showed an antifungal effect only immediately after setting. Permlastic showed a complete growth inhibition when in contact with C albicans and sustained this ability for at least 7 days. No significant antimicrobial properties were recorded for Orthoprint. When in contact with E faecalis, no significant antibacterial properties were recorded for any of the materials. CONCLUSION: None of the tested materials exhibited a long-lasting or complete antibacterial and antifungal property. Therefore, disinfection of impressions is essential.
TI  - WFDC2 is differentially expressed in the mammary gland of the tammar wallaby and  provides immune protection to the mammary gland and the developing pouch young.
AB  - WAP four disulfide core domain 2 (WFDC2) is a four disulfide core (4-DSC) protein secreted in the milk of the tammar wallaby. It is comprised of two 4-DSC domains assigned domain III at the NH2-terminal end and domain II at the COOH-terminal end. The WFDC2 gene was expressed only during pregnancy, early lactation, towards the end of lactation and involution. The WFDC2 protein showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and this activity resided with domain II. There was no antibacterial activity detected against Enterococcus faecalis. The observed expression pattern of tammar WFDC2 and its antibacterial activity suggests a role to either reduce mastitis in the mammary gland caused by S. aureus or to protect the gut of the young at a time when it is not immune-competent. The latter effect could be achieved without disturbing the balance of commensal gut flora such as E. faecalis.
TI  - Scleroderma digital ulcers complicated by infection with fecal pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Digital ulcers represent one of the most frequent complications of systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma); they are very painful, scarcely responsive to treatment, and often responsible for marked limitations on daily activities, including patient self-care. Infectious complications may severely compromise the outcome of skin lesions in a significant percentage of patients. Numerous pathogens of different origin may be involved, including bacteria from patient endogenous flora. Here we evaluated the possible involvement of fecal pathogens in scleroderma digital ulcers. METHODS: Among a series of 82 SSc patients with digital ulcers, we retrospectively analyzed 42 subjects with clinical signs of local bacterial infection. All digital ulcers with suspected infection have been investigated by microbiologic examinations. RESULTS: Bacterial infection was confirmed in all 42 patients investigated; in particular, Staphylococcus aureus were the most frequently found (50%). Interestingly, 11 (26%) of 42 patients showed digital ulcers infected with intestinal bacteria; specifically, 7 patients were positive for Escherichia coli and 4 for Enterococcus faecalis. Diffuse cutaneous SSc patients were more numerous in this subgroup versus the other 31 patients (Fisher's P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: A number of effective measures involving health care personnel and hospital environment are essential in the management of digital ulcers and prevention of infectious complications. In addition, the prevalence of fecal pathogens in one-quarter of cases, never reported previously, suggests an important role of a patient's self-care limitations, mainly during intercurrent home medications. Consequently, methodical education on hand hygiene of both patients and relatives, frequently involved in ulcer medications, is mandatory to avoid such deleterious complications.
TI  - Comparison of cefpodoxime proxetil release and antimicrobial activity from tablet formulations: complexation with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin in the presence of water soluble polymer.
AB  - This study aims to prove the complexation of cefpodoxime proxetil (CP) by hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) in the presence of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (Na CMC), and makes a comparison of commercial tablets by dissolution and antimicrobial activity studies. The CP--HP-beta-CD complex was prepared by kneading method and characterized by SEM, FTIR and DSC. The solubility method was used to investigate the effect of HP-beta-CD and Na CMC on the solubility of CP. The complex tablets were prepared using direct compression method. Dissolution studies were performed with complex tablets and commercial tablets in pH 1.2, 4.5, 6.8 and 7.4 buffer solutions. It was observed that complexation occurred in all formulations, and HP-beta-CD is able to increase CP solubility and dissolution rate of CP was improved from complex tablets, when compared with commercial tablets. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity studies revealed that the CP--HP-beta-CD complex and complex tablets were shown to have more effective antimicrobial activity than commercial tablets. It is evident from the results that complexation with HP-beta-CD in the presence of Na CMC is feasible way to prepare a more efficient tablet formulation with improved dissolution and antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Synthesis, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activity of novel silver(I) tris(pyrazolyl)methanesulfonate and 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphadamantane complexes.
AB  - Five new silver(I) complexes of formulas [Ag(Tpms)] (1), [Ag(Tpms)(PPh(3))] (2),  [Ag(Tpms)(PCy(3))] (3), [Ag(PTA)][BF(4)] (4), and [Ag(Tpms)(PTA)] (5) {Tpms = tris(pyrazol-1-yl)methanesulfonate, PPh(3) = triphenylphosphane, PCy(3) = tricyclohexylphosphane, PTA = 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane} have been synthesized and fully characterized by elemental analyses, (1)H, (13)C, and (31)P NMR, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and IR spectroscopic techniques. The single crystal X-ray diffraction study of 3 shows the Tpms ligand acting in the N(3)-facially coordinating mode, while in 2 and 5 a N(2)O-coordination is found, with the SO(3) group bonded to silver and a pendant free pyrazolyl ring. Features of the tilting in the coordinated pyrazolyl rings in these cases suggest that this inequivalence is related with the cone angles of the phosphanes. A detailed study of antimycobacterial and antiproliferative properties of all compounds has been carried out. They were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard strains Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29922), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 49619), Streptococcus pyogenes (SF37), Streptococcus sanguinis (SK36), Streptococcus mutans (UA159), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), and the fungus Candida albicans (ATCC 24443). Complexes 1-5 have been found to display effective antimicrobial activity against the series of bacteria and fungi, and some of them are potential candidates for antiseptic or disinfectant drugs. Interaction of Ag complexes with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has been studied by fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, using ethidium bromide (EB) as a fluorescence probe of DNA. The decrease in the fluorescence of DNA-EB system on addition of Ag complexes shows that the fluorescence quenching of DNA-EB complex occurs and compound 3 is particularly active. Complexes 1-5 exhibit pronounced antiproliferative activity against human malignant melanoma (A375) with an activity often higher than that of AgNO(3), which has been used as a control, following the same order of activity inhibition on DNA, i.e., 3 > 2 > 1 > 5 > AgNO(3)>> 4.
TI  - Surgical therapy of hip-joint empyema. Is the Girdlestone arthroplasty still up to date?
AB  - PURPOSE: Hip-joint empyema is a severe local infection that can cause general illness and, in the worst-case scenario, death by septic complications. For severe hip-joint infections, the Girdlestone arthroplasty has been an established treatment option for many decades. We describe functional midterm results after treatment of haematological and postoperative hip-joint infections. METHODS: From 2000 to 2010, 24 patients underwent surgical treatment for 27 hip-joint empyemas. The surgical procedures included radical debridement, implantation of local antibiotic beads and soft tissue management. Besides clinical, laboratory and imaging parameters, we analysed the Harris hip score (HHS). RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (26 hips) were followed up after a mean of 30 (3.1-126.8) months. The study group consists of 12 men and 11 women, with an average height of 1.71 m, weight of 84.7 kg and body mass index (BMI) of 28.6 kg/m(2). Hip-joint empyema was due to haematological septic spread in eight patients, surgery related in 12 hips and other causes in six cases. One patient died due to septic complications during the hospital stay. Intraoperative bacterial culture was positive in 50%, with Staphylococcus aureus as the most common organism (n = 11). Average hospital stay was 35 days. HHS significantly improved from 18.2 preoperatively to 47.8 at follow-up. Functional results were mainly poor, but pain relief increased significantly. The infection control rate was 96% with four (15%) complications. CONCLUSION: Resection arthroplasty by Girdlestone is able to control infection in most cases with an acceptable complication rate but poor functional results. In conclusion, the Girdlestone arthroplasty still is an essential surgical strategy for treating hip-joint empyema in cases in which functional outcome is of lesser priority.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of methyl aminolevulinate photodynamic therapy in the treatment of a cutaneous ulcer.
AB  - We describe a 79-year-old female with a chronic venous ulceration infected by Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis and not responsive to conventional treatments. The patient was treated with Methyl-Aminolaevulinate Photodynamic Therapy (MAL-PDT). After four weeks the cutaneous swabs become negative and we observed a significant clinical improvement. Therefore we suppose that MALPDT could represent a valid therapeutic option in the treatment of infected chronic ulcers.
TI  - Comparative study of antimicrobial activity and phytochemical analysis of methanolic and aqueous extracts of the fruit of Emblica officinalis against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate antimicrobial potential of aqueous (infusions, decoctions) and methanlic extracts (1:2 and 1:5 concentrations) of Emblica officinalis (amla) against seven pathogenic bacteria namely Staphylococcs aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus cloacae, Proteus vulgaris and Klebsiella pneumoniae. METHODS: The well diffusion technique was employed. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using micro-broth dilution methods and phytochemical screening was done as per standard procedures. RESULTS: Aqueous infusion extract of amla exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against E. cloacae followed by E. coli. Preliminary phytochemical analysis of E. officinalis aqueous extracts (infusions and decoctions) only showed presence of tannins, saponins, flavanoids, Terpenoids and phenols. MIC of aqueous extract of E. officinalis was most active against K. pneumoniae. Whereas MIC of methanol extract of E. officinalis shows maximum activity against E. coli. CONCLUSION: Emblica officinalis definitely possesses potent antimicrobial activities and this can serve as an important platform for the development of inexpensive, safe and effective medicines
TI  - Predictors of in-hospital mortality in elderly patients with bacteraemia admitted to an Internal Medicine ward.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases are a common cause of increased morbidity and mortality in elderly patients. Bacteraemia in the elderly is a difficult diagnosis and a therapeutic challenge due to age-related vicissitudes and to their comorbidities. The main purpose of the study was to assess independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality among the elderly with bacteraemia admitted to an Internal Medicine Ward. METHODS: Overall, a cohort of 135 patients, 65 years of age and older, with bacteraemia were retrospectively studied. Data related to demographic information, comorbidities, clinical parameters on admission, source and type of infection, microorganism isolated in the blood culture, laboratory data and empirical antibiotic treatment was recorded from each patient. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify independent predictors of all-cause in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of these 135 patients, 45.9% were women. The most common infections in this group of patients were urinary tract infections (46.7%). The main microorganisms isolated in the blood cultures were Escherichia coli (14.9%), Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (12.0%), non-MRSA (11.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.1%) and Enterococcus faecalis (8.0%). The in-hospital mortality was 22.2%. Independent prognostic factors associated with in-hospital mortality were age >/= 85 years, chronic renal disease, bacteraemia of unknown focus and cognitive impairment at admission (OR, 2.812 [95% CI, 1.039-7.611; p = 0.042]; OR, 6.179 [95% CI, 1.840-20.748; p = 0.003]; OR, 8.673 [95% CI, 1.557-48.311; p = 0.014] and OR, 3.621 [95% CI, 1.226-10.695; p = 0.020], respectively). By multivariate analysis appropriate antibiotic therapy was not associated with lower odds of mortality. CONCLUSION: Bacteraemia in the elderly has a high mortality rate. There are no set of signs or clinical features that can predict bacteraemia in the elderly. However, older age (>/= 85 years), chronic renal disease, bacteraemia of unknown focus and severe cognitive impairment adversely affects the outcome of elderly patients with bacteraemia admitted to an Internal Medicine ward.
TI  - Phytochemical constituents and antibacterial efficacy of the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum (DC.) Baker ex Heyne.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the preliminary phytochemistry and antibacterial activity of the flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum . METHODS: Phytochemical analysis was done by using the standard methods given by Harbone. The methanolic flower extract were tested against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marsecens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes by the agar disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Preliminary phytochemical screening of flower extract showed the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, tannins, xanthoproteins, carboxylic acids, coumarins and carbohydrates. The flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum showed significant activity against four gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes) and three gram negative bacteria (Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii and Serratia marsecens), out of 12 pathogenic bacteria studied. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study confirm the presence of significant antibacterial activity against human pathogens in the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum.
TI  - Acanthamoeba polyphaga, a potential environmental vector for the transmission of  food-borne and opportunistic pathogens.
AB  - The endosymbiotic relationship could represent for many bacteria an important condition favouring their spread in the environment and in foods. For this purpose we studied the behaviour of some food-borne and opportunistic pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, Aeromonas hydrophila, Yersinia enterocolitica) when internalized in Acanthamoeba polyphaga. Our results confirm the capability of the bacteria tested to grow within amoebal hosts. We can observe two types of interactions of the bacteria internalized in A. polyphaga. The first type, showed by Y. enterocolitica and A. hydrophila, was characterized by an early replication, probably followed by the killing and digestion of the bacteria. The second type, showed by E. faecalis and S. aureus was characterized by the persistence and grow inside the host without lysis. Lastly, when amoebae were co-cultured with L. monocytogenes and S. Enteritidis, an eclipse phase followed by an active intracellular growth was observed, suggesting a third type of predator-prey trend. The extracellular count in presence of A. polyphaga, as a result of an intracellular multiplication and subsequent release, was characterized by an increase of E. faecalis, S. aureus, L. monocytogenes and S. Enteritidis, and by a low or absent cell count for Y. enterocolitica and A. hydrophila. Our study suggests that the investigated food-borne and opportunistic pathogens are, in most cases, able to interact with A. polyphaga, to intracellularly replicate and, lastly, to be potentially spread in the environment, underlining the possible role of this protozoan in food contamination.
TI  - The revival of fosfomycin.
AB  - Fosfomycin, originally named phosphonomycin, was discovered in Spain in 1969. There are three forms of fosfomycin: fosfomycin tromethamine (a soluble salt) and fosfomycin calcium for oral use, and fosfomycin disodium for intravenous use. Fosfomycin is a bactericidal antibiotic that interferes with cell wall synthesis in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by inhibiting the initial step involving phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase. It has a broad spectrum of activity against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It is highly active against Gram-positive pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus, and against Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Its unique mechanism of action may provide a synergistic effect to other classes of antibiotics including beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. Oral fosfomycin is mainly used in the treatment of urinary tract infections, particularly those caused by Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. Intravenous fosfomycin has been administered in combination with other antibiotics for the treatment of nosocomial infections due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Fosfomycin has good distribution into tissues, achieving clinically relevant concentrations in serum, kidneys, bladder wall, prostate, lungs, inflamed tissues, bone, cerebrospinal fluid, abscess fluid, and heart valves. Fosfomycin is well tolerated, with a low incidence of adverse events. Further randomized controlled trials are needed in order to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous fosfomycin for the management of nosocomial infections due to MDR pathogens.
TI  - [Investigation of the efficacy of some disinfectants against nosocomial Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp. isolates].
AB  - Nosocomial infections which exhibit an increasing trend worldwide, are important  contributors to morbidity and mortality. Most bacteria that cause nosocomial infections can retain their viability even after exposure to disinfectants in routine practice. This study was conducted to determine the susceptibilities of nosocomial Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp. isolates to various disinfectants. A total of 30 S.aureus [16 were methicillin-resistant (MRSA), 14 were methicillin-susceptible (MSSA)] and 21 Enterococcus spp. (13 E.faecalis, 7 E.faecium, 1 non-typable Enterococcus spp.) strains isolated from clinical samples of hospitalized patients as nosocomial infection agents in the Central Microbiology Laboratory of Ibn-i Sina Hospital, Ankara University, Faculty of Medicine, were included in the study. Glutaraldehyde (2% wt/vol), chlorhexidine gluconate (4% wt/vol), 2-propanol (70% vol/vol), povidone iodine (7.5% wt/vol), povidone iodine (10% wt/vol) and hydrogen peroxide (3% wt/vol) susceptibilities of the isolates were investigated by quantitative suspension test at contact times of 3, 5, and 10 minutes. All of the isolates were found susceptible to glutaraldehyde (2%), chlorhexidine gluconate (4%), povidone iodine (7.5%), povidone iodine (10%) and 2-propanol (70%) at all tested contact times. However, 12 S.aureus (5 MSSA, 7 MRSA) and 3 enterococci (2 E.faecium, 1 E.faecalis) isolates were found susceptible to hydrogen peroxide (3%) at 3 minutes contact time; 11 S.aureus (4 MSSA, 7 MRSA) and 7 E.faecalis isolates were found susceptible at 5 minutes contact time, and 6 S.aureus (4 MSSA, 2 MRSA) and 3 enterococci (1 E.faecium, 2 E.faecalis) isolates were found susceptible at 10 minutes contact time. One MSSA and 8 enterococci (4 E.faecium, 3 E.faecalis, 1 Enterococcus spp.) isolates were found resistant to hydrogen peroxide (3%) at 10 minutes contact time. In conclusion, glutaraldehyde (2%), chlorhexidine gluconate (4%), povidone iodine (7.5%), povidone iodine (10%) and 2-propanol (70%) can be safely used against S.aureus and Enterococcus spp. owing to their high effectiveness, however, hydrogen peroxide (3%) should not be preferred against those strains due to the presence of resistant isolates, in Ankara University Ibn-i Sina Hospital.
TI  - Vulvar abscess: a retrospective review.
AB  - Vulvar abscesses can progress to cause significant illness requiring disfiguring  surgical debridement, broad spectrum antibiotics, and require hospitalization. A retrospective review of de-identified charts of 13 patients admitted for inpatient care for vulvar abscesses from 2004-2009 at West Virginia University Hospitals was conducted. Risk factors for vulvar abscess in these patients included obesity and diabetes. Body mass index (BMI) is directly proportionate to the size of the abscess and increased risk of intensive care unit admission. Most patients did not seek medical care prior to hospital admission. Polymicrobial infections were common, and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus was seen in two cases. The presence of multiple risk factors increased the length of hospitalization. Clinicians should be aware of these risk factors and initiate aggressive therapy for patients with elevated BMI or multiple risk factors.
TI  - Double triplex real-time PCR assay for simultaneous detection of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus and determination of their methicillin resistance directly from positive blood culture bottles.
AB  - We developed and validated here a double triplex real-time PCR assay to simultaneously detect and identify Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and their methicillin resistance in a single reaction directly from Gram-positive cocci-in-clusters (GPCs)-positive blood culture bottles. From August 15, 2009 through February 15, 2010, 238 GPC-positive samples were collected and identified by conventional methods as 11 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 28 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), 176 MR coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS), 21 MSCoNS and two Enterococcus faecalis. The double triplex real-time PCR assay was targeted and detected tuf, nuc and mecA genes in the first tube and atlE, gap and mvaA genes in the second tube which could be run simultaneously. The detection limit of the assay was found at 10(3) CFU/ml for the atleE gene, 10(4) CFU/ml for the mva gene and 10(5) CFU/ml for gap, nuc, mecA and tuf genes based on seeding experiments. All Staphylococcus species except two S. epidermidis were correctly identified by the assay. The double triplex real-time PCR assay quickly and accurately detects S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hominis and S. haemolyticus and their methicillin resistance in a single reaction directly from positive blood culture bottles within 83 min.
TI  - Synthesis, antioxidant and antimicrobial evaluation of simple aromatic esters of  ferulic acid.
AB  - Aromatic ester derivatives of ferulic acid where the phenolic hydroxyl is free (6a-d) or acetylated (5a-d) were evaluated for their antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. The superoxide radical scavenging capacity of compounds 5d and 6d-e (IC(50) of 0.19, 0.27 and 0.20 mM, respectively) was found to be twice as active as alpha-tocopherol (IC(50) = 0.51 mM). DPPH radical scavenging capacity was moderate and only found in compounds bearing free phenolic hydroxyl groups (6a-e). With regard to antimicrobial properties, compounds 6b and 6c displayed significant activity against Enterococcus faecalis (MICs = 16 mug/mL) and vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (MIC for 6b, 32 and for 6c, 16 mug/mL). Compound 6c also demonstrated prominent activity against planktonic Staphylococcus aureus with a MIC value of <8 mug/mL and it inhibited bacterial biofilm formation by S. aureus with a MBEC value of <8 mug/mL, which was 64 and 128 times more potent than ofloxacin and vancomycin, respectively.
TI  - A newly isolated Streptomyces sp. CS392 producing three antimicrobial compounds.
AB  - With the aim of isolating new microbes capable of producing strong antimicrobial  substances, strain CS392 was screened from 700 soil isolates preserved in our laboratory. The strain was related to genus Streptomyces based on various characteristics. Three highly active antimicrobial compounds, C1, C2 and C3, produced by the strain were purified by solvent extraction followed by silica gel column chromatography. These compounds were highly active against various Gram-positive resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Among three, C3 was the most active against MRSA and VRSA with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2 mug/ml while C2 and C3 had MIC values of 4 mug/ml for the strains. In case of Bacillus subtilis ATCC6633, C1 and C3 were more effective with MIC values of 0.5 mug/ml than C2 with MIC of 2 mug/ml. Those antibiotics were variably active (MIC of 4-32 mug/ml) against Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Mycobacterium smegmatis ATCC 9341 and VRE.
TI  - Serotypes and antibiotic resistance in Group B streptococcus isolated from patients at the Maternity Hospital, Kuwait.
AB  - A total of 143 group B streptococcus (GBS) isolates collected from mothers at the Maternity Hospital in Kuwait were investigated for their serotypes and antibiotic resistance, and screened by PCR for the carriage of genes for resistance to tetracycline (tetk, tetM, tetL, tetO), erythromycin (ermA, ermB, ermC, ermTR, ermM, mefA, mefE, msrA) and aminoglycosides (aph3, ant4, ant6). All isolates were serotyped using a latex agglutination test. Most of the isolates belonged to serotypes V (38.5 %), III (20.9 %), Ia (7.7 %) and II (11.2 %). Sixteen isolates (11.2 %) were nontypable. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin and cefotaxime (MICs 0.016-0.094 microg ml(-1)) but were resistant to trimethoprim (92.3 %), tetracycline (89.5 %), minocycline (89.5 %), high-level kanamycin (76.9 %), chloramphenicol (30.0 %), erythromycin (12.6 %), clindamycin (7.0 %), high-level streptomycin (3.5 %) and ciprofloxacin (0.7 %). The tetracycline-resistant isolates contained tetM (94.5 %), tetO (3.9 %), tetL (1.6 %) and tetK (0.8 %). The erythromycin-resistant isolates contained ermB (61.1 %), ermTR (38.9 %), ermA (5.5 %), mefA (5.5 %) and mefE (11 %). All high-level kanamycin-resistant isolates contained aph3. One of the high-level streptomycin-resistant isolates contained ant6. Partial DNA sequencing of aph3 revealed sequences with 99 % similarity to aph3 found in Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, suggesting that the GBS isolates could have acquired aph3 from other Gram-positive cocci. The high proportion of isolates with resistance to tetracycline, high-level kanamycin and trimethoprim, and the increase in the prevalence of erythromycin resistance, represents an emerging public health concern that needs further surveillance.
TI  - Synthesis, spectroscopic properties and antipathogenic activity of new thiourea derivatives.
AB  - A number of acylthioureas, 2-((4-methylphenoxy)methyl)-N-(aryl-carbamothioyl)benzamides (aryl = 3,5-dichlorophenyl, 2,3-dichlorophenyl, 3,4-dichloro-phenyl, 2,4,5-trichlorophenyl, 3,4,5-trichlorophenyl, 2-bromophenyl, 2,4-dibromophenyl, 2,5-dibromophenyl, 2-iodophenyl, 3-fluorophenyl, 2,3,4-trifluorophenyl, 2,4,5-trifluoro-phenyl, 2,4,6-trifluorophenyl) have been synthesized, characterized by elemental analysis, IR and NMR spectroscopy and tested for their interaction with bacterial cells in free and adherent state. The anti-pathogenic activity was correlated with the presence of one iodine, bromide or fluorine, and two or three chloride atoms on the N-phenyl substituent of the thiourea moiety, being significant especially on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus strains, known for their ability to grow in biofilms. Our results demonstrate the potential of these derivatives for further development of novel anti-microbial agents with antibiofilm properties.
TI  - Lobophorins E and F, new spirotetronate antibiotics from a South China Sea-derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 01127.
AB  - The strain SCSIO 01127, isolated from the South China Sea sediment, was identified as a member of Streptomyces by the 16S rDNA sequence analysis. Two new spirotetronate antibiotics lobophorins E (1) and F (2), along with two known analogs lobophorins A (3) and B (4), were isolated from Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 01127. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of detailed IR, NMR and MS spectroscopic analyses. The new compound lobophorin F (2) showed antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 with MIC values of 8 mug ml(-1) for both the strains, better than that of lobophorin B (4). Lobophorin F (2) also displayed better cytotoxic activities than lobophorin B (4), with IC(50) of 6.82, 2.93 and 3.16 muM against SF-268, MCF-7 and NCI-H460, respectively.
TI  - Pseudonocardians A-C, new diazaanthraquinone derivatives from a deap-sea actinomycete Pseudonocardia sp. SCSIO 01299.
AB  - Pseudonocardians A-C (2-4), three new diazaanthraquinone derivatives, along with  a previously synthesized compound deoxynyboquinone (1), were produced by the strain SCSIO 01299, a marine actinomycete member of the genus Pseudonocardia, isolated from deep-sea sediment of the South China Sea. The structures of compounds 1-4 were determined by mass spectrometry and NMR experiments ((1)H, (1)(3)C, HSQC, and HMBC). The structure of compound 1, which was obtained for the first time from a natural source, was confirmed by X-ray analysis. Compounds 1-3 exhibited potent cytotoxic activities against three tumor cell lines of SF-268, MCF-7 and NCI-H460 with IC(5)(0) values between 0.01 and 0.21 mum, and also showed antibacterial activities on Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Bacillus thuringensis SCSIO BT01, with MIC values of 1-4 mug mL(-)(1).
TI  - In-vitro antimicrobial activity and synergistic/antagonistic effect of interactions between antibiotics and some spice essential oils.
AB  - Spices and herbs have been used for many years by different cultures. The aim of  the present study is (1) to investigate in-vitro antimicrobial effects of different spices and herbs (5 species: Rosmarinus officinalis (Rosemary), Coriandrum sativum (coriander), Micromeria fruticosa (L.) Druce subsp. Brachycalyx P.H. Davis (White micromeria), Cumium cyminum (cumin), Mentha piperita (Peppermint) against different bacteria and fungi species, and (2) to discuss the in-vitro possible effects between the plants and antibiotics. The microorganisms used were Micrococcus luteus LA 2971, Bacillus megaterium NRS, Bacillus brevis FMC 3, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 15753, Pseudomonas pyocyaneus DC 127, Mycobacterium smegmatis CCM 2067, Escherichia coil DM, Aeromonas hydrophila ATCC 7966, Yersinia enterocolitica AU 19, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1, Streptococcus faecalis DC 74 bacteria, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae WET 136, Kluvyeromyces fragilis DC 98 fungi in this study. The results indicated that essential oils of Rosmarinus officinalis, Coriandrum sativum L., Micromeria fruticosa (L.) Druce subsp. brachycalyx P.H. Davis, Cumium cyminum L., Mentha piperita L. were shown antimicrobial activity in the range of 7-60 mm 2 microl(-1) inhibition zone to the microorganisms tested, using disc diffusion method. Standard antibiotic such as Gentamicin (10 microg), Cephalothin (30 microg), Ceftriaxone (10 microg), Nystatin (10 U) discs were used for comparison with the antimicrobial activities of essential oils of these plants. In addition, antibacterial activity of essential oils of these plants was researched by effects when it was used together with these standard antibiotics in vitro. However, antibacterial activity changed also by in vitro interactions between these standard antibiotics and essential oils of these plants. Synergic, additive or antagonist effects were observed in antibacterial activity.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of maleic acid and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid on endodontic pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of 7% maleic acid (MA) and 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in elimination of Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, and Staphylococcus aureus at different time intervals. STUDY DESIGN: Transfer culture of microbial strains were used for inoculum preparation and determination of time-kill assay. The viability counts of 7% MA and 17% EDTA suspensions were performed at 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours. Assay results were analyzed by determining number of strains that yielded log(10) CFU/mL of -1 compared with counts at 0 hours, for test medicaments at time intervals. Medicaments were considered to be microbicidal at a minimum inhibitory concentration that reduced original inoculum by >3 log(10) CFU/mL (99.9%) and microbiostatic if inoculum was reduced by <3 log(10) CFU/mL. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-square and Fisher exact tests as well as Friedman test for comparison of the time interval within the MA and EDTA groups. RESULTS: At all time intervals, there was no significant difference between MA and EDTA for all of the organisms (P > .05). However, within the MA and EDTA groups at various time intervals, there were significant differences (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Equivalent antimicrobial activity was observed by MA and EDTA against all of the organisms tested at various periods.
TI  - Antimicrobial and toxicological activities of five medicinal plant species from Cameroon traditional medicine.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases caused by multiresistant microbial strains are on the increase. Fighting these diseases with natural products may be more efficacious. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of methanolic, ethylacetate (EtOAc) and hexanic fractions of five Cameroonian medicinal plants (Piptadeniastum africana, Cissus aralioides, Hileria latifolia, Phyllanthus muellerianus and Gladiolus gregasius) against 10 pathogenic microorganisms of the urogenital and gastrointestinal tracts. METHODS: The fractions were screened for their chemical composition and in vivo acute toxicity was carried out on the most active extracts in order to assess their inhibitory selectivity. The agar well-diffusion and the micro dilution methods were used for the determination of the inhibition diameters (ID) and Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) respectively on 8 bacterial species including two Gram positive species (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis), and six Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi) and two fungal isolates (Candida albicans, Candida krusei). The chemical composition was done according to Harbone (1976), the acute toxicity evaluation according to WHO protocol and the hepatic as well as serum parameters measured to assess liver and kidney functions. RESULTS: The chemical components of each plant's extract varied according to the solvent used, and they were found to contain alkaloids, flavonoids, polyphenols, triterpens, sterols, tannins, coumarins, glycosides, cardiac glycosides and reducing sugars. The methanolic and ethylacetate extracts of Phyllanthus muellerianus and Piptadeniastum africana presented the highest antimicrobial activities against all tested microorganisms with ID varying from 8 to 26 mm and MIC from 2.5 to 0.31 mg/ml. The in vivo acute toxicity study carried out on the methanolic extracts of Phyllanthus muellerianus and Piptadeniastrum africana indicated that these two plants were not toxic. At the dose of 4 g/kg body weight, kidney and liver function tests indicated that these two medicinal plants induced no adverse effect on these organs. CONCLUSION: These results showed that, all these plant's extracts can be used as antimicrobial phytomedicines which can be therapeutically used against infections caused by multiresistant agents.

TI  - Preparation and antibacterial evaluation of decarboxylated fluoroquinolones.
AB  - Decarboxylated ciprofloxacin (3) has been reported in the literature to have antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and especially potent activity against Escherichia coli. Herein, we report our syntheses of 3 and five additional decarboxylated fluoroquinolones (FQs). We have re-evaluated the antibacterial activity of these FQs. In contrast to previously reported data, none of these decarboxylated fluoroquinolones showed significant antibacterial activity in our assays using both the broth dilution and agar methods. Our study confirmed that the presence of a carboxylic acid group at the 3-position of the fluoroquinolone scaffold is essential for antibacterial activity.
TI  - N-O chemistry for antibiotics: discovery of N-alkyl-N-(pyridin-2-yl)hydroxylamine scaffolds as selective antibacterial agents using nitroso Diels-Alder and ene chemistry.
AB  - The discovery, syntheses, and structure-activity relationships (SAR) of a new family of heterocyclic antibacterial compounds based on N-alkyl-N-(pyridin-2-yl)hydroxylamine scaffolds are described. A structurally diverse library of approximately 100 heterocyclic molecules generated from Lewis acid-mediated nucleophilic ring-opening reactions with nitroso Diels-Alder cycloadducts and nitroso ene reactions with substituted alkenes was evaluated in whole cell antibacterial assays. Compounds containing the N-alkyl-N-(pyridin-2-yl)hydroxylamine structure demonstrated selective and potent antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive bacterium Micrococcus luteus ATCC 10240 (MIC(90) = 2.0 muM or 0.41 mug/mL) and moderate activity against other Gram-positive strains including antibiotic resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). A new synthetic route to the active core was developed using palladium-catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig amination reactions of N-alkyl-O-(4-methoxybenzyl)hydroxylamines with 2-halo-pyridines that facilitated SAR studies and revealed the simplest active structural fragment. This work shows the value of using a combination of diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS) and parallel synthesis for identifying new antibacterial scaffolds.
TI  - [Study of marine actinomycetes isolated from the central coast of Peru and their  antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the antimicrobial potential of marine actinomycetes against drug-resistant pathogens represented by strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Strains of actinomycetes (29) isolated from marine sediment were evaluated by their characteristics in two culture media and by testing their inhibitory capacity by in vitro antagonism against multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogenic bacteria for MRSA and VRE. Organic extracts of 3 selected actinomicetes were processed to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the active compound. RESULTS: Most isolated actinomycetes belong to a homogeneous group of write-gray actinomycetes with a good growth in Marine Agar. The inhibitory rates of the isolates were above 85% for both pathogens with inhibition zones greater than 69 and 78 mm in diameter for MRSA and VRE respectively. Dichloromethane extracts of 3 isolates (I-400A, B1-T61, M10-77) showed strong inhibitory activity of both pathogens, M10-77 being the highest actinomycete strain with antibiotic activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus ATCC 43300 and vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis ATCC 51299 with a minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 7.9 and 31.7 mug/ml respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of M10-77 strain showed 99% similarity with the marine species Streptomyces erythrogriseus. CONCLUSIONS: Marine sediments of the central coast of Peru, are a source of actinomycetes strains showing high capacity to produce bioactive compounds able to inhibit pathogens classified as multi-drug-resistant such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis.
TI  - Synthesis, antimicrobial activity and possible mechanism of action of 9-bromo-substituted indolizinoquinoline-5,12-dione derivatives.
AB  - A series of 9-bromo-substituted indolizinoquinoline-5,12-dione derivatives was synthesized.

Compound 27 shows the best anti-MRSA activity with an MIC value of 0.031 mug/ml. To assess the mechanism of action, the inhibitory activities of compound 1 against DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase IV were also measured. The results indicate that compound 1 has strong inhibitory effects on the Escherichia coli DNA gyrase supercoiling activity and S. aureus Topo IV relaxing activity.
TI  - Chemical composition and in vitro antibacterial activity of the essential oil of  Phthirusa adunca from Venezuelan Andes.
AB  - In this paper, preliminary studies on the chemical characterization of Phthirusa  adunca Meyer essential oil, obtained by hydrodistillation, is presented. The separation of the components was performed by GC-MS. Twenty-three compounds (94.5% of the sample) were identified of which the three major ones (76% of the sample) were beta-phellandrene (38.1%), germacrene D (26.8%) and beta-pinene (11.5%). The essential oil showed a broad spectrum of activity against Salmonella Typhi CDC 57 (100 microg/mL), Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 (200 microg/mL), Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 (250 microg/mL), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 y Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 23357 (500 microg/mL). This is the first report on the composition and activity of the essential oil of this species.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of the essential oil of Lantana camara var. moritziana.
AB  - The essential oil obtained from the leaves of Lantana camara var. moritziana (Otto & Dietr.) Lopez-Palacios collected at Rubio, Tachira State, Venezuela, was obtained by hydrodistillation in a Clevenger trap (0.1% yield). The oil was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) on HP GC-MS System, model 5973, identifying 33 compounds (97.1%) of which the major components were germacrene D (31.0%), followed by beta-caryophyllene (14.8%), a-phellandrene (6.7%), limonene (5.7%) and 1,8-cineole (5.2%). Evaluation of the antibacterial activity by agar diffusion method with discs against international reference bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella Typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) showed growing inhibition of E. faecalis and S. aureus at MIC of 350 mg/mL and 400 mg/mL, respectively.
TI  - Growing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis in the region with the highest prevalence of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  
TI  - Epidemiologic characteristics of resistant microorganisms present in reserves from an intensive care unit.
AB  - In this study, significant contamination in the intensive care unit environment was observed (P < .004). Sampling of inanimate surfaces and equipment found vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, ciprofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and S epidermidis, and multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii with similarities (60%-80%) to blood culture isolates.
TI  - Microbiology at first visit of moderate-to-severe diabetic foot infection with antimicrobial activity and a survey of quinolone monotherapy.
AB  - Samples from 1295 patients with diabetic foot infection were evaluated; 4332 samples were collected with an average of 3.3 samples per patient. Fifty-seven percent of patients had a 2B ulcer and 23% had a 3B ulcer according to Texas University Classification. In 64.2% of samples collected at first visit an etiologic agent was identified. About 40% of the positive samples were polymicrobial. Gram positive bacteria were more frequently isolated (52.6%), Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated single agent (29.9%) and MRSA was 22% of S. aureus. Enterococcus spp., mainly Enterococcus faecalis, were 9.9%, all vancomycin susceptible except 2 isolates. Streptococci were 4.6%, more than 60% Streptococcus agalactiae. Gram negative rods were 40.6%, with enterobacteria 23.5% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 10.3%. Anaerobes were only 0.3%, probably due to culture methods applied in our laboratory. Cotrimoxazole, rifampin and doxycycline were still active against S. aureus. ESBL producers, among enterobacteria, were 10%, mainly Escherichia coli and Proteus spp. Only colistin had a rate of susceptibility against P. aeruginosa above 90%. Levofloxacin had the best clinical activity with respect to the other quinolones, but when it failed, selected more resistant strains with respect to moxifloxacin among S. aureus and with respect to ciprofloxacin among P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Tammar wallaby mammary cathelicidins are differentially expressed during lactation and exhibit antimicrobial and cell proliferative activity.
AB  - Cathelicidins secreted in milk may be central to autocrine feedback in the mammary gland for optimal development in addition to conferring innate immunity to both the mammary gland and the neonate. This study exploits the unique reproductive strategy of the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) model to analyse differential splicing of cathelicidin genes and to evaluate the bactericidal activity and effect of the protein on mammary epithelial cell proliferation. Two linear peptides, Con73 and Con218, derived from the heterogeneous carboxyl end of cathelicidin transcripts, MaeuCath1 and MaeuCath7 respectively, were evaluated for antimicrobial activity. Both Con73 and Con218 significantly inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aureginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Salmonella enterica. In addition both MaeuCath1 and MaeuCath7 stimulated proliferation of primary tammar wallaby mammary epithelial cells (WallMEC). Lactation-phase specific alternate spliced transcripts were determined for MaeuCath1 showing utilisation of both antimicrobial and proliferative functions are required by the mammary gland and the suckled young. The study has shown for the first time that temporal regulation of milk cathelicidins may be crucial in antimicrobial protection of the mammary gland and suckled young and mammary cell proliferation.
TI  - Investigation of the antimicrobial activity of Rhaponticum (Rhaponticum carthamoides D.C. Iljin) and shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa L.).
AB  - The aim of the study was to determine antimicrobial activity of rhaponticum and shrubby cinquefoil extracts. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Ethanol extract from the leaves of rhaponticum (Rhaponticum carthamoides D.C. Iljin) and shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa L.) was produced at the Department of Food Technology, Kaunas University of Technology. The antimicrobial activity of the viscous extract or rhaponticum and shrubby cinquefoil was evaluated using standard microorganism cultures (bacteria Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 33499, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 12459, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Bacillus cereus ATCC 8035 and fungi Candida albicans ATCC 60193). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the examined preparations was determined. RESULTS. Both studied preparations - rhaponticum (Rhaponticum carthamoides D.C. Iljin) and shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa L.) - demonstrated similar antimicrobial activity. The highest sensitivity to the studied preparations was observed in microbes with eukaryotic cell structure: Candida albicans, which is a fungus, and a spore-forming prokaryotic bacterium, Bacillus cereus. The highest resistance was observed in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS. The studied preparations - viscous extracts of rhaponticum and shrubby cinquefoil - are substances with antimicrobial activity against gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis) bacteria, spore-forming bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus), and fungi (Candida albicans).
TI  - Essential oil from aerial parts of of Betonica grandiflora Willd. from Iran.
AB  - The chemical composition of the essential oil obtained from the aerial parts of Betonica grandiflora Willd., growing wild in Iran, was analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for the first time. Overall, 40 volatile components were identified on the basis of their mass spectra characteristics and retention indices in which ledol (21.8%), myrtenyl acetate (21.7%), eudesm-7(11)-en-4-ol (6.5%), trans-caryophyllene (5.5%), alpha-bisabolol (4.9%) and isolongifolol (4.5%) were the major constituents. Oxygenated sesquiterpenes, monoterpene hydrocarbons and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were the main groups of compounds with 45.6%, 23.1% and 18.4%, respectively. The oil was moderately active against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus and inactive against Enterococcus faecalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae.

TI  - Antimicrobial activity of daptomycin tested against gram-positive strains collected in European hospitals: results from 7 years of resistance surveillance (2003-2009).
AB  - Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide approved by the European medicines Agency (EMEA) for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI) and Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis. We evaluated the in vitro activity of daptomycin and comparators tested against clinical isolates from european hospitals over a 7-year period (2003-2009). A total of 36,769 consecutive isolates were collected in 34 medical centers located in 13 European countries, Turkey and Israel. the collection included S. aureus (18,352; 27.2% oxacillin-resistant [MRSA]); coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 6,874), Enterococcus spp. (7,241; 9.4% vancomycin-resistant), beta-hemolytic (3,009), viridans group streptococci (1,176), and Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus (107). The organisms were isolated mainly from patients with bloodstream infection (56%) or cSSTI (23%). Daptomycin was very active against S. aureus and CoNS (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l for both organisms), and its activity was not adversely influenced by oxacillin resistance. All Enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to daptomycin (MIC(50/90), 1/1 mg/l). Daptomycin (MIC(50/90), 2/2 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and linezolid (MIC(50/90), 1/2 mg/l; 99.7% susceptible) were the most active agents tested against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium. Vancomycin- resistant and -susceptible enterococcal strains were equally susceptible to daptomycin. Daptomycin was also active against beta-hemolytic streptococci (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.25 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible), viridans group streptococci (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l; 99.8% susceptible) and S. bovis (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.12 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible).In summary, daptomycin was very potent against this large collection (36,769) of Gram-positive organisms isolated in european hospitals, and its activity remained stable across the 7-year period evaluated (2003-2009), using reference methods and interpretive criteria. Decreases in daptomycin potency were not observed since EMEA approval and widespread clinical use, and emerging resistance to other compounds did not adversely influence daptomycin activity against contemporary Gram-positive species.
TI  - Synergistic and antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria on tyramine production by food-borne pathogenic bacteria in tyrosine decarboxylase broth.
AB  - The effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains on tyramine (TYR) and also other biogenic amines (BA) production by eight common food-borne pathogen (FBP) in tyrosine decarboxylase broth (TDB) was investigated by using a rapid HPLC method. Significant differences were observed among the FBP strains in ammonia (AMN) and BA production apart from tryptamine, histamine (HIS) and spermine formation (p<0.05). Salmonella paratyphi A was characterised as the main amine producer. LAB had an important synergetic role in some BA production by food-borne pathogenic bacteria, although the effect of some LAB strains on BA production was strain-dependent. Lactococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. resulted in significantly higher TYR accumulation by Aeromonas hydrophila and Enterococcus faecalis in TDB. The presence of Lactococcus and/or Lactobacillus in TDB significantly increased HIS production by A. hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Ent. faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas HIS accumulation was significantly reduced by Staphylococcus aureus, S. paratyphi A and Listeria monocytogenes.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial effect of aqueous and ethanolic Moringa leaf extracts.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antibacterial effect of aqueous and ethanolic moringa  leaf extracts (Moringa oleifera) on the growth of gram-positive and negative bacteria. METHODS: Paper disks were soaked with 100, 200, 300 and 400 muL of extract at 20 g/180 mL and 10 g/190 mL. All extracts were tested against Escherichia coli (ATCC25922), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC25923), Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC29212), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27853), Salmonella enteritidis (IH) and Aeromonas caviae. The susceptibility tests were performed using the modified disk diffusion method. RESULTS: The strains E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. enteritidis (IH) were resistant to all treatments. In general, disks with 400 muL extract were the most efficient against S. aureus, V. parahaemolyticus, E. faecalis and A. caviae. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates a promising potential for aqueous and ethanolic Moringa leaf extracts as alternative treatment of infections caused by the tested strains.
TI  - Functional analysis of environmental DNA-derived type II polyketide synthases reveals structurally diverse secondary metabolites.
AB  - A single gram of soil is predicted to contain thousands of unique bacterial species. The majority of these species remain recalcitrant to standard culture methods, prohibiting their use as sources of unique bioactive small molecules. The cloning and analysis of DNA extracted directly from environmental samples (environmental DNA, eDNA) provides a means of exploring the biosynthetic capacity of natural bacterial populations. Environmental DNA libraries contain large reservoirs of bacterial genetic diversity from which new secondary metabolite gene clusters can be systematically recovered and studied. The identification and heterologous expression of type II polyketide synthase-containing eDNA clones is reported here. Functional analysis of three soil DNA-derived polyketide synthase systems in Streptomyces albus revealed diverse metabolites belonging to well-known, rare, and previously uncharacterized structural families. The first of these systems is predicted to encode the production of the known antibiotic landomycin E. The second was found to encode the production of a metabolite with a previously uncharacterized pentacyclic ring system. The third was found to encode the production of unique KB-3346-5 derivatives, which show activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. These results, together with those of other small-molecule-directed metagenomic studies, suggest that culture-independent approaches are capable of accessing biosynthetic diversity that has not yet been extensively explored using culture-based methods. The large-scale functional screening of eDNA clones should be a productive strategy for generating structurally previously uncharacterized chemical entities for use in future drug development efforts.
TI  - Evaluation of forty new phenothiazine derivatives for activity against intrinsic  efflux pump systems of reference Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus strains.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because phenothiazines inhibit efflux pumps of bacteria, forty new phenothiazine derivatives were tested for their inhibition of the efflux pump systems of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Detection of efflux pump activity was conducted by a previously described automated fluorimetric method. RESULTS: Although many of the compounds significantly inhibited efflux by distinct bacteria, four compounds had exceptional activity against the efflux pump systems of the pathogenic wild type bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. These four compounds were then evaluated for ability to reduce or reverse resistance of multi-drug resistant members of Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus whose MDR phenotypes are mediated by specific over-expressed efflux pumps. One of the compounds, 2173, significantly reduced resistance of MDR Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSION: These results suggest possible use of compound 2173 for therapy of infections caused by this organism.
TI  - Antioxidant, electrochemical, thermal, antimicrobial and alkane oxidation properties of tridentate Schiff base ligands and their metal complexes.
AB  - In this study, two Schiff base ligands (HL(1) and HL(2)) and their Cu(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Pd(II) and Ru(III) metal complexes were synthesized and characterized by the analytical and spectroscopic methods. Alkane oxidation activities of the metal complexes were studied on cyclohexane as substrate. The ligands and their metal complexes were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Corynebacterium xerosis, Bacillus brevis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus cereus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis (as gram-positive bacteria) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Klebsiella fragilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Candida albicans (as gram-negative bacteria). The antioxidant properties of the Schiff base ligands were evaluated in a series of in vitro tests: 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging and reducing power activity of superoxide anion radical generated non-enzymatic systems. Electrochemical and thermal properties of the compounds were investigated.
TI  - Detection of volatile compounds produced by microbial growth in urine by selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS).

This technique has the potential to offer rapid and simple diagnosis of the causative agent of UTIs.

TI  - Unraveling the protein targets of vancomycin in living S. aureus and E. faecalis  cells.
AB  - Vancomycin is a potent glycopeptide antibiotic that has evolved to specifically bind to the D-Ala-D-Ala dipeptide termini of nascent peptidoglycans. Although this mode of action is well established, several studies indicate that vancomycin and analogues exploit noncanonical target sites. In order to address all vancomycin targets in clinically relevant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis strains we developed a series of small-molecule photoaffinity probes based on vancomycin. Proteomic profiling revealed the specific labeling of two previously unknown vancomycin targets that are likely to contribute to its antibiotic activity. The specific inhibition of the major staphylococcal autolysin Atl confirms previous observations that vancomycin alters S. aureus cell morphology by interaction with the autolytic machinery. Moreover, in E. faecalis the vancomycin photoprobe specifically binds to an ABC transporter protein, which likely impedes the uptake of essential nutrients such as sugars and peptides. The labeling of these two prominent membrane targets in living cells reveals a thus far unexplored mode of vancomycin binding and inhibition that could allow a rational design of variants with improved activity.
TI  - High-level fluorescence labeling of gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - Fluorescence labeling of bacterial pathogens has a broad range of interesting applications including the observation of living bacteria within host cells. We constructed a novel vector based on the E. coli streptococcal shuttle plasmid pAT28 that can propagate in numerous bacterial species from different genera. The plasmid harbors a promoterless copy of the green fluorescent variant gene egfp under the control of the CAMP-factor gene (cfb) promoter of Streptococcus agalactiae and was designated pBSU101. Upon transfer of the plasmid into streptococci, the bacteria show a distinct and easily detectable fluorescence using a standard fluorescence microscope and quantification by FACS-analysis demonstrated values that were 10-50 times increased over the respective controls. To assess the suitability of the construct for high efficiency fluorescence labeling in different gram-positive pathogens, numerous species were transformed. We successfully labeled Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus anginosus and Staphylococcus aureus strains utilizing the EGFP reporter plasmid pBSU101. In all of these species the presence of the cfb promoter construct resulted in high-level EGFP expression that could be further increased by growing the streptococcal and enterococcal cultures under high oxygen conditions through continuous aeration.
TI  - Validation of the Zurich burn-biofilm model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite advances in the use of topical and parenteral antimicrobial therapy and the practice of early tangential burn-wound excision, bacterial infection remains a major problem in the management of burn victims today. The purpose of this study was to design and evaluate a polyspecies biofilm model with bacteria known to cause severe infections in burn patients. The model is simple to prepare, maintain and analyse, and allows for short-term exposure to antimicrobials. RESULTS: Initial experiments showed that it was impossible to establish balanced polyspecies biofilms with an inoculum of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. After 64.5 h of incubation, the Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) had suppressed the Gram-positives (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus intermedius). However, adding the Gram-negative bacteria after 41.5 h to an established biofilm of Gram-positives resulted in a balanced microbial consortium. After 64.5 h, all species were present in high numbers (10(7) to 10(8) colony forming units (CFU) per biofilm). Multiple repetitions showed high reproducibility of biofilm formation without significant differences between and within experiments. Combined fluorescence in situ hybridisation/confocal laser scanning microscopy (FISH/CLSM) analyses, for which biofilms had to be grown on a different non-flexible substrate (hydroxy apatite), revealed that, by 41.5 h, the biofilm consisted of an almost confluent layer of bacteria firmly adherent to the substratum. After 64.5 h (22 h after the addition of the Gram negatives), the biofilm consisted of a confluent mixture of single cells, an abundance of galaxies of bacteria with small lacunae and large amounts of extracellular matrix polysaccharides. CONCLUSIONS: The polyspecies biofilm model contains the most prevalent burn-associated Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens and mimics the Gram-negative shift observed in vivo. It shows excellent reproducibility. It should allow adaptation to the bacterial spectrum prevalent in different burn centres and lead to a much more reliable investigation of the efficiency of topical antimicrobial agents than models operating with planktonic bacteria. The experiments further open up the perspective to create an in vivo model using these biofilms as infectious agents.
TI  - First detection of the staphylococcal trimethoprim resistance gene dfrK and the dfrK-carrying transposon Tn559 in enterococci.
AB  - The trimethoprim resistance gene dfrK has been recently described in Staphylococcus aureus, but so far has not been found in other bacteria. A total of 166 enterococci of different species (E. faecium, E. faecalis, E. hirae, E. durans, E. gallinarum, and E. casseliflavus) and origins (food, clinical diseases in humans, healthy humans or animals, and sewage) were studied for their susceptibility to trimethoprim as determined by agar dilution (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing) and the presence of (a) the dfrK gene and its genetic environment and (b) other dfr genes. The dfrK gene was detected in 49% of the enterococci (64% and 42% of isolates with minimum inhibitory concentrations of >/=2 mg/L or </=1 mg/L, respectively). The tet(L)-dfrK linkage was detected in 21% of dfrK-positive enterococci. The chromosomal location of the dfrK gene was identified in one E. faecium isolate in which the dfrK was not linked to tet(L) gene but was part of a Tn559 element, which was integrated in the chromosomal radC gene. This Tn559 element was also found in 14 additional isolates. All combinations of dfr genes were detected among the isolates tested (dfrK, dfrG, dfrF, dfrK+dfrG, dfrK+dfrF, dfrF+dfrG, and dfrF+dfrG+dfrK). The gene dfrK gene was found together with other dfr genes in 58% of the tested enterococci. This study suggested an exchange of the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrK between enterococci and staphylococci, as previously observed for the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrG.
TI  - Anti-proliferative activity of meroditerpenoids isolated from the brown alga Stypopodium flabelliforme against several cancer cell lines.
AB  - The sea constitutes one of the most promising sources of novel compounds with potential application in human therapeutics. In particular, algae have proved to be an interesting source of new bioactive compounds. In this work, six meroditerpenoids (epitaondiol, epitaondiol diacetate, epitaondiol monoacetate, stypotriol triacetate, 14-ketostypodiol diacetate and stypodiol) isolated from the brown alga Stypopodium flabelliforme were tested for their cell proliferation inhibitory activity in five cell lines. Cell lines tested included human colon adenocarcinoma (Caco-2), human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y), rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3), murine macrophages (RAW.267) and Chinese hamster fibroblasts (V79). Antimicrobial activity of the compounds was also evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Micrococcus luteus. Overall, the compounds showed good activity against all cell lines, with SH-SY5Y and RAW.267 being the most susceptible. Antimicrobial capacity was observed for epitaondiol monoacetate, stypotriol triacetate and stypodiol, with the first being the most active. The results suggest that these molecules deserve further studies in order to evaluate their potential as therapeutic agents.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities of commonly encountered bacterial isolates to fosfomycin determined by agar dilution and disk diffusion methods.
AB  - We studied the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against 960 strains of commonly encountered bacteria associated with urinary tract infection using standard agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. Species studied included 3 common species of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus; and vancomycin-susceptible and resistant Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. MICs and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted in accordance with both the currently recommended Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) criteria for urinary tract isolates of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) criteria for Enterobacteriaceae. Tentative zone diameter interpretive criteria were developed for species not currently published by CLSI or EUCAST. Escherichia coli was uniformly susceptible to fosfomycin, as were most strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. A. baumannii was resistant to fosfomycin, while the prevalence of resistance in P. aeruginosa and S. maltophilia was greatly affected by the choice of MIC breakpoint. New tentative zone diameter criteria for K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, S. aureus, and E. faecium were able to be set, providing some interim laboratory guidance for disk diffusion until further breakpoint evaluations are undertaken by CLSI and EUCAST.
TI  - Neutral metallated and meso-substituted porphyrins as antimicrobial agents against gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterial pathogen that causes severe infections among humans. The increasing emergence of antibiotic resistance necessitates the development of new strategies to combat the spread of disease. One approach is photodynamic inactivation using porphyrin photosensitizers, which generate superoxide and other radicals in the presence of light, causing cell death via the oxidation of proteins and lipids. In this study, we analyzed a novel library of meso-substituted and metallated porphyrins for activity against multidrug-resistant S. aureus. From a library of 251 compounds, 51 showed antimicrobial activity, in three discrete classes of activity: those that functioned only in light, those that had toxicity only in darkness, and those that displayed activity regardless of illumination. We further demonstrated the broad-spectrum activity of these compounds against a variety of pathogens, including Bacillus anthracis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Escherichia coli. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) analyses of lead compounds (XPZ-263 and XPZ-271) revealed strong activity and killing towards methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains. An analysis of mutation frequencies revealed low incidences of resistance to lead compounds by E. coli and MRSA. Finally, an exploration of the underlying mechanism of action suggests that these compounds do not depend solely upon light-induced radical generation for toxicity, highlighting their potential for clinical applications.
TI  - Population biology of Gram-positive pathogens: high-risk clones for dissemination of antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Infections caused by multiresistant Gram-positive bacteria represent a major health burden in the community as well as in hospitalized patients. Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium are well-known pathogens of hospitalized patients, frequently linked with resistance against multiple antibiotics, compromising effective therapy. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes are important pathogens in the community and S. aureus has recently emerged as an important community-acquired pathogen. Population genetic studies reveal that recombination prevails as a driving force of genetic diversity in E. faecium, E. faecalis, S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes, and thus, these species are weakly clonal. Although recombination has a relatively modest role driving the genetic variation of the core genome of S. aureus, the horizontal acquisition of resistance and virulence genes plays a key role in the emergence of new clinically relevant clones in this species. In this review, we discuss the population genetics of E. faecium, E. faecalis, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and S. aureus. Knowledge of the population structure of these pathogens is not only highly relevant for (molecular) epidemiological research but also for identifying the genetic variation that underlies changes in clinical behaviour, to improve our understanding of the pathogenic behaviour of particular clones and to identify novel targets for vaccines or immunotherapy.
TI  - Tn916-like genetic elements: a diverse group of modular mobile elements conferring antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive bacteria are responsible for morbidity and mortality in healthcare environments. Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae can all exhibit clinically relevant multidrug resistance phenotypes due to acquired resistance genes on mobile genetic elements. It is possible that clinically relevant multidrug-resistant Clostridium difficile strains will appear in the future, as the organism is adept at acquiring mobile genetic elements (plasmids and transposons). Conjugative transposons of the Tn916/Tn1545 family, which carry major antibiotic resistance determinants, are transmissible between these different bacteria by a conjugative mechanism during which the elements are excised by a staggered cut from donor cells, converted to a circular form, transferred by cell-cell contact and inserted into recipient cells by a site-specific recombinase. The ability of these conjugative transposons to acquire additional, clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes importantly contributes to the emergence of multidrug resistance.
TI  - Determination of disk diffusion and MIC quality control guidelines for JNJ-Q2, a  novel quinolone.
AB  - JNJ-Q2 is a novel fluorinated 4-quinolone in development for treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. This quality control (QC) study was performed to establish ranges for control strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 (0.004 to 0.015 mug/ml), Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 (0.015 to 0.06 mug/ml), Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (0.5 to 2 mug/ml and 17 to 23 mm), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 (0.008 to 0.03 mug/ml and 30 to 36 mm), Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 (0.002 to 0.015 mug/ml and 31 to 39 mm), Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 (0.004 to 0.015 mug/ml and 28 to 35 mm), and S. aureus ATCC 25923 (32 to 38 mm). These ranges will be crucial in evaluating JNJ-Q2 potency as it progresses through clinical trial development.
TI  - Synthetic 3-arylideneflavanones as inhibitors of the initial stages of biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of twenty two synthetic flavonoids is reported. Among  them three 3-arylideneflavanones, 2b, 2c, and 2i, were shown to be highly active against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis reference strains, with MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) values ranging from 4.68 microg/ml (14.3 microM) to 37.5 microg/ml (119.7 microM). The synergy of oxacillin and vancomycin with 2c, evaluated as fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was shown (against planktonic culture of S. aureus A3 and E. faecium 138/09 clinical strains). The presence of 2c in the culture medium diminished the initial adhesion of bacteria to an abiotic surface. Such an effect resulted in a decrease in biofilm formation during prolonged culture. Unfortunately, 2e failed to eradicate the S. aureus mature biofilm which was already preformed, however, decreased the number of live biofilm cells. The biofilm of E. faecalis was more susceptible to the action of 3-arylideneflavanone 2c than the S. aureus biofilm. The finding that 3-arylideneflavanones are lipophilic, cause bacterial aggregation, and influence the integrity of membranes making them permeable to SYTO 9/propidium iodide dyes may implicate the cytoplasmic membrane as a target site for these compounds activity.
TI  - In vitro assay of the antimicrobial activity of kephir against bacterial and fungal strains.
AB  - Kephir is a fermented carbonated refreshing milk, with a slightly acidic aromatic taste and creamy foam composition which contains lactobacilli, leuconostocci, acetic acid bacteria, lactostreptococci and yeasts. Recent studies have demonstrated its antibacterial, immunostimulating, antitumoral and cholesterol-lowering activities. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of kephir against Bacillus subtilis spp. spizizenii ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Salmonella enteritidis ATCC 13076, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. The kephir fermented for 24 h and 48 h, as well and after 7 days preservation at 4-8 degrees C was tested by in vitro disk diffusion method. The intensity of the antimicrobial activity was interpreted by comparison with two antibiotics, i.e. ampicillin and neomycin. RESULTS: The antimicrobial activity of 24 h as well as 48 fermented kephir, fresh or after 7 days preservation at 4-8 degrees C was similar and observed against B. subtilis, S. aureus, E. coli, E. faecalis and S. enteritidis. For E. coli, E. faecalis and S. enteritidis the antimicrobial activity was superior to both tested antibiotics and for B. subtilis and S. aureus to one antibiotic. The tested products exhibited no activity against P. aeruginosa and C. albicans. CONCLUSION: Kephir is exhibiting large spectrum and strong antibacterial activity probably due to the complex viable probiotic strains association producing antimicrobial substances.
TI  - Airway pathogens during the first year after lung transplantation: a single-center experience.
AB  - After lung transplantation, a high level of immunosuppression is needed to prevent rejection. This demand renders recipients more sensitive to infections. As pulmonary infections are a major clinical problem during the first postoperative year after lung transplantation, preventive treatment and regular surveillance examinations are needed for immediate, adequate therapy. We describe the airway pathogens registered during the first posttransplantation year among our 12 lung transplant recipients since December 2008. Samples were obtained for microbiologic analysis from the upper and lower respiratory tracts and from serum as part of routine care. During the first year after transplantation the most frequent pathogens were fungi (Candida albicans 82%; Aspergillus 50%), Pneumocystis (8%), gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas spp 60%; Klebsiella 25%, Acinetobacter 17%; Escherichia Coli 17%; and Enterococcus faecalis 25%), and Staphylococcus aureus (50%, including methicillin-resistant strains 25%). This pathogen spectrum in the first postoperative year after lung transplantation was similar to other centers. Colonization with Pseudomonas or fungi presented early and was prevalent among our patients.
TI  - Essential oil composition and antibacteral activity of Vismia baccifera fruits collected from Merida, Venezuela.
AB  - The essential oil from the fruits of Vismia baccifera Triana & Planch. (Gutttiferae), collected in June 2009, was analyzed by GC/MS. A yield of 0.6% oil was obtained by hydrodistillation. Twenty-seven components were identified by comparison of their mass spectra with those in the Wiley GC-MS Library data base. The major components were trans-cadin-l1,4-diene (36.6%), cis-cadin-1,4-diene (18.8%) and beta-caryophyllene (11.9%). The essential oil showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against the important human pathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25992), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 23357) with MIC values ranging from 9 to 37 microg/mL.
TI  - Recognition of pathogenic microbes by the Drosophila phagocytic pattern recognition receptor Eater.
AB  - Non-opsonic phagocytosis is a primordial form of pathogen recognition that is mediated by the direct interaction of phagocytic receptors with microbial surfaces. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the EGF-like repeat containing scavenger receptor Eater is expressed by phagocytes and is required to survive infections with gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. However, the mechanisms by which this receptor recognizes different types of bacteria are poorly understood. To address this problem, we generated a soluble, Fc-tagged receptor variant of Eater comprising the N-terminal 199 amino acids including four EGF-like repeats. We first established that Eater-Fc displayed specific binding to broad yet distinct classes of heat- or ethanol-inactivated microbes and behaved similarly to the membrane-bound, full-length Eater receptor. We then used Eater-Fc as a tool to probe Eater binding to the surface of live bacteria. Eater-Fc bound equally well to naive or inactivated Staphylococcus aureus or Enterococcus faecalis, suggesting that in vivo, Eater directly targets live gram-positive bacteria, enabling their phagocytic clearance and destruction. By contrast, Eater-Fc was unable to interact with live, naive gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For these bacteria, Eater-Fc binding required membrane-disrupting treatments. Furthermore, we found that cecropin A, a cationic, membrane-disrupting antimicrobial peptide, could promote Eater-Fc binding to live E. coli, even at sublethal concentrations. These results suggest a previously unrecognized mechanism by which antimicrobial peptides cooperate with phagocytic receptors to extend the range of microbes that can be targeted by a single, germline-encoded receptor.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics of free ertapenem in critically ill septic patients: intermittent versus continuous infusion.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper was to compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters of continuous (CI) and intermittent infusion (ITI) of ertapenem into critically ill patients with severe abdominal infections. METHODS: Twenty septic patients hospitalized in a university hospital intensive care unit were enrolled in the study. Half of the patients received ertapenem as an ITI 1 g bolus once daily, and the other half of the patients received the same dose via CI over 24 h following a 1-g loading dose. Blood was drawn 1, 12 and 24 h after terminating ITI or on days 2, 3 and 5 after starting CI for each patient. After centrifugation, the drawn blood was frozen at -80 degrees C until being examined by high-performance liquid-chromatography analysis. RESULTS: Median serum-free ertapenem concentrations were as follows: fCmax = 98.9 mg/L and fCmin = 2.5 mg/L for ITI, and fCss=15.9 mg/L for CI. The ITI and CI median total clearance and volumes of distribution were 2.2 L/h vs. 2.5 L/h and 15.4 L vs. 21.0 L, respectively. The ertapenem MIC ranges were as follows: Escherichia coli (0.006 to 0.5 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (0.023 to 0.5 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.023 to 0.5 mg/L), Staphylococcus aureus (0.38 to 3 mg/L), Streptococcus viridians (0.38 to 3 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (0.38 to 3 mg/L). ITI and CI provided steady-state serum-free ertapenem concentrations constantly above the MIC for all bacteria. CONCLUSION: Ertapenem exhibited satisfactory PK/PD parameters and achieved serum-free concentrations 100% of the time, above even the high MIC of extracellular pathogens normally encountered during severe abdominal infections. CI administration resulted in equally effective PK/PD parameters as ITI in normal weight, good renal-function patients.
TI  - Structure-based design of a new series of D-glutamic acid based inhibitors of bacterial UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine:D-glutamate ligase (MurD).
AB  - MurD ligase is one of the key enzymes participating in the intracellular steps of peptidoglycan biosynthesis and constitutes a viable target in the search for novel antibacterial drugs to combat bacterial drug-resistance. We have designed, synthesized, and evaluated a new series of D-glutamic acid-based Escherichia coli MurD inhibitors incorporating the 5-benzylidenethiazolidin-4-one scaffold. The crystal structure of 16 in the MurD active site has provided a good starting point for the design of structurally optimized inhibitors 73-75 endowed with improved MurD inhibitory potency (IC(50) between 3 and 7 muM). Inhibitors 74 and 75 showed weak activity against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Compounds 73-75, with IC(50) values in the low micromolar range, represent the most potent D-Glu-based MurD inhibitors reported to date.
TI  - Susceptibility of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria to novel nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle technology.
AB  - The rapidly evolving crisis of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms has contributed to the rise of patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial and community-acquired infections. Therefore, innovative antimicrobial technology targeting mechanisms to which the bacteria are unlikely to evolve resistance is urgently needed. We have previously described a nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle (NO-np) with efficacy against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter baumannii in vitro and in murine wound and abscess models. Although the prior findings suggest that the NO-np can be a useful therapeutic for skin and soft tissue infections, the antimicrobial spectrum of NO-np has yet to be fully elucidated. In the current study, we investigated the efficacy of a NO-np against several Gram-positive and -negative clinical isolates. We found that the NO-np were uniformly active against all of the Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates examined, including strains that were both sensitive and resistant to commonly used antibiotics. We concluded that the NO-np have the potential to serve as a novel broad spectrum antimicrobial agent.
TI  - The microbiology of secondary and postoperative pancreatic infections: implications for antimicrobial management.
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: We reviewed our experience with secondary pancreatic infections with  a focus on preemptive intervention and the potential alteration of the recovered microbial flora. The pathogens associated with postoperative pancreatic infections were analyzed with respect to nonenteric organisms, if any, that were recovered. We hypothesized that our findings might alter the antimicrobial management of these patients. DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Hospitals affiliated with the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis. PATIENTS: Patients developing secondary and postoperative pancreatic infections following severe acute pancreatitis. METHODS: Factors examined relative to secondary pancreatitis included preoperative antibiotic use and antecedent extrapancreatic infections potentially implicated in seeding the pancreatic bed. Patients who had elective resection received 24 to 48 hours of antibiotic prophylaxis. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients required surgery for secondary infections following severe acute pancreatitis, with 29 pathogenic isolates being recovered. Of these 22 patients, 14 received vancomycin hydrochloride prior to surgical intervention. Of those 14 patients, 6 had isolates recovered at the time of surgery that were positive for Enterococcus faecalis and 5 of these isolates were vancomycin resistant. Eight of the 22 patients received antifungal prophylaxis with no fungi recovered from intraoperative culture. However, 2 of the 14 patients who did not receive empiric therapy had isolates that were positive for fungi. Five patients who required an urgent operation for sepsis had pathogenic isolates that were similar to those recovered from central lines. Postoperative infections occurred in 40 of 225 patients (17.8%) who had an elective pancreatic resection, with 72 pathogenic isolates being recovered. Of these 40 patients, 22 (55.0%) had polymicrobial infections. Of the 72 pathogenic isolates recovered from patients, 34 (47.2%) were gram-positive organisms, 15 (20.8%) were fungal organisms, and 17 (23.6%) were drug-resistant bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged vancomycin use in patients with severe acute pancreatitis is associated with the acquisition of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Empiric antifungal therapy may reduce the incidence of secondary fungal pancreatic infections. Systemic bloodstream infections at extrapancreatic sites can lead to seeding of pancreatic pseudocysts. Postoperative infections frequently include gram-positive, fungal, and drug-resistant organisms, and empiric therapy directed at these pathogens should be utilized until definitive culture results are obtained.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of MX-2401, an expanded-spectrum lipopeptide active in the presence of lung surfactant.
AB  - MX-2401 is an expanded-spectrum lipopeptide antibiotic selective for Gram-positive bacteria that is a semisynthetic analog of the naturally occurring lipopeptide amphomycin. It was active against Enterococcus spp., including vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus (VSE), vanA-, vanB-, and vanC-positive vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), linezolid- and quinupristin-dalfopristin-resistant isolates (MIC(90) of 4 mug/ml), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) (MIC(90) of 2 mug/ml), coagulase-negative staphylococci, including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) (MIC(90) of 2 mug/ml), and Streptococcus spp. including viridans group streptococci, and penicillin-resistant, penicillin-sensitive, penicillin-intermediate and macrolide-resistant isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) of 2 mug/ml). MX-2401 demonstrated a dose-dependent postantibiotic effect varying from 1.5 to 2.4 h. Furthermore, MX-2401 was rapidly bactericidal at 4 times the MIC against S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, with more than 99.9% reduction in viable bacterial attained at 4 and 24 h, respectively. The MICs of MX-2401 against MRSA, MSSA, VSE, and VRE strains serially exposed for 15 passages to sub- to supra-MICs of MX-2401 remained within three dilutions of the original MIC. In contrast to that of the lipopeptide daptomycin, the antibacterial activity of MX-2401 was not affected in vitro by the presence of lung surfactant, and MX-2401 was active in vivo in the bronchial-alveolar pneumonia mouse model, in which daptomycin failed to show any activity. Moreover, the activity of MX-2401 was not as strongly dependent on the Ca(2+) concentration as is the activity of daptomycin. In conclusion, MX-2401 is a promising new-generation lipopeptide for the treatment of serious infections with Gram-positive bacteria, including hospital-acquired pneumonia.
TI  - Eight-year (2002-2009) summary of the linezolid (Zyvox(R) Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum; ZAAPS) program in European countries.
AB  - The linezolid surveillance network (ZAAPS program) has been monitoring linezolid  activity and susceptibility rates for eight years (2002-2009) in european medical centers. Samples from 12-24 sites annually in 11 countries were monitored by a central laboratory design using reference MIC methods with international and regional interpretations (EUCAST). A total of 13,404 gram-positive pathogens were tested from 6 pathogen groups. Linezolid remained without documented resistance from 2002 through 2005, but beginning in 2006 resistant strains emerged at very low rates among Staphylococcus aureus (G2576T mutant in ireland, 2007), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; usually Staphylococcus epidermidis, France and Italy in 2006-2009) and enterococci (Enterococcus faecium in Germany [2006, 2008, 2009] and E. faecalis in Sweden [2008], United Kingdom [2008] and Germany [2009]); all but one strain having a target mutation. A mobile cfr was detected in an italian CoNS strain (2008 and 2009), and clonal spread was noted for linezolid-resistant strains (PFGE results). Overall the linezolid susceptibility rates were >99.9, 99.7 and 99.6% for S. aureus, CoNS and enterococci, respectively; and all streptococcal strains were susceptible (MIC(90), 1 mg/l). In conclusion, the ZAAPS program surveillance confirmed high, sustained levels of linezolid activity from 2002-2009 and without evidence of MIC creep or escalating resistance in gram-positive pathogens across monitored european nations.
TI  - Cytotoxic and antimicrobial activity of pseudopterosins and seco-pseudopterosins  isolated from the octocoral Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae of San Andres and Providencia Islands (Southwest Caribbean Sea).
AB  - To expand the potential of pseudopterosins and seco-pseudopterosins isolated from the octocoral Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae of San Andres and Providencia islands (southwest Caribbean Sea), we report the anti-microbial profile against four pathogenic microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans) and report a more complete cytotoxic profile against five human cells lines (HeLa, PC-3, HCT116, MCF-7 and BJ) for the compounds PsG, PsP, PsQ, PsS, PsT, PsU, 3-O-acetyl-PsU, seco-PsJ, seco-PsK and IMNGD. For the cytotoxic profiles, all compounds evaluated showed moderate and non-selective activity against both tumor and normal cell lines, where PsQ and PsG were the most active compounds (GI(5)(0) values between 5.8 muM to 12.0 muM). With respect to their anti-microbial activity the compounds showed good and selective activity against the Gram-positive bacteria, while they did not show activity against the Gram-negative bacterium or yeast. PsU, PsQ, PsS, seco-PsK and PsG were the most active compounds (IC(5)(0) 2.9-4.5 muM) against S. aureus and PsG, PsU and seco-PsK showed good activity (IC(5)(0) 3.1-3.8 muM) against E. faecalis, comparable to the reference drug vancomycin (4.2 muM).
TI  - [Bacterial strains isolated from systemic infections and reported for evaluation  and antibiotic resistance surveillance by the "Dr. Victor Babes" Clinical Hospital for Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Bucharest].
AB  - AIM: Testing antibiotic resistance of bacterial strains (compulsor, reported for  EARSS surveillance) isolated from patients hospitalised for systemic infection in the "Dr. V. Babe" Hospital for Infectious and Tropical Diseases during 01.01.2005-11.11.2009, for a dynamic evaluation and for the surveillance of resistance emergence for certain classes of antibiotics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bacterial isolation: BacT/ALERT system; strain identification in classic and automated system (ATB Expression. VITEK 2C): antibioresistance: disk-difussion method (NCCLS 2005--CLSI 2009), MIC (E-Test, ATB/ Expression, VITEK 2C). Screening of ESBL-producing strains performed with double disk-difussion method (DDD). Reference strains used: S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619, E. coli A TCC 25922, Enterococcus fiecalis ATCC 29212. RESULTS: During the studied period, 245 bacterial strains have been isolated, identified and tested (Staphylococcus aureus / 70, Streptococcus pneumoniae / 61, Enterococcus faecalis / 18, Enterococcus faecium / 5, Neisseria meningitidis / 18, E. coli / 73). out of 166 hemocultures and 79 cerebrospinal fluids / CSF. The average incidence of MRSA strains in systemic infections was 34.28%. 44.28% of the S. aureus strains were resistant to erythromycin, 17.14% to cyprofloxacyne, 15.71% to rifampicine, 14.49% to gentamycine. No strain resistant to vancomycine and linezolide. Streptococcus pneumoniae presented an average high resistance to penicillin G of 11.47%. and a 1.63% resistance to third generation cephalosporines. 0% resistance to vancomycine and rifampicine. 7/ 18 Enterococcus faecalis strains and 4/5 Enterococcus faecium strains presented high level resistance to gentamycine (CN 120 microg/disk) and no strain was resistant to vancomycine, teicoplanin or linezolid. The 18 Neisseria meningitidis strains were all sensitive to beta-lactams, macrolides, fluoroquinolones and cloramphenicol. For the 73 Escherichia coli strains, the average incidence of ESBL-producing isolates was 10.95%, the average resistance to ampicillin was 58.90%, to gentamycine--13.88% and to cyprofloxacin--20.83%. No strain resistant to carbapenemes and amikacine. CONCLUSIONS: For the systematic surveillance of antibiotic resistance there is a need for a harmonised protocol of data gathering and strain selection and the rigurous implementation of correct evaluating methods for antibiotic resistance in the microbiology laboratory. Carbapenemes. glycopeptides and oxazolidinones still present a major effectiveness in the first intention treatment of systemic infections.
TI  - [Trends of antimicrobial resistance in microbial strains isolated from invasive infections in Romania. Experience of participation in EARSS (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System), 2002-2008].
AB  - EARSS (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System) is the biggest antimicrobial resistance surveillance project in the world financed from public finds, aiming to provide validated and comparable official data on antimicrobial resistance of invasive microbial strains (isolated from blood and CSF), belonging to 6 indicator bacterial species, i.e.: S. aureus, E. coli, E. faecium/faecalis, Str. pneumoniae, Ps. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae. Romania reported data to EARSS since 2002 so far. Though the number of participating laboratories increased progressively from 12 to 35, the number of hospitals which reported for EARSS. as the number of strains included in the data base remained steady and relatively low. This issue is related to the particular position of Romania in the European context, in respect of the very low number of blood cultures performed in hospitals. Our paper is presenting the trends of antimicrobial resistance in the indicator strains in the 2002-2008 interval. During the 2002-2008 interval, Romania reported to EARSS a total number of 1276 bacterial strains, distributed by species as follows: 513 S aureus, 369 E. coli, 128 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 127 Enterococcus spp.. 71 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 68 Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were reported, according to the EARSS protocol, only for the 2005-2008 interval. It is difficult to describe trends, specially in Enterococcus, Streptococcus pneumonaie and the 2 species collected only since 2005, because of the low number of isolates, but there are several results that are supporting us to claim that antimicrobial resistance in invasive isolates is a real problem in Romanian hospitals, like in other Central, Southern and South Eastern European countries: more than 25% of S. aureus strains resistant to methicilline, with more than 50% in some years, high aminoglycozides resistance in more than 70-80% of Enterococcus faecium invasive strains, more than 80% of strains resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporines etc.
TI  - [Antibiotic resistance of Gram-positive cocci isolated in 2008].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Antibiotic resistance evaluation of Gram-positive cocci isolated in 2008. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed for 1044 strains: 610 Staphylococcus aureus (352 from patients, 258 from carriers), 203 Streptococcus pneumoniae (53 from patients, 150 from carriers), 144 Enterococcus faecalis. 57 Enterococcus faecium and 30 Streptococcus spp. using automatic systems Vitek 2 Compact. MicroScan, disc diffusion method and Etest according to 2008 CLSI. A number of 497 Streptococcus pyogenes strains were tested for eritromycin resistance. RESULTS: There were 33.2% MRSA for strains isolated from patients and 30.0% from carriers. From MRSA strains. 35.5% were resistant to gentamicin. 33.6% to ciprofloxacin, 74.3% to erythromycin and 30.5% to rifampin. There were no S. aureus strain resistant to vancomycin and linezolid. S. aureus strains isolated from wounds were more resistant to erythromycin (43.9%) than the strains isolated from systemic infections (12.1%). From 11 S. pneumoniae strains isolated from meningitis, 4 were resistant to penicillin. Neither S. pneumoniae strain isolated from other infections, nor those from carriers had MIC to penicillin more than 4 microg/ml. S. pneumoniae strains isolated from carriers were more resistant to erythromycin. clindamycin and tetracycline than the strains isolated from patients (66.7%, 54.1%, 54.2% vs. 27.4%, 22.6%, 33.9%). E. faecium was 95.9% resistant to penicillin, 90.2% to ampicillin, 64.7% to gentamicin, 72.0% to streptomycin and 78.4% to ciprofloxacin. F. faecalis was less resistant than E. faecium at most of the antibiotics: 32.4% to gentamicin, 59.6% to streptomycin, 28.5% to ciprofloxacin. Viridans group Streptococci, all isolated from blood culture were 92% susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin. To erythromycin, 12% of viridians group Streptococci were resistant. S. pyogenes resistance to eritromycin was 5.8%. CONCLUSIONS: S. aureus strains showed a relatively high level of resistance to oxacillin (33.2%) and resistance in the same time to several antibiotics. S. pneumoniae can not be considered resistant to penicillin administrated parenteral, with exception of the strains isolated from meningitis. E. faecium had a higher resistance rate than E. faecalis.
TI  - N-Benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines are a New Class of Bacterial DNA Gyrase Inhibitors.
AB  - This paper characterizes N-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines (gyramides) as DNA gyrase inhibitors. Gyramide A was previously shown to exhibit antimicrobial activity that suggested it inhibited bacterial cell division. In this study, we conducted target identification studies and identified DNA gyrase as the primary target of gyramide A. The gyramide A resistance-determining region in DNA gyrase is adjacent to the DNA cleavage gate and is a new site for inhibitor design. We studied the antibiotic effects of gyramides A-C in combination with the Gram-negative efflux pump inhibitor MC-207,110 (60 muM). The gyramides had a minimum inhibitory concentration of 10-40 muM against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae; the compounds were ineffective against Enterococcus faecalis. The IC(50) of gyramides A-C against E. coli DNA gyrase was 0.7- 3.3 muM. The N-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines described in this manuscript represent a starting point for development of antibiotics that bind a new site in DNA gyrase.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of daptomycin and comparator agents tested against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci: trend analysis of a 6-year period in US medical centers (2005-2010).
AB  - We evaluated daptomycin activity trends against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE; MIC, >/=8 mug/mL) in a 6-year period (2005-2010) following US regulatory release for clinical use. Consecutive, unique patient strains of clinical significance were collected in 32 US medical centers and susceptibility tested in a central laboratory against daptomycin and various comparator agents by reference broth microdilution methods. A total of 22 858 S. aureus (12 181 [53.3%] MRSA), 4312 Enterococcus faecalis (195 [4.5%] VRE), and 2462 Enterococcus faecium (1867 [75.8%] VRE) were evaluated. Daptomycin susceptibility rates were 99.94%, 99.98%, and 99.68% for S. aureus, E. faecalis, and E. faecium, respectively. Among MRSA (daptomycin MIC(5)(0)/(9)(0), 0.25/0.5 mug/mL), only 13 (0.11%) daptomycin-non-susceptible (MIC, >/= 2 mug/mL) isolates were observed with no MIC creep over the study interval. Daptomycin was very active against vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (MIC(5)(0)/(9)(0), 1/2 mug/mL) and E. faecium (MIC(5)(0)/(9)(0), 2/2 mug/mL). Among VRE, only 4 daptomycin-non-susceptible isolates (all E. faecium) were detected. In conclusion, daptomycin demonstrated sustained activity against an extensive collection of clinical isolates of MRSA and VRE from numerous US medical centers over the last 6 monitored years.
TI  - Acquisition of VanB-type vancomycin resistance by Bacillus subtilis: the impact on gene expression, cell wall composition and morphology.
AB  - The vancomycin resistance operons from Enterococci, Staphylococci and Actinomycetes encode a VanRS two-component signal transduction system (TCS) and a suite of enzymes to modify the peptidoglycan biosynthetic precursor lipid II and to eliminate the D-Ala-D-Ala from the cell. Commingling of these regulatory and enzymatic activities with host functions has the potential to significantly impact host gene expression and cell wall metabolism. Here we report the effects of individually expressing the VanR(B) S(B) TCS and the VanY(B) WH(B) BX(B) resistance proteins in Bacillus subtilis. VanY(B) WH(B) BX(B) expression confers resistance to 2 microg ml(-1) of vancomycin with concomitant reduced Van-FL staining and leads to a cell division defect. In contrast to E. faecalis and S. aureus, VanS(B) is active in B. subtilis without vancomycin addition. Individual expression of the VanR(B) S(B) TCS and the VanY(B) WH(B) BX(B) resistance proteins repress and increase, respectively, expression of PhoPR regulon genes in the phosphate-limited state. When vancomycin-resistant cells are exposed to elevated vancomycin levels, mutant strains with increased resistance to vancomycin and a growth dependency on vanY(B) WH(B) BX(B) expression frequently arise. Mutation of the endogenous Ddl ligase is the necessary and sufficient cause of both phenotypes. We discuss how these effects may influence establishment of van operons in new host bacteria.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing on burn wound isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the antimicrobial effectiveness of a silver alginate dressing  on opportunistic pathogens, namely meticillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter sakazakii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Chryseobacterium indologenes, Proteus vulgaris and Acinetobacter baumannii. METHOD: In total, 40 microorganisms were isolated from patients attending three burn centres in the US and evaluated for their susceptibility to a silver alginate wound dressing, employing a corrected zone of inhibition assay, conducted on Mueller Hinton agar (MHA). RESULTS: The sizes of the corrected zones of inhibition varied between and within genera. For example, all Acinetobacter baumannii strains were found to be sensitive to ionic silver at pH 7, with a mean of 2.8mm, compared with 3.5mm at pH 5.5. The silver alginate dressing also demonstrated activity on all strains of Enterobacter and Escherichia coli, with susceptibility to the silver alginate dressing enhanced at pH 5.5. For Enterococcus spp. the average corrected zone of inhibition at pH 7 was 3.6mm, versus 4.9mm at pH 5.5. All strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found to be sensitive to the silver alginate dressing. The average corrected zone of inhibition was 6.9mm at pH 7, compared with 8mm at pH 5.5. For MRSA and Staphylococcus aureus, it ranged from 4.5mm to 7.5mm at pH 7. When the pH was decreased to 5.5, the corrected zone of inhibition increased. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the activity of a silver alginate dressing on a wide range of burn isolates, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria, isolated from three different burn centres in the US. It also highlights the possible importance of pH and its potential effects on antimicrobial performance and microbial susceptibility. However, more extensive testing is required to substantiate this.

TI  - Lactobacillus fermentum isolated from human colonic mucosal biopsy inhibits the growth and adhesion of enteric and foodborne pathogens.
AB  - A number of Lactobacillus species are used as probiotic strains in order to benefit health. We have isolated L. fermentum from human colonic mucosal biopsy samples that possess antimicrobial activities against entroinvasive and foodborne pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella paratyphi A, Shigella sonnei, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio sp. In addition to lactic acid, L. fermentum secretes antimicrobial proteinacious compound(s) that was found to be active even at neutral pH (pH 7.0). The compound was sensitive to heat treatment and trypsin digestion. Lactobacillus fermentum inhibited the adhesion of enteropathogens to intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. Isolated cell surface associated proteins (SAPs) from L. fermentum were sufficient for the adhesion exclusions of enteropathogenic E. coli. Our results indicate that L. fermentum produces antimicrobial compounds and SAPs to inhibit the growth and adhesion of enteropathogens, respectively.
TI  - A family of multicyclic indolosesquiterpenes from a bacterial endophyte.
AB  - Three novel indolosesquiterpenes, xiamycin B (1b), indosespene (2), and sespenine (3), along with the known xiamycin A (1a) were isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces sp. HKI0595, a bacterial endophyte of the widespread mangrove tree Kandelia candel. Agar diffusion assays revealed moderate to strong antimicrobial activities against several bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, while no cytotoxicity against human tumor cell lines was observed. Together with the previously reported oridamycin, the endophyte metabolites represent the first indolosesquiterpenes isolated from prokaryotes.
TI  - Antimicrobial effectiveness of different preparations of calcium hydroxide.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intracanal medicaments have an antibacterial effect on the root canal flora. The effectiveness of such vehicles has to be tested and substantiated against the normal bacterial flora. The various vehicles that were tested for their effectiveness were commercially prepared calcium hydroxide (Metapex), saline, glycerine, CMCP, and Rexidine-M gel. The bacterial cultures tested for sensitivity were aerobes (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, Streptococcus pyogens, Enterococcus faecalis), anaerobes (Lactobacillus, Bacteroides melaninogenicus) and a commonly found fungus (Candida albicans). One hundred and twenty-five samples were divided into five experimental groups consisting of 21 samples each and one control group of the same size. AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the influence of four different vehicles on the effectiveness of calcium hydroxide against the commonly found aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in endodontic infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The samples were taken and transported using standardized techniques and pure growth of each bacterium was isolated. Petri dishes were prepared for the various calcium hydroxide combinations for each bacterium and incubated. The inhibition zone was recorded at three intervals of 24, 96 and 168 hours. Results were tabulated and sent for statistical analysis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: It was seen that calcium hydroxide and CMCP combination showed the maximum zone of inhibition, and maximum inhibitory effect was seen at 24 hours. The bacteria most susceptible was found to be S. aureus and the least susceptible was E. faecalis. Further clinical studies are required to substantiate these results.
TI  - Rapid identification of bacteria with a disposable colorimetric sensing array.
AB  - Rapid identification of both species and even specific strains of human pathogenic bacteria grown on standard agar has been achieved from the volatiles they produce using a disposable colorimetric sensor array in a Petri dish imaged with an inexpensive scanner. All 10 strains of bacteria tested, including Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus and their antibiotic-resistant forms, were identified with 98.8% accuracy within 10 h, a clinically important time frame. Furthermore, the colorimetric sensor arrays also proved useful as a simple research tool for the study of bacterial metabolism and as an easy method for the optimization of bacterial production of fine chemicals or other fermentation processes.
TI  - In vitro activity and in vivo efficacy of the saponin diosgenyl 2-amino-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranoside hydrochloride (HSM1) alone and in combination with daptomycin and vancomycin against Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Surgical site infections are the second most common hospital- and community-acquired Gram-positive infections, with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimating that about 500 000 surgical site infections occur annually in the USA. The aim of this work was to determine the in vitro activity of the saponin diosgenyl 2-amino-2-deoxy-beta-d-glucopyranoside hydrochloride (HSM1) and its bactericidal effect for a large number of Gram-positive cocci, as well as to investigate its in vitro interaction with seven clinically used antibiotics. In vivo, a wound model was established through the panniculus carnosus of BALB/c mice and then inoculated with 5x10(7) c.f.u. Staphylococcus aureus or Enterococcus faecalis. For each bacterial strain, the study included an infected or non-infected group that did not receive any treatment, a group treated with local HSM1, a group treated with intraperitoneal vancomycin, a group treated with intraperitoneal daptomycin and two groups that received HSM1 local treatment plus intraperitoneal vancomycin or daptomycin. All isolates were inhibited by HSM1 at concentrations of 2-32 mg l(-1). Synergy was demonstrated when HSM1 was combined with vancomycin and daptomycin. In in vivo studies, all groups treated with single drugs showed a statistically significant result compared with the control group. The two groups treated with drug combinations showed the highest antimicrobial efficacy. The good in vitro activities and the in vivo efficacy suggest HSM1 as a promising therapeutic candidate in Gram-positive wound infections.
TI  - Microflora in maxillofacial infections--a changing scenario?
AB  - PURPOSE: Advances in isolation and culturing techniques have brought the role of  anaerobic bacteria-causing maxillofacial infections to the fore. Recent literature also favors the role of anaerobes in maxillofacial infections. A prospective clinical and microbiological study was designed to check the validity of such claims. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 88 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Pus was obtained by aspirating the involved spaces and culture and sensitivity tests were performed to determine the microbes involved and their sensitivity to various antibiotics. RESULTS: Upon isolating the various organisms causing infection, it was found that 68.2% were aerobes, 13.6% were mixed infections, and 9.1% were anaerobes. Streptococcus and Peptostreptococcus species were the most common among aerobes and anaerobes, respectively. On determining sensitivity to penicillin, 81.3% were sensitive and 18.8% were resistant. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Staphylococcus aureus were predominantly resistant to penicillin. CONCLUSION: Analysis of the results indicated no change in microflora-causing infections in the maxillofacial region and penicillin remains the drug of choice in treating these infections.
TI  - Prevalence of plasmid mediated pesticide resistant bacterial assemblages in crop  fields.
AB  - Three crop fields namely paddy sugarcane and tomato exposed to bavistin [Methyl (1H-benzimidazol-2-yl) carbomate], monocrotophos[Dimethyl(E)-1-methyl-2-(methyl-carbamoyl) vinyl phosphate] and kinado plus [(EZ)-2-chloro-3-dimethoxyphosphinoyloxy-X1, X1-diethylbut-2-enamide], respectively were chosen for the present investigation to know the bacterial population and degradation of pesticides. The chemical nature of the soil and water samples from the pesticide contaminated fields was analysed along with counting of the total heterotrophic bacteria (THB), Staphylococci and Enterococcci population. Mean calcium, phosphate and biological oxygen demand were maximum in tomato field water Field water recorded maximum phophate and silicate content, whereas, sugarcane field water elicited maximum dissolved oxygen content. On the other hand, available phosphate and exchangeable potassium were maximum is sugarcane field soil. Significant variations in the bacterial population were evident between the treatments in sugarcane field soil and tomato field water exposed to monocrotophos and kinado plus, respectively In addition, significant variations between THB, Staphlyococci and Enterococci population were also evinced in both the sugarcane andtomato fields. The dominant pesticide resistant bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeuroginosa harboured plasmids and the resistant trait observed were found to be plasmid borne.
TI  - Global in vitro activity of tigecycline and linezolid against Gram-positive organisms collected between 2004 and 2009.
AB  - This study reports the antimicrobial activity of tigecycline and comparator antimicrobials, including linezolid, against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium collected as part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) between 2004 and 2009. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using broth microdilution methodology according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined according to CLSI criteria. For tigecycline, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved criteria were used. Overall, 41.3% (8249/19 982) of S. aureus collected were meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). All MRSA were susceptible to linezolid and 99.98% were susceptible to tigecycline. A total of 2.3% of E. faecalis (201/8576) and 39.7% of E. faecium (1226/3088) were vancomycin-resistant. Linezolid and tigecycline MIC(90) values (MIC at which 90% of isolates inhibited) against the Enterococcus spp. were 2mg/L and </= 0.25 mg/L, respectively. All S. pneumoniae [including 6.2% (599/9618) penicillin-non-susceptible] were susceptible to linezolid and vancomycin; tigecycline MIC(90) values were </= 0.12 mg/L. This report demonstrates the continuing good activity of tigecycline and linezolid against Gram-positive isolates globally, including resistant organisms such as MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, with antimicrobial activity maintained over the 6 years of isolate collection.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of 7-(3-alkoxyimino-4-amino-4-methylpiperidin-1-yl) fluoroquinolone derivatives.
AB  - A series of novel 7-(3-alkoxyimino-4-amino-4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)fluoroquinolone derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity. All of the target compounds have potent antibacterial activity against the tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains, and exhibit good potency in inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA, Staphylococcus epidermidis including MRSE and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MICs: 0.125-4 mug/mL). Compound 22, with the best activity against Gram-positive strains, is 4-16 fold more potent than gemifloxacin, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin against Enterococcus faecalis, and 16- and 4-fold more potent than levofloxacin against S. epidermidis 09-6 and S. pneumoniae 08-4, respectively.
TI  - [Tolerance and heteroresistance in Gram-positive microorganisms].
AB  - During the last few years, insufficient efficacy of currently recommended antimicrobial agents has been observed, mainly in the case of glycopeptides, during the treatment of infections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, even if these isolates show MIC values within the susceptible range. The phenomena associated with this observation are tolerance (a genetic event in which a bactericidal antibiotic fails to kill a bacterial population), persistence (a non-inherited and transient phenotypic phenomenon in which a bacterial subpopulation -0.1%-10%- survive lethal antimicrobial concentrations irrespective of the mechanisms of action) and heteroresistance (an epigenetic event in which less susceptible isogenic subpopulations are recovered when the entire population is challenged with concentrations exceeding MIC values). New antimicrobials, including daptomycin, are less affected by these phenomena and should be considered as the treatment of choice when these events are demonstrated or suspected.
TI  - Identification of an N-terminal formylated, two-peptide bacteriocin from Enterococcus faecalis 710C.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis 710C, isolated from beef product, has a broad antimicrobial activity spectrum against foodborne pathogens. Two bacteriocins, enterocin 7A (Ent7A) and enterocin 7B (Ent7B), were purified from the culture supernatant of E. faecalis 710C and characterized using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and electrospray infusion tandem mass spectrometry analyses. These data and subsequent genetic analysis showed that Ent7A and Ent7B are produced without N-terminal leader sequences and have amino acid sequences that are identical to those of enterocins MR10A and MR10B, respectively. However, the observed masses for Ent7A and Ent7B are 5200.80 and 5206.65 Da (monoisotopic mass), respectively, which are higher than the theoretical molecular masses of MR10A and MR10B, respectively. This study provides evidence that both Ent7A and Ent7B are formylated on the N-terminal methionine residue. Purified Ent7A and Ent7B are active against spoilage microorganisms and foodborne pathogens, including Clostridium sporogenes , Listeria monocytogenes , and Staphylococcus aureus as well as Brevundimonas diminuta , which has been associated with infections among immune-suppressed cancer patients.
TI  - The challenges of antimicrobial resistance in Brazil.
AB  - Brazil is a country with continental proportions with high geographic and economic diversity. Despite its medical centers of excellence, antimicrobial resistance poses a major therapeutic challenge. Rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus are up to 60% and are related to an endemic Brazilian clone. Local resistance to vancomycin in Enterococci was first related to Enterococcus faecalis, which differs from European and American epidemiology. Also, local Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases have a much higher prevalence (40%-50% and 10%-18%, respectively). Carbapenem resistance among the enterobacteriaceae group is becoming a major problem, and K. pneumoniae carbapenemase isolates have been reported in different states. Among nonfermenters, carbapenem resistance is strongly related to SPM-1 (Pseudomonasaeruginosa) and OXA-23 (Acinetobacter baumannii complex) enzymes, and a colistin-only susceptible phenotype has also emerged in these isolates, which is worrisome. Local actions without loosing the global resistance perspective will demand multidisciplinary actions, new policies, and political engagement.
TI  - Short-term antimicrobial properties of mineral trioxide aggregate with incorporated silver-zeolite.
AB  - The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether adding silver-zeolite (SZ) to mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) would enhance the antimicrobial activity of MTA against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC #25923), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC #29212), Escherichia coli (ATCC#25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC #27853), Candida albicans (ATCC #90028), Porphyromonas gingivalis (ATCC #33277), Actinomyces israelii (ATCC #12102), and Prevotella intermedia (ATCC# 15032). SZ was added at 0.2% and 2% mass fraction concentration to MTA powder. The control group was MTA powder with no SZ. The antimicrobial effect test was accomplished by placing freshly mixed MTA specimens on agar plates inoculated with microorganisms and comparing the zones of inhibition at 24, 48, and 72 h. The amounts of silver ion release from MTA specimens were measured with atomic absorption spectrophotometry at 10-min, 24-, 48-, and 72-h periods. The pH of MTA specimens was measured with a pH meter at 10-min, 24-, 48-, and 72-h periods. MTA with 2% and 0.2% SZ specimens showed inhibitory effects on some microorganisms at all time periods, whereas no antimicrobial activity showed for P. intermedia and A. israelii. MTA without SZ inhibited C. albicans, E. Coli, and P. intermedia. The highest silver release was detected in 2% SZ MTA at 24 h. The incorporation of SZ may enhance the antimicrobial activity of MTA.
TI  - Urine cultures from indwelling bladder catheters in nursing home patients: a point prevalence study in a Swedish county.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To survey the bacterial flora and antibiotic resistance in urinary strains from patients with indwelling bladder catheters residing in nursing homes within a geographically defined region. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Urine was sampled for culture from 163 catheter patients (126 men and 37 women) during a 2 week period in March 2010. Susceptibility testing of the isolated bacteria was compared with all urinary strains (n = 9994) from hospitals and primary healthcare in the same geographical area cultured during the first 6 months of 2010 (control group). RESULTS: Bacteriuria was found in 159 of 163 urine samples (98%). Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli were the most common species, one or both being detected in 72% of the urine samples, while Proteus species were found in10% and a single isolate of Providentia species was seen.Strains in the study patients were more resistant to antibiotics than in the control group. Particularly large differences were noted for ciprofloxacinin in E. coli (16.9% vs 7.9%) and for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in E. faecalis (39.1% vs 24.8%). One extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli was cultured (1.3%), compared with 1.6% in the control group. No vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Proteus mirabilis and Providentia species were rarely isolated, in sharp contrast to previous studies from geriatric hospital wards where they have often been in the majority. The limited incidence of ESBL and the absence of VRE and MRSA is gratifying, but the high resistance to antibiotics needs to be assessed on a continuous basis.
TI  - Evaluating the In-vitro Antibacterial Effect of Iranian Propolis on Oral Microorganisms.
AB  - Propolis has traditionally been used in curing infections and healing wounds and  burns. Current researches have shown that propolis has antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral actions however, the pharmacological activity of propolis is highly variable depending on its geographic origin. There have been few studies on the effects of Iranian propolis on the oral microorganisms. In this in-vitro study, the antimicrobial activity of the ethanolic and water extracts of the Iranian propolis (10%, w/v) from north-east area of Tehran was evaluated. Susceptibility of the oral strains tested (Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668; Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 9222; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 9854 and Lactobacillus casei ATCC 39392) was evaluated using the agar diffusion method at a concentration of 20 mg/mL of propolis and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. Antibacterial activity was determined by using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) at different concentrations of propolis. The ethanolic extract showed bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against all the strains, with MIC and MBC ranges of 250-500 microg/mL. The MIC concentration of the water extract was 500 microg/mL against S. mutans and E. faecalis. The water extract showed bactericidal activity only against S. mutans (20 mg/mL). These results indicate that the ethanolic extract is probably more useful in the control of oral biofilms and subsequent dental caries development. However, to determine the consequence of the ethanolic extract of Iranian propolis on the oral mucosa, in-vivo studies of its possible effects are needed.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Greek endemic Stachys spruneri and its main component, isoabienol.
AB  - The essential oils of Stachys spruneri Boiss. (sample A and sample B) were analyzed by GC and GC-MS. (+)-Isoabienol was the dominant component (49.5 and 48.2%, respectively of the total oils) among seventy-two identified constituents. Isoabienol was separated, purified by preparative thin-layer chromatography, and further identified by means ofphysicochemical and spectrometric analysis. The microbial growth inhibitory properties of the essential oil and its main metabolite, the labdane diterpene isoabienol, were determined using the broth microdilution method against eight laboratory strains of bacteria (Gram-positive: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Gram- negative: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and two strains of the yeast Candida albicans. Both essential oil and isoabienol showed considerable activity against all the microorganisms tested, with the isolated compound being most active.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic Gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2006].
AB  - The activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic Gram-positive cocci (26 species, 1022 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (23 species, 184 strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2006 at 16 clinical facilities in Japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. The ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was 53.0% and 65.8%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. Vancomycin (VCM) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (QPR/DPR) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, with MIC90s of < or = 2 micrcog/mL. The ratio of penicillin (PC) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of PC-binding proteins among Streptococcus pneumoniae was 87.6%. Ceftriaxone, cefpirome, cefepime, carbapenem antibiotics, VCM, teicoplanin, linezolid(LZD) and QPR/DPR had MIC90s of < or = 1 microg/mL against PC-intermediate and resistant S. pneumoniae strains. Against all strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, the MICs of VCM and TEIC were under 2 microg/mL, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 10.9% of E. faecalis strains or 3.5% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to LZD. 24.4% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to QPR/DPR. Against all strains of Clostridium difficile, the MIC of VCM were under 1 microg/mL, suggesting that VCM had excellent activity against C. difficile. Carbapenems showed good activity against Peptococcaceae, Bacteroides spp., and Prevotella spp. However since several strains of Bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems and the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future.
TI  - [In vitro activity of sitafloxacin against clinical isolates in 2009].
AB  - In vitro activity of sitafloxacin (STFX) and various oral antimicrobial agents against bacterial isolates recovered from clinical specimens between January and December 2009, at different healthcare facilities in Japan was evaluated. A total of 1,620 isolates including aerobic and anaerobic organisms was available for the susceptibility testing using the microbroth dilution methods recommended by Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute. The minimum inhibitory concentration of STFX at which 90% of isolates (MIC90) was 0.06 microg/mL for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and was equal to that of garenoxacin (GRNX), 2 times lower than that of moxifloxacin (MFLX), and 8 times lower than that of levofloxacin (LVFX). STFX inhibited the growth of all the isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 microg/mL or less. The MIC90s of STFX ranged from 0.03 to 0.06 microg/mL and were 1 to 2 times lower than those of GRNX, 2 to 4 times lower than those of MFLX, and 16 to 32 times lower than those of LVFX. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, the MIC90 of STFX was 0.06 microg/mL and was 2 times lower than that of GRNX, 4 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX was 0.25 microg/mL for Enterococcus faecalis, and was 2 times lower than those of GRNX and MFLX, and 8 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX for E. coli was 2 microg/mL, and the MIC90s of other 10 species of Enterobacteriaceae which were the lowest values of the quinolones tested ranged from 0.03 to 1 microg/mL. The MIC90 of STFX for Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates recovered from urinary infections was 8 microg/mL and was 16 times lower than those of GRNX, MFLX and LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX for P aeruginosa isolates recovered from respiratory infections was 2 microg/mL and was 32 times lower than those of GRNX and MFLX, and 16 times lower than that of LVFX. STFX inhibited the growth of all the isolates of Haemophilus influenzae at 0.004 microg/mL or less, and was 2 to 4 times lower than those of GRNX, 8 times lower than those of MFLX, and 4 times lower than those of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX was 0.008 microg/mL for Moraxella catarrhalis, and was 2 times lower than that of GRNX, 8 times lower than those of MFLX and LVFX. The MIC90s of STFX ranged from 0.015 to 0.12 microg/mL for all the species of anaerobic bacteria and were the lowest values of all the antimicrobial agents tested. In conclusion, the activity of STFX against Gram-positive cocci was comparable or superior to those of GRNX, MFLX and LVFX. STFX showed the most potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria of all the antimicrobial agents tested in this study.
TI  - Monitoring of multiple drug-resistant pathogens in a selected stretch of Bay of Bengal, India.
AB  - The present work aims at identification of multiple drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria in a selected stretch, namely, Puri on the Bay of Bengal, India. Six stations at the coast of Puri were selected and samples of water and sediment were collected during the winter of 2008 and 2009 for this study. Thirty-eight pathogenic bacteria were isolated and identified from both the water and the sediment of 6 fixed stations (PU-1a, PU-1b, PU-2, PU-3, PU-4, and PU-5). The identified pathogens were Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis. Antibiotic sensitivity of the isolated bacteria was studied by using 12 selected antibiotics, commonly used for the medication of human beings and animals. The isolated pathogens from both the water and the sediment samples showed lowest resistance to chloramphenicol (C-30 mug) where as the pathogens showed highest level of resistance to ampicillin (10-mug) among the antibiotics used for the study. Among the isolated pathogens E. faecalis (PU-1a), P. aeruginosa (PU-2 and PU-3), E. coli (PU-3 and PU-4), and K. pneumonia (PU-4) showed resistance to more than four antibiotics. Out of the isolated species, 57.8% pathogens were multi-drug resistant. Antibiotic resistance indexes of all the stations were calculated and found to be in the range of 0.066 to 0.083.
TI  - Spectrum of early-onset and late-onset bacteremias after liver transplantation: implications for management.
AB  - Bacteremia is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation. The characterization of the microbiological spectrum of bacteremia after liver transplantation may help physicians in choosing the initial empirical antimicrobial therapy for patients presenting with sepsis. The clinical and microbiology records of patients who received liver transplantation from January 1997 to March 2006 were reviewed. One hundred twenty-three of the 737 liver recipients (16.7%) developed bacteremia during the median follow-up period of 5.8 years (interquartile range = 2.5-8.8 years); 92 patients (12.5%) had gram-positive bacteremia (GPB), whereas 47 (6.4%) had gram-negative bacteremia (GNB). Nosocomial bacteremia was significantly more frequent among patients with early-onset GPB or GNB versus patients with late-onset GPB (66.7% versus 23.7%, P < 0.001) or GNB (70.6% versus 20.0%, P = 0.001). Peritonitis (33.3% versus 7.9%, P = 0.004) and wound infections (13.0% versus 0%, P = 0.04) as sources were more common in patients with early-onset GPB versus patients with late-onset GPB. Likewise, peritonitis was a more common source of early-onset GNB than late-onset GNB (41.2% versus 6.7%, P = 0.007). Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium were the most common pathogens in patients with early-onset GPB, whereas Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus species were most common in patients with late-onset GPB. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobes were the most common pathogens in patients with early-onset GNB, whereas Escherichia coli was most common in patients with late-onset GNB. In conclusion, the microbiological spectra of early-onset and late-onset bacteremias differ, and this should be considered by those determining the initial empirical treatment of liver transplant recipients suspected to have bacteremias.
TI  - Need for improved antimicrobial and infection control stewardship in Vietnamese intensive care units.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Survey of antibiotic consumption, microbial resistance and hygiene precautions in the intensive care units of three hospitals in northern Vietnam. METHODS: Observational study. Data were collected from the microbiological laboratories. Antibiotic consumption was determined based on quantities of drugs delivered from the pharmacy. A protocol to observe the application of hygiene precautions was developed and used. Bacteria were typed and tested for drug susceptibility using the disc-diffusion method. RESULTS: The mean antibiotic consumption was 811 defined daily doses per 1000 occupied bed days. The most commonly used antibiotics were third-generation cephalosporins, followed by carbapenems, amoxicillin and ampicillin. Eighty per cent of bacterial isolates were Gram-negative. The most common pathogens found in blood cultures were Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas spp. were the two most frequently isolated bacteria from the respiratory tract and all other sources together. Seventy per cent of Acinetobacter species showed reduced susceptibility to imipenem, 80% to ciprofloxacin and 89% to ceftazidime. Forty-four per cent of Pseudomonas spp. showed reduced susceptibility to imipenem, 49% to ciprofloxacin and 49% to ceftazidime. Escherichia coli was fully susceptible to imipenem, but 57% of samples were resistant to both ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime. Hygiene precautions were poor, and fewer than 50% of patient contacts incorporated appropriate hand hygiene. CONCLUSION: Low antibiotic consumption, poor hygiene precautions and the high level of antibiotic resistance indicate that there is room for improvement regarding antibiotic use and infection control.
TI  - Association of red complex, A. actinomycetemcomitans and non-oral bacteria with periodontal diseases.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pathogens related to systemic infections have been detected in the periodontal microbiota. The relationship amongst these pathogens, periodontal bacteria and periodontal clinical status is poorly understood. This study evaluated the association amongst red complex, A. actinomycetemcomitans (A.a) and non-oral pathogenic bacteria in subjects with good periodontal health (PH), gingivitis (G), chronic (CP) and aggressive (AP) periodontitis. METHODS: Subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 51 PH, 42 G, 219 CP and 90 AP subjects. The presence and levels of A.a, red complex (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola), Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus were determined by DNA probes and DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: CP and AP subjects presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of A.a, red complex and A. baumannii than G and PH individuals (p<0.01), whereas S. aureus was detected in lower frequency and counts in AP as compared to the other groups (p<0.001). The predictor variables age, prevalence of red complex, and the presence of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa were strongly associated with the frequency of sites with PD and CAL >/=5 mm. Increasing age (OR 1.08), high frequency of red complex (OR 6.10), and the presence of A.a with P. aeruginosa (OR 1.90) were associated with periodontal disease (p<0.001). Subjects harbouring a high prevalence of A.a, A. baumannii, and red complex with P. aeruginosa were more likely to have AP than CP (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Putative periodontal pathogens and non-oral bacteria alone or in association were strongly associated with periodontitis.
TI  - Prevalence and epidemiology of microbial pathogens causing bloodstream infections: results of the OASIS multicenter study.
AB  - Beginning on April 2007, a prospective multicenter study was performed to investigate prevalence and epidemiology of microbial pathogens causing bloodstream infections (BSIs). Twenty microbiology laboratories participated to the survey over a 1-year period. A total of 11,638 episodes of BSI occurred in 11 202 patients, with 8.5% (n=985) of episodes being polymicrobial. Of 12 781 causative organisms, aerobic Gram-negative bacteria were 47.4% (n=6058), whereas Gram-positives accounted for 43.9% (n=5608). The remaining organisms included fungal species (n=924, 7.2%) and anaerobes (n=191, 1.5%). The most prevalent agents were Escherichia coli (21.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (14.9%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.0%), and Enterococcus faecalis (6.3%). Isolates recovered from patients admitted to medical, surgical, and intensive care units accounted for 62.9%, 17.7%, and 19.4% of cases, respectively. BSIs were classified as hospital-acquired in 67.2% of cases. Compared with previous studies, our data show an increasing role of Gram-negative bacteria among both hospital- and community-acquired blood isolates.
TI  - Cytotoxicity, antiviral and antimicrobial activities of alkaloids, flavonoids, and phenolic acids.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Some natural products consisting of the alkaloids yohimbine and vincamine (indole-type), scopolamine and atropine (tropane-type), colchicine (tropolone-type), allantoin (imidazolidine-type), trigonelline (pyridine-type) as well as octopamine, synephrine, and capsaicin (exocyclic amine-type); the flavonoid derivatives quercetin, apigenin, genistein, naringin, silymarin, and silibinin; and the phenolic acids namely gallic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and quinic acid, were tested for their in vitro antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal activities and cytotoxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antiviral activity of the compounds was tested against DNA virus herpes simplex type 1 and RNA virus parainfluenza (type-3). Cytotoxicity of the compounds was determined using Madin-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines, and their cytopathogenic effects were expressed as maximum non-toxic concentration. Antibacterial activity was assayed against following bacteria and their isolated strains: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Bacillus subtilis, although they were screened by microdilution method against two fungi: Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis. RESULTS: Atropine and gallic acid showed potent antiviral effect at the therapeutic range of 0.8-0.05 microg ml(-1), whilst all of the compounds exerted robust antibacterial effect. CONCLUSION: Antiviral and antimicrobial effects of the compounds tested herein may constitute a preliminary step for further relevant studies to identify the mechanism of action.
TI  - Relative roles of the cellular and humoral responses in the Drosophila host defense against three gram-positive bacterial infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Two NF-kappaB signaling pathways, Toll and immune deficiency (imd), are required for survival to bacterial infections in Drosophila. In response to septic injury, these pathways mediate rapid transcriptional activation of distinct sets of effector molecules, including antimicrobial peptides, which are important components of a humoral defense response. However, it is less clear to what extent macrophage-like hemocytes contribute to host defense. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In order to dissect the relative importance of humoral and cellular defenses after septic injury with three different gram-positive bacteria (Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus), we used latex bead pre-injection to ablate macrophage function in flies wildtype or mutant for various Toll and imd pathway components. We found that in all three infection models a compromised phagocytic system impaired fly survival--independently of concomitant Toll or imd pathway activation. Our data failed to confirm a role of the PGRP-SA and GNBP1 Pattern Recognition Receptors for phagocytosis of S. aureus. The Drosophila scavenger receptor Eater mediates the phagocytosis by hemocytes or S2 cells of E. faecalis and S. aureus, but not of M. luteus. In the case of M. luteus and E. faecalis, but not S. aureus, decreased survival due to defective phagocytosis could be compensated for by genetically enhancing the humoral immune response. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results underscore the fundamental importance of both cellular and humoral mechanisms in Drosophila immunity and shed light on the balance between these two arms of host defense depending on the invading pathogen.
TI  - Maklamicin, an antibacterial polyketide from an endophytic Micromonospora sp.
AB  - A new spirotetronate-class polyketide, maklamicin (1), was isolated from the culture extract of an endophytic actinomycete of the genus Micromonospora. The structure and relative configuration of 1 were elucidated by interpretation of NMR and other spectroscopic data, and the absolute configuration was determined using the modified Mosher method. Maklamicin (1) showed strong to modest antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. All Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (MIC(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/mL and 2 mug/mL, respectively). Ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/mL), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL), and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL). Over 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/mL. Ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae. The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus Pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (MIC(90), 16 mug/mL). The broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial resistant pathogens from blood cultures from Canadian hospitals: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - This study assessed the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance of pathogens associated with bloodstream infections in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. Tertiary-care medical centers representing 8 of 10 Canadian provinces submitted bloodstream infection pathogens from patients attending hospital clinics, emergency rooms, medical/surgical wards, and intensive care units. Over 8,000 blood culture pathogens were collected. The 10 most common pathogens (representing 80.9% of all isolates) were Escherichia coli (1856 [22.6%]), Staphylococcus aureus (1457 [17.7%] including 1101 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and 356 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), coagulase-negative staphylococci (907 [11.0%]), Klebsiella pneumoniae (600 [7.3%]), Streptococcus pneumoniae (470 [5.7%]), Enterococcus faecalis (360 [4.4%]), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (333 [4.0%]), viridans group streptococci (321 [3.9%]), Enterobacter cloacae (193 [2.3%]), and Streptococcus pyogenes (159 [1.9%]). The most active agents against Gram-negative bacilli were carbapenems (e.g., meropenem and ertapenem) and piperacillin-tazobactam, while for Gram-positive cocci, they were vancomycin, linezolid, and daptomycin.
TI  - The Antimicrobial Activities of Extract and Compounds Isolated from Brillantaisia lamium.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brillantaisia lamium is an erect branched herb, which grows to a height of 1.50 m in moist tropical areas, both in full sun and partial shade. In , the aerial part of this plant is used in the treatment of various microbial infections such as skin diseases and infections of urinary tract. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activities of CH(2)Cl(2): MeOH (1:1) extract, fractions and compounds from the aerial part of B. lamium. METHODS: The plant was dried and extracted by maceration in CH(2)Cl(2): MeOH (1:1 v/v). Structures of the compounds from the CH(2)Cl(2): MeOH (1:1) soluble fraction were determined by spectroscopic methods and compared with published data. The broth micro dilution method was used to evaluate the antimicrobial activities against bacteria and fungal species. RESULTS: Four known compounds: aurantiamide acetate (1), lupeol (2), lespedin (3), sitosterol 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (4) and a mixture of sterols: campesterol (5), stigmasterol (6) and beta-sitosterol (7) were isolated from CH(2)Cl(2): MeOH (1:1) extract of B. lamium aerial parts. The crude extract, fractions and isolated compounds exhibited both antibacterial and antifungal activities that varied with microorganism (MIC=6.25 - 1000 microg/ml). Compound 3 was the most active (MIC=6.25 - 100 microg/ml) while Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida tropicalis and Cryptococcus neoformans were the most sensitive to all the tested compounds. CONCLUSION: The overall results of this study indicate that the CH(2)Cl(2): MeOH (1:1) extract and some of isolated compounds have interesting antimicrobial properties and can be used for the treatment of fungal and bacterial infections.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of raw and processed honey.
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activity of methanol, ethanol, and ethyl acetate extracts  of raw and processed honey was tested against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Micrococcus luteus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhi). Both types of honey showed antibacterial activity against tested organisms with the zone of inhibition (ZOI) ranging from 6.94 to 37.94 mm, while E. coli, S. typhi, and P. aeruginosa showed that sensibility towards all the extracts with ZOI ranges between 13.09 to 37.94 mm. The methanol extract showed more potent activity than other organic extracts. Gram-negative bacteria were found to be more susceptible as compared to Gram-positive bacteria except E. faecalis. The broth microdilution assay gave minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) value of 625 mug/mL, while the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranges between 625 mug/mL 2500 mug/mL. The study showed that honey has antibacterial activity (bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect), similar to antibiotics, against test organisms and provides alternative therapy against certain bacteria.
TI  - Multistep resistance development studies of ceftaroline in gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
AB  - Ceftaroline, the active component of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a novel  broad-spectrum cephalosporin with bactericidal activity against Gram-positive and -negative isolates. This study evaluated the potential for ceftaroline and comparator antibiotics to select for clones of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis with elevated MICs. S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes isolates in the present study were highly susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC range, 0.004 to 0.25 mug/ml). No streptococcal strains yielded ceftaroline clones with increased MICs (defined as an increase in MIC of >4-fold) after 50 daily passages. Ceftaroline MICs for H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were 0.06 to 2 mug/ml for four strains and 8 mug/ml for a beta-lactamase-positive, efflux-positive H. influenzae with a mutation in L22. One H. influenzae clone with an increased ceftaroline MIC (quinolone-resistant, beta-lactamase-positive) was recovered after 20 days. The ceftaroline MIC for this isolate increased 16-fold, from 0.06 to 1 mug/ml. MICs for S. aureus ranged from 0.25 to 1 mug/ml. No S. aureus isolates tested with ceftaroline had clones with increased MIC (>4-fold) after 50 passages. Two E. faecalis isolates tested had ceftaroline MICs increased from 1 to 8 mug/ml after 38 days and from 4 to 32 mug/ml after 41 days, respectively. The parental ceftaroline MIC for the one K. pneumoniae extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-negative isolate tested was 0.5 mug/ml and did not change after 50 daily passages.
TI  - [Epidemic hazard of water use in the reactivation of bacteria after disinfection].
AB  - Variability in the cultural and biochemical properties of indicator, opportunistic, and pathogenic bacteria and possibilities of their reactivation after exposure to chlorine-containing reagents and during photo-activated disinfection processes in the presence of photosensitizes were experimentally studied to enhance the epidemic reliability and adequacy of microbiological monitoring in the evaluation of the decontamination efficiency of water of its various use types. Reactivation of coliform bacteria, enterococci, salmonellas, and the total number of microbes were estimated after exposure to the bacteriostatic doses of sodium hypochlorite and chlorine dioxide when the river and waste waters were decontaminated. During photo-activated disinfection under the action of the photosensitizers methylene blue and proflavin acetate given in the bacteriostatic doses, there was transition into the uncultivated state, followed by 1-5-day reactivation of both museum strains and strains isolated from waste waters, such as Salmonella infantis spp, Salmonella enteritidis spp, Salmonella enteritidis 5765 ATCC, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 10145, Pseudomonas aeruginosa spp, Escherichia coli 1257, Staphylococcus aureus 906, and Enterococcus faecalis 29212. Moreover, Pseudomonas and Salmonellas not only regained their viability, but also multiplied up to the control level. Recommendations are given how to improve methods for monitoring the efficiency of disinfection, by taking into account a possible variability in the cultural and biochemical properties of bacteria and for reactivation by monitoring the trend in the process during 5 days.
TI  - Purification of a lectin with antibacterial activity from Bothrops leucurus snake venom.
AB  - A novel lectin was isolated from Bothrops leucurus snake venom using a combination of affinity and gel filtration chromatographies. The lectin (BlL) agglutinated glutaraldehyde-treated rabbit and human erythrocytes with preference for rabbit erythrocytes. Galactose, raffinose, lactose, fetal bovine serum and casein inhibited lectin-induced rabbit erythrocyte agglutination. BlL, with a molecular mass of 30 kDa and composed of two subunits of 15 kDa, showed dependence on calcium. BlL is an acidic protein with highest activity over the pH range of 4.0-7.0 and stable under heating to 70 degrees C. Fluorescence emission spectra showed tryptophan residues partially buried within the lectin structure. The percentages of secondary structure revealed by circular dichroism were 1% alpha-helix, 44% beta-sheet, 24% beta-turn and 31% unordered. BlL showed effective antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus subtilis with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 31.25, 62.25 and 125 mug/mL, respectively. In conclusion, B. leucurus snake venom contains a galactoside-binding lectin with antibacterial activity.
TI  - Acute necrotic stomatitis (noma) associated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection in a newly acquired rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta).
AB  - BACKGROUND: A newly acquired rhesus macaque was suffering from rapid destruction  of the left cheek caused by necrotizing stomatitis. METHODS: To restore reconstructive surgery and intensive care with antibiotics, wound protection, wound healing agents, and debridement were applied. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis were isolated from the culture of the lesion, and the antibiotic susceptibility test revealed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection. Vancomycin and ampicillin-sulbactam effectively treated the bacterial infections, and reconstructive surgery was performed once the infection was cleared. Topical application of recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF) was useful to treat exposed wound of the noma lesion. CONCLUSIONS: Simian noma associated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) had not previously been reported in non-human primates. Although noma associated with MRSA is hard to cure because of its rapid and destructive progress, the aggressive therapy used in this study led to the successful resolution of an acute necrotic stomatitis lesion in a rhesus macaque.
TI  - Use of daptomycin in complicated cases of infective endocarditis.
AB  - Infective endocarditis (IE) is a serious form of infection with a high mortality. Medical management can be a challenge because of organ dysfunction, lack of clinical response or allergy to the recommended antibiotics. Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic with a potent bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria. There are limited data on the use of daptomycin in complicated cases of IE. We aim to report our experience of daptomycin use in complicated cases of IE through a prospective observational study (from 1 October 2008 to 30 September 2009). Daptomycin was prescribed for cases that were either unresponsive or allergic to the standard therapy. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were reviewed. Success was defined as clinical improvement accompanied with the resolution of laboratory markers of sepsis and continuation of the above findings for at least 8 weeks after the end of therapy. Eight cases were evaluable. Native and prosthetic valves were involved in equal proportions. The range of organisms was wide: Staphylococcus aureus, two cases; S. epidermidis, two cases; streptococci, two cases; and Enterococcus faecalis, two cases. The median duration of therapy was 42 days. All patients were successfully treated. Daptomycin was well tolerated. Daptomycin is useful in the management of complicated cases of IE.
TI  - Assessment of the antibacterial activity of calcium hydroxide combined with chlorhexidine paste and other intracanal medications against bacterial pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the in vitro antibacterial activity of four formulations of calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)(2)] pastes against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus mutans. METHODS: A broth dilution test was performed, and the lengths of time for different pastes to kill the microbial cells were recorded and statistically analyzed. The following medications were assessed: Group I - Ca(OH)(2) + 2.0% chlorhexidine (CHX) gel; Group II - Ca(OH)(2) + camphorated paramonochlorophenol (CMCP) and propylene glycol; Group III - Ca(OH)(2) + propylene glycol; Group IV - Ca(OH)(2) + saline. RESULTS: The results showed that E. faecalis was the most resistant microorganism. Groups II and III eliminated all the microbial cells in 15 seconds. Group I took 45 seconds to eliminate E. faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this study, it was concluded that all the intracanal medications tested showed antibacterial activity. However, the association of Ca(OH)(2) and PMCC or Ca(OH)(2) and propylene glycol showed a better performance, since Groups II and III took a shorter length of time than the other groups to eliminate S. aureus and E. faecalis.
TI  - Transcriptome, proteome, and metabolite analyses of a lactate dehydrogenase-negative mutant of Enterococcus faecalis V583.
AB  - A constructed lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-negative mutant of Enterococcus faecalis V583 grows at the same rate as the wild type but ferments glucose to ethanol, formate, and acetoin. Microarray analysis showed that LDH deficiency had profound transcriptional effects: 43 genes in the mutant were found to be upregulated, and 45 were found to be downregulated. Most of the upregulated genes encode enzymes of energy metabolism or transport. By two-dimensional (2D) gel analysis, 45 differentially expressed proteins were identified. A comparison of transcriptomic and proteomic data suggested that for several proteins the level of expression is regulated beyond the level of transcription. Pyruvate catabolic genes, including the truncated ldh gene, showed highly increased transcription in the mutant. These genes, along with a number of other differentially expressed genes, are preceded by sequences with homology to binding sites for the global redox-sensing repressor, Rex, of Staphylococcus aureus. The data indicate that the genes are transcriptionally regulated by the NADH/NAD ratio and that this ratio plays an important role in the regulatory network controlling energy metabolism in E. faecalis.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of ceftobiprole against clinical isolates from French teaching hospitals: proposition of zone diameter breakpoints.
AB  - The aims of this study were to determine the in vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, a pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, against a large number of bacterial pathogens and to propose zone diameter breakpoints for clinical categorisation according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints. MICs of ceftobiprole were determined by broth microdilution against 1548 clinical isolates collected in eight French hospitals. Disk diffusion testing was performed using 30 mug disks according to the method of the Comite de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie (CA-SFM). The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole, expressed by MIC(50/90) (MICs for 50% and 90% of the organisms, respectively) (mg/L), was as follows: meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25/0.5; meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 1/2; meticillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 0.12/0.5; meticillin-resistant CoNS, 1/2; penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, </= 0.008/0.03; penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, 0.12/0.5; viridans group streptococci, 0.03/0.12; beta-haemolytic streptococci, </= 0.008/0.016; Enterococcus faecalis, 0.25/1; Enterococcus faecium, 64/128; Enterobacteriaceae, 0.06/32; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4/16; Acinetobacter baumannii, 0.5/64; Haemophilus influenzae, 0.03/0.12; and Moraxella catarrhalis, 0.25/0.5. According to the regression curve, zone diameter breakpoints could be 28, 26, 24 and 22 mm for MICs of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mg/L respectively. In conclusion, this study confirms the potent in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against many Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA but not E. faecium, whilst maintaining a Gram-negative spectrum similar to the advanced-generation cephalosporins such as cefepime. Thus ceftobiprole appears to be well suited for the empirical treatment of a variety of healthcare-associated infections.
TI  - An in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (CloSYS Oral Rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. METHODS: Oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. The numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity. RESULTS: As expected, Listerine and Crest Pro-Health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. Breath Rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. CloSYS and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, CloSYS oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that CloSYS Oral Rinse has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.
TI  - Triterpenoid saponins from Symplocos lancifolia.
AB  - Three new bidesmosidic saponins (1-3) and a new ursane triterpenoid, 2alpha,3beta,11alpha,23-tetrahydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid (4), along with seven known compounds, were isolated from a methanolic extract of the leaves of Symplocos lancifolia. The bidesmosidic saponins were found to possess the same sugar unit part, composed of two beta-d-glucose moieties and one alpha-l-rhamnose moiety, linked to maslinic acid, arjunolic acid, and asiatic acid, respectively. Their structures were elucidated by interpretation of their 1D and 2D NMR spectra and completed by analysis of the HRESIMS data. The antibacterial activity of the isolated triterpenoids was evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and several showed activity against Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic species--an in vitro study.
AB  - The in vitro study was aimed to determine the effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic microorganisms. Ozone was generated for 6 s-2 x 24 s (corresponding to 0.56 mg-2 x 2.24 mg of ozone) against 23 mainly anaerobic periodontopathogenic species. Agar diffusion test was used as a screening method. Then, the killing activity was tested in a serum-free environment and with 25% v/v inactivated serum. Further, the effect of ozone on bactericidal activity of native serum was analyzed against Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. Agar diffusion test showed a high efficacy of ozone against microorganisms, especially against Porphyromonas gingivalis. This result was confirmed by the killing tests; most of the strains in a concentration of 10(5) were completely eliminated after twofold 18-s application of ozone. Only four of the six potentially "superinfecting" species (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Candida albicans) survived in part. Addition of heat-inactivated serum reduced the killing rate of ozone by 78% after 6-s and by 47% after twofold 18-s exposures; no strain was completely eradicated after any application of ozone. The bactericidal effect of native serum was enhanced after application of ozone; no effect was visible on the included A. actinomycetemcomitans strain which was found to be completely resistant to the bactericidal action of serum. In conclusion, (a) ozone has a strong antibacterial activity against putative periodontopathogenic microorganisms, and (b) the bactericidal effect is reduced in the presence of serum. Ozone may have potential as an adjunctive application to mechanical treatment in periodontitis patients.
TI  - Evaluation of three swab transport systems for the maintenance of clinically important bacteria in simulated mono- and polymicrobial samples.
AB  - In this study, three swab transport systems were evaluated: M40 Transystem, Amies broth with a relatively new type of swab (both Copan Diagnostics, Corona, CA, USA), and SSI transportmedium (Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen Denmark). The CLSI M40-A standard procedures and 11 culture collection strains were used. The transport systems were tested at room temperature for holding times of 0, 24, and 48 h, and both mono- and polymicrobial samples were included. After 24 h of simulated transportation, all systems were able to maintain the viability of all organisms tested. SSI transportmedium exhibited the lowest maintaining ability, whereas the two Copan systems were the most growth-promoting system. In polymicrobial samples, this latter feature was a problem. At 48 h, no transport system could maintain the viability of all strains, and the recovery rates differed depending on organism and device. The species most difficult to recover in all the three systems was Neisseria gonorrhoeae. When selecting a swab transport system, consideration must be given to the sample type, the conditions that prevail locally, and the performance in the clinical setting.
TI  - Synthesis of 2-mercaptobenzimidazole derivatives as potential anti-microbial and  cytotoxic agents.
AB  - A series of novel 2-(1H-benzimidazol-2-ylsulfanyl)-N-(4-oxo-2-phenyl-thiazolidin-3yl)-acetamide 5a-j have been synthesized from various aldehydes and 2-(5-phenyl-[1,3,4]-oxadiazol-2-ylmethylsulfanyl)-1H-benzimidazole 6a-j from various benzoic acids. These compounds were screened for their in-vitro anti-bacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis as Gram positive, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli as Gram negative bacterial strains and for in-vitro anti-fungal activity against Asperigillus fumigatus and Candida albicans. The in vitro cytotoxic properties were studied using brine shrimp bioassay. Results revealed that, compounds 5b, 5d, 5g, 5i, 6b, 6e, 6f, and 6i showed excellent activity against a panel of microorganisms. The cytotoxic activities of 5b, 5g, 5i, 6b, 6f, 6h, and 6i were found to be good. All the newly synthesized compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, IR, (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR and MS.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis virulence regulator FsrA binding to target promoters.
AB  - The FsrABDC signal transduction system is a major virulence regulator in Enterococcus faecalis. The FsrC sensor histidine kinase, upon activation by the gelatinase biosynthesis-activating pheromone (GBAP) peptide encoded by the fsrBD genes, phosphorylates the FsrA response regulator required for the transcription of the fsrBDC and the gelE-sprE genes from the fsrB promoter and the gelE promoter, respectively. FsrA belongs to the LytTR family of proteins, which includes other virulence regulators, such as AgrA of Staphylococcus aureus, AlgR of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and VirR of Clostridium perfringens. The LytTR DNA-binding domain that characterizes these proteins generally binds to two imperfect direct repeats separated by a number of bases that place the repeats on the same face of the DNA helix. In this study, we demonstrated that FsrA also binds to two imperfect direct repeats separated by 13 bp, based on the consensus sequence of FsrA, T/AT/CAA/GGGAA/G, which is consistent with the binding characteristics of LytTR domains.
TI  - Comparative genome-wide analysis of small RNAs of major Gram-positive pathogens:  from identification to application.
AB  - In the recent years, the number of drug- and multi-drug-resistant microbial strains has increased rapidly. Therefore, the need to identify innovative approaches for development of novel anti-infectives and new therapeutic targets is of high priority in global health care. The detection of small RNAs (sRNAs) in bacteria has attracted considerable attention as an emerging class of new gene expression regulators. Several experimental technologies to predict sRNA have been established for the Gram-negative model organism Escherichia coli. In many respects, sRNA screens in this model system have set a blueprint for the global and functional identification of sRNAs for Gram-positive microbes, but the functional role of sRNAs in colonization and pathogenicity for Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis and Clostridium difficile is almost completely unknown. Here, we report the current knowledge about the sRNAs of these socioeconomically relevant Gram-positive pathogens, overview the state-of-the-art high-throughput sRNA screening methods and summarize bioinformatics approaches for genome-wide sRNA identification and target prediction. Finally, we discuss the use of modified peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) as a novel tool to inactivate potential sRNA and their applications in rapid and specific detection of pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Suprathel-antiseptic matrix: in vitro model for local antiseptic treatment?
AB  - Acetic acid is a traditional antiseptic agent that has been used for more than 6000 years. The main goal of this study was to demonstrate the suitability of Suprathel (PolyMedics Innovations GmbH, Denkendorf, Germany) in combination with various antiseptic agents to create an "antiseptic-matrix" especially designed for problematic microorganisms such as Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter baumannii, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are frequently associated with burns. The study was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial effect of a "Suprathel-antiseptic matrix" (Suprathel combined with acetic acid 3%, povidone-iodine 11% [Betaisodona], polyhexanide 0.04% [Lavasept], phenoxyethanol 2%/octenidine dihydrochloride 0.1% [Octenisept], mafenide acetate 5%, and chlorhexidine gluconate 1.5%/cetrimid 15% [Hibicet]). As a means to assess the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria strains were tested: Escherichia coli, P vulgaris, P aeruginosa, A baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S aureus, and beta-hemolytic streptococcus groups A and B. The tests showed a positive bactericidal effect of the Suprathel-antiseptic matrix, particularly with problematic Gram-negative bacteria such as P vulgaris, P aeruginosa, and A baumannii, except for the combination of Suprathel and mafenide acetate. It can be concluded that Suprathel-antiseptic matrix appears to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but clinical studies need to be performed to confirm these in vitro observations. The authors' previous studies have shown that acetic acid demonstrates a wide antiseptic spectrum for microorganisms typically found in burn patients. The combination of Suprathel and acetic acid worked well in this study and appears to be promising for future clinical application.
TI  - Entianin, a novel subtilin-like lantibiotic from Bacillus subtilis subsp. spizizenii DSM 15029T with high antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Lantibiotics, such as nisin and subtilin, are lanthionine-containing peptides that exhibit antimicrobial as well as pheromone-like autoinducing activity. Autoinduction is specific for each lantibiotic, and reporter systems for nisin and subtilin autoinduction are available. In this report, we used the previously reported subtilin autoinduction bioassay in combination with mass spectrometric analyses to identify the novel subtilin-like lantibiotic entianin from Bacillus subtilis subsp. spizizenii DSM 15029(T). Linearization of entianin using Raney nickel-catalyzed reductive cleavage enabled, for the first time, the use of tandem mass spectrometry for the fast and efficient determination of an entire lantibiotic primary structure, including posttranslational modifications. The amino acid sequence determined was verified by DNA sequencing of the etnS structural gene, which confirmed that entianin differs from subtilin at 3 amino acid positions. In contrast to B. subtilis ATCC 6633, which produces only small amounts of unsuccinylated subtilin, B. subtilis DSM 15029(T) secretes considerable amounts of unsuccinylated entianin. Entianin was very active against several Gram-positive pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. The growth-inhibiting activity of succinylated entianin (S-entianin) was much lower than that of unsuccinylated entianin: a 40-fold higher concentration was required for inhibition. For succinylated subtilin (S-subtilin), a concentration 100-fold higher than that of unsuccinylated entianin was required to inhibit the growth of a B. subtilis test strain. This finding was in accordance with a strongly reduced sensing of cellular envelope stress provided by S-entianin relative to that of entianin. Remarkably, S-entianin and S-subtilin showed considerable autoinduction activity, clearly demonstrating that autoinduction and antibiotic activity underlie different molecular mechanisms.
TI  - Carijodienone from the octocoral Carijoa multiflora. A spiropregnane-based steroid.
AB  - Two new steroids (1 and 2) and the known pregna-1,4,20-trien-3-one (3) have been  isolated from the Pacific octocoral Carijoa multiflora. Compound 1 possesses a novel spiropregnane-based steroidal skeleton. The photochemical transformation of 3 into 1 allowed the assignment of the absolute configuration at C-10 of 1. The antibacterial activities of compounds 1 and 3 were evaluated against a panel of bacterial strains.
TI  - Vancomycin-resistance transferability from VanA enterococci to Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - In last decade methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with high level of vancomycin-resistance (VRSA) have been reported and generally the patients with VRSA infection were also infected with a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Considering that the high level of vancomycin-resistance in VRSA isolates seems to involve the horizontal transfer of Tn1546 transposon containing vanA gene from coinfecting VRE strains, the authors have studied the "in vitro" conjugative transfer of this resistance from VanA enterococci to S. aureus. Out of 25 matings performed combining five vancomycin-resistant enterococci as donors (three Enterococcus faecalis and two Enterococcus faecium), and five S. aureus as recipients, all clinical isolates, two have been successful using E. faecalis as donor. The transfer of vancomycin-resistance was confirmed by vanA gene amplification in both transconjugants and the resistance was expressed at lower levels (MIC 32 mug/ml) in comparison with the respective VRE donors (MIC > 128 mug/ml). The vancomycin-resistance of trasconjugants was maintained even after subsequent overnight passages on MSA plates containing subinhibitory levels of vancomycin. This study shows that the vanA gene transfer can be achieved through techniques "in vitro" without the use of laboratory animals employed, in the only similar experiment previously carried out by other authors, as substrate for the trasconjugant growth. Moreover, in that previous experiment, contrary to this study, the vancomycin resistant S. aureus trasconjugants were selected on erythromycin agar and not by direct vancomycin agar selection.
TI  - Prevalence of hospital-acquired enterococci infections in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo, southwestern Nigeria.
AB  - Enterococci are opportunistic bacteria that become pathogenic when they colonize  niches where they are not normally found. Of recent, they have become major cause of nosocomial infections, especially of the bloodstream, urinary tract and surgical sites. The aim of this study is to determine the point-prevalence rate of human enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in Osogbo, Nigeria. The study was conducted between January and June 2009 in two primary-care hospitals in Osogbo and involved a total of 118 patients who developed clinical evidence of infection at least 48 hours after hospital admission. Appropriate clinical samples were collected from the patients after an informed consent and cultured for isolation/biochemical identification of Enterococcus species at the Bacteriology Laboratory of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Osogbo using standard microbiological methods. There were 525 hospital admissions within the time frame of the study of which 118 (22.5%) developed hospital acquired infection (HAI); 58 (49.2%) of which cultured positive for bacterial pathogens. Enterococci were isolated from infective focus in 7 patients, giving a prevalence rate of hospital-acquired enterococci infection of 5.9%. Two species of Enterococcus were identified; Enterococcus faecalis from urinary tract infection (UTI) and surgical site infection (SSI) of 6 (85.7%) patients and Enterococcus faecium from UTI in 1 (14.3%) patient. Other bacteria recovered from other infective foci were Klebsiella spp 31.0%, Pseudomonas spp 20.7%, Staphylococcus aureus 17.2%, Escherichia coli 12.1%, Staphylococcus epidermidis 3.4%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 1.7% and Serratia spp 1.7%. All the enterococci isolates were multiply antibiotic resistant, and 42.9% were vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) with the VRE strains showing resistance to wider range of antibiotics than the vancomycin-sensitive strains. Other Gram-positive and Gram negative bacterial isolates also demonstrated multiple resistance to all commonly available antibiotics in this community except E. coli and Pseudomonas spp which were relatively sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. This limited study demonstrated a high prevalence rate of multiple antibiotic resistant enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in this environment. There is need for systematic surveillance of hospitals for enterococci infections; prudent use and rational prescription of antibiotics and stringent measures to reduce the prevalence rate by health education on infection control measures such as isolation, cleaning, disinfection and sterilization.
TI  - Ozone in dentistry: microbiological effects of gas action depending on the method and the time of application using the ozonytron device. Experimental study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal activity of ozone is generally known and has been exploited for years in industry and medicine. Ozone therapy became an inherent element of the treatment of infection in such fields as surgery, dermatology, cosmetics, and dentistry. Ozone is a gas, so it penetrates very well even into such tissues and spaces that are not easily accessible. Thanks to the property of deep penetration and long ozone presence in tissues after treatment, a long-lasting bactericidal effect is achieved. The action of oxygen radicals is, however, not neutral for the human organism, therefore the use of an appropriate procedure and therapy algorithms is essential. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We decided to confirm the effect of antibacterial activity of ozone applied by means of the Ozonytron device (made by Biozonix) on model strains of Streptococcus salivarius, pneumonia, pyogenes, and agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, using two application patterns developed by us. RESULTS: We found a statistically significant difference in the size of zones of inhibited bacterial growth on all media depending on the time of action of ozone. In the present paper, the bactericidal activity of ozone in relation to bacterial strains that are most frequently isolated from the oral cavity was confirmed. What is more, two models of application of the gas on the infected medium were compared. CONCLUSION: Research on the use of ozone in combatting bacteria typical for dental diseases has shown that the gas has an oxidizing effect on these bacteria and is bactericidal.

TI  - Inhibitory activity of root canal irrigants against Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The present study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of three root canal irrigants against Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, and Staphylococcus aureus. These microorganisms were incubated in the presence of citric acid (6 and 10%), EDTA (17%), and NaOCl (0.5, 1.0, 2.5, and 5.25%). Agar diffusion tests were performed and redox indicator resazurin was used to evaluate the inhibitory effect of the irrigants on the metabolic activity of these microorganisms. The mean diameters of the inhibition zones for the C. albicans cultures were 11.6 mm (17% EDTA), 5.5 mm (0.5% NaOCl), 12.9 mm (1% NaOCl), 22.1 mm (2.5% NaOCl), and 28.5 mm (5.25% NaOCl). The mean diameters of the inhibition zones for E. faecalis were 2.8 mm (1% NaOCl), 5.4 mm (2.5% NaOCl), and 8.3 mm (5.25% NaOCl). For S. aureus, the mean values were 8.0 mm (17% EDTA), 3.0 mm (1% NaOCl), 8.8 mm (2.5% NaOCl), and 10.0 mm (5.25% NaOCl). Most of the irrigant solutions presented effective antimicrobial activity against C. albicans. A high inhibitory effect on the metabolic activity of E. faecalis was detected when the microorganisms were incubated with 17% EDTA. The same result was reached when S. aureus was incubated in the presence of > 2.5% NaOCl. Altogether, these results indicate that 2.5% and 5.25% NaOCl are microbicides against S. aureus while 0.5% and 1% NaOCl are only microbiostatic against the tested bacteria. The 6% and 10% citric acid as well as 17% EDTA did not affect the viability of any of the assayed microorganisms.
TI  - [Chlorhexidine as a root canal irrigant--antimicrobial and scanning electron microscopic evaluation].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Selection of irrigant is very important for long-term success of root canal therapy. OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of 2% chlorhexidine digluconate solution (CHX) against five selected microorganisms and to evaluate its efficacy in root canal cleaning. METHODS: In this study, by agar diffusion test, were evaluated antimicrobial effects of three root canal irrigants: 5.25% NaOCl, 2.5% NaOCl and 2% CHX. The microorganisms tested in this study were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. A scanning electron microscope was used to evaluate root canal cleaning ability of 5.25% NaOCl, 2.5% NaOCl, 2% CHX and 15% EDTA. Twelve extracted single-root human teeth were divided into four groups depending on the irrigant used during instrumentation. Mechanical preparation was performed with Step back technique and K files. Data were analysed statistically by Student's t-test. RESULTS: 5.25% NaOCl was the most effective against all tested microorganisms. 2.5% NaOCl and 2% CHX showed antimicrobial effects against all tested microorganisms but zones of inhibition were smaller.The best results in root canal walls cleaning were obtained in the group where the irrigant was 15% EDTA (score 2.33). In 5.25% NaOCl, 2.5% NaOCl and 2% CHX groups, there was more smear layer (score 4 and 5). CONCLUSION: 2% chlorhexidine digluconate showed strong antimicrobial effect on the tested microorganisms, but was not effective in cleaning root canal walls.
TI  - Effects of demethylfruticuline A and fruticuline A from Salvia corrugata Vahl. on biofilm production in vitro by multiresistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - In this study, demethylfruticuline A (dfA) and fruticuline A (fA), two quinones representing the major diterpenoid components of the exudate produced by the aerial parts of Salvia corrugata, were assessed for their ability to modify surface characteristics, such as hydrophobicity, and to inhibit synthesis of biofilm in vitro by multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis. Five strains of S. aureus (three meticillin-resistant and two meticillin-susceptible), five strains of S. epidermidis (four meticillin-resistant and one meticillin-susceptible) and eight vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, all recently isolated from clinical specimens and capable of slime production, were studied. fA decrease by at least two-fold the hydrophobic properties of the S. aureus cell membrane but did not affect S. epidermidis or E. faecalis. Biofilm formation on polystyrene plates was quantified spectrophotometrically by established methodologies. Inhibition of biofilm formation was also confirmed by the Congo red agar plate assay. dfA and fA were more effective against S. aureus strains (>70% effect at subinhibitory concentrations) than against S. epidermidis in inhibiting slime synthesis. Against E. faecalis, dfA at subinhibitory concentration induced an inhibition of biofilm production of ca. 60%; fA was less active and more strain-dependent. Moreover, the two compounds were shown to possess chelating activity on divalent and trivalent metal cations. Interactions of fA and dfA with bacteria could be very complex, possibly being species-specific, and could depend not only on inhibition of exopolysaccharide synthesis but also on their chelating activity and on changes in the microorganism's surface, including cell hydrophobicity.
TI  - Chitosan-cobalt(II) and nickel(II) chelates as antibacterial agents.
AB  - Antibacterial behavior of chitosan-bivalent metal chelates (Co and Ni) was investigated in vitro against standard bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 4533, S. faecalis ATCC 8043 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25923. The chitosan-metal chelates were prepared by varying the molar ratio of metal ions to a fixed amount of chitosan. The metal ion contents, structural properties and morphology of the chelates were respectively determined using ICP-OES, FT-IR and SEM. All the chitosan-metal chelates showed wide spectrum of effective antibacterial activities better than free chitosan and the individual metal ions. The results indicated that inhibitory effects of the chelates were dependent not only on the property of the coordinated metal ion, but also on the molar ratio of the metal ion. Consequently, the ideal inhibitory effects could be obtained with metal ion of high charge intensity and when the molar ratio of chitosan to metal was above 1:1. These chelates are promising materials for novel antibacterial agents.
TI  - Ceftaroline activity against pathogens associated with complicated skin and skin  structure infections: results from an international surveillance study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the spectrum and potency of ceftaroline, a novel anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcal cephalosporin, against a 2008 surveillance collection of clinical isolates from patients in the USA and Europe. METHODS: A collection of 14 169 isolates of various bacterial species from complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs) was tested for susceptibility to ceftaroline and 19 comparator agents in a central reference laboratory using CLSI broth microdilution methods. Organisms were received from 55 medical centres; 27 in the USA and 28 in Europe (12 countries, including Israel). The clonality of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus with elevated ceftaroline MICs (4 mg/L) was determined by PFGE and single and multilocus sequence typing, and the mechanism of ceftaroline non-susceptibility was assessed by molecular methods (PCR amplification and sequencing). RESULTS: Ceftaroline, the active component of the parenteral prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, was active against 2988 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates, with an MI(9)(0) of 1 mg/L. The MIC(9)(0) for methicillin-susceptible strains was 0.25-0.5 mg/L. Ceftaroline was additionally active against coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC(9)(0), 0.5-1 mg/L), Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(5)(0), 2 mg/L), beta-haemolytic and viridans group streptococci (MIC(9)(0), 0.015-0.25 mg/L) and three commonly isolated Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus mirabilis; MIC(9)(0) values of 0.25 to > 16 mg/L). All but four isolates of MRSA (0.13%) had ceftaroline MIC values of </= 2 mg/L. The isolates for which ceftaroline MICs were 4 mg/L were clonal (single Greek hospital) and had detectable mecA mutations (N146K, N204K, E150K and H351N). CONCLUSIONS: The ceftaroline yearly (2008) surveillance for the USA and Europe documented low MIC(5)(0)/(9)(0) values for MRSA isolates at 1/1 and 1/2 mg/L, respectively. Ceftaroline demonstrated promising potency and coverage against Gram-positive and -negative pathogens known to cause cSSSIs, including MRSA and beta-haemolytic streptococci.
TI  - Telavancin Activity against gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients with skin and skin-structure infections.
AB  - Telavancin is approved in the United States and Canada for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) in adults caused by susceptible Gram-positive organisms. The antimicrobial activity of telavancin and comparators was evaluated against 5,027 (2007-2008) Gram-positive bacteria responsible for SSSI in medical centers in Asia-Pacific, European, Latin American, and North American regions. Telavancin was active against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.12/0.25 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.12/0.25 mg/l). telavancin inhibited all Enterococcus faecalis, including four strains displaying a VanB phenotype, at </= 1 mg/L (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.25/0.5 mg/l), except for two isolates with a VanA phenotype (MIC, >2 mg/l). Vancomycin-susceptible and VanB vancomycin-resistant E. faecium were inhibited by telavancin at </= 0.25 mg/L, while this drug exhibited elevated MIC values (>/= 0.5 mg/l) against E. faecium of VanA phenotype (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 2/>2 mg/l). Telavancin was potent against beta-haemolytic streptococci (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.03/0.12 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and viridans group streptococci (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.03/0.06 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible). These in vitro data document the activity of telavancin against contemporary Gram-positive isolates and support its clinical use for the treatment of cSSSI caused by the indicated pathogens.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of E-101 Solution, a novel myeloperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial, against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: E-101 Solution (E-101) is a novel myeloperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial. It is composed of porcine myeloperoxidase (pMPO), glucose oxidase, glucose as the substrate and specific amino acids in an aqueous vehicle. E-101 is being developed for topical application directly into surgical wounds to prevent surgical site infections (SSIs). The in vitro activity of E-101 was investigated. METHODS: MIC, MBC, time-kill and antimicrobial combination experiments were performed according to CLSI guidelines with modifications. Resistance selection studies were performed using a serial passage method. RESULTS: E-101 showed MIC(90) values of 0.03, 0.5 and 0.5 mg pMPO/L for staphylococci (n = 140), streptococci (n = 95) and enterococci (n = 55), respectively. MIC(90) values ranged between 0.03-0.5 and </= 0.004-0.12 mg pMPO/L for Enterobacteriaceae (n = 148) and Gram-negative non-Enterobacteriaceae (n = 92) strains, respectively. There was no antimicrobial tolerance to E-101 for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae or Streptococcus pyogenes. Time-kill studies demonstrated a rapid (<30 min) bactericidal effect against S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. There was no evidence of stable resistance to E-101 among staphylococci, enterococci, E. coli or P. aeruginosa strains and no evidence of E-101 interaction with antibiotics commonly used in clinical medicine. Conclusions E-101 shows potent and broad-spectrum in vitro activity against bacteria that are the causative pathogens of SSIs, thereby providing the impetus to test its clinical utility in the prevention of SSIs.
TI  - Co(III), Ni(II), Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes with 2-acetyl-2-thiazoline thiosemicarbazone: Synthesis, characterization, X-ray structures and antibacterial activity.
AB  - The new ligand 2-acetyl-2-thiazoline thiosemicarbazone (HATtsc) and the complexes [Co(ATtsc)(2)](2)[CoCl(4)].2H(2)O (1), [Co(ATtsc)(2)]NO(3).H(2)O (2), [Ni(HATtsc)(2)](NO(3))(2) (3), [ZnCl(2)(HATtsc)].CH(3)CN (4), [{CdCl(HATtsc)}(2)(mu-Cl)(2)].2H(2)O (5) and [{Cd(NO(3))(HATtsc)}(2)(mu-NO(3))(2)] (6) were isolated and characterized by a variety of physico-chemical techniques and X-ray diffraction. The structure of HATtsc in 1 and 2 presented a thiolate form while in 3-6 the thione form was present, as it was in free ligand. In addition, we studied the antibacterial activity of the ligand and complexes 2-6 against some representative bacteria. Cd(II) complexes were more active against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis than organic ligand. Conversely, Cd(II) compounds seemed to interfere in the cell separation of B. subtilis.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity study of a novel class of cationic anthraquinone analogs.
AB  - Reported previously by our group, one-pot cycloaddition using naphthoquinone, sodium azide and alkyl halides can lead to the formation of both 1-alkyl-1H- and 2-alkyl-2H-naphtho[2,3-d]triazole-4,9-diones. Herein, the effect of leaving group and additive in dictating the selectivity between the formation of 1-alkyl-1H- and 2-alkyl-2H-naphtho[2,3-d]triazole-4,9-diones has been further investigated. In the process of investigating the factors that control the selectivity and the biological activity associated with these two compounds, a novel class of antibacterial cationic anthraquinone analogs has been developed. Although these compounds are structurally similar, different antibacterial profiles are noted. One lead compound, 4e manifests high potency (MIC<1mug/mL) and selectivity against Gram positive (G+) pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) while exerting only modest activity against Gram negative (G-) bacteria. Other lead compounds (4f and 4g) exhibit broad antibacterial activity including MRSA and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) that is comparable to other commercially available cationic antiseptic chemicals. This unique difference in antibacterial profile may pave the way for the development of new therapeutic agents.
TI  - Characterization of lytic enzyme open reading frame 9 (ORF9) derived from Enterococcus faecalis bacteriophage phiEF24C.
AB  - In bacteriophage (phage) therapy against Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis, members of a genus of SPO1-like viruses are typically employed because of their extreme virulence and broad host spectrum. Phage phiEF24C, which is a SPO1-like virus infecting E. faecalis, has previously been characterized as a therapeutic phage candidate. In addition to the phage itself, phage endolysin is also recognized as an effective antimicrobial agent. In this study, a putative endolysin gene (orf9) of E. faecalis phage phiEF24C was analyzed in silico, and its activity was characterized using the recombinant form. First, bioinformatics analysis predicted that the open reading frame 9 (ORF9) protein is N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase. Second, bacteriolytic and bactericidal activities of ORF9 against E. faecalis were confirmed by zymography, decrease of peptidoglycan turbidity, decrease of the viable count, and morphological analysis of ORF9-treated cells. Third, ORF9 did not appear to require Zn(2+) ions for its activity, contrary to the bioinformatics prediction of a Zn(2+) ion requirement. Fourth, the lytic spectrum was from 97.1% (34 out of 35 strains, including vancomycin-resistant strains) of E. faecalis strains to 60% (6 out of 10 strains) of Enterococcus faecium strains. Fifth, N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase activity of ORF9 was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and the subsequent MALDI-postsource decay (PSD) analyses. Finally, functional analysis using N- or C-terminally deleted ORF9 mutants suggested that a complete ORF9 molecule is essential for its activity. These results suggested that ORF9 is an endolysin of phage phiEF24C and can be a therapeutic alternative to antibiotics.
TI  - [Bacterial meningitis secondary to spinal analgesia and anaesthesia].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although rare, infectious complications from spinal analgesia and anaesthesia (SA) can have serious morbidity and mortality. This study describes the clinical features and outcome of SA-associated bacterial meningitis in adults seen in a hospital over a 25 yearperiod. METHODS: We reviewed the charts of all patients (aged >/=14 years) diagnosed with SA-associated bacterial meningitis between 1982 and 2006. RESULTS: Eight cases of SA-associated bacterial meningitis were diagnosed (3.3% bacterial meningitis), with a median age of 62 years (range, 35-80). SA procedures were: morphine infusion pumps with epidural (3 cases) or intrathecal (3) catheters, spinal cord stimulation with epidural neuroelectrode (1), and epidural anesthesia (1). Site of spinal insertion was: cervical (2 cases), thoracic (3), and lumbar (3). The median time to onset of meningitis was 26 days (range, 7-101) after AE. The most common clinical findings were fever (8 cases, 100%), headache (7 cases, 87.5%), and neck stiffness (4 cases, 50%). CSF abnormalities were pleocytosis (8 cases, 100%), elevated protein level (8 cases, 100%), and hypoglycorrhachia (5 cases, 62.5%). The causative organisms were Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 cases), Staphylococcus aureus (2), Enterococcus faecalis (1), Streptococcus milleri (1), and S. epidermidis and Pseudomonas fluorescens (1); one patient had a negative CSF culture. Treatment included antibiotics and to remove the analgesia device in all patients. There was one death (12.5%). CONCLUSIONS: SA is a rare predisposing condition to bacterial meningitis but, due to the seriousness of the infection, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis for any patient who develops fever or headache in this setting.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of doripenem against clinical isolates from French teaching hospitals: proposition of zone diameter breakpoints.
AB  - The aims of the study were to determine the in vitro activity of doripenem, a new carbapenem, against a large number of bacterial pathogens and to propose zone diameter breakpoints for clinical categorization in France according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints. The MICs of doripenem were determined by the broth microdilution method against 1,547 clinical isolates from eight French hospitals. The disk diffusion test was performed (10-mug discs) according to the Comite de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie (CASFM) method. The MIC(50/90) (mg/L) values were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (0.03/0.25), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (1/2), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (MSCoNS) (0.03/0.12), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS) (2/8), Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.016/0.25), viridans group streptococci (0.016/2), beta-hemolytic streptococci (</=0.008/</=0.008), Enterococcus faecalis (2/4), Enterococcus faecium (128/>128), Enterobacteriaceae (0.06/0.25), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.5/8), Acinetobacter baumannii (0.25/2), Haemophilus influenzae (0.12/0.25), and Moraxella catarrhalis (0.03/0.06). According to the regression curve, the zone diameter breakpoints were 24 and 19 mm for MICs of 1 and 4 mg/L, respectively. This study confirms the potent in vitro activity of doripenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Enterobacteriaceae, MSSA, MSCoNS, and respiratory pathogens. According to the EUCAST MIC breakpoints (mg/L) </=1/>4 for Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter, and </=1/>1 for streptococci, pneumococci, and Haemophilus, the zone diameter breakpoints could be (mm) >/=24/<19 and >/=24/<24, respectively.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of telavancin studied in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model of infection.
AB  - The antibacterial effects of telavancin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin against six  Staphylococcus aureus strains (1 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus [MSSA] strain, 4 methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA] strains, and 1 vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus [VISA] strain) and three Enterococcus sp. strains (1 Enterococcus faecalis strain, 1 Enterococcus faecium strain, and 1 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium [VREF] strain) were compared using an in vitro pharmacokinetic model of infection. Analyzing the data from all five vancomycin-susceptible S. aureus (VSSA) strains or all 4 MRSA strains showed that telavancin was superior in its antibacterial effect as measured by the area under the bacterial kill curve at 24 h (AUBKC(24)) and 48 h (AUBKC(48)) in comparison to vancomycin or teicoplanin (P < 0.05). Telavancin was also superior to vancomycin and teicoplanin in terms of its greater early killing effect (P < 0.05). Against the three Enterococcus spp. tested, telavancin was superior to vancomycin in terms of its AUBKC(24), AUBKC(48), and greater early bactericidal effect (P < 0.05). Dose-ranging studies were performed to provide free-drug area under the concentration-time curve over 24 h in the steady state divided by the MIC (fAUC/MIC) exposures from 0 to 1,617 (7 to 14 exposures per strain) for 5 VSSA, 4 VISA, and the 3 Enterococcus strains. The fAUC/MIC values for a 24-h bacteriostatic effect and a 1-log-unit drop in the viable count were 43.1 +/- 38.4 and 50.0 +/- 39.0 for VSSA, 3.2 +/- 1.3 and 4.3 +/- 1.3 for VISA, and 15.1 +/- 8.8 and 40.1 +/- 29.4 for the Enterococcus spp., respectively. The reason for the paradoxically low fAUC/MIC values for VISA strains is unknown. There was emergence of resistance to telavancin in the dose-ranging studies, as indicated by subpopulations able to grow on plates containing 2x MIC telavancin concentrations compared to the preexposure population analysis profiles. Changes in population analysis profiles were less likely with enterococci than with S. aureus, and the greatest risk of changed profiles occurred for both species at fAUC/MIC ratios of 1 to 10. Maintaining a fAUC/MIC ratio of >50 reduced the risk of subpopulations able to grow on antibiotic-containing media emerging. These data help explain the clinical effectiveness of telavancin against MRSA and indicate that telavancin may have clinically useful activity against Enterococcus spp., and perhaps also VISA, at human doses of 10 mg/kg of body weight/day. In addition, they support a clinical breakpoint of sensitive at </=1 mg/liter for both S. aureus and Enterococcus spp.
TI  - Inhibition of efflux pumps in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis resistant strains by triterpenoids from Momordica balsamina.
AB  - Six cucurbitane-type triterpenoids (1-6) isolated from the aerial parts of Momordica balsamina were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the activity of bacterial efflux pumps of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) COL(OXA), Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Salmonella enterica subsp. I serovar Typhimurium 5408 and S. Typhimurium 5408CIP strains. The latter strain overproduces the AcrB transporter of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump six-fold compared with its parent. Compounds 4-6 were also tested for similar activity against Escherichia coli AG100 wild-type strain and E. coli AG100TET8 that overproduces the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump. Evaluation of efflux activity was performed using a semi-automated method that measures accumulation of the universal efflux pump substrate ethidium bromide (EtBr). Some of the compounds significantly inhibited efflux of EtBr by MRSA COL(OXA) and E. faecalis ATCC 29212. A correlation between activity and the topological polar surface area of the compounds was found for MRSA COL(OXA).
TI  - Antimicrobial characterisation of solithromycin (CEM-101), a novel fluoroketolide: activity against staphylococci and enterococci.
AB  - Solithromycin (CEM-101) is a novel fluoroketolide with high potency against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria commonly associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections. In this study, solithromycin and comparator antimicrobials were tested against a contemporary collection of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and other Enterococcus spp. collected in the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. Solithromycin was active against S. aureus [minimum inhibitory concentration for 50% of the organisms (MIC(50))=0.12 mug/mL] and was two-fold more active than telithromycin (MIC(50)=0.25 mug/mL). Solithromycin was more potent against methicillin (oxacillin)-susceptible S. aureus [MIC(50)=0.06 mug/mL and MIC for 90% of the organisms (MIC(90))=0.12 mug/mL) compared with methicillin (oxacillin)-resistant S. aureus (MIC(50)=0.12 mug/mL and MIC(90)>16 mug/mL). Solithromycin activity was reduced amongst heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (MIC(50)>16 mug/mL). Against strains with defined susceptibilities to erythromycin, clindamycin and telithromycin, solithromycin showed potent inhibition against all combinations (MIC(50)=0.06 mug/mL) except those with non-susceptibility to telithromycin (>2 mug/mL) (MIC(50)>16 mug/mL). The solithromycin MIC(50) for E. faecium (1 mug/mL) was four-fold higher than the MIC(50) for E. faecalis (0.25 mug/mL). In summary, solithromycin demonstrated high potency against many Staphylococcus and Enterococcus spp. isolated from contemporary infections worldwide.
TI  - [Antimicrobial potential of Metarhizium taii in vitro].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial potential of Metarhizium tail and its corresponding active fractions. METHODS: The agar diffusion method and growth-rate assay were employed individually to measure the antibacterial and antifungal activities of M. taii. The microdilution and disk colony count was used to test the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bacterial concentration. RESULTS: The extraction fractions of M. tail could evidently inhibi the growth of Gram positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Gram negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aerzginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis,and phytopathogenic fungi such as Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium oxysporum, hereby M. taii had a broad spectrum antimicrobial effect including potent antibacterial and antifungal activities. The antimicrobial active ingredients of M. tail mainly existed in three extraction fractions including ethyl acetate extract in fermented broth, chloroform, and ethyl acetate extracts in mycelia. However there was an evident discrepancy on the antibacterial spectrum and competence for different active extraction fractions. CONCLUSION: M. taii possess potent and broad-spectrum antimicrobial potential, and it is a good edible and medicinal resource for the functional food development and the discovery of new antimicrobial drug.
TI  - Construction of mini-Tn4001 transposon vector for Mycoplasma gallisepticum.
AB  - The detailed genetic analysis of mycoplasmas has long been hampered by the lack of appropriate tools for genetic manipulation. In this study, the transposon vector, mini-Tn4001tetM, was constructed containing the tnp gene, encoding a transposase gene in Staphylococcus aureus, two copies of the IS256 inverted repeat sequence (inner and outer) and the tetM gene, from the Enterococcus faecalis Tn916 transposon, conferring resistance to tetracycline. This vector was electro-transformed into Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG). The recombinant cells were screened by tetracycline selection. The results indicated that the transposon vector could replicate in MG strain R by successive passages, indicating that MG is a potential vector for expressing protective antigens of other pathogens.
TI  - Non-aggregated Ga(III)-phthalocyanines in the photodynamic inactivation of planktonic and biofilm cultures of pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  - Visible light-absorbing cationic water-soluble gallium(III) phthalocyanines (GaPcs) peripherally substituted with four and eight methylpyridyloxy groups were synthesized and investigated as antimicrobial photodynamic sensitizers. The inserted large gallium ion in the phthalocyanine ligand is axially substituted by one hydroxyl group which prevents aggregation of the complexes in aqueous solution. The cellular uptake and the photodynamic activity for the representative strains of the Gram positive bacteria methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA) and Enterococcus faecalis, of the Gram negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa and of the fungus Candida albicans in planktonic phase were studied. The tetra-methylpyridyloxy substituted GaPc1 showed lower cellular uptake compared to the octa-methylpyridyloxy substituted GaPc2. The photodynamic activity of the GaPcs was studied in comparison to methylene blue (MB) and a photodynamically active Zn(II)-phthalocyanine with the same substitution (ZnPcMe). Photodynamic treatment with 3.0 muM GaPc1 at mild light conditions (50 J cm(-2), 60 mW cm(-2)) resulted in a high photoinactivation of the microorganisms in the planktonic phase nevertheless the dark toxicity of GaPc1 towards MRSA and E. faecalis. GaPcs against fungal biofilm grown on polymethylmethacrylate (PMMC) resin showed a complete inactivation at a higher concentration of GaPc2 (6.0 muM) and of the referent sensitizer ZnPcMe. However, the bacterial biofilms were not susceptible to treatment of GaPcs with only 1-2 log reduction of the biofilm. The bacterial biofilm E. faecalis was effectively inactivated only with MB. The water-soluble octa-methylpyridyloxy substituted GaPc2 has a potential value for photodynamic treatment of C. albicans biofilms formed on denture acrylic resin.
TI  - Anti-bacterial activity of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy: comparative in vitro study of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, mefloquine, and azithromycin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is recommended for the prevention of malaria in pregnancy in sub-Saharan Africa. Increasing drug resistance necessitates the urgent evaluation of alternative drugs. Currently, the most promising candidates in clinical development are mefloquine and azithromycin. Besides the anti-malarial activity, SP is also a potent antibiotic and incurs significant anti-microbial activity when given as IPTp - though systematic clinical evaluation of this action is still lacking. METHODS: In this study, the intrinsic anti-bacterial activity of mefloquine and azithromycin was assessed in comparison to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine against bacterial pathogens with clinical importance in pregnancy in a standard microdilution assay. RESULTS: SP was highly active against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. All tested Gram-positive bacteria, except Enterococcus faecalis, were sensitive to azithromycin. Additionally, azithromycin was active against Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Mefloquine showed good activity against pneumococci but lower in vitro action against all other tested pathogens. CONCLUSION: These data indicate important differences in the spectrum of anti-bacterial activity for the evaluated anti-malarial drugs. Given the large scale use of IPTp in Africa, the need for prospective clinical trials evaluating the impact of antibiotic activity of anti-malarials on maternal and foetal health and on the risk of promoting specific drug resistance of bacterial pathogens is discussed.
TI  - Myeloperoxidase selectively binds and selectively kills microbes.
AB  - Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is reported to selectively bind to bacteria. The present study provides direct evidence of MPO binding selectivity and tests the relationship of selective binding to selective killing. The microbicidal effectiveness of H(2)O(2) and of OCl(-) was compared to that of MPO plus H(2)O(2). Synergistic microbicidal action was investigated by combining Streptococcus sanguinis, a H(2)O(2)-producing microbe showing low MPO binding, with high-MPO-binding Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa without exogenous H(2)O(2), with and without MPO, and with and without erythrocytes (red blood cells [RBCs]). Selectivity of MPO microbicidal action was conventionally measured as the MPO MIC and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) for 82 bacteria including E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and viridans streptococci. Both H(2)O(2) and OCl(-) destroyed RBCs at submicrobicidal concentrations. Nanomolar concentrations of MPO increased H(2)O(2) microbicidal action 1,000-fold. Streptococci plus MPO produced potent synergistic microbicidal action against all microbes tested, and RBCs caused only a small decrease in potency without erythrocyte damage. MPO directly killed H(2)O(2)-producing S. pyogenes but was ineffective against non-H(2)O(2)-producing E. faecalis. The MPO MICs and MBCs for E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus were significantly lower than those for E. faecalis. The streptococcal studies showed much higher MIC/MBC results, but such testing required lysed horse blood-supplemented medium, thus preventing valid comparison of these results to those for the other microbes. E. faecalis MPO binding is reportedly weak compared to binding of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus but strong compared to binding of streptococci. Selective MPO binding results in selective killing.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite-based irrigating solutions.
AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of the present study was the in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of three different NaOCl-based endodontic irrigating solutions: a 5.25% conventional sodium hypochlorite solution; and two new irrigating solutions, a 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution with the addition of a proteolytic enzyme and a surfactant; and a 5.25% sodium hypochlorite gel with inorganic silicate. METHODS: Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans strains were selected to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the endodontic irrigating solutions by the agar disc diffusion test. Paper disks were saturated with each one of the tested solutions (at room temperature and pre-warmed at 45 degrees C) and placed onto culture agar-plates pre-adsorbed with bacterial cells and further incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees C. The growth inhibition zones around each irrigating solution were recorded and compared for each bacterial strain. RESULTS: The results were significantly different among the tested irrigating solutions: 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution produced the highest inhibition areas; 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution with a proteolytic enzyme and a surfactant, and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite gel with inorganic silicate showed the lowest zones of inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Even if all tested irrigating solution possessed antibacterial activity versus all tested bacterial strains, 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution with a proteolytic enzyme and a surfactant, and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite gel with inorganic silicate showed lower in vitro efficacy than 5.25% conventional sodium hypochlorite solution.
TI  - Chitosan-EDTA new combination is a promising candidate for treatment of bacterial and fungal infections.
AB  - Chitosan is an attractive preparation widely used as a pharmaceutical excipient.  This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activities of chitosan derivatives, EDTA, and the newly developed chitosan-EDTA combination against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria as well as Candida albicans. Antimicrobial activity was studied. Both minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) and minimal biocidal concentrations (MBC) were determined. Chitosan acetic acid recorded lower MIC values against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans than those exhibited by EDTA. EDTA failed to have inhibitory activity against Enterococcus faecalis as well as MBC against any of the studied microorganisms. Chitosan acetic acid's MBC were recorded to all examined species. Checkerboard assay results indicated a synergistic antimicrobial activity of the new combination against Staphylococcus aureus and an additive effect against other microorganisms. Moreover, a short microbial exposure to chitosan-EDTA (20-30 min) caused complete eradication. Due to the continuous emergence of resistant strains, there is an urgent need to discover new antimicrobial agents. Our findings suggest the use of chitosan as an enhancing agent with antibacterial and antifungal properties in combination with EDTA in pharmaceutical preparations.
TI  - Elaboration of antibiofilm materials by chemical grafting of an antimicrobial peptide.
AB  - A peptide antibiotic, gramicidin A, was covalently bound to cystamine self-assembled monolayers on gold surfaces. Each step of the surface functionalization was characterized by polarization modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The antimicrobial activity of the anchored gramicidin was tested against three Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria ivanovii, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus), the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli and the yeast Candida albicans. The results revealed that the adsorbed gramicidin reduced, from 60% for E. coli to 90% for C. albicans, the number of culturable microorganisms attached to the surface. The activity was proven to be persistent overtime, up to 6 months after the first use. The bacteria attached to the functionalized surfaces were permeabilized as shown by confocal microscopy. Taken together, these results indicate a bacteriostatic mode of action of the immobilized peptide. Finally, using green fluorescent protein-expressing bacteria, it was shown that the development of a bacterial biofilm was delayed on peptide-grafted surfaces for at least 24 h.
TI  - Synergism between maggot excretions and antibiotics.
AB  - Maggots are successfully used to treat severe, infected wounds. This study investigated whether maggot excretions/secretions influence the antibacterial activity of different antibiotics. Minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were determined of gentamicin and flucloxacillin for Staphylococcus aureus, of penicillin for Streptococcus pyogenes, of amoxicillin and vancomycin for Enterococcus faecalis, of gentamicin for Enterobacter cloacae, and of gentamicin, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin for Pseudomonas aeruginosa by checkerboard titration. A range of concentrations of antibiotics in combination with excretions/secretions was examined to investigate the potential of maggot excretions/secretions to affect antibacterial activity. The results showed a dose-dependent increase of the antibacterial effect of gentamicin in the presence of excretions/secretions on S. aureus. Minimal concentrations and MBC of gentamicin decreased, respectively, 64- and 32-fold. The MBC of flucloxacillin and excretions/secretions against S. aureus were also decreased. The other antibiotic and excretions/secretions combinations exerted an indifferent effect. Excretions/secretions alone did not have any antibacterial effect. The synergism between gentamicin and maggot excretions/secretions could be of direct importance in clinical practice, because it could allow the use of lower doses of gentamicin and thus minimize the risk of gentamicin-related side effects.
TI  - Synergy of nitric oxide and silver sulfadiazine against gram-negative, gram-positive, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
AB  - The synergistic activity between nitric oxide (NO) released from diazeniumdiolate-modified proline (PROLI/NO) and silver(I) sulfadiazine (AgSD) was evaluated against Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis using a modified broth microdilution technique and a checkerboard-type assay. The combination of NO and AgSD was defined as synergistic when the fractional bactericidal concentration (FBC) was calculated to be <0.5. Gram-negative species were generally more susceptible to the individual antimicrobial agents than the Gram-positive bacteria, while Gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible to combination therapy. The in vitro synergistic activity of AgSD and NO observed against a range of pathogens strongly supports future investigation of this therapeutic combination, particularly for its potential use in the treatment of burns and chronic wounds.
TI  - In vivo and in vitro antibacterial activity of acanthospermal B, a sesquiterpene  lactone isolated from Acanthospermum hispidum.
AB  - Acanthospermal B (AcB), the major sesquiterpene lactone (SL) of Acanthospermum hispidum, an herb widely spread in Argentina, is a selective antibacterial agent against Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus, but inactive on Gram-negative and Lactobacillus. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the main microorganisms involved in human chronic infection. A balb\c mouse skin infection model was developed to reproduce the lesions caused by acute and chronic infections produced by MRSA. After determination of the maximum concentration of AcB unable to produce tissular injury after intradermal injection, the anti-MRSA effect of AcB was evaluated on skin, liver and spleen tissues of infected mice. AcB, at doses of 2.5 mg/kg, produced a ten times decrease of MRSA growth in skin infection. In addition, the same dose prevented the dissemination to liver and/or spleen. AcB also displayed a bacteriostatic effect, in vitro, on MRSA cultures at 50 microg/mL that seems to be caused by partial denaturation of total bacterial DNA and/or inhibition of the PCR reaction in not denaturized DNA. Finally, total MRSA cell wall lysis occurred at a concentration of 100 microg/mL of AcB after 2 h of exposure.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts from Tamarindus indica L. leaves.
AB  - Tamarindus indica L. leaves are reported worldwide as antibacterial and antifungal agents; however, this observation is not completely accurate in the case of Cuba. In this article, decoctions from fresh and sun dried leaves, as well as fluid extracts prepared with 30 and 70% ethanol-water and the pure essential oil from tamarind leaves were microbiologically tested against Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomona aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Aqueous and fluid extracts were previously characterized by spectrophotometric determination of their total phenols and flavonoids, while the essential oil was chemically evaluated by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS). Experimental data suggest phenols as active compounds against B. subtilis cultures, but not against other microorganisms. On the other hand, the essential oil exhibited a good antimicrobial spectrum when pure, but its relative low concentrations in common folk preparations do not allow for any good activity in these extracts.
TI  - Effect of ceftobiprole on the normal human intestinal microflora.
AB  - Ceftobiprole is a new broad-spectrum pyrrolidinone cephem active against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Gram-negative bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of administration of ceftobiprole on the normal intestinal microflora. Twelve healthy subjects (six males and six females) aged 20-31 years received ceftobiprole 500 mg by intravenous infusion every 8h for 7 days. Plasma samples were collected on Days -1, 1, 4, 7, 10, 14 and 21 for determination of drug concentration by biological and chemical methods. Faecal samples were collected on Days -1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 14 and 21. For analysis of the microflora, faecal specimens were cultured on non-selective and selective media. Different colony types were counted, isolated in pure culture and identified to genus level. All new colonising aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were tested for susceptibility to ceftobiprole. Plasma concentrations of ceftobiprole 10 min after completion of infusion were as follows: Day 1, 14.7-23.6 mg/L; Day 4, 15.9-24.5 mg/L; and Day 7, 15.9-23.9 mg/L. No ceftobiprole was detected in plasma on Days -1, 10, 14 and 21. No measurable concentrations of ceftobiprole were found in faeces on Days -1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 14 and 21. There were minor changes in the numbers of enteric bacteria, enterococci and Candida albicans and there were moderate changes in the numbers of bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, clostridia and Bacteroides spp. during the same period. No Clostridium difficile strains or toxins were found. No new colonising aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with ceftobiprole minimum inhibitory concentrations of >/= 4 mg/L were found. Ceftobiprole had no significant ecological impact on the human intestinal microflora.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of single aroma compounds.
AB  - Commercially available aroma samples were evaluated for their olfactory quality by professional perfumers and tested for their antimicrobial activity. Agar diffusion and agar-dilution were used as test methods and a set of two Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) and four Gram-negative bacterial strains (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris G, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella abony) and a yeast, Candida albicans, were the test microorganisms. All the investigated compounds were active against Gram-positive bacteria, especially beta-caryophyllene against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC 6 ppm), but only few substances showed activity towards Gram-negative bacteria, except for cinnamic acid, which was active against all (MIC 60 ppm) and Candida albicans, against which cinnamic acid and caryophyllene oxide showed high activity (MIC < 60 ppm).
TI  - Photolysis of hydrogen peroxide, an effective disinfection system via hydroxyl radical formation.
AB  - The relationship between the amount of hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis  of H(2)O(2) and bactericidal activity was examined. H(2)O(2) (1 M) was irradiated with laser light at a wavelength of 405 nm to generate hydroxyl radicals. Electron spin resonance spin trapping analysis showed that the amount of hydroxyl radicals produced increased with the irradiation time. Four species of pathogenic oral bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Streptococcus mutans, and Enterococcus faecalis, were used in the bactericidal assay. S. mutans in a model biofilm was also examined. Laser irradiation of suspensions in 1 M H(2)O(2) resulted in a >99.99% reduction of the viable counts of each of the test species within 3 min of treatment. Treatment of S. mutans in a biofilm resulted in a >99.999% reduction of viable counts within 3 min. Other results demonstrated that the bactericidal activity was dependent on the amount of hydroxyl radicals generated. Treatment of bacteria with 200 to 300 muM hydroxyl radicals would result in reductions of viable counts of >99.99%.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of phytotherapic Uncaria tomentosa against endodontic pathogens.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of Uncaria tomentosa (Willd.) DC (cat's claw) against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans. Suspensions with 10(8) cells/ml of each microorganism were plated in triplicate on Mueller-Hinton agar. Wells in the agar were made and filled with 2% chlorhexidine (CHX) gel, 2% cat's claw (CC) gel, 2% CHX+CC, and 1% hydroxyethylcellulose (NAT) gel. Inhibition halos were measured after 24 h at 37 degrees C and differences were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. The mean diameter of the microbial growth inhibition zones of 2% CHX+CC against the tested microbial strains ranged from 21.7 to 33.5 mm. This was the most effective substance against E. faecalis and C. albicans, followed by CHX and CC. Against S. aureus, CHX+CC, CHX, and CC showed similar antimicrobial activity (P > 0.05). The results indicate that all the investigated compounds had antimicrobial activity against microorganisms frequently found in infected root-filled teeth.
TI  - Leaves Antimicrobial Activity of Glycyrrhiza glabra L.
AB  - Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra L.) is an important medicinal plant. In this study,  the antimicrobial activities of ethanolic and aqueous extracts from licorice leaves were studied compared to root extracts activities. Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans were used as test organisms. Antimicrobial activity was tested by paper disc agar diffusion and serial dilution methods in order to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The root and leave extracts showed activity against Candida albicans, and tested gram-positive bacteria in a dose dependent manner. The ethanolic extract of the leaves was the most active extract against gram-positive bacteria. Its effectiveness against strains provides hope that it can serve as an alternative therapeutic agent.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of traditional Thai herbal remedies for  aphthous ulcers.
AB  - Four medicinal plants (Quercus infectoria, Kaempferia galanga, Coptis chinensis and Glycyrrhiza uralensis) as well as one traditional Thai treatment for aphthous ulcers based on these four plants were tested for antimicrobial activity. MIC values for a range of bacteria and Candida albicans were determined, with both type strains and clinical isolates being used. Antioxidant activity was determined using the ABTS radical scavenging assay. Among the four plants, Q. infectoria showed antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus with an MIC of 0.41 mg/mL, while C. chinensis showed antifungal activity against C. albicans with an MIC of 6.25 mg/mL. Activity was also shown against a range of other organisms including Salmonella typhi, Serratia marcescens, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. The antimicrobial activity of the traditional aphthous ulcer preparation (a powder) was comparable to that for the individual plant extracts, however, incorporation of the powder into a gel formulation resulted in the loss of almost all activity. All extracts, with the exception of K. galanga, also showed good antioxidant activity. This study supports the traditional use of these plants and suggests that they may also be useful in the treatment of other infections.
TI  - Characterization of phenolic content, in vitro biological activity, and pesticide loads of extracts from white grape skins from organic and conventional cultivars.
AB  - Grape skin extracts of Riesling Vitis vinifera L. grapes from conventionally or organically managed cultivars were compared on the basis of their phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, antimicrobial and antimutagenic properties and pesticide loads. Promising results on their biological properties suggest that those extracts would be valuable as food preservatives. The antioxidant capacity of conventional extracts was significantly higher, according to the higher content in catechin, epicatechin and procyanidin B. Pesticide loads did not affect the antimutagenic or antimicrobial properties of the extracts. Both extracts inhibited the growth of Gram-positive foodborne pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium to similar extents. Possibly as a result of higher amounts of quercetin and its derivatives, higher antimicrobial effects against Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium were observed for the organic white grape skin extracts. Conventional or organic extracts did not show remarkable antimutagenic effects when tested against the mutagen IQ by means of the Ames test. Due to the presence of fungicides, the conidial germination of Penicillium expansum, Penicillium chrysogenum and Aspergillus niger, were inhibited by 95% by conventional GSE, while negligible effects were observed with organic grape extracts. The latter, however, showed inhibitory effects against Trichoderma viridie and Aspergillus versicolor.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of nemonoxacin, a novel non-fluorinated quinolone.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the in vivo antibacterial efficacy of nemonoxacin, a novel C8-methoxy non-fluorinated quinolone in murine systemic and local infection models. METHODS: The efficacy of nemonoxacin in systemic infections was evaluated in mouse peritonitis models using isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, n=1), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA, n=1), methicillin- and levofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus capitis (levofloxacin-resistant MRSC, n=1), penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP, n=1), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP, n=2), Enterococcus faecalis (n=2, including 1 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, VRE) and Escherichia coli (n=3). The local infections included mouse pulmonary infections caused by PRSP (n=1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1) and mouse ascending urinary tract infection caused by E. coli (n=1). RESULTS: In the mouse systemic infection model, nemonoxacin demonstrated potent activity against MSSA (ED(50) =2.08 mg/kg), MRSA (ED(50) =2.59 mg/kg), levofloxacin-resistant MRSC (ED(50) =2.52 mg/kg), PISP (ED(50) =5.47 mg/kg), PRSP (ED(50) =3.68-5.28 mg/kg) and E. coli (ED(50) =3.13-5.28 mg/kg), and moderate activity towards E. faecalis infection (ED(50) =8.48-15.16 mg/kg). The therapeutic efficacy of nemonoxacin was significantly higher (P<0.01) than that of levofloxacin in infections caused by Gram-positive isolates (MSSA, MRSA, levofloxacin-resistant MRSC, PISP, PRSP and E. faecalis), but less potent than that of levofloxacin against E. coli infection (P<0.01). Nemonoxacin in vivo efficacy results with Gram-positive isolates (2- to 5-fold ED(50) advantage over levofloxacin) are consistent with the MIC data (4- to 16-fold MIC advantage of nemonoxacin over levofloxacin). In the mouse pulmonary infection model, nemonoxacin showed potent activity towards PRSP (higher than levofloxacin) and K. pneumoniae (lower than levofloxacin) infections. In the mouse ascending urinary tract infection model, nemonoxacin exhibited potent activity against E. coli infection (lower than levofloxacin). CONCLUSIONS: The results validated the potent efficacy of nemonoxacin in vivo. The higher efficacy of nemonoxacin than of levofloxacin towards infections caused by Gram-positive cocci (especially MRSA, levofloxacin-resistant MRSC, PRSP and VRE) warrants investigation of its clinical use.
TI  - Antioxidant, cytoprotective and antibacterial effects of Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) leaves.
AB  - The present study was carried out to investigate the antioxidant, cytoprotective  and antibacterial effects of aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts of Hippophae rhamnoides L. (Sea buckthorn) (SBT) leaves by using various in vitro systems and analysis of marker compounds by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The chemical composition of the leaf extracts was quantified by colorimetric reaction in terms of total phenol and flavonoids contents. Further, some of its bioactive phenolic constituents, such as quercetin-3-O-galactoside, quercetin-3-O-glucoside, kaempferol and isorhamnetin were also quantified in both SBT leaf extracts by RP-HPLC. The SBT leaf extracts exhibited potent antioxidant activity determined by 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. Further, both extracts were observed to have cytoprotective activity against hydrogen peroxide and hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase induced damage to BHK-21 cell line. The SBT leaf extracts showed growth inhibiting effect against Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. These observations suggest that aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts of Sea buckthorn leaves have marked antioxidant, cytoprotective and antibacterial activities.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of selected key methyl ether derivatives of vancomycin aglycon.
AB  - A select series of methyl ether derivatives of vancomcyin aglycon were prepared and examined for antimicrobial activity against vancomycin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci faecalis as well as their binding affinity for D-Ala-D-Ala and D-Ala-D-Lac. The intent of the study was to elucidate the role selected key methyl groups may play in the improvement of the in vitro antimicrobial profile of the tetra methyl ether derivative of vancomycin aglycon against vancomycin-resistant Enterococci faecalis previously reported. In these studies, methodology for selective derivatization of the A-, B-, and D-ring was developed that defines the relative reactivity of the four phenols of vancomycin aglycon, providing a foundation for future efforts for site-directed modification of the vancomycin aglycon core.
TI  - The photodynamic effect: the comparison of chemiexcitation by luminol and phthalhydrazide.
AB  - The presence of light, oxygen and photosensitizer (organic dye) is required for the photodynamic effect. Light and photosensitizer are harmless by themselves, but when combined with oxygen, reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be produced. This photodynamic effect is used in photodynamic therapy (PDT); the production of ROS as lethal cytotoxic agents can inactivate tumor cells. However, during PDT, there are many difficulties, so it is not possible to excite the photosensitizer using a laser, a source of light at the wavelengths specific to the photosensitizer (in visible region of the spectrum). Chemiluminescence is the light emission as a result of a chemical reaction. It is possible to use a chemiluminescent mixture to excite the photosensitizer even if the light emission does not conform to the absorption maximum of the photosensitizer. Luciferin and luminol have been used as chemiluminescent compounds (energizers) for the excitation of the photosensitizers. The aim of this work was to compare the chemiexcitation of some selected photosensitizers (e.g. fluorescein, eosin, methylene blue, hypericin and phthalocyanines) by chemiluminescent mixtures containing luminol (high chemiluminescent quantum yield) or phthalhydrazide (low chemiluminescent quantum yield) on some Gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli) bacteria and some cell lines (NIH3T3 and MCF7). The efficiency of the chemiexcitation was dependent on the kind of the photosensitizer and on the type of the bacterial strain or cell line and was independent of the energizers.
TI  - Characterisation of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis mutants with  reduced susceptibility to the investigational oxazolidinone RWJ-416457.
AB  - RWJ-416457 is a novel investigational oxazolidinone with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to staphylococci and enterococci that are two- to four-fold lower than those of linezolid. Single-step and serial passage in vitro resistance selection experiments were performed for RWJ-416457 and linezolid with Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis laboratory and clinical isolates. RWJ-416457 selected for resistant mutants in single-step selections at a frequency of </=1x10(-10), similar to that of linezolid. In serial passage selection experiments, a G2576T transversion in the domain V region of the 23S rRNA gene was the predominant mutation observed for both oxazolidinones, suggesting similar 23S rRNA binding sites. The associated development of increasing oxazolidinone resistance in E. faecalis (four 23S rRNA alleles) required fewer passages than with S. aureus isolates (six 23S rRNA alleles), and resistance was generally proportionate to the number of mutated (G2576T) 23S rRNA alleles. Fold changes in MICs were similar for both compounds, and MICs for RWJ-416457 remained two- to four-fold lower than those of linezolid for mutants selected by either compound. Serial passage of linezolid with S. aureus OC 2878 yielded a novel A2572T 23S rRNA mutation, whilst the final passages of S. aureus OC 10517 with RWJ-416457 resulted in the apparent loss of a mutated (G2576T) allele 6.
TI  - X-ray crystal structure of the DNA-binding domain of response regulator WalR essential to the cell viability of staphylococcus aureus and interaction with target DNA.
AB  - A bacterial two-component signal transduction system, WalK/WalR, is essential to  the cell viability of Gram-positive bacteria and is therefore a potential target for the development of a new class of antibiotics. We have solved the X-ray crystal structure of the DNA-binding domain of the response regulator WalR (WalRc) from a Gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, currently causing serious problems in public health through the acquisition of multi-drug resistance. The structure contains a winged helix-turn-helix motif and closely resembles those of WalRs of Bacillus subtilis and Enterococcus faecalis, and also that of PhoB of Escherichia coli. Gel mobility shift assays with mutant WalRs revealed specific interactions of WalR with the target DNA, as elaborated by in silico modeling of the WalRc-DNA complex.
TI  - Diversity-oriented synthesis of cyclic acyldepsipeptides leads to the discovery of a potent antibacterial agent.
AB  - A class of cyclic acyldepsipeptide antibiotics collectively known as the enopeptins has recently attracted much attention because of their activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. These antibiotics are further distinguished by their novel mechanism of action in which they bind and deregulate the tightly controlled activity of the cytoplasmic protease ClpP. Although the natural products have poor pharmacological properties, a synthetic derivative called acyldepsipeptide 4 (ADEP 4) showed remarkable antibacterial activity both in vitro and in mouse models of bacterial infections. A novel route to the ADEP 4 peptidolactone core structure, featuring the Joullie-Ugi three-component reaction, was developed. This multicomponent reaction and a related multicomponent reaction, the Ugi four-component reaction, were used to prepare analogs that were designed using the principles of conformational analysis. These cyclic acyldepsipeptides were tested for their activity against drug-resistant, clinical isolates of Staphylococci and Enterococci. One ADEP 4 analog in which the pipecolate was replaced by 4-methyl pipecolate exhibited in vitro antibacterial activity against Enterococci that was fourfold higher than the parent compound.
TI  - Coagulase-negative staphylococcus and enterococcus as predominant pathogens in liver transplant recipients with Gram-positive coccal bacteremia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus have been a common cause of infection among liver transplant (LT) recipients in recent decades. The understanding of local epidemiology and its evolving trends with regard to pathogenic spectra and antibiotic susceptibility is beneficial to prophylactic and empiric treatment for LT recipients. This study aimed to investigate etiology, timing, antibiotic susceptibility and risk factors for multidrug resistant (MDR) Gram-positive coccal bacteremia after LT. METHODS: A cohort analysis of prospectively recorded data was performed to investigate etiologies, timing, antibiotic susceptibility and risk factors for MDR Gram-positive coccal bacteremia in 475 LT recipients. RESULTS: In 475 LT recipients in the first six months after LT, there were a total of 98 episodes of bacteremia caused by Gram-positive cocci in 82 (17%) patients. Seventy-five (77%) bacteremic episodes occurred in the first post-LT month. The most frequent Gram-positive cocci were methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CoNS, 46 isolates), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, 13) and enterococcus (34, E. faecium 30, E. faecalis 4). In all Gram-positive bacteremic isolates, 59 of 98 (60%) were MDR. Gram-positive coccal bacteremia and MDR Gram-positive coccal bacteremia predominantly occurred in patients with acute severe exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B and with fulminant/subfulminant hepatitis. Four independent risk factors for development of bacteremia caused by MDR Gram-positive coccus were: LT candidates with encephalopathy grades II - IV (P = 0.013, OR: 16.253, 95%CI: 1.822 - 144.995), pre-LT use of empirical antibiotics (P = 0.018, OR: 1.029, 95%CI: 1.002 - 1.057), post-LT urinary tract infections (P < 0.001, OR: 20.340, 95%CI: 4.135 - 100.048) and abdominal infection (P = 0.004, OR: 2.820, 95%CI: 1.122 - 10.114). The main infectious manifestations were coinfections due to gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli. CONCLUSIONS: Methicillin-resistant CoNS and enterococci are predominant pathogens among LT recipients with Gram-positive coccal bacteremia. Occurrences of Gram-positive coccal bacteremia may be associated with the severity of illness in the perioperative stage.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of stethoscopes used by health workers: public health implications.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was designed to assess both the potential for bacterial transmission by stethoscopes used by health-care workers in Nigeria and the implications for patient safety and control of hospital-acquired infections. METHODOLOGY: A structured questionnaire was administered to health workers and the surface of the diaphragm of their stethoscopes swabbed for bacteriological analysis using standard techniques. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Of the 107 stethoscopes surveyed, 84 (79%) were contaminated with bacteria; 59 (81%) of the contaminated stethoscopes belonged to physicians and 25 (74%) were from other health workers. Isolates included Staphylococcus aureus (54%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19%), Enterococcus faecalis (14%), and Escherichia coli (13%). All stethoscopes that had never been cleaned were contaminated while lower levels of contamination were found on those cleaned one week or less before the survey (chi(2) = 22.4, P < .05). Contamination was significantly higher on stethoscopes cleaned with only water (100%) compared to those cleaned with alcohol (49%) (chi(2) = 30.17, P < .05). Significantly fewer (9%) stethoscopes from health workers who washed their hands after seeing each patient were contaminated when compared with the instruments (86%) of those who did not practice hand washing (chi(2) = 23.79, P < .05). E. coli showed the highest antibiotic resistance, while S. aureus showed the highest antibiotic susceptibility. Strict adherence to stethoscope disinfection practices by health workers can minimize cross-contamination and ensure improved patient safety in hospital environments.
TI  - Fluorescence in situ hybridization rapidly detects three different pathogenic bacteria in urinary tract infection samples.
AB  - The detection of pathogenic bacteria in urine is an important criterion for diagnosing urinary tract infections (UTIs). By using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with rRNA-targeted, fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes, bacterial pathogens present in urine samples were identified within 3-4 h. In this study, three probes that are specific for Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus were designed based on the conserved 16S RNA sequences, whereas probe Eub338 broadly recognizes all bacteria. We collected a total of 1000 urine samples, and 325 of these samples tested positive for a UTI via traditional culturing techniques; additionally, all 325 of these samples tested positive with the Eub338 probe in FISH analysis. FISH analyses with species-specific probes were performed in parallel to the test the ability to differentiate among several pathogenic bacteria. The samples for these experiments included 76 E. coli infected samples, 32 E. faecalis infected samples and 9 S. aureus infected samples. Compared to conventional methods of bacterial identification, the FISH method produced positive results for >90% of the samples tested. FISH has the potential to become an extremely useful diagnostic tool for UTIs because it has a quick turnaround time and high accuracy.
TI  - Natural product derivatives with bactericidal activity against Gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - We have shown that the intentional engineering of a natural product biosynthesis  pathway is a useful way to generate stereochemically complex scaffolds for use in the generation of combinatorial libraries that capture the structural features of both natural products and synthetic compounds. Analysis of a prototype library based upon nonactic acid lead to the discovery of triazole-containing nonactic acid analogs, a new structural class of antibiotic that exhibits bactericidal activity against drug resistant, Gram-positive pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - Preservation of viability and antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus spp. in calcium alginate beads.
AB  - The objective of the study was to produce calcium alginate beads able to deliver  Lactobacillus spp. (Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Lactobacillus lactis) with preserved viability and antibacterial activity. Four types of beads, containing entrapped (E), surface and entrapped (ES), surface (S) and concentrated surface and entrapped lactobacilli (C(ES)) were prepared and physically characterized. The antibacterial activity of lactobacilli cultures before and after immobilization, freeze-drying and throughout storage was studied in relationship to the viable number of lactobacilli. Multi-resistant clinical isolates (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycine-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, VIM-2-metalo-beta-lactamase producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa and CTX-M-15-beta-lactamase producing strains: Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were used as indicator strains. Alginate beads in which lactobacilli proliferated to the beads surface (ES and C(ES)) differed significantly from the other types of beads in their physicochemical properties, showing smoother surface morphology, more spherical shape, bigger weight, lower calcium content, density and crushing force. Lactobacilli cultures, at high cell concentrations (10(8)cfu/ml) were active against both Gram-positive and negative multi-resistant bacteria. Beads containing both entrapped and surface lactobacilli (ES) resulted in viability and antibacterial activity most similar to non-processed lactobacilli cultures. The viability and antibacterial activity of the immobilized lactobacilli remained stable after 6 months storage.
TI  - Suprathel-acetic acid matrix versus acticoat and aquacel as an antiseptic dressing: an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The treatment of burn wounds is still a challenge regarding the management of antiseptic wound conditioning. Especially, in the United States, silver-containing dressings, such as Acticoat and Aquacel are frequently used. Because silver-containing dressings have well-known drawbacks such as an antimicrobial lack against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we sought to develop an alternative dressing method. In previous studies, we could demonstrate the excellent antiseptic properties of acetic acid against common burn unit germs, and in another study, the feasibility and suitability of a Suprathel-acetic acid matrix as an antiseptic dressing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial effect of a Suprathel-acetic acid matrix versus Acticoat and Aquacel. To cover the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria strains were tested: Escherichia coli, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. RESULTS: The tests showed an excellent bactericidal effect of the Suprathel-acetic acid matrix particularly with problematic Gram-negative bacteria such as Proteus vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. The efficiency was superior to that of Acicoat and Aquacel. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the notion, that the Suprathel-acetic acid matrix has an excellent bactericidal effect and therefore seems to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent in the treatment of burn wounds.
TI  - Synergistic properties of the terpenoids aromadendrene and 1,8-cineole from the essential oil of Eucalyptus globulus against antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the chemical composition of the essential oil of the fruits of Eucalyptus globulus and to examine the potential application of the fruit oil against multidrug-resistant bacteria. GLC/MS analysis in the fruit oil showed that aromadendrene was the main compound followed by 1,8-cineole and globulol. The three most abundant components of the fruit oil were also tested individually against microorganisms. In addition, the synergistic effects of combinations of the major constituents (aromadendrene and 1,8-cineole) of the fruit oil were also investigated. All Gram-positive bacteria were susceptible to the fruit oil with different degrees of susceptibility as determined by microdilution method. The oil exerted a marked inhibition against multidrug-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) Enterococcus faecalis. The results indicated that aromadendrene might be responsible for the antimicrobial properties, whereas 1,8-cineole and globulol exhibited low activities. The checkerboard assay demonstrated that combinations of 1,8-cineole and aromadendrene reduce the MIC in most cases in an additive way, whereas the time-kill assay indicates a synergistic effect.
TI  - Pitucamycin: structural merger of a phenoxazinone with an epoxyquinone antibiotic.
AB  - Chemical profiling of a Streptomyces griseus strain isolated from an old building with moisture damage led to the discovery of two novel phenoxazinones, chandrananimycin D and pitucamycin , along with the known grixazone B. Pitucamycin represents an unprecedented hybrid molecule composed of a phenoxazinone and an enaminomycin-like epoxyquinone moiety.
TI  - Total synthesis and antibiotic activity of dehydrohomoplatencin.
AB  
TI  - Seasonal variation, chemical composition, and analgesic and antimicrobial activities of the essential oil from leaves of Tetradenia riparia (Hochst.) Codd in southern Brazil.
AB  - The seasonal variation of the chemical composition of the essential oil from fresh leaves of Tetradenia riparia (Hochst.) Codd grown in southern Brazil was analyzed by GC-MS, and the analgesic and antimicrobial activities of this oil were assayed. The yield of essential oil ranged from 0.17% to 0.26%, with the maximum amount in winter and the minimum in spring. The results obtained from principal components analysis (PCA) revealed the existence of high chemical variability in the different seasons. The samples were clearly discriminated into three groups: winter, autumn, and spring-summer. Samples collected during winter contained the highest percentages of calyculone (24.70%), abietadiene (13.54%), and viridiflorol (4.20%). In autumn, the major constituents were ledol (8.74%) and cis-muurolol-5-en-4-alpha-ol (13.78%). Samples collected in spring-summer contained the highest percentages of fenchone (12.67%), 14-hydroxy-9-epi-caryophyllene (24.36%), and alpha-cadinol (8.33%). Oxygenated sesquiterpenes were predominant in all the samples analyzed. The observed chemovariation might be environmentally determined by a seasonal influence. The essential oil, when given orally at a dose of 200 mg/kg, exhibited good analgesic activity on acetic acid-induced writhing in mice, inhibiting the constrictions by 38.94% to 46.13%, and this effect was not affected by seasonal variation. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil against the bacterial strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, and Enterobacter cloacae, and the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans was assessed by the disc diffusion method and determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration. The results obtained, followed by measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), indicated that S. aureus, B. subtilis, and Candida albicans were the most sensitive microorganisms, showing largest inhibition, and the lowest MIC values varied from 15.6 to 31.2 microg/mL, 7.8 to 15.6 microg/mL, and 31.2 to 62.5 microg/mL, respectively.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial, acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activities of novel ester and hydrazide derivatives of 3(2H)-pyridazinone.
AB  - In the current study, some novel ethyl 6- [(substituted-phenylpiperazine]-3(2H)-pyridazinone-2-yl propionate III and 6-[(substituted-phenylpiperazine]-3(2H)-pyridazinone-2-yl propionohydrazide IV derivatives were synthesized as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitors. The structures of these new pyridazinone derivatives were confirmed by their IR, 1H-NMR spectra and elementary analysis. 6-Substituted-3(2H)-pyridazinone-2-yl propionate IIIa-e derivatives showed significant inhibitory activity against AChE and BChE. 6-[4-(3-Trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine]-3(2H)-pyridazinone-2-yl propionate IIIe has been found to be the most active compound in terms of inhibition of either AChE or BChE. Compound IIIe exhibited inhibitory activity close to that of galantamine (CAS 357-70-0) and did not show any selectivity between the two enzymes. Also the antimicrobial activities of III and IV derivatives have been evaluated. All III and IV derivatives exhibited poor antibacterial activities but moderate antifungal activities.
TI  - Lycopersicon esculentum seeds: an industrial byproduct as an antimicrobial agent.
AB  - Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) fruit is a widely studied matrix. However, only  few works focus their attention on its seeds, which constitute a major byproduct of the tomato processing industry. In this study the antimicrobial potential of ten different tomato seed extracts from "Bull's heart" and "Cherry" varieties were analyzed against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) bacteria and fungi (Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Trichophyton rubrum). Regarding antibacterial capacity, the different extracts were revealed to be active only against Gram-positive bacteria, E. faecalis being the most susceptible one (MIC: 2.5-10 mg/mL). Concerning antifungal activity, "Bull's heart" extracts were the most active. In a general way C. albicans was the most susceptible species (MIC: 5-10 mg/mL). The chemical composition of the extracts was also pursued, concerning organic acids, phenolics and fatty acids, in order to establish a possible relationship with the observed antimicrobial effect.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of surgical suture resembles a biofilm.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although much attention is currently directed to studying microbial biofilms on a variety of surfaces, few studies are designed to study bacterial growth on surgical suture. The purpose of this study was to compare the kinetic development of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis on five surgical suture materials and to clarify factors that might influence this growth. METHODS: Pure cultures of S. aureus and E. faecalis were incubated with five types of suture for four days using either tissue culture medium or a bacterial growth medium. Suture-associated bacteria were quantified daily. In selected experiments, the bacterial growth medium was supplemented with heparin, a substance known to promote S. aureus biofilm formation. The ultrastructure of S. aureus biofilm developing on braided suture was studied with scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus and E. faecalis were recovered in greater numbers (typically p < 0.01) from braided than from monofilament suture, and the numbers of bacteria were greater (often p < 0.01) on sutures incubated in bacterial growth medium rather than tissue culture medium. Addition of heparin 1,000 U/mL to silk or braided polyglactin 910 suture incubated three days with S. aureus resulted in greater numbers of bacteria on day one but not on subsequent days. Scanning electron microscopy showed a maturing S. aureus biofilm that developed from small clusters of cells among amorphous material and fibrillar elements to larger clusters of cells that appeared covered by more consolidated extracellular material. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial growth was favored on braided vs. monofilament suture, and heparin enhanced bacterial adherence after day one, but not at subsequent times. Staphylococcus aureus adhered to suture material and formed a structure consistent with a bacterial biofilm.
TI  - Chemical composition, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of the essential oils of Sideritis erythrantha Boiss. and Heldr. (var. erythrantha and var. cedretorum P.H. Davis) endemic in Turkey.
AB  - In the present study, chemical compositions, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of the essential oils of Sideritis erythrantha var. erythrantha (SE) and Sideritis erythrantha var. cedretorum (SC), which are endemic taxa in Turkey, were investigated. The essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). alpha-Pinene was the major component of the essential oils of SC and SE. SC essential oil was as effective as antibiotic against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), ampicillin resistant Haemophilusinfluenzae and vancomycin sensitive E. faecalis. Similarly, SE essential oil was also as effective as antibiotic against VRE and ampicillin resistant H. influenzae. Antioxidant activities of the essential oils of SC and SE were determined by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), beta-carotene/linoleic acid and reducing power. Both essential oils exhibited weak antioxidant activity. This is the first report on antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of the essential oils of SC and SE.
TI  - Biological activity of the essential oil of Kadsura longipedunculata (Schisandraceae) and its major components.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim was to determine the chemical composition of the essential oil of Kadsura longipedunculata and the biological activity of the oil and its major components. METHODS: The essential oil from stem bark of Kadsura longipedunculata was analysed by capillary gas chromatography (GLC/FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GLC/MS). The ability of the oil to reduce diphenylpicrylhydrazine (DPPH(*)) was used to evaluate the antioxidant activity. Inhibition of both lipoxygenase and prostaglandin E(2) was used to assess the anti-inflammatory activity. Antimicrobial activity was studied in vitro against a range of bacteria and fungi using diffusion and microdilution methods. Inhibition of trypanosome proliferation was assessed using resazurin as vital stain. The in-vitro cytotoxicity of the essential oil on six human cancer cell lines (HepG2, MIA PaCa-2, HeLa, HL-60, MDA-MB-231 and SW-480) was examined using the MTT assay. KEY FINDINGS: Fifty compounds, representing 97.63% of total oil, were identified. delta-Cadinene (21.79%), camphene (7.27%), borneol (6.05%), cubenol (5.12%) and delta-cadinol (5.11%) were found to be the major components of the oil. The oil exerted a good antimicrobial activity against all Gram-positive bacteria tested, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. Streptococcus pyogenes and S. agalactiae were the most sensitive bacteria with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 60 microg/ml oil. The essential oil showed a moderate fungicidal activity against yeasts, but it did not show any activity against Gram-negative bacteria. The essential oil showed a good trypanocidal activity in Trypanosoma b. brucei with an IC50 value of 50.52 +/- 0.029 microg/ml. Radical scavenging activity had an IC50 value of 3.06 +/- 0.79 mg/ml. 5-Lipoxygenase inhibition (IC50 = 38.58 microg/ml) and prostaglandin E(2) production inhibition (28.82% at 25 microg/ml) accounted for anti-inflammatory activity of the oil. The oil exhibited some degree of cytotoxic activity against MIA PaCa-2, HepG-2 and SW-480 cell lines with IC50 values of 133.53, 136.96 and 136.62 microg/ml, respectively. The oil increased caspase 3/7 activity (an indicator of apoptosis) 2.5-4 fold in MIA Paca-2 cells. Camphene and borneol did not show antioxidant activity. However, both compounds exhibited some degree of antimicrobial, trypanocidal, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activity. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation provided evidence for, and confirmed the efficacy of, K. longipedunculata, a traditionally used Chinese medicinal plant for the treatment of inflammation and infection.
TI  - Dissemination of an Enterococcus Inc18-Like vanA plasmid associated with vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Of the 9 vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) cases reported to date in the literature, 7 occurred in Michigan. In 5 of the 7 Michigan VRSA cases, an Inc18-like vanA plasmid was identified in the VRSA isolate and/or an associated vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) isolate from the same patient. This plasmid may play a critical role in the emergence of VRSA. We studied the geographical distribution of the plasmid by testing 1,641 VRE isolates from three separate collections by PCR for plasmid-specific genes traA, repR, and vanA. Isolates from one collection (phase 2) were recovered from surveillance cultures collected in 17 hospitals in 13 states. All VRE isolates from 2 Michigan institutions (n = 386) and between 60 and 70 VRE isolates (n = 883) from the other hospitals were tested. Fifteen VRE isolates (3.9%) from Michigan were positive for an Inc18-like vanA plasmid (9 E. faecalis [12.5%], 3 E. faecium [1.0%], 2 E. avium, and 1 E. raffinosus). Six VRE isolates (0.6%) from outside Michigan were positive (3 E. faecalis [2.7%] and 3 E. faecium [0.4%]). Of all E. faecalis isolates tested, 6.0% were positive for the plasmid, compared to 0.6% for E. faecium and 3.0% for other spp. Fourteen of the 15 plasmid-positive isolates from Michigan had the same Tn1546 insertion site location as the VRSA-associated Inc18-like plasmid, whereas 5 of 6 plasmid-positive isolates from outside Michigan differed in this characteristic. Most plasmid-positive E. faecalis isolates demonstrated diverse patterns by PFGE, with the exception of three pairs with indistinguishable patterns, suggesting that the plasmid is mobile in nature. Although VRE isolates with the VRSA-associated Inc18-like vanA plasmid were more common in Michigan, they remain rare. Periodic surveillance of VRE isolates for the plasmid may be useful in predicting the occurrence of VRSA.
TI  - Spectral, thermal and in vitro antimicrobial studies of cyclohexylamine-N-dithiocarbamate transition metal complexes.
AB  - Transition metal complexes of the type [M(L)(2)] and those containing monodentate phosphines of the type [M(L)(2)(PPh(3))] {M=Ni, Co, Cu and Zn; L=cyclohexylamine-N-dithiocarbamate; PPh(3)=triphenylphosphine} have been synthesized. The complexes were characterized using IR, UV-vis, NMR spectroscopy, and thermal analysis (TGA). The (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and (31)P NMR showed the expected signals for the dithiocarbamate and triphenylphosphine moieties. The spectral studies in all compounds revealed that the coordination of metals occurs via the sulphur atom of the dithiocarbamate ligand in a bidentate fashion. Thermal behavior of the complexes showed that the complexes were more stable than their parent ligands. The ligand moiety is lost in the first step and the rest of the organic moiety decomposes in the subsequent steps. Furthermore, the ligand and their metal complexes were screened in vitro for their antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus and antifungal activities against Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus carbonarius, Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus fumigatus. The metal complexes exhibited higher antimicrobial activity than the parent ligands. Generally, the zinc complexes were effective against the growth of bacteria with Zn(L)(2) displaying broad spectrum bacteriocidal activity at concentrations of 50microg/mL; and Ni(L)(2) was more effective against the growth of fungi at concentrations of 100-400microg/mL under laboratory conditions.
TI  - [Investigation of distribution of bacteria and fungi in severe acute pancreatitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spectrum of bacteria and fungi in different sites in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). METHODS: The prospective study was performed in 205 patients with SAP treated from January 2000 to December 2008. The Infection rate of bacteria and fungi was observed prospectively in pancreatic necrosis and(or) pus form abdomen, body fluids and deep vein catheter in SAP. Body fluids and pancreatic necrosis were cultured twice a week. Central venous catheter was cultured when it had been placed for two weeks. Blood was cultured for bacteria and fungi when body temperature was more than 39 degrees C. Constituent ratio of bacteria and fungi was observed in different sites and in all sites within 28 days after onset of SAP. RESULTS: There were 937 pathogens, among which infection rates of gram-negative bacteria was higher than gram-positive bacteria and fungi (P < 0.05), the infection rates of gam-positive bacteria and fungi were similar. Infection rates of gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis (55.2%), bile (55.4%), blood (68.1%) and central venous catheter (44.4%) were increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-positive bacteria and (30.2%, 33.9%, 23.4%, 38.9%) and fungi (14.6%, 10.7%, 8.5%, 16.7%); however, infection rate of fungi (59.6%) was increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-negative bacteria (24.0%) and gram-positive bacteria (16.3%) in urine; infection rate of gram-negative bacteria (53.2%) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of fungi (27.1%) and gram-positive bacteria (19.7%) in sputum. Infection rate of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) in gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis, bile, blood, central venous catheter and sputum was significantly higher than that of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae) (P < 0.01); infection rate of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli) was higher significantly (P < 0.01) than that of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii). Infection rate of staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium in pancreatic necrosis and sputum;but infection rate of Enterococcus faecium in bile and urine was significantly higher than other gram-positive bacteria (P < 0.05). There was not difference among gram-positive bacteria;however, infection rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis in central venous catheter was increased significantly (P < 0.05). Infection rate of candida mycoderma in pancreatic necrosis, bile, urine and sputum was significantly higher than that of tricho bacteria (P < 0.05). The peak of infection rate of microbes in body fluid was within 2 to 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Constituent ratio in gram-negative, gram-positive bacteria and fungi as well as their species in different sites is diverse. The peak of infection rate of microbes is 2 to 3 weeks after onset of the disease.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of extracts from plants of central Argentina--isolation of an active principle from Achyrocline satureioides.
AB  - The great increase in bacterial infections is fueling interest in the search for  antibacterial products of plant origin. Extracts obtained from 51 native and naturalized plants from central Argentina were therefore evaluated for their IN VITRO inhibitory activity on pathogenic bacteria with the aim of selecting the most active ones as new sources of effective antibiotics. The susceptibility of reference and clinical strains of Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, and Staphylococcus aureus was determined. Extracts from Achyrocline satureioides, Flourensia oolepis, Lepechinia floribunda, and Lithrea molleoides were the most potent, with MIC and MBC values ranging from 0.006 to 2 and 0.012 to 10 mg/mL, respectively, on both gram-positive and negative bacteria. The antibacterial activity-guided isolation of A. satureioides ethanol extract showed 23-methyl-6-O-desmethylauricepyrone (1) to be the most active compound. This compound showed inhibitory effects against gram-positive bacteria with MIC and MBC values of 0.002 and 0.008 mg/mL, respectively, while on gram-negative strains, the MIC and MBC were 0.062-0.250 and 0.062-0.500 mg/mL, respectively. The strong antibacterial activity shown by the four plant extracts or the compound isolated from A. satureioides suggests that they could become part of the arsenal of antibacterial drugs currently used.
TI  - Worldwide summary of telavancin spectrum and potency against Gram-positive pathogens: 2007 to 2008 surveillance results.
AB  - Telavancin was approved in the United States and Canada for the treatment of adult patients with complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSI) caused by susceptible Gram-positive isolates. In this study, telavancin and comparator antimicrobial activities were determined against a total of 24,017 clinical isolates, including Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (CoNS), Enterococcus spp., and various Streptococcus spp. Overall, telavancin was highly active across all geographic regions for S. aureus (MIC(50/90), 0.12/0.25 microg/mL; 100.0% susceptible), CoNS (MIC(50/90), 0.12/0.25 microg/mL), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 microg/mL; 100.0% susceptible), Enterococcus faecium (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.12 microg/mL), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(50/90), < or =0.015/0.03 microg/mL), viridans group Streptococcus spp. (MIC(50/90), 0.03/0.06 microg/mL; 100.0% susceptible), and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. (MIC(50/90), 0.03/0.12 microg/mL; 99.8% susceptible). Telavancin had potent activity against vancomycin-nonsusceptible, teicoplanin-susceptible (VanB) E. faecalis (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 microg/mL) and E. faecium (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.25 microg/mL). These in vitro results show continued activity for telavancin, which represents an important alternative available for treating cSSSI.
TI  - Prevalence and clinical outcome of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis: a prospective observational study in central part of Croatia.
AB  - Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a serious complication of liver cirrhosis and is defined as infected ascites in the absence of any recognizable secondary cause of infection. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence, incidence, pathogens and clinical outcome of SBP. This prospective observational study included 108 cirrhotic patients with ascites treated during 18 months. Patients were divided into two groups according to diagnostic criteria of SBP: SBP group (n=23) and non-SBP group (n=85). Differences in clinical outcomes between the two groups were analyzed, including mortality rate, incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, bacteremia/sepsis and frequency of rehospitalization. The pathogens responsible for SBP were analyzed in SBP group. The prevalence of SBP was 21% and incidence 14.1% per year. Statistically significant between-group differences were recorded in mortality (26% vs. 4.7%; P=0.017), incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding (39% vs. 11.7%; P=0.015) and rehospitalization frequency (47.8% vs. 20%; P=0.05). The incidence of sepsis following episode of gastrointestinal bleeding was similar in both groups (55.5% vs. 50%; P=0.892). The following pathogens were responsible for SBP: Escherichia coli (n=7), MRSA (n=2), Acinetobacter spp. (n=2), Staphylococcus aureus (n=1), Streptococcus spp. (n=1), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=1) and Enterococcus faecalis (n=1). As indicated by study results, the incidence and mortality of SBP were high. Patients with liver cirrhosis and gastrointestinal hemorrhage were found to be at a high risk of developing sepsis with or without clinically proven SBP. The pathogens responsible for SBP were mostly gram-negative microorganisms; however, there were also a significant proportion of gram-positive microorganisms and hospital infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Study results suggested the spectrum of pathogens to change due to the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria within the hospital setting.
TI  - Antioxidant and antibacterial activities on foodborne pathogens of Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam. (Moraceae) leaves extracts.
AB  - Total water extract, ethyl acetate, and aqueous fractions from the leaves of Artocarpus heterophyllus were evaluated for phenolic content, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities against some foodborne pathogens such as E. coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enterica, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs) of extract and fractions determined by the agar dilution method were ranged from 221.9 microg/mL for ethyl acetate fraction to 488.1 microg/mL for total extract. In the agar diffusion method the diameters of inhibition were 12.2 for the total extract, 10.7 and 11.5 for ethyl acetate and aqueous fractions, respectively. A. heterophyllus showed significant antioxidant activity tested in different in vitro systems (DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, and Fe(2+) chelating activity assay). In particular, in DPPH assay A. heterophyllus total extract exhibited a strong antiradical activity with an IC(50) value of 73.5 microg/mL while aqueous fraction exerted the highest activity in FRAP assay (IC(50) value of 72.0 microg/mL). The total phenols content by Folin-Ciocalteau method was determined with the purpose of testing its relationship with the antioxidant and antibacterial activities.
TI  - High level expression and purification of antimicrobial human cathelicidin LL-37  in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 is a cationic peptide with antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms. This work describes the development of an expression system based on Escherichia coli capable of high production of the recombinant LL-37. The fusion protein Trx-LL-37 was expressed under control of T7 promoter. The expression of T7 polymerase in the E. coli strain constructed in this work was controlled by regulation mechanisms of the arabinose promoter. The expression plasmid was stabilized by the presence of parB locus which ensured higher homology of the culture during cultivation without antibiotic selection pressure. This system was capable of producing up to 1 g of fusion protein per 1 l of culture. The subsequent semipreparative HPLC allowed us to isolate 40 mg of pure LL-37. LL-37 showed high antimicrobial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms. Its activity against Candida albicans was practically nonexistent. Minimal Inhibition Concentration (MIC) determined for E. coli was 1.65 microM; for Staphylococcus aureus 2.31 microM, and for Enterococcus faecalis 5.54 microM. The effects of cathelicidin on E. coli included the ability to permeabilize both cell membranes, as could be observed by the increase of beta-galactosidase activity in extracellular space in time. Physiological changes were studied by scanning electron microscopy; Gram-positive microorganisms did not show any visible changes in cell shapes while the changes observed on E. coli cells were evident. The results of this work show that the herein designed expression system is capable of producing adequate quantities of active human antimicrobial peptide LL-37.
TI  - Synthesis, structure and in vitro antibacterial activities of new hybrid disinfectants quaternary ammonium compounds: pyridinium and quinolinium stilbene benzenesulfonates.
AB  - The series of pyridinium (1-10) and quinolinium (11-20) stilbene benzenesulfonates have been synthesized and their structures were investigated by UV-vis, FT-IR and (1)H NMR spectroscopy. In addition, compound 5 was also determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction technique. The antibacterial activity of the synthesized compounds against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria has been determined. The quinolinium derivatives exhibited two very potent characteristic activities, namely, (i) specific activity to Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus and (ii) with broad band spectrum activity. Compounds 11, 13 and 14 are the most active showing broad spectrum antibacterial activity against gram-positive (Methicillin-Resistant S. aureus, S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecalis) and gram-negative bacterium (Shigella sonnei). The MICs of these compounds were found to be better than that of Benzalkonium chloride (BZK), the commercially used disinfectant.
TI  - Evaluation of the efficacy of chemical disinfectants for disinfection of heat-polymerised acrylic resin.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the efficacy of disinfectants on the internal aspect of heat-polymerised acrylic resin contaminated with microbial strains. BACKGROUND: Dentures absorb oral fluids and become contaminated by different microorganisms. METHODS: Two hundred and fifty rectangular specimens were made of heat-polymerised acrylic resin, and then divided into five groups corresponding to the microbial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, S. mutans and Enterococcus faecalis). After contamination, the specimens were immersed in 1 and 2% sodium hypochlorite and 2% glutaraldehyde for periods of 5, 10 and 15 min. The specimens were placed into tubes containing different broths and incubated at 35 degrees C and then visually analysed. Turbidity in the medium indicated microbial growth. The Fisher's exact test was used in the analysis of the results. RESULTS: The strain E. faecalis was the most resistant to the disinfectant solutions, and among them, glutaraldehyde was more effective than 2 and 1% hypochlorite for disinfection for 5 min; in the 10-min period there were no differences between the disinfectants. In 15 min of immersion, 1% hypochlorite and glutaraldehyde were more effective than 2% hypochlorite. CONCLUSIONS: Disinfection for 10 min with 1% hypochlorite and glutaraldehyde is effective in disinfecting the internal aspect of heat-polymerised acrylic resin.
TI  - [Clinical relevance of time-to-positivity in BACTEC9240 blood culture system].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous monitoring systems have allowed determination of the time-to-positivity (TTP). We evaluated the clinical relevance of TTP in the BACTEC9240 system (Becton-Dickinson, USA). METHODS: A total of 2,354 vials of positive blood cultures were evaluated over 2 months. TTP was monitored from each of BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F (BD) or Pediatric Plus/F and Lytic Anaerobic/F bottles, and the differential time-to-positivity (DTP) for blood samples drawn simultaneously via catheter and a peripheral site was determined. RESULTS: The average TTP of the positive vials was 17.4 hr, and 79.9% and 95.2% of the vials showed positivity within 24 and 48 hr, respectively. While the average TTP values for Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were less than 10 hr, those for Candida spp., anaerobes, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium spp, Bacillus spp. other than cereus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were 35.3, 27.0, 56.8, 45.8, 23.0, and 26.3 hr, respectively. The negative predictive values of TTP over 24 hr to predict Staphylococcus aureus among staphylococci and S. pneumoniae among alpha-hemolytic streptococci were 76.7% and 100%, respectively. Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus faecalis showed shorter TTP in anaerobic vials than in aerobic vials. DTP of more than 2 hr was observed for 27.8%, 72.2%, and 45.5% of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Candida spp. CONCLUSIONS: TTP can be used to discriminate pathogens and contaminants. The shorter TTP in anaerobic vials of certain Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus spp. would facilitate further identification. DTP is useful for diagnosing catheter-related bloodstream infection by S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Candida spp.
TI  - Linum usitatissimum (linseed/flaxseed) fixed oil: antimicrobial activity and efficacy in bovine mastitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: In vitro antimicrobial activity and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of L. usitatissimum (linseed/flaxseed) fixed oil in bovine mastitis were investigated. METHOD: In vitro antimicrobial activity of L. usitatissimum fixed oil was evaluated against a number of microorganisms by disc diffusion method and MIC determination. The in vivo efficacy of the oil was evaluated in nine mastitis-affected cows divided into three groups (three in each group), following once-a-day intramammary infusion of oil, cefoperazone or an oil-cefoperazone combination for 7 days and by monitoring the California mastitis test score, somatic cell count and microbial count in milk samples. RESULTS: The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the oil against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Escherichia coli was comparable to that of cefoperazone while the antimicrobial activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus and Candida albicans, was greater than that of cefoperazone. In the in vivo study, the oil exhibited significant reduction in the California mastitis test score and somatic cell count in milk samples from infected udders following 7 days of intramammary administration suggesting its anti-inflammatory effect. The microbial count in milk samples was also reduced significantly following oil treatment. The effects were comparable to the treatment by cefoperazone (Mastiwock) alone or in combination with the oil. Apparently, the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of the oil contribute to its therapeutic efficacy in mastitis; the oil could be used as an alternative treatment for bovine mastitis CONCLUSION: The results suggest possible therapeutic potential of L. usitatissimum fixed oil in bovine mastitis.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 2 against nosocomial strains.
AB  - Human beta-defensin 2 (hBD-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. We determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hBD-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. The native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hBD-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hBD-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. Characteristically, A. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (MDR) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hBD-2 (vLD(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-MDR (wild-type) A. baumannii strains (vLD(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). Bactericidal activity of hBD-2 was less pronounced against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. These observations give indications that the natural hBD-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting MDR phenotypes.
TI  - Effects of myrcia ovata cambess. Essential oil on planktonic growth of gastrointestinal microorganisms and biofilm formation of enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The essential oil from the leaves of Myrcia ovata Cambess., commonly used in Brazil for the treatment of gastric illnesses, was screened for antimicrobial activity and action in the formation of microbial biofilms by Enterococcus faecalis. The oil was obtained by hydrodistillation using a clevenger-type system. Its chemical composition was analyzed using GC and GC-MS. Both MIC and MBC of the essential oil were determined by broth microdilution techniques and agar dilution method. The essential oil showed antimicrobial activity against E. faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella choleraesuis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Candida parapsilosis. The results showed that the essential oil of M. ovata Cambess. was effective against the formation of biofilm by E. faecalis when compared with the control. Four volatile compounds, representing 92.1 % of the oil, were identified and geranial was the major component (50.4 %). At the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from leaves of M. ovata.
TI  - Inactivation of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis by a direct-current, cold atmospheric-pressure air plasma microjet.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A direct-current, cold atmospheric-pressure air plasma microjet (PMJ)  was performed to inactivate Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) in air. The process of sterilization and morphology of bacteria was observed. We wish to know the possible inactivation mechanisms of PMJ and explore a potential application in dental and other temperature sensitive treatment. METHODS: In this study, we employed a direct current, atmospheric pressure, cold air PMJ to inactivate bacterias. Scanning electron microscopy was employed to evaluate the morphology of S. aureus and showed rupture of cell walls after the plasma treatment and Optical emission spectrum (OES) were used to understand the possible inactivation mechanisms of PMJ. RESULTS: The inactivation rates could reach 100% in 5 min. When the distance between the exit nozzle of the PMJ device and Petri dish was extended from 1 cm to 3 cm, effective inactivation was also observed with a similar inactivation curve. CONCLUSION: The inactivation of bacteria is attributed to the abundant reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, as well as ultroviolet radiation in the plasma. Different life spans and defensibilities of these killing agents may hold the key to understanding the different inactivation curves at different treatment distances.
TI  - Surgical treatment of infectious spondylitis in patients undergoing hemodialysis  therapy.
AB  - Treatment of infectious spondylitis in hemodialysis patients remains a challenge  because of comorbidities. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on the clinical manifestations and surgical outcomes of patients with spinal infection. Sixteen patients who underwent surgical intervention were included. There were 3 thoracic and 13 lumbar lesions. All patients presented with intractable back pain at the start of treatment. Six patients had a fever, nine had inflammation at the hemodialysis access site, and six of them had concomitant bacteremia. Ten patients had an elevated leukocyte count. Serological tests indicated an elevation of the C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate level in all patients. Five patients had a neurological compromise. Postoperative complications included two mortalities, two iliac bone graft and implant dislodgement, and one retroperitoneal wound dehiscence. The preoperative mean visual analog scale score was 7.7 (range, 6-9), which improved to 3.4 (range, 2-5) at the final follow-up for 14 surviving patients. Neurological improvement was obtained by at least one grade in four Frankel C category patients. The radiographs revealed a good bony fusion in 12 cases although with a variable bone graft subsidence. In conclusion, early diagnosis of infectious spondylitis is difficult due to latent symptoms. A spine infection should be suspected in hemodialysis patients with severe back pain, even when they are afebrile. Surgical intervention for infectious spondylitis in ESRD patients undergoing hemodialysis can be performed with acceptable outcomes; however, the complication and mortality rates are relative high.
TI  - Evaluation of the epinecidin-1 peptide as an active ingredient in cleaning solutions against pathogens.
AB  - We tested the activity of epinecidin-1, a novel antimicrobial peptide structurally related to pleurocidin, in commercial cleaning solutions stored at 4 and 25 degrees C for 7 and 14 days. The peptide's activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Propionibacterium acnes, and Candida albicans were measured in a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination, minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) determination, disk diffusion test, and a count of the bacterial numbers. Exposure to epinecidn-1 in a cleaning solution following MIC value comparisons in the disk diffusion test and counts of bacterial numbers after 16, 24, 48, and 72 h suggested that bacterial numbers were much lower than those treated with only commercial cleaning solutions for all bacteria. The efficacy of the antimicrobial activities of inhibiting bacterial numbers by epinecidin-1 in cleaning solutions at a low pH and a low temperature was not affected. Given its simple structure and antimicrobial activity, epinecidin-1 may be a useful component of microbicides designed to prevent pathogen infections and/or remediate abnormal vaginal or skin flora.
TI  - Mobile genetic elements and their contribution to the emergence of antimicrobial  resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) including plasmids and transposons are pivotal in  the dissemination and persistence of antimicrobial resistance in Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Enterococcal MGEs have also been shown to be able to transfer resistance determinants to more pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus. Despite their importance, we have a limited knowledge about the prevalence, distribution and genetic content of specific MGEs in enterococcal populations. Molecular epidemiological studies of enterococcal MGEs have been hampered by the lack of standardized molecular typing methods and relevant genome information. This review focuses on recent developments in the detection of MGEs and their contribution to the spread of antimicrobial resistance in clinically relevant enterococci.
TI  - Standardized comparison of antiseptic efficacy of triclosan, PVP-iodine, octenidine dihydrochloride, polyhexanide and chlorhexidine digluconate.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study presents a comparative investigation of the antimicrobial  efficacy of the antiseptics PVP-iodine, triclosan, chlorhexidine, octenidine and polyhexanide used for pre-surgical antisepsis and antiseptic treatment of skin, wounds and mucous membranes based on internationally accepted standards. METHODS: MICs and MBCs were determined in accordance with DIN 58940-7 and 58940-8 using Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, Haemophilus influenzae and Candida albicans. The microbicidal efficacy was determined in accordance with DIN EN 1040 and 1275 using S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans. RESULTS: For chlorhexidine, octenidine and polyhexanide, MIC(48) and MBC(24) ranged from 16 to 32 mg/L. Maximum values for triclosan ranged from 256 to 512 mg/L, with an efficacy gap against P. aeruginosa, while the maximum values of PVP-iodine were 1024 mg/L, with a gap against S. pneumoniae. Comparing the minimal effective concentrations, octenidine was most effective. After 1 min, only octenidine and PVP-iodine fulfil the requirements for antiseptics. CONCLUSIONS: Tests under standardized and harmonized conditions help to choose the most efficacious agent. When a prolonged contact time is feasible, ranking of agents would be polyhexanide = octenidine > chlorhexidine > triclosan > PVP-iodine. This is consistent with the recommendations for antisepsis of acute wounds. Polyhexanide seems to be preferable for chronic wounds due to its higher tolerability. If an immediate effect is required, ranking would be octenidine = PVP-iodine>> polyhexanide > chlorhexidine > triclosan.
TI  - [Fosfomycin: past, present and future].
AB  - The continuously increasing problem of multidrug-resistant (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and/or metallo-beta-lactamase producing) bacteria in recent years has created the need to re-evaluate antibiotic therapy for these infections. Fosfomycin is reconsidered to be an alternative treatment agent for such infections. Fosfomycin was first discovered in Spain in 1969 from cultures of Streptomyces species and originally called phosphonomycin. In the early years, fosfomycin was administered parenterally to the patients with many serious infections including meningitis. In some European countries, fosfomycin is occasionally administered for the initial empirical therapy of sepsis or soft-tissue infections. Although in most European countries fosfomycin has been used for many years, it has become available in clinical use only recently in Turkey. In USA, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved fosfomycin only for the treatment of patients with uncomplicated cystitis. The use of fosfomycin in the treatment of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections and in the treatment of pediatric cancer patients with fever and neutropenia in combination with other antibiotics, has withdrawn attention to this agent. Fosfomycin has a rapid bactericidal effect and a wide antibacterial spectrum, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, glycopeptide-susceptible or resistant enterococci and a large number of gram-negative pathogens. Since it has a long serum half-life and high concentrations are achieved in urine after oral administration; fosfomycin deserved further consideration for single-dose treatment of urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coil and Enterococcus faecalis. In this review article the properties, mechanisms of action and resistance, antibacterial spectrum, clinical use, toxicity and adverse reactions of fosfomycin have been summarized.
TI  - A type III-like restriction endonuclease functions as a major barrier to horizontal gene transfer in clinical Staphylococcus aureus strains.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is an versatile pathogen that can cause life-threatening infections. Depending on the clinical setting, up to 50% of S. aureus infections are caused by methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA) that in most cases are resistant to many other antibiotics, making treatment difficult. The emergence of community-acquired MRSA drastically changed the picture by increasing the risk of MRSA infections. Horizontal transfer of genes encoding for antibiotic resistance or virulence factors is a major concern of multidrug-resistant S. aureus infections and epidemiology. We identified and characterized a type III-like restriction system present in clinical S. aureus strains that prevents transformation with DNA from other bacterial species. Interestingly, our analysis revealed that some clinical MRSA strains are deficient in this restriction system, and thus are hypersusceptible to the horizontal transfer of DNA from other species, such as Escherichia coli, and could easily acquire a vancomycin-resistance gene from enterococci. Inactivation of this restriction system dramatically increases the transformation efficiency of clinical S. aureus strains, opening the field of molecular genetic manipulation of these strains using DNA of exogenous origin.
TI  - Observations on the incidence and aetiology of valvular endocarditis in broiler breeders and detection of a newly described taxon of Pasteurellaceae, Avibacterium endocarditidis.
AB  - A total of 122 dead broiler breeders randomly selected from a flock showing normal production parameters and covering the age from 44 to 61 weeks were subjected to a comprehensive routine post-mortem examination including examination for lesions of endocarditis. Forty-two hens (34%) showed valvular endocarditis caused by Avibacterium endocarditidis (43%), Enterococcus faecalis (31%), Staphylococcus aureus (5%) and Streptococcus pluranimalium (5%), while growth was not obtained from 17% with the methods used for isolation. Gross lesions associated with the different bacterial pathogens did not allow separation according to pathogens involved. Port of entry and pathogenesis associated with the high prevalence of valvular endocarditis remained speculative. The present findings demonstrated the newly described species of Pasteurellaceae, Avibacterium endocarditidis associated with endocarditis in chickens and confirm previous observations on the prevalence of endocarditis in chickens, partly explaining the slightly increased mortality normally observed in broiler breeders during the last weeks of production.
TI  - Defensin of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha): molecular structure, in vitro expression, antimicrobial activity, and potential functions.
AB  - A 409 bp full length defensin gene was cloned and sequenced based on an expressed sequence tag (EST) obtained from a normalized zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) foot cDNA library developed in our laboratory. The D. polymorpha defensin (Dpd) gene encoded a peptide with 76 amino acid residues. The mature Dpd contains 54 amino acids with a fully functional insect defensin A domain. Homologue searching against GenBank database suggested that this Dpd was phylogenetically close to defensins from a group of insects with six conserved cysteine residues. Predicted with homology-modeling method, the three-dimensional structure of Dpd also demonstrated a significant similarity with insect defensin A. The recombinant Dpd was in vitro expressed through an Escherichia coli expression system. The antimicrobial activities of the refolded recombinant Dpd were found against the growth of Morganella sp., Plesiomonas shigelloides, Edwardsiella tarda, E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus aureus (ATCC12598) with the minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) 0.35, 0.43, 1.16, 6.46, and 30.39 microM, respectively. However, with less than 50 microM no detectable inhibition activities were observed against the other four Gram-negative bacteria (Aeromonas salmonicida salmonicida, Motile Aeromonas, Flavobacterium sp., Pseudomonas fluorescens, Shewanella putrifaciens), as well as the other Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus megaterium ATCC14581, Carnobacterium maltaromaticum ATCC27865, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC19433, and Micrococcus leteus ATCC4698), and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) of Dpd in the zebra mussel suggested that the Dpd was expressed in a variety of tissues, such as foot, retractor muscle, ctenidium, mantle, hemocytes, gonad, digestive gland, and intestine. By using the quantitative PCR, the expression level of Dpd in the zebra mussel foot was the highest, followed by the muscle. By comparing the amount of Dpd transcripts in the zebra mussel foot under two different byssogenesis conditions (byssogenesis and non-byssogenesis) with qPCR, we found that the higher expression levels of Dpd were always associated with the byssogenesis status from 2 to 4 days after the start of byssogenesis. Findings of this study suggest that the expression of the Dpd gene was upregulated in vivo by byssogeneis, and by hemocytes in vitro upon stimulation with microbial antigens.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils from flowers of Senecio othonnae, s. racemosus, and s. nemorensis.
AB  - The chemical composition of the essential oils of Senecio othonnae, S. racemosus, and S. nemorensis obtained by hydrodistillation of fresh flowers were analysed by GC-FID and GC-MS. A total of seventy-six compounds were identified, constituting over 83.1%, 97.7% and 86.8% of the total oil composition of the flowers of S. othonnae, S. racemosus, and S. nemorensis. The main components of the oils were caryophyllene oxide (18.6%), (E)-beta-farnesene (21.6%), and gamma-curcumene (42.8%), respectively. Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were the main group of constituents of all three species, forming 34.6%, 73.2%, and 81.8% of the oils, respectively. The oils of S. othonnae, and S. nemorensis showed antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida tropicalis, but that of S. racemosus was only active against Candida tropicalis.
TI  - Isolation of bacteriocin-like substances producing bacteria from finished cattle-manure compost and activity evaluation against some food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria.
AB  - A finished compost sample was examined for bacteriocin-like substance production  against five pathogenic bacteria: Salmonella typhimurium EF 85-9, Escherichia coli O157:H7 ATCC 43888, Enterococcus faecalis JCM 8726, Staphylococcus aureus JCM 2151, and Yersinia enterocolitica JCM 7577. At the preliminary detection of bacterial strains exhibiting antimicrobial activity from the compost sample, thirteen strains could be isolated. Screening of the inhibitory activity was done using agar-well diffusion assay and Microtiter plate growth assay. Six bacterial strains from the compost showed an antimicrobial activity against one or more of the tested indicator strains. Four strains (M1-M4) belonged to Shigella species and the other two strains (M5 and M6) belonged to Salmonella species. The antimicrobial activity was sensitive for alpha-chymotrypsin and papain. The antimicrobial substances from M3, M4 and M6 were heat stable when heated for 15 min at 121 degrees C with 100% relative activity. The bacteriocin-like substance produced by strain M2 was partially characterized. It exhibited an inhibitory activity against the tested food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, except Enterobacter aerogenes JCM 1235 and Lactobacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum JCM 1149. It was stable at a wide range of pH (3-11). There was no loss of activity for up to 3 weeks when stored at 4 and -20 degrees C or for up to 2 weeks when stored at 28 and -80 degrees C. This is the first report indicating the presence of bacteriocin-like activity in animal manure compost.
TI  - Berberine-INF55 (5-nitro-2-phenylindole) hybrid antimicrobials: effects of varying the relative orientation of the berberine and INF55 components.
AB  - Hybrid antimicrobials containing an antibacterial linked to a multidrug resistance (MDR) pump inhibitor make up a promising new class of agents for countering efflux-mediated bacterial drug resistance. This study explores the effects of varying the relative orientation of the antibacterial and efflux pump inhibitor components in three isomeric hybrids (SS14, SS14-M, and SS14-P) which link the antibacterial alkaloid and known substrate for the NorA MDR pump berberine to different positions on INF55 (5-nitro-2-phenylindole), an inhibitor of NorA. The MICs for all three hybrids against wild-type, NorA-knockout, and NorA-overexpressing Staphylococcus aureus cells were found to be similar (9.4 to 40.2 microM), indicating that these compounds are not effectively effluxed by NorA. The three hybrids were also found to have similar curing effects in a Caenorhabditis elegans live infection model. Each hybrid was shown to accumulate in S. aureus cells to a greater extent than either berberine or berberine in the presence of INF55, and the uptake kinetics of SS14 were found to differ from those of SS14-M and SS14-P. The effects on the uptake and efflux of the NorA substrate ethidium bromide into S. aureus cells in the presence or absence of the hybrids were used to confirm MDR inhibition by the hybrids. MDR-inhibitory activity was confirmed for SS14-M and SS14-P but not for SS14. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that SS14 prefers to adopt a conformation that is not prevalent in either SS14-M or SS14-P, which may explain why some properties of SS14 diverge from those of its two isomers. In summary, subtle repositioning of the pump-blocking INF55 moiety in berberine-INF55 hybrids was found to have a minimal effect on their antibacterial activities but to significantly alter their effects on MDR pumps.
TI  - Functional and structural analysis of a key region of the cell wall inhibitor moenomycin.
AB  - Moenomycin A (MmA) belongs to a family of natural products that inhibit peptidoglycan biosynthesis by binding to the peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases, the enzymes that make the glycan chains of peptidoglycan. MmA is remarkably potent, but its clinical utility has been hampered by poor physicochemical properties. Moenomycin contains three structurally distinct regions: a pentasaccharide, a phosphoglycerate, and a C25 isoprenyl (moenocinyl) lipid tail that gives the molecule its name. The phosphoglycerate moiety links the pentasaccharide to the moenocinyl chain. This moiety contains two negatively charged groups, a phosphoryl group and a carboxylate. Both the phosphoryl group and the carboxylate have previously been implicated in target binding but the role of the carboxylate has not been explored in detail. Here we report the synthesis of six MmA analogues designed to probe the importance of the phosphoglycerate. These analogues were evaluated for antibacterial and enzyme inhibitory activity; the specific contacts between the phosphoglycerate and the protein target were assessed by X-ray crystallography in conjunction with molecular modeling. Both the phosphoryl group and the carboxylate of the phosphoglycerate chain play roles in target binding. The negative charge of the carboxylate, and not its specific structure, appears to be the critical feature in binding since replacing it with a negatively charged acylsulfonamide group produces a more active compound than replacing it with the isosteric amide. Analysis of the ligand-protein contacts suggests that the carboxylate makes a critical contact with an invariant lysine in the active site. The reported work provides information and validated computational methods critical for the design of analogues based on moenomycin scaffolds.
TI  - Potent antimicrobial activity of 3-(4,5-diaryl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-1H-indole derivatives against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - A new series of antimicrobial derivatives [3-(4,5-diaryl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-1H-indole)] have been synthesized with potent activity against strains of Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA). Compound 17 [3-(4,5-bis(4-fluorophenyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-5-bromo-1H-indole], the most active derivative was shown to inhibit the growth of all Gram-positive strains tested, including vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium with no activity against Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - [Investigation of the in vitro antibacterial effects of statins].
AB  - It was previously shown that statins have anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and anti-oxidant effects. This study was aimed to investigate the in-vitro antibacterial effects of simvastatin and atorvastatin. In this study antibacterial activity of the statins were tested against 16 methicillin-susceptible Stophylococcus aureus (MSSA), 16 methicillin-resistant S.aureus (MRSA), 16 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCoNS), 9 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium, 7 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecolis, 13 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, 16 extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) positive Escherichia coli, 16 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 Acinetobacter boumannii, 15 ESBL positive Klebsiella pneumoniae, 6 Stenotrophomonas maltophilio by broth microdilution method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) performance and interpretive guidelines. S. aureus ATCC 29213, S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. aureus ATCC 43300, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, K.pneumoniae ATCC 700603 and E. coli ATCC 35218 were tested as control strains. The results showed that minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for all isolates were > 128 microg/ml for the two statins tested. However, MIC of simvastatin was 32 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 29213 and was 64 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 25923 and E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and was > 128 microg/ml for others, but MIC of atorvastatin was > 128 microg/mI for all standard strains. According to these results, we observed that simvastatin and atorvastain had no significant antibacterial effect in vitro. In this study, although no antibacterial effect of statins were determined in vitro, further studies are needed to investigate the combined effect of statins with antibacterial agents in the living organism.
TI  - Nepetalactone content and antibacterial activity of the essential oils from different parts of Nepeta persica.
AB  - The essential oils from the flower, leaf, stem and root of Nepeta persica Boiss., analyzed by GC and GC/MS, were shown to contain 4abeta,7alpha,7abeta-nepetalactone (58.5%, 62.3%, 66.2% and 27.1%, respectively), and 4aalpha,7alpha,7abeta-nepetalactone (33.0%, 28.3%, 24.9% and 7.6%, respectively). The other main component of the flower and stem oils was alpha-pinene (3.6% and 4.4%) and of the leaf oil beta-ocimene (3.6%). In the root oil, other main constituents were alpha-pinene (40.4%), alpha-amorphene (5.3%), gamma-cadinene (2.9%), and cis-calamenene (2.5%). Nepetalactone was the major component of the flower, leaf and stem oils, which are thus important sources of nepetalactone. Antibacterial activities of the flower, leaf, stem and root oils were evaluated using the micro-dilution broth method. Inhibitory effects on Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi and Enterococcus faecalis were recorded. The flower, leaf, stem, and root oils had difference activities against the test microorganisms. The antibacterial property of the essential oils might be ascribed to their high content of nepetalactone isomers.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of novel Ag-N-hetero-cyclic carbene complexes.
AB  - A series of imidazolidinium ligand precursors are metallated with Ag2O to give silver(I) N-heterocyclic carbene complexes. All compounds were fully characterized by elemental analyses, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and IR spectroscopy techniques. All compounds studied in this work were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard strains: Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and the fungi Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis. The new imidazolidin-2-ylidene silver complexes have been found to display effective antimicrobial activity against a series of bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Gold(I) complexes of N-heterocyclic carbene ligands containing benzimidazole: synthesis and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Gold(I) N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes were obtained in good yields from  the corresponding silver complexes by treatment with [AuCl(PPh3)] following the commonly used silver carbene transfer route. The silver complexes were synthesized from the benzimidazolium halide salts by the in situ reactions with Ag2O in dichloromethane as a solvent at room temperature. All gold complexes have been characterized by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Au-NHC complexes were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungal species.
TI  - Isolation, phylogenetic analysis and anti-infective activity screening of marine  sponge-associated actinomycetes.
AB  - Terrestrial actinomycetes are noteworthy producers of a multitude of antibiotics, however the marine representatives are much less studied in this regard. In this study, 90 actinomycetes were isolated from 11 different species of marine sponges that had been collected from offshore Ras Mohamed (Egypt) and from Rovinj (Croatia). Phylogenetic characterization of the isolates based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing supported their assignment to 18 different actinomycete genera representing seven different suborders. Fourteen putatively novel species were identified based on sequence similarity values below 98.2% to other strains in the NCBI database. A putative new genus related to Rubrobacter was isolated on M1 agar that had been amended with sponge extract, thus highlighting the need for innovative cultivation protocols. Testing for anti-infective activities was performed against clinically relevant, Gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria, fungi (Candida albicans) and human parasites (Leishmania major, Trypanosoma brucei). Bioactivities against these pathogens were documented for 10 actinomycete isolates. These results show a high diversity of actinomycetes associated with marine sponges as well as highlight their potential to produce anti-infective agents.
TI  - Spectrum and prevalence of fungi infecting deep tissues of lower-limb wounds in patients with type 2 diabetes.
AB  - The prevalence rate and spectrum of fungi infecting deep tissues of diabetic lower-limb wounds (DLWs) have not been previously studied. Five hundred eighteen (382 male and 136 female) consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes hospitalized due to infected lower-limb wounds were enlisted in this study. Deep tissue (approximately 0.5- x 0.5-cm size) taken perioperatively from the wound bed was cultured for fungi. Fungi was found in 27.2% (141/518) of the study population. Candida parapsilosis (25.5%), Candida tropicalis (22.7%), Trichosporon asahii (12.8%), Candida albicans (10.6%), and Aspergillus species (5.0%) were the most predominant fungal isolates. Of the fungal isolates, 17.7% were resistant to itraconazole, 6.9% were resistant to amphotericin B, 6.9% were resistant to voriconazole, 3.9% were resistant to fluconazole, and 1.5% were resistant to flucytosine. Of the population, 79.7% (413/518) had bacterial infection in deep tissue. The predominant isolates were Enterococcus faecalis (14.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (12.2%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.8%). Mixed fungal and bacterial infections were seen in 21.4% of patients, while 5.8% had only fungal infection and 58.3% had only bacterial infections. Another 14.5% had neither bacteria nor fungi in the deep tissue. Patients with higher glycosylated hemoglobin levels had significantly more fungal infections. Our study reveals that deep-seated fungal infections are high in DLWs. In the context of delayed wound healing and amputation rates due to DLWs, it is important to study the pathogenicity of fungi in deep tissues of DLWs and their possible contribution to delayed wound healing. The role of antifungal agents in wound management needs to be evaluated further.
TI  - Evaluation of efflux activity of bacteria by a semi-automated fluorometric system.
AB  - A semi-automated method that uses the common efflux pump (EP) substrate ethidium  bromide (EB) is described for the assessment of EP systems of bacteria. The method employs the Rotor-Gene(TM) 3000 thermocycler (Corbett Research) for the real-time assessment of accumulation and efflux of EB in Phosphate-Buffered Solution (PBS) under varying physiological conditions, such as temperature, pH, presence and absence of the energy source, and presence of efflux pumps inhibitors (EPIs). The method is sufficiently sensitive to characterize intrinsic EP systems of reference strains, a prime necessity if there is a need for assessment of EP-mediated multi-drug resistance (MDR). The method has been successfully applied by us to characterize intrinsic and over-expressed EP systems of Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium avium, suggesting that if the organism can be maintained in PBS, the system described may suffice for the evaluation and assessment of its EP system.
TI  - [Interpretive reading of the antibiogram in gram positive cocci].
AB  - Resistance to methicillin in Staphylococcus is related to the expression of the mecA gene, and involves resistance to all beta-lactams, with the exception of the new cephalosporins, ceftobiprole and ceftaroline. Breakpoints for interpretation of this mechanism differ in S. aureus and in coagulase-negative species. For macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramins B, (MLS(B)) the most frequent mechanism among resistant strains is expression of methylases (erm genes). Topoisomerase changes caused by point mutations and expression of the efflux pump NorA determine resistance to quinolones, but there are great differences in the activity of different compounds, which makes interpretative reading difficult. Strains of S. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides (GISA strains) have been described, as well as highly-vancomycin-resistant isolates (vanA isolates). In Spain, there is a high percentage of S. pneumoniae strains intermediate or resistant to penicillin, and a low percentage of strains intermediate or resistant to third generation cephalosporins, due to mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. The most frequent phenotype of resistance to MLS(B) in this species is caused by methylase production. Resistance to quinolones is still uncommon, and is mainly related to mutations in parC/parE (low level) and in gyrA. It is important to detect low level resistance due to its clinical implications. No strains of S. pyogenes resistant to penicillin have yet been described. In Spain the most common phenotype of resistance to macrolides in S. pyogenes is determined by efflux pumps (mef genes), affecting 14- and 15-membered macrolides. E. faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, in contrast to E. faecium. Enterococci show intrinsic low-level resistance to aminoglycosides, but still remain susceptible to the combination of these antimicrobials and cell-wall active agents. Strains expressing different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (high-level resistance) became resistant to the combination. Glycopeptide-resistant strains of enterococci are uncommon in Spain, but nosocomial outbreaks due to vanA enterococci and case reports due to vanB2 enterococci have been recently reported.
TI  - Potential airborne microbial hazards for workers on dairy and beef cattle farms in Egypt.
AB  - This study was conducted to determine the concentration and frequency distribution of certain airborne micro-organisms on cattle farms and their potential health hazards to farm workers. The samples (60 air samples and 240 hand and nasal swabs from cattle farm workers) were collected from ten cattle farms (five dairy barns and five beef sheds) located in the Sharkia Governorate of Egypt. Air samples were collected for microbiological examination in liquid media using an all-glass impinger whereas those for fungal examination were placed on agar plates using slit air samplers (aeroscopes). The results showed that the overall means of total culturable bacterial and fungal counts were lower in the air of dairy cattle barns than in beef cattle sheds. Identification of the isolated bacteria revealed the recovery of the following species (from dairy cattle barns versus beef cattle sheds): Staphylococcus epidermidis (26.7% vs 36.7%), S. saprophyticus (20% vs 33.3%), S. aureus (10% vs 16.7%), Enterococcus faecalis (23.3% vs 26.7%), Enterobacter agglomerans (23.3 vs 13.3%), Escherichia coli, (16.7% vs 26.7%), Klebsiella oxytoca, (10% vs 16.7%), K. pneumoniae (3.3% vs 0%), Proteus rettegri (6.7% vs 13.3%), P. mirabilis (10% vs 10%), P. vulgaris (3.3% vs 6.7%), Pseudomonas species (6.7% vs 16.7%), respectively). Mycological examination of air samples revealed the presence of Aspergillus fumigatus (46.7% vs 63.3%), A. niger (20% vs 36.7%), A. flavus (13.3% vs 26.7%), Penicillium citrinum (16.7% vs 23.3%), P. viridicatum (13.3% vs 6.7%), P. capsulatum (3.3% vs 0%), Cladosporium spp. (30% vs 56.7%), Alternaria spp. (13.3 vs 23.3%), Mucor spp. (6.7% vs 16.7%), Fusarium spp. (3.3% vs 10%), Absidia spp. (6.7% vs 10%), Curvilaria spp. (10% vs 3.3%), Rhizopus spp. (6.7% vs 13.3%), Scopulariopsis (3.3% vs 6.7%), Epicoccum spp. (0% vs 3.4%) and yeast (13.3% vs 20%), respectively. In addition, microbiological examinations of farm workers revealed heavy contamination of their hands and noses with most of the micro-organisms detected in the air of cattle farms. The results showed that potential airborne microbial risks in beef cattle sheds were greater than in dairies.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Alpinia galanga (L) Willd crude extracts.
AB  - Methanol, acetone and diethyl ether extracts of Alpinia galanga have been evaluated against pathogens viz. Bacillus subtilis MTCC 2391, Enterobacter aerogene, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli MTCC 1563, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 6642, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus epidermis using Agar well diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of all the extracts were determined using the macrodilution method. Methanol extracts have shown excellent activity towards all the pathogens with MIC and MBC values ranging from 0.04-1.28 mg/ml and 0.08-2.56 mg/ml, respectively. The GC-MS analysis of methanol extracts have yielded compounds like 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (59.9%), benzyl alcohol (57.6%), 1,8 cineole (15.65%), methylcinnamate (9.4%), 3-phenyl-2-butanone (8.5%) and 1,2 benzenedicarboxylic acid (8.9%), which could be responsible for its broad spectrum activity. So, A. galanga can be quite resourceful for the development of new generation drugs.
TI  - Combined effect of enterocin AS-48 and high hydrostatic pressure to control food-borne pathogens inoculated in low acid fermented sausages.
AB  - The single and combined effects of enterocin AS-48 and high hydrostatic pressure  (HHP) on Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonellaenterica, and Staphylococcus aureus was investigated in fuet (a low acid fermented sausage) during ripening and storage at 7 degrees C or at room temperature. AS-48 (148 AU g(-1)) caused a drastic 5.5 log cfu g(-1) decrease in L. monocytogenes (P<0.001) and a significant (P<0.01) inhibition (1.79 logs) for Salmonella at the end of ripening (10 d). After pressurization (400 MPa) and storage Listeria counts remained below 5 cfu g(-1) in all fuets containing AS-48 (pressurized or not). HHP alone had no anti-Listeria effect. HHP treatment significantly reduced Salmonella counts, with lowest levels in pressurized fuets with AS-48. S. aureus showed similar growth for all treatments and storage conditions. These results indicate that AS-48 can be applied alone to control L. monocytogenes and combined with HHP treatment to control Salmonella in fuets.
TI  - Biological activities of pargamicin A, a novel cyclic peptide antibiotic from Amycolatopsis sp.
AB  - The time-kill studies using pargamicin A against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis were performed. The effects of the incorporation of radioactive precursors into macromolecules, membrane potential and function using fluorescent dyes were also examined. These studies revealed that rapid bactericidal activity of pargamicin A correlates with the perturbation of bacterial cell membrane potential and membrane function.
TI  - Azinyl sulfides--CXVIII. Antimicrobial activity of novel 1-methyl-3-thio-4-aminoquinolinium salts.
AB  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of novel 1-methyl-3-alkylthio-4-aminoquinolinium salts 2 and 1-methyl-3-acylthio-4-aminoquinolinium salts 4 are described. Compounds 2 were obtained by reacting 1-methyl-3,4-(dimethylthio)quinolinium chloride 1 with amines and by reacting 1-methyl-4-aminoquinolinium-3-thiolates 3 with alkylating agents. Compounds 4 were obtained by the reaction of 1-methyl-4-aminoquinolinium-3-thiolates 3 with acylating agents. Antimicrobial activity of compounds 2 and 4 was determined using G+ (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) and G(-) (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) strains as well as Candida albicans yeast. The compounds show greatest activity against S. aureus whereas the lowest against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of the essential oil from fruits  of Bursera tomentosa.
AB  - The hydrodistilled oil from the fruits of Bursera tomentosa, obtained in 0.2% yield, was analyzed by GC-MS. Nine components were identified, which made up 99.3% of the oil. The most abundant constituents were cis-ocimene (47.6%), n-nonane (28.2%) and germacrene-D (11.1%). The oil showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) and Salmonella typhi (CDC 57), with MIC values of 80 microg/mL, 120 microg/mL and 100 microg/mL, respectively.
TI  - Essential oil from the underground parts of Laserpitium zernyi: potential source  of alpha-bisabolol and its antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from the underground parts (roots and rhizomes) of Laserpitium zernyi Hayek (Apiaceae) were investigated. The pale blue essential oil, obtained by hydrodistillation, was analyzed by GC and GC-MS. Forty-three compounds were identified (94.3% of total oil). The main constituent, beside alpha-pinene (31.6%) was alpha-bisabolol (30.9%), so this oil may be a novel potential natural source of this sesquiterpene alcohol. The antimicrobial activity was tested using the microdilution method against Gram (+) bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis), Gram (-) bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli), and two strains of yeast (Candida albicans). L. zernyi oil showed significant antibacterial activity against S. epidermidis, S. aureus and M. luteus, but lower activities against the other tested strains.
TI  - Maggot excretions inhibit biofilm formation on biomaterials.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biofilm-associated infections in trauma surgery are difficult to treat with conventional therapies. Therefore, it is important to develop new treatment modalities. Maggots in captured bags, which are permeable for larval excretions/secretions, aid in healing severe, infected wounds, suspect for biofilm formation. Therefore we presumed maggot excretions/secretions would reduce biofilm formation. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We studied biofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterobacter cloacae on polyethylene, titanium, and stainless steel. We compared the quantities of biofilm formation between the bacterial species on the various biomaterials and the quantity of biofilm formation after various incubation times. Maggot excretions/secretions were added to existing biofilms to examine their effect. METHODS: Comb-like models of the biomaterials, made to fit in a 96-well microtiter plate, were incubated with bacterial suspension. The formed biofilms were stained in crystal violet, which was eluted in ethanol. The optical density (at 595 nm) of the eluate was determined to quantify biofilm formation. Maggot excretions/secretions were pipetted in different concentrations to (nonstained) 7-day-old biofilms, incubated 24 hours, and finally measured. RESULTS: The strongest biofilms were formed by S. aureus and S. epidermidis on polyethylene and the weakest on titanium. The highest quantity of biofilm formation was reached within 7 days for both bacteria. The presence of excretions/secretions reduced biofilm formation on all biomaterials. A maximum of 92% of biofilm reduction was measured. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations suggest maggot excretions/secretions decrease biofilm formation and could provide a new treatment for biofilm formation on infected biomaterials.
TI  - The extracytoplasmic function sigma factor SigV plays a key role in the original  model of lysozyme resistance and virulence of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enterococcus faecalis is one of the leading agents of nosocomial infections. To cause diseases, pathogens or opportunistic bacteria have to adapt and survive to the defense systems encountered in the host. One of the most important compounds of the host innate defense response against invading microorganisms is lysozyme. It is found in a wide variety of body fluids, as well as in cells of the innate immune system. Lysozyme could act either as a muramidase and/or as a cationic antimicrobial peptide. Like Staphylococcus aureus, E. faecalis is one of the few bacteria that are completely lysozyme resistant. RESULTS: This study revealed that oatA (O-acetyl transferase) and dlt (D-Alanylation of lipoteicoic acids) genes contribute only partly to the lysozyme resistance of E. faecalis and that a specific transcriptional regulator, the extracytoplasmic function SigV sigma factor plays a key role in this event. Indeed, the sigV single mutant is as sensitive as the oatA/dltA double mutant, and the sigV/oatA/dltA triple mutant displays the highest level of lysozyme sensitivity suggesting synergistic effects of these genes. In S. aureus, mutation of both oatA and dlt genes abolishes completely the lysozyme resistance, whereas this is not the case in E. faecalis. Interestingly SigV does not control neither oatA nor dlt genes. Moreover, the sigV mutants clearly showed a reduced capacity to colonize host tissues, as they are significantly less recovered than the parental JH2-2 strain from organs of mice subjected to intravenous or urinary tract infections. CONCLUSIONS: This work led to the discovery of an original model of lysozyme resistance mechanism which is obviously more complex than those described for other Gram positive pathogens. Moreover, our data provide evidences for a direct link between lysozyme resistance and virulence of E. faecalis.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antimalarial activity of Cussonia species (Araliaceae).
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cussonia species are used in African traditional  medicine mainly against pain, inflammation, gastro-intestinal problems, malaria and sexually transmitted diseases. AIM OF THE STUDY: To summarise ethnomedicinal uses of Cussonia and to find scientific evidence in support of selected main uses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method, leaves of 13 Cussonia species, Schefflera umbellifera and Seemannaralia gerrardii were tested against pathogens associated with diarrhoea (Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli), sexually transmitted infections (Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Trichomonas vaginalis) and general infectious diseases (Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Antimalarial sensitivity was studied using Plasmodium falciparum and the [(3)H]-hypoxanthine incorporation assay. Cytotoxic effects on a T-cell leukaemia (Jurkat) cell line were determined using the tetrazolium-based cellular toxicity assay. RESULTS: Methanolic extracts were active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC of 1.0-1.5 mg/mL), Trichomonas vaginalis (MIC of 0.8-1.3 mg/mL) and Staphylococcus aureus (Cussonia arborea, 1.8 mg/mL). All samples were active against Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC of 0.02-0.7 mg/mL). The methanol extract of Cussonia arborea was the most active against Plasmodium falciparum (13.68 microg/mL) and showed anticancer properties (5.60 microg/mL). CONCLUSIONS: The traditional use of Cussonia species to treat sexually transmitted diseases and Plasmodium infections appears to have a scientific basis.
TI  - A genetic determinant in Streptococcus gordonii Challis encodes a peptide with activity similar to that of enterococcal sex pheromone cAM373, which facilitates intergeneric DNA transfer.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis strains secrete multiple peptides representing different sex pheromones that induce mating responses by bacteria carrying specific conjugative plasmids. The pheromone cAM373, which induces a response by the enterococcal plasmid pAM373, has been of interest because a similar activity is also secreted by Streptococcus gordonii and Staphylococcus aureus. The potential to facilitate intergeneric DNA transfer from E. faecalis is of concern because of extensive multiple antibiotic resistance, including vancomycin resistance, that has emerged among enterococci in recent years. Here, we characterize the related pheromone determinant in S. gordonii and show that the peptide it encodes, gordonii-cAM373, does indeed induce transfer of plasmid DNA from E. faecalis into S. gordonii. The streptococcal determinant camG encodes a lipoprotein with a leader sequence, the last 7 residues of which represent the gordonii-cAM373 heptapeptide SVFILAA. Synthetic forms of the peptide had activity similar to that of the enterococcal cAM373 AIFILAS. The lipoprotein moiety bore no resemblance to the lipoprotein encoded by E. faecalis. We also identified determinants in S. gordonii encoding a signal peptidase and an Eep-like zinc metalloprotease (lspA and eep, respectively) similar to those involved in processing certain pheromone precursors in E. faecalis. Mutations generated in camG, lspA, and eep each resulted in the ablation of gordonii-cAM373 activity in culture supernatants. This is the first genetic analysis of a potential sex pheromone system in a commensal oral streptococcal species, which may have implications for intergeneric gene acquisition in oral biofilms.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for diabetic foot infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparative antimicrobial agents was evaluated against 1828 primary baseline pathogens isolated from 844 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trials investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in diabetic foot infection (DFI). The trials were global, enrolling patients in 30 countries. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in DFI, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with 95% of MICs < or =2 microg/mL for the entire collection. The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens for DFI, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. As reported previously, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and several pathogens in the Proteeae group were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other Gram-negative pathogens. The excellent in vitro expanded broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility of tigecycline for pathogens associated with DFIs.
TI  - Photoantimicrobials as a potential local approach to geriatric UTIs.
AB  - AIMS: To test the efficacy of acceptable photoantimicrobial agents against bacterial pathogens implicated in complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in comparison with conventionally employed antibacterials. METHODS AND RESULTS: Toluidine blue (TB), methylene blue (MB), 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA), trimethoprim and levofloxacin were employed in the study against the typical UTI-implicated pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Proteus mirabilis. Standard bacterial cell culture was used to assay the activity both in the dark and under 660-nm LED-illuminated conditions. TB and MB were highly photoactive across the range and exhibited rapid kill rates, their effects being assayed after 20-min illumination, rather than the 18-h incubation employed with the other compounds. Trimethoprim was inactive against all bacteria except Pr. mirabilis, while levofloxacin maintained highly bactericidal activity throughout. ALA required high concentrations for effective action but, for porphyrin production in situ, also required an 18-h incubation. CONCLUSIONS: TB and MB were highly and rapidly photobactericidal in comparison with the remaining agents tested. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Ubiquitous catheterization of geriatric patients offers a portal for light delivery to the urinary tract. The photoantimicrobial approach thus offers considerable potential.
TI  - In vitro prevention of the emergence of daptomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci following combination with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or ampicillin.
AB  - Daptomycin is bactericidal against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), glycopeptide-intermediate-resistant S. aureus (GISA) and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococci. However, selection for daptomycin-resistant derivatives has occasionally been reported during therapy in humans. Here we evaluate whether selection for daptomycin-resistant S. aureus or enterococci could be prevented in vitro by combining daptomycin with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, gentamicin or rifampicin. Six strains of S. aureus (four MRSA and two GISA) and four strains of enterococci (two Enterococcus faecalis and two Enterococcus faecium) were serially exposed in broth to two-fold stepwise increasing concentrations of daptomycin alone or in combination with a fixed concentration [0.25x minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)] of either of the second agents. The daptomycin MIC was examined after each cycle. Exposure to daptomycin alone gradually selected for S. aureus and enterococci with an increased MIC. Gentamicin did not prevent the emergence of daptomycin-resistant bacteria. Rifampicin was also unable to prevent daptomycin resistance, although resistance was slightly delayed. In contrast, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or ampicillin prevented or greatly delayed the selection of daptomycin-resistant mutants in S. aureus and enterococci, respectively. Addition of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or ampicillin to daptomycin prevents, or greatly delays, daptomycin resistance in vitro. Future studies in animal models are needed to predict the utility of these combinations in humans.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of 11,12-carbamate-3-O-acyl erythromycin derivatives.
AB  - A novel series of acylide derivatives have been synthesized which exhibit in vitro potency against key respiratory pathogens. Modification of position 3 was accomplished by replacing different 3-O-substituted acyl groups in the macrolide core via a facile procedure. Compounds 7a-7i were eventually yielded by the conjunction of diverse hetero-aryl side chains with the 11-N,12-O-carbamate sub-structure.
TI  - Phenolics and anthocyanins in berries of European cranberry and their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - European cranberry is a berry plant rich in biologically active substances, making it valued by both the phyto-pharmaceutical and food industries. The aim of this study was to examine the accumulation of phenolic compounds and anthocyanins in berries of European cranberry and to assess their antibacterial activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Different wild clones of European cranberry were investigated according to berry weight and the amounts of total phenolics and anthocyanins. Anthocyanin profiles of extracts were evaluated by HPLC, whereas the antimicrobial properties were determined by the agar well diffusion method. A strong negative correlation between berry weight and the amount of anthocyanins was found. The amount of total phenolics among different cranberry clones in the field collection ranged from 224.0 mg/100 g to 498.0 mg/100 g, and the amount of total anthocyanins ranged from 40.7 mg/100 g to 207.3 mg/100 g. Quantitative HPLC-UV analysis revealed six anthocyanins in the berries of European cranberry, among which the anthocyanin peonidin-3-galactoside was most prevalent. CONCLUSIONS: Investigation of the antimicrobial properties showed that European cranberry extracts inhibited the growth of wide range of human pathogenic bacteria, both gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium) and gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis).
TI  - Conservative management of mesh-site infection in hernia repair.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mesh hernioplasty is the preferred surgical procedure for large abdominal wall hernias. Infection remains one of the most challenging complications of this operation. Salvaging infected prosthetic material after ventral hernia repair is rarely successful. Most cases require mesh excision and complex abdominal wall reconstruction, with variable success rates. In this article, we report 3 cases of mesh salvage after laparoscopic ventral herniorrhapy with a novel use of percutaneous drainage and antibiotic irrigation. RESULTS: Three patients developed infected seromas after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. The fascial defect of the first patient was repaired with a commercially available 20 x 18 cm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) mesh. A complex fluid collection developed the following month in the anterior abdominal wall overlying the patient's mesh. The cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus. The second patient had a 30 x 20 cm PTFE mesh placed, which developed a fluid collection with Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. The third case underwent repair, using a another commercially available 22 x 28 cm PTFE mesh. A fluid collection measuring 20 x 10 cm in the anterior abdominal wall developed, growing Staphylococcus lugdunensis. In all 3 cases, a percutaneous drain was placed within the fluid collection and long-term intravenous (i.v.) access was obtained. I.v. antibiotics were initiated. In addition, gentamicin (80 mg) with 20 mL of saline was infused through the drain 3 times a day. All patients have remained free of clinical signs of infection following the completion of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Infected mesh after laparoscopic ventral herniorrhapy without systemic sepsis may be amenable to nonoperative treatment. A conservative approach that includes percutaneous drainage followed by antibiotic irrigation is a potential alternative to prosthetic removal in carefully selected patients. Further evaluation of this technique is warranted to define the most appropriate management strategies for these patients.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils from several Hypericum taxa (Guttiferae) growing in central Italy (Appennino Umbro-Marchigiano).
AB  - The chemical composition of the essential oils of nine taxa from seven sections of Hypericum L. (Guttiferae; H. perforatum subsp. perforatum, H. perforatum subsp. veronense, H. calycinum, H. montanum, H. richeri subsp. richeri, H. hyssopifolium, H. hirsutum, H. hircinum subsp. majus, and H. tetrapterum) occurring in central Italy (Appennino Umbro-Marchigiano) was analyzed by GC/FID and GC/MS. A total of 186 compounds were identified in the different species and subspecies, accounting for 86.9-92.8% of the total oils. The major fraction of the oil was always represented by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (30.3-77.2%), while quantitative differences occurred between the other classes of volatiles depending on the taxa considered. Chemical composition of the nine Hypericum entities with respect to the taxonomical classification was discussed. Essential oils obtained from six taxa, i.e., H. perforatum subsp. perforatum, H. perforatum subsp. veronense, H. calycinum, H. richeri subsp. richeri, H. hirsutum and H. tetrapterum, were also tested for their antimicrobial properties against five different microbial strains by the broth-microdilution method, and they were found to have significant activity (expressed as MIC) on B. subtilis, moderate activity on C. albicans and S. aureus, and weak activity on E. coli and E. faecalis, the most active being those from H. hirsutum, H. richeri subsp. richeri, and H. tetrapterum.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria isolated in Brazilian hospitals participating in the SENTRY Program (2005-2008).
AB  - We report the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the most frequently isolated Gram-positive bacteria in the Brazilian hospitals participating in the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. The strains were consecutively collected (one per patient) between January 2005 and September 2008 and susceptibility tested by reference broth microdilution methods at the JMI Laboratories (North Liberty, Iowa, USA). A total of 3,907 Gram-positive cocci were analyzed. The Gram-positive organisms most frequently isolated from bloodstream infections were Staphylococcus aureus (2,218 strains; 20.2% of total), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 812 strains [14.7%]), and Enterococcus spp. (754 strains; 5.0%). S. aureus ranked first (28.1%) and Enterococcus faecalis ranked 7th (4.5%) among cases of skin and soft tissue infections. S. aureus was also the second most frequently isolated pathogen from patients with lower respiratory tract infections (24.9% of cases) after Pseudomonas aeruginosa (30.5%). Resistance to oxacillin was observed in 31.0% of S. aureus and the vast majority of oxacillin-resistant (MRSA) strains were also resistant to clindamycin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. Vancomycin, linezolid and daptomycin were all very active against S. aureus strains tested (>99.9-100.0% susceptible), but daptomycin (MIC(50), 0.25 g/mL and MIC(90), 0.5 g/mL) was four- to eight-fold more potent than vancomycin (MIC(50) and MIC(90) of 1 g/mL) and linezolid (MIC(50), 1 g/mL and MIC(90), 2 g/mL). Vancomycin resistance increased significantly among enterococci during the study period, but it was restrict to only one medical center until 2007 and emerged in a second medical center in 2008. Daptomycin was the most active antimicrobial tested against enterococci in general (100.0% susceptible), followed by linezolid (99.9% susceptible), ampicillin (87.4%) and vancomycin (84.6%). In conclusion, daptomycin and linezolid showed excellent in vitro activity against contemporary Gram-positive organisms (3,907) collected in Brazilian hospitals monitored by the SENTRY Program, including MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and other multi-drug-resistant organisms. Although vancomycin resistance rates in Brazil appears to be relatively low compared to those reported in the USA, VRE has emerged and rapidly disseminated in some Brazilian medical centers.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for hospital acquired pneumonia.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline was evaluated against 819 baseline pathogens isolated from 383 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trial investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP). The trials were global, enrolling patients in 27 countries. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in HAP, including gram-positive and gram-negative strains (90% of MICs </=2 microg/mL for the entire collection). The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii/calcoaceticus complex, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Enterobacter cloacae. As reported previously, a few genera, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the Proteeae, were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other gram-negative pathogens. The excellent in vitro, expanded, broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility of tigecycline for pathogens associated with with hospital acquired pneumonia infections.
TI  - NXL-103, a combination of flopristin and linopristin, for the potential treatment of bacterial infections including community-acquired pneumonia and MRSA.
AB  - Novexel is developing the novel, orally active, semisynthetic streptogramin NXL-103, which has potential therapeutic application in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, community- or hospital-acquired MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and acute bacterial skin and soft tissue infections. NXL-103 is a combination of streptogramin A:streptogramin B components, initially developed in a 70:30 dose ratio. In multiple in vitro studies, NXL-103 demonstrated potent activity against different types of bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. NXL-103 was not affected by the resistance profiles of bacteria against other commonly used antibiotics. In phase I clinical trials, NXL-103 achieved bactericidal levels in plasma and was generally well tolerated, with side effects primarily on the gastrointestinal system. The first phase II trial conducted to evaluate the efficacy of NXL-103 against community-acquired pneumonia revealed that the compound was comparable with amoxicillin. NXL-103 has promise to become an important agent in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and complex skin and soft tissue infections, pending further development.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Artemisia nilagirica leaf extracts against clinical and phytopathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The six organic solvent extracts of Artemisia nilagirica were screened for the potential antimicrobial activity against phytopathogens and clinically important standard reference bacterial strains. METHODS: The agar disk diffusion method was used to study the antibacterial activity of A. nilagirica extracts against 15 bacterial strains. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the plant extracts were tested using two fold agar dilution method at concentrations ranging from 32 to 512 microg/ml. The phytochemical screening of extracts was carried out for major phytochemical derivatives in A. nilagirica. RESULTS: All the extracts showed inhibitory activity for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria except for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. The hexane extract was found to be effective against all phytopathogens with low MIC of 32 microg/ml and the methanol extract exhibited a higher inhibition activity against Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella typhi, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (32 microg/ml), Bacillus subtilis (64 microg/ml) and Shigella flaxneri (128 microg/ml). The phytochemical screening of extracts answered for the major derivative of alkaloids, amino acids, flavonoids, phenol, quinines, tannins and terpenoids. CONCLUSION: All the extracts showed antibacterial activity against the tested strains. Of all, methanol and hexane extracts showed high inhibition against clinical and phytopathogens, respectively. The results also indicate the presence of major phytochemical derivatives in the A. nilagirica extracts. Hence, the isolation and purification of therapeutic potential compounds from A. nilagirica could be used as an effective source against bacterial diseases in human and plants.
TI  - Activity of linezolid in an in vitro pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model using  different dosages and Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis strains with and without a hypermutator phenotype.
AB  - The influence of antibiotic dosages and bacterial mutator phenotypes on the emergence of linezolid-resistant mutants was evaluated in an in vitro pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model. A twice-daily 0.5-h infusion of a 200-, 600-, or 800-mg dose for 48 h was simulated against four strains (MIC, 2 microg/ml): Staphylococcus aureus RN4220 and its mutator derivative MutS2, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, and a mutator clinical strain of E. faecalis, Ef1497. The peak concentrations (4.38 to 4.79, 13.4 to 14.6, and 19.2 to 19.5 microg/ml) and half-lives at beta-phase (5.01 to 6.72 h) fit human plasma linezolid pharmacokinetics. Due to its bacteriostatic property, the cumulative percentages of the dosing interval during which the drug concentration exceeded the MIC (T > MIC), 66.6 and 69.1% of the dosing interval, were not significant, except for Ef1497, with an 800-mg dose and a T > MIC of 80.9%. At the standard 600-mg dosage, resistant mutants (2- to 8-fold MIC increases) were selected only with Ef1497. A lower, 200-mg dosage did not select resistant mutants of E. faecalis ATCC 29212, but a higher, 800-mg dosage against Ef1497 did not prevent their emergence. For the most resistant mutant (MIC, 16 microg/ml), characterization of 23S rRNA genes revealed the substitution A2453G in two of the four operons, which was previously described only in in vitro mutants of archaebacteria. Nevertheless, this mutant did not yield further mutants under 600- or 200-mg treatment. In conclusion, linezolid was consistently efficient against S. aureus strains. The emergence of resistant E. faecalis mutants was probably favored by the rapid decline of linezolid concentrations against a strong mutator, a phenotype less exceptional in E. faecalis than in S. aureus.
TI  - Comparison of the duration of antimicrobial activity of 2 different antimicrobial central venous catheters.
AB  - We compared the duration of antimicrobial effectiveness of 2 different antimicrobial catheters. The baseline activity of minocycline-rifampin catheters was greater than that of silver-platinum-carbon catheters against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis. The antimicrobial activity of the minocycline-rifampin catheters against these pathogens persisted for up to 12 days, while that of the silver-platinum-carbon catheters was depleted by day 10 (P < .05).
TI  - [Evolution in the antibiotic susceptibility and resistance].
AB  - Over the last decade the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant pathogens has been a growing problem, especially in some geographic areas, making useless most of the classical antibiotic therapies. The rapid emergence of resistant bacteria is the result of different factors as the intrinsic microbial complexity, the growing attitude to travel of humans, animals and goods, the use of antibiotics outside hospitals, and the lack of precise therapeutic chooses for high risk group of patients. The antibiotic-resistance becomes certainly a serious problem when a resistant pathogen, and often multi-resistant today, is present in an infective site. In fact in a recent estimate of the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about 90.000 deaths per year in the USA are attributable to bacterial infections and in particular to resistant pathogens. It appears clear that the clinic relevance of this problem is the decimation of the sensible germs of the normal flora that leads to the upper hand of the only resistant bacteria. The antibiotic therapy, in fact, select the resistance and each bacteria has developed a particular strategy to survive: mutations of the genetic content or acquisition of resistance genes from the external. Among the Gram positive bacteria, besides methicillin resistant Staphyloccocus aureus, there are other pathogens such as coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis, some species of streptococci and multiresistant Corynebacterium. The CoNS, eg. S. epidermidis, S. hominis and S. haemolyticus, are recognized as new important nosocomial pathogens and are not only responsible of invasive infections but have become in few years resistant to oxacillin (more than 60%) and multiresistant. The unsuspected fragility of glycopeptides, which for 40 years have been the most important treatment against infections due to Gram-positive bacteria, has posed the need for new antimicrobial molecules. Among the therapeutic possible options there are linezolid, tygecyline and daptomycin, but new other molecules are appearing in the clinical use like ceftobiprole and dalbavancin.
TI  - Antineoplastic agents. 573. isolation and structure of papilistatin from the papilionid butterfly Byasa polyeuctes termessa.
AB  - Bioassay-guided separation of an extract of the wings from a Taiwan butterfly, Byasa polyeuctes termessa, allowed isolation of a new cancer cell growth inhibitor designated papilistatin (1a). The structure was determined by analysis of 1D and 2D NMR spectra and by HRMS. Against a panel of six human and the murine P388 leukemia cancer cell lines, papilistatin exhibited cancer cell growth inhibition with GI(50)'s of 0.093-3.5 microg/mL. Papilistatin was also found to have antibacterial activity.
TI  - [Investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  - Sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. Previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. A total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. The antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in Mueller-Hinton broth according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for 10 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 Acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 Escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 Proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 Proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 Enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 Enterobacter aerogenes strains. The MIC values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for E. faecalis ATCC 29212, 32 microg/ml for K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, 32 microg/ml for E. coli ATCC 25922 and > 128 microg/ml for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Sertralin has showed antibacterial activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that MIC values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. Further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Effects of biofilm treatments on the multi-species Lubbock chronic wound biofilm  model.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of several biofilm effectors in inhibiting biofilm formation in an in vitro multi-species chronic wound biofilm model. METHOD: The Lubbock Chronic Wound Biofilm (LCWB) model has been described in detail elsewhere. Pathogens used in the model are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. These are three of the most important species associated with biofilms. Here, the model was exposed to the following biofilm effectors: xylitol, salicylic acid, farnesol, erythritol and two proprietary, semi-solid, wound-dressing formulations currently under development (Sanguitec gels). RESULTS: Biofilm formation was completely inhibited in the LCWB model following treatment with 20% xylitol, 10% erythritol, 1,000 microg/ml farnesol, 20mM salicylic acid or 0.1% of either of the two Sanguitec gel formulations. Salicylic acid specifically inhibited S. aureus (p<0.01) at 10mM and 20mM, consequently increasing the ratios of P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis within the biofilm. Xylitol had an increasing inhibitory effect on P. aeruginosa (p<0.01) at all concentrations evaluated. Erythritol had an inhibitory effect on P. aeruginosa and S. aureus growth (p<0.01) at over 5% concentrations. The inhibitory effect of both Sanguitec gel formulations was more broadly effective, with an increasingly inhibitory effect on all LCWB species (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: The LCWB model provides a multi-species format with which to evaluate the effect of biofilm effectors on wound flora in a biofilm phenotype. These results suggest that different treatments can target specific populations within a biofilm. Salicylic acid preferentially targeted S. aureus, xylitol preferentially targeted P. aeruginosa, while erythritol preferentially targeted both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. In contrast, the two Sanguitec gel formulations provided a broad, less preferential, inhibition of biofilm development. DECLARATION OF INTEREST: Research and Testing Laboratory is a for-profit enterprise that develops molecular methods and performs service research work on biofilms. Sanguitec gel was developed by JPK and CEJ.
TI  - [Recent trend and research issues related to antimicrobial-resistant bacteria].
AB  - The discovery of penicillin in 1928 was followed by the discovery and synthesis of various kinds of antimicrobial agents such as quinolone, aminogycoside, macrolide, tetracyclone, and oxazolidinone. These discoveries dramatically decreased the mortality rate due to infectious diseases. However, bacteria have also acquired antimicrobial-resistance genes or changed their own genes to oppose these antimicrobial agents, and now drug-resistant bacteria are becoming a serious clinical concern. Today, contagious diseases must be treated with the limited number of effective antimicrobial agents available. Infection control measures are required to prevent the spread of resistant bacteria in the clinical environment, and we must also increase our understanding of the drug-resistant mechanisms of bacteria. In this issue we wish to introduce the recent worldwide trend in antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, especially multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, along with recently-discovered antimicrobial-resistant systems.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of root canal filling materials for primary teeth: zinc oxide and eugenol cement, Calen paste thickened with zinc oxide, Sealapex and EndoREZ.
AB  - This study evaluated in vitro the antibacterial activity of 4 root canal filling  materials for primary teeth - zinc oxide and eugenol cement (ZOE), Calen paste thickened with zinc oxide (Calen/ZO), Sealapex sealer and EndoREZ sealer - against 5 bacterial strains commonly found in endodontic infections (Kocuria rhizophila, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus) using the agar diffusion test (agar-well technique). Calen paste, 1% chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) and distilled water served as controls. Seven wells per dish were made at equidistant points and immediately filled with the test and control materials. After incubation of the plates at 37 degrees C for 24 h, the diameter of the zones of bacterial growth inhibition produced around the wells was measured (in mm) with a digital caliper under reflected light. Data were analyzed statistically by analysis of variance and Tukey's post-hoc test (alpha=0.05). There were statistically significant differences (p<0.0001) among the zones of bacterial growth inhibition produced by the different materials against all target microorganisms. K. rhizophila was inhibited more effectively (p<0.05) by ZOE, while Calen/ZO had its highest antibacterial activity against E. faecalis (p<0.05). S. mutans was inhibited by Calen/ZO, Sealapex and ZOE in the same intensity (p>0.05). E. coli was inhibited more effectively (p<0.05) by ZOE, followed by Calen/ZO and Sealapex. Calen/ZO and ZOE were equally effective (p>0.05) against S. aureus, while Sealapex had the lowest antibacterial efficacy (p<0.05) against this microorganism. EndoREZ presented antibacterial activity only against K. rhizophila and S. aureus. The Calen paste and Calen/ZO produced larger zones of inhibition than 1% CHX when the marker microorganism was E faecalis. In conclusion, the in vitro antibacterial activity of the 4 root canal filling materials for primary teeth against bacterial strains commonly found in endodontic infections can be presented in a decreasing order of efficacy as follows: ZOE>Calen/ZO>Sealapex>EndoREZ.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of NSAIDS on clinical isolates of urinary tract infection and diabetic foot infection.
AB  - Non Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS) are a group of chemically dissimilar agents that have primary effect of inhibition of prostaglandin's synthesis. Aspirin (Acetyl Salicylic Acid) is used as an analgesic, anti pyretic, anti-inflammatory agent and also have an anticoagulant effect. Tylenol (acetaminophen) is used as pain reliever. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of Aspirin and Tylenol against clinical isolates of urinary tract infection (UTI) and diabetic foot infections. A total of 100 clinical isolates were analyzed. Out of these 50 were urine samples from diabetic patients with UTI and 50 pus samples from diabetic foot infection. Bacteriological study was done by inoculating urine samples on Cysteine Lactose Electrolyte deficient (CLED) media. Pus samples were inoculated on Blood agar and MacConkey's agar. Identification was done by colony characteristics, gram staining and standard biochemical tests and Quick Test Strip (QTS-20) DESTO Laboratories, Karachi. Antibacterial effect of Aspirin and Tylenol were tested against 100 clinical isolates by Replica plate method, Agar well diffusion method and tube dilution method. Concentrations of Aspirin and Tylenol (10 microg, 50 microg, 100 microg, 500 microg, 1000 microg) were made in Muller Hinton media. Bacteria isolated from urine samples were Escherichia coli 30%, Staphylococcus aureus 20%, Enterococcus faecalis 10%, S. saprophyticus 10%, Proteus spp. 6%, Pseudomonas spp. 6%, S. pyogenes 6%, S. agalactiae 6%, S. epidermidis 4%, and Klebsiella spp. 2%. Bacteria isolated from pus samples were S. aureus 30%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 18%, S. epidermidis 14%, Klebsiella pneumonia 12%, Proteus mirabilis 12%, E. coli 10%, P. vulgaris 4%. Aspirin was effective at 100-500 microg concentration against all isolates. Tylenol has marked effect on pathogens at 100 microg concentration. Aspirin and Tylenol along with analgesic, anti-pyretic, anti-inflammatory properties also have marked anti bacterial effect on isolates from UTI and Diabetic foot infections and inhibits the growth of both gram negative and gram positive bacteria, and both can be used synergistically with antibiotics for effective treatment.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of 5-ylidenethiazolidin-4-ones and 5-benzylidene-4,6-pyrimidinediones.
AB  - 5-benzylidenethiazolidin-4-ones and 5-benzylidenepyrimidine-4,6-diones (compounds 1-9), carrying 2,3,4-trifluoro or 3,4,5-trimethoxy groups on the benzylidene moiety, and rhodanine derivatives 10 and 11 were synthesized and assayed in vitro for their antimicrobial activity against four standard bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853). Compounds 1-3 and 9 that were active against S. aureus, were also tested against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) ATCC 43300, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 and Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615. (Z)-5-(2,3,4-Trifluorobenzylidene)rhodanine (1) inhibited the growth of S. aureus at 0.5 microg/mL and MRSA at 32 microg/mL. Stronger antimicrobial activity against S. aureus was observed for compounds bearing the rhodanine ring than those containing other heterocyclic moieties. Neither of the compounds 1-11 inhibited the growth of Gram-negative bacteria E. coli or P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Antimicrobial treatment of nosocomial intra-abdominal infections--new treatment  options with tygecycline].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Nosocomial, intra-abdominal infections are extremely serious conditions, considering possibilities for their early diagnosis, as well as for their effective therapy. Multiresistant bacteria (Enterobacteriacae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases - ESBL Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, vancomycin-resistant enterococci [VRE], and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA]) are frequently isolated as pathogens of these infections. Tygecycline is among the novel wide- spectrum antibiotics affecting multiresistant bacteria, which are being introduced in clinical practice. AIM: The aim of this study is to assess actual sensitivity of tygecycline to the commonest pathogens of intra-abdominal infections, generated in hospitalized surgical patients. Based on the sensitivity tests, tygecycline was indicated for targeted antibiotic therapy in intraabdominal infections. METHODS: Sensitivity to tygecycline, aminopenicillins, fluorochinoloni and gentamycine was established for the following bacteria: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonie, Enterobacter cloacea, Proteus mirabilis. Sensitivity to oxacillin, clincamycine and tygecycline was tested in Staphylococcus aureus, and to fluorochinolini, gentamycine and tygecycline in Enterococcus faecalis, and to fluorochinoloni, gentamycine, ceftazidime and gentamycine in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Based on the sensitivity results, tygecycline was administered in two patients with postsurgical intra-abdominal infections caused by ESBL Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonie. The initital dose of tygecycline was 100 mg i.v., followed by tygecycline 50 mg i.v. every 12 hours for 7 days. RESULTS: The isolated bacteria showed 98-100% sensitivity to tygecycline, except Psudomonas aeruginosa, where 100% resistance was demonstrated. Targeted antimicrobial medication with tygecycline proved effective in postoperative nosocomial intra-abdominal infections, the both concerned patients recovered. CONCLUSION: The choice of antimicrobial medication in nosocomial intra-abdominal infections requires through evaluation considering various factors including prior antibiotic therapy, co-morbidities and the current status of sensitivity with respect to potential multiresistant pathogens. Tygecycline shows significant in vitro efficacy against resistant gram-positive and key gram-negative facultative bacteria, which are a common cause of intra-abdominal infections in surgery patients. Clinical experience has shown that tygecycline is safe and effective in the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - The biocompatability of mesoporous inorganic-organic hybrid resin films with ionic and hydrophilic characteristics.
AB  - New mesoporous silicate-titania resin systems hybridized with 4,5-dihydroxy-m-benzenedisulfonic acid and poly(ethylene glycol)-dimethacrylate component were developed. These inorganic-organic hybrid resins were found to reveal highly controlled ionic and hydrophilic surface with excellent durability and adhesion onto various substrates. The resin films revealed high resistance to nonspecific adsorption of fibrinogen and to adherence by several bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis. Furthermore, excellent biocompatibility of the developed resins was proved by both HEp-2 cell adhesion in vitro and subcutaneous implantation in mice. The inorganic-organic hybrid resins are strongly promising for biomedical applications including biomedical devices and biosensors.
TI  - Susceptibility to tigecycline of isolates from samples collected in hospitalized  patients with secondary peritonitis undergoing surgery.
AB  - Activity of tigecycline against nosocomial secondary peritonitis isolates collected along 18 months in 29 Spanish hospitals was tested by Etest in a central laboratory, considering Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC)/European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints. A total of 600 facultative/aerobic isolates (392 Gram negative, 208 Gram positive) and 100 anaerobes were tested. None of the 220 Escherichia coli isolates was resistant to tigecycline (MIC(50)/MIC(90) = 0.25/0.5 microg/mL), with 0.5% (FDA breakpoint) and 3.6% (BSAC/EUCAST breakpoint) intermediate strains. All Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli isolates (15 strains), all Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca isolates (42 strains) were susceptible to tigecycline. No isolates resistant to tigecycline were found among Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecium, but 18.9% of Enterococcus faecalis strains were intermediate following BSAC/EUCAST breakpoints. All (but 1) isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 45) were tigecycline susceptible, as well as Gram-positive anaerobes. Tigecycline offers an adequate activity profile against isolates from secondary peritonitis when tested by Etest regardless of the breakpoints used for categorization.
TI  - Relapse of enterococcal prosthetic valve endocarditis with aortic root abscess following treatment with daptomycin in a patient not fit for surgery.
AB  - Daptomycin is a novel lipopeptide with activity against Gram-positive organisms including enterococci. It is licensed for the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia and right-sided endocarditis, but not endocarditis due to Enterococcus spp. We report a case of enterococcal prosthetic valve endocarditis with an aortic root abscess in an elderly patient who was not fit for surgery. The patient's endocarditis relapsed 9 weeks after a 6 week course of daptomycin.
TI  - Comparative genomics and transduction potential of Enterococcus faecalis temperate bacteriophages.
AB  - To determine the relative importance of temperate bacteriophage in the horizontal gene transfer of fitness and virulence determinants of Enterococcus faecalis, a panel of 47 bacteremia isolates were treated with the inducing agents mitomycin C, norfloxacin, and UV radiation. Thirty-four phages were purified from culture supernatants and discriminated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and restriction mapping. From these analyses the genomes of eight representative phages were pyrosequenced, revealing four distinct groups of phages. Three groups of phages, PhiFL1 to 3, were found to be sequence related, with PhiFL1A to C and PhiFL2A and B sharing the greatest identity (87 to 88%), while PhiFL3A and B share 37 to 41% identity with PhiFL1 and 2. PhiFL4A shares 3 to 12% identity with the phages PhiFL1 to 3. The PhiFL3A and B phages possess a high DNA sequence identity with the morphogenesis and lysis modules of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris prophages. Homologs of the Streptococcus mitis platelet binding phage tail proteins, PblA and PblB, are encoded on each sequenced E. faecalis phage. Few other phage genes encoding potential virulence functions were identified, and there was little evidence of carriage of lysogenic conversion genes distal to endolysin, as has been observed with genomes of many temperate phages from the opportunist pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. E. faecalis JH2-2 lysogens were generated using the eight phages, and these were examined for their relative fitness in Galleria mellonella. Several lysogens exhibited different effects upon survival of G. mellonella compared to their isogenic parent. The eight phages were tested for their ability to package host DNA, and three were shown to be very effective for generalized transduction of naive host cells of the laboratory strains OG1RF and JH2-2.
TI  - Single-dose daptomycin pharmacokinetics in chronic haemodialysis patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Daptomycin has concentration-dependent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Its use is increasing in haemodialysis units. The manufacturer recommends a 4-6-mg/kg dose administered every 48 hrs for patients receiving haemodialysis. However, there are no published data about daptomycin pharmacokinetics and clearance during haemodialysis. The recommended dosing regimen would conflict with asymmetric thrice-weekly haemodialysis, which yields two ~44-hr and one ~68-hr interdialytic periods. This is the first study to evaluate daptomycin pharmacokinetics in haemodialysis patients, assess the extent of daptomycin dialytic removal and model serum concentrations at 44 and 68 hrs. METHODS: Six otherwise healthy subjects on chronic haemodialysis (55.3 +/- 16.1 years old, three females, 66.2 +/- 14.2 kg) received a single 6-mg/kg dose of daptomycin post-haemodialysis infused over 30 minutes. Serial blood samples were collected for ~44 hrs (pre-next haemodialysis) and throughout the subsequent haemodialysis session with a high permeability haemodialyser. Individual pharmacokinetic parameters determined by compartmental analysis were used to model trough serum concentrations at 44 and 68 hrs with 6-, 8- and 10-mg/kg post-haemodialysis doses. RESULTS: The haemodialysis session in this trial yielded mean urea and daptomycin reduction ratios of 79.6 +/- 5.8% and 57.6 +/- 9.2%, respectively. Daptomycin half-life was 19.4 +/- 6.5 and 3.8 +/- 1.1 hrs 'off' and 'on haemodialysis', respectively, with minimal rebound 1 hr post-haemodialysis. All modelled trough concentrations at 44 and 68 hrs at all doses exceed typical minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC(90)) values for Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: Daptomycin serum concentrations declined by ~50% after a 4-hr haemodialysis session with a high permeability haemodialyser. A 6-mg/kg i.v. post-haemodialysis thrice-weekly dose should result in sufficient pre-haemodialysis daptomycin serum concentrations even after a 68-hr interdialytic period.
TI  - Evaluation of risk factors for coinfection or cocolonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - We retrospectively evaluated 410 patients with coinfection or cocolonization due  to vancomycin-resistant (VR) enterococcus (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The prevalence rate was 19.8%. Risk factors included isolation of VR Enterococcus faecalis and use of linezolid or clindamycin. Inc18-like vanA plasmids were found in 7% of VR E. faecalis isolates and none of the VR E. faecium isolates.
TI  - Postoperative surgical site infection following acetabular fracture fixation.
AB  - Postoperative surgical site infection (SSI) in orthopaedic trauma surgery is uncommon, but can present serious complications. This study was designed to assess the prevalence of, and to identify the risk factors for, SSI following acetabular fracture open reduction and internal fixation. A total of 326 consecutive patients who underwent acetabular fracture surgery were retrospectively reviewed. There were 17 patients (5.2%) who developed a SSI, including 10 deep infections and 7 superficial infections. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common causative pathogens in 9 patients, and was Methicillin-resistant in 3 patients. Enterococcus faecalis was found in 6 patients, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 patients, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterbacter cloacae in 2 patients each. Fourteen of 17 patients developed their infection within 4 weeks after the fixation. Univariate analysis demonstrated that the SSI group had statistically significant higher Injury Severity Score, longer intensive care unit (ICU) stays, larger amount of packed red blood cells transfused, longer operative time, larger estimated operative blood loss, higher body mass index (BMI), more frequent performance of combined approach, embolisation of internal iliac arteries, association of urinary tract injury, and Morel-Lavallee lesion compared to the no SSI group. Multivariate analysis using these 10 parameters showed that BMI, ICU stay, and Morel-Lavallee lesion were independently significant risk factors for SSI. To reduce the incidence of SSI following acetabular fracture surgery, special attention should be directed at the care of obese patients, patients requiring ICU care, and patients with associated Morel-Lavallee lesions.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of glutaraldehyde-like compounds from olive products.
AB  - The bactericidal effects of several olive compounds (nonenal, oleuropein, tyrosol, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid either free [EDA] or linked to tyrosol [TyEDA] or to hydroxytyrosol [HyEDA]), other food phenolic compounds (catechin, epicatechin, eugenol, thymol, carvacrol, and carnosic acid), and commercial disinfectants (glutaraldehyde [GTA] and ortho-phthalaldehyde [OPA]), were tested against strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Escherichia coli. It was found that the bactericidal activities of olive GTA-like compounds (EDA, HyEDA, and TyEDA) were greater than those exerted by several food phenolic substances. Surprisingly, these olive antimicrobials were as active as the synthetic biocides GTA and OPA against the four bacteria studied. Thus, it has been proposed that the bactericidal activity of the main olive antimicrobials is primarily due to their dialdehydic structure, which is similar to that of the commercial biocides GTA and OPA. Our results clearly reveal that olive GTA-like compounds possess a strong bactericidal activity even greater than that of other food phenolic compounds or synthetic biocides.
TI  - [Problem of infections at ENT Department of Poznan University of Medical Sciences based on the material from 2006-2007 years].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Infections at ENT wards constitute an essential clinical, organizational and economic issue. AIM: The purpose of this work was to present the problem of infections at ENT Clinic of Poznan University of Medical Sciences based on the material from 2006-2007 years. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 2006-2007 in The Department of Otolaryngology in Poznan there were treated 7052 patients. During that time 476 biological samples were taken to carry out a bacteriological examination. They came from: 74 postoperative wounds, 43 tracheotomy areas, 29 tracheoesophageal fistulas, 9 salivary fistulas, 105 ears, 71 noses, pharynxes and oral cavities, 44 body fluids, 18 paranasal sinuses, 11 central venous catheter areas, 23 urine samples, some constituted BAL, sputum, cyst content, materials from decubitus ulcer and gastrostomies areas. 21 materials were taken from abscesses and phlegmons, 32 from patients with purulent complications of chronic otitis media, 18 from patients with complications of chronic sinusitis and in 1 case there was taken in hospital conditions peritonsillar abscess content. RESULTS: 119 biological samples were aseptic, in 43 samples there were no pathological cultures, in 314 samples pathological bacterial flora was found. The most often isolated pathogens constituted: in postoperative wounds-Staphylococcus epidermidis, in tracheotomy areas-Enterococcus faecalis, in tracheoesophagal fistulas-Streptococcus viridans, in ears-Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in materials from noses, pharynxes and oral cavities-Staphylococcus aureus, while in materials from abscesses, paranasal sinuses and central venous catheter areas-Staphylococcus epidermidis. CONCLUSIONS: All cases were analyzed in detail. There was made a correlation between isolated pathogens and: a kind of pathology, surgical procedure, general patient condition, length of hospitalization.
TI  - Risk factors and management of Gram-positive bacteraemia.
AB  - The incidence of Gram-positive bloodstream infections has been increasing steadily. The virulence of coagulase-negative staphylococci is based mainly on their ability to produce biofilms, and thus cause infections of intravascular devices and foreign bodies, which must be removed to resolve the infection. Staphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of endocarditis, and it is important to recognize patients at risk of the complications of S. aureus bloodstream infections. The rate of meticillin resistance is higher in healthcare-related infections, although clones of community-acquired meticillin-resistant S. aureus carrying the Panton-Valentine leukocidin have recently emerged. Vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) creep gives cause for concern, and MICs >1 microg/mL are associated with higher failure rates and mortality in patients with S. aureus bacteraemia treated with vancomycin. Daptomycin should be considered the optimal empirical treatment for S. aureus bloodstream infections in settings with medium to high prevalence of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. Enterococci are the third leading cause of Gram-positive bacteraemia in our institution. Management of this disease is difficult because of its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics, mainly in Enterococcus faecium infections. The recently described synergism of ampicillin plus ceftriaxone is a good therapeutic option for Enterococcus faecalis bacteraemia and endocarditis caused by high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oil of Bupleurum montanum and B. plantagineum.
AB  - The hydrodistilled oils from the aerial parts of Bupleurum montanum and B. plantagineum, which are endemic to North Africa, including Algeria, were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Ninety-eight compounds were detected in the oil of B. montanum, representing 98.6% of the total oil, and 68 in the oil of B. plantagineum, representing 99.8% of the total. Megastigma-4,6-(E),8(2)-triene was the major constituent of B. montana oil (25.3%). Other important compounds were myrcene, alpha-pinene and benzyl tiglate. Conversely, the major constituents of the oil of B. plantagineum were alpha-pinene (31.9%), cis-chrysanthenyl acetate (28.2%), and myrcene (24.8%), followed by the monoterpene hydrocarbon limonene (5.1%). The mutagenic, antiplasmodial and antimicrobial activities of the essential oils were individually evaluated against eleven microorganisms, using the agar diffusion method, by determination of MIC values. The investigated oils exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity. Maximum activity of the oils was observed against Nocardia asteroides, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Fungicidal activity against Candida albicans was also found for both oils.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of the essential oil of Monticalia andicola (Asteraceae) collected in Venezuela.
AB  - The essential oil from the leaves of Monticalia andicola Turcz., collected in November 2008, was analyzed by GC/MS. A yield of 0.15% oil was obtained by hydrodistillation. Thirty-six components were identified by comparison of their mass spectra with those in the Wiley GC-MS Library data base. The major components were alpha-pinene (19.6%), beta-pinene (10.5%), alpha-longipinene (6.5%), delta-3-carene (6.2%), cyperene (5.4%) and beta-phellandrene (5.2%). The antibacterial activity of the essential oil was evaluated against Gram- positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli ATCC 25992, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 23357, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) bacteria, using the disc diffusion agar method. The results showed a broad spectrum of activity with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 10 to 150 microg/mL.
TI  - Benzoxazine series of histidine kinase inhibitors as potential antimicrobial agents with activity against enterococci.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibacterial activity of three members of a benzoxazine series of histidine kinase inhibitors ( 4a , 4b and 6 ) was studied on standard strains, and with 4b also on clinical isolates of enterococci. METHODS: Susceptibility to each compound was tested using a broth macrodilution method with a range of dilutions from 0.016 to 128 microg/ml on four standard strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212) and in the case of 4b also on 52 clinical isolates of enterococci (7 vancomycin-susceptible E. faecalis, 15 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium and 30 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium), and on two additional standard strains (S. aureus ATCC 43300 and E. faecalis ATCC 51299). RESULTS: Neither of the compounds inhibited the growth of E. coli ATCC 25922 or P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Compound 4b inhibited the growth of S. aureus ATCC 29213 at 8 microg/ml, S. aureus ATCC 43300 at 32 microg/ml, E. faecalis ATCC 29212, and E. faecalis ATCC 51299 at 16 microg/ml, while 4a and 6 did so at higher concentrations. For clinical isolates of enterococci, the minimal inhibitory concentrations of 4b were in the range of 0.5-16 microg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Compound 4b promises to be a potentially useful antimicrobial agent for vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococci.
TI  - Update on the in vitro activity of daptomycin tested against 17,193 Gram-positive bacteria isolated from European medical centers (2005-2007).
AB  - The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of 17,193 Gram-positive isolates consecutively collected from 28 medical centers in 12 countries in europe and israel in 2005-2007 were evaluated by Clinical and laboratory Standards institute (CLSI) broth microdilution methods supplemented with calcium to 50 mg/l for testing daptomycin. Overall, the rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was 28.3%, varying from 32.3% in 2005 to 27.1% in 2006 and 28.5% in 2007. Vancomycin resistance rates were 0.8% and 21.5% among Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, respectively. Among E. faecium, vancomycin resistance increased from 17.9% in 2005 to 26.3% in 2007, and varied from 0.0% in Spain, Sweden and Switzerland to as high as 54.6% in ireland for 2007. All isolates tested, except for seven CoNS (0.2%; 3,234 tested) were considered susceptible to daptomycin using breakpoints established by the United States food and Drug Administration, the CLSI and the EUCAST. Daptomycin was very active against all Gram-positive species with the highest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) results being 1, 4, 2 and 4 mg/l for S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, E. faecalis and E. faecium, respectively. Daptomycin activity was not adversely influenced by resistance to oxacillin among staphylococci or to vancomycin among enterococci.
TI  - Chronic suppurative otitis media in cleft palate: microorganism etiology and susceptibilities.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the microbial etiology of suppurative chronic otitis media (SCOM) in patients with complete cleft lip and palate and isolated cleft palate and to determine the sensitivity of isolated microorganisms to antibiotics by drug diffusion from impregnated discs in agar and the minimum inhibitory concentration of each drug to these microorganisms by drug dilution in agar. DESIGN/PATIENTS: Effusion samples of SCOM obtained from 40 patients with cleft lip and palate registered at the Hospital for Rehabilitation of Craniofacial Anomalies, University of Sao Paulo, at Bauru, Brazil, were bacteriologically analyzed by cultures. The isolated bacteria were submitted to an in vitro susceptibility test to clinically used drugs. RESULTS: Positive cultures were obtained in 100% of studied cases. Among the 57 strains observed, the most frequent were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (35%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.5%), Enterococcus faecalis (14%), and Proteus mirabilis (12%). The frequency of Gram-negative bacilli (enterobacteriaceae and nonfermentative bacilli) was 67%. Pseudomonas aeruginosa presented the highest sensitivity to ciprofloxacin, and enterobacteriaceae exhibited the highest sensitivity to gentamicin. The strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis presented the highest sensitivity to imipenem and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, respectively. CONCLUSION: Patients with cleft lip and palate presenting with SCOM exhibited 100% positive cultures, with the highest frequency of Pseudomonas and enterobacteriaceae. With regard to the action of antibiotics, imipenem was effective against the four species of isolated microorganisms, followed by ciprofloxacin, which was effective against 75% of isolated species.
TI  - Global reemergence of tuberculosis: are host defense peptides an option to ameliorate disease burden?
AB  - Tuberculosis is the most relevant infectious disease worldwide according to the estimates of the World Health Organization, and despite being a curable disease, it requires a 6-9-month therapy with multiple antibiotics. Intermittent drug therapy due to noncompliance or poor delivery of therapy promotes the emergence of bacterial strains showing resistance to multiple drugs and the rise of extremely drug-resistant strains. Moreover, increased antibiotic resistance has been observed for several microorganisms, including extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. In vitro, cathelicidin induction results in enhanced mycobacterial clearance, and synthetic human neutrophil peptides had a rather modest bactericidal effect in Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected mice. In vivo therapeutic efficacy of improved molecules that show enhanced bactericidal action in vitro remains to be tested.
TI  - Evaluation of an enterocin AS-48 enriched bioactive powder obtained by spray drying.
AB  - Enterocin AS-48 is a cationic cyclic bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecalis with broad bactericidal activity. Currently we are assaying the efficacy of AS-48 as biopreservative in foods. In this work we have applied the spray drying process to different AS-48 liquid samples to obtain active dried preparations. We have also assayed different methods, heat, UV irradiation and filtration, to inactivate/remove the AS-48 producer cells from the samples. Best results were obtained for the sample from CM-25 cation exchange, for which it was also possible to completely eliminate/inactivate the producer cells by heat or UV irradiation without loss of activity. When added at 0.016% or 5% to Brain Heart Infusion broth or to skim milk, respectively, the AS-48 powder caused early and complete inactivation of Listeria monocytogenes. A partial inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus was achieved in broth and in skim milk supplemented with 2.5% and 10% AS-48 powder, respectively.
TI  - Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum program: linezolid surveillance program results for 2008.
AB  - The seventh year of the Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum Program (2008) continues to monitor the in vitro activities of linezolid and comparator agents tested against Gram-positive pathogens in Latin America, Europe, Canada, and the Asia-Pacific region. Linezolid is an oxazolidinone approved for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections, complicated skin and soft tissue infections, and nosocomial pneumonia caused by various Gram-positive species including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Surveillance isolates were submitted from 64 medical centers (24 countries) for a total of 6121 strains. Each country was requested to send 200 consecutive isolates in 6 targeted pathogen categories to a central processing laboratory, except the United Kingdom, Japan, and China where more strains were processed (400, 400, and 800, respectively). Reference broth microdilution susceptibility testing methods were used to test the following organism groups: S. aureus (3240), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (748), enterococci (864), Streptococcus pneumoniae (655), viridans group (297), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (317). Eight linezolid-resistant (LZD-R) isolates were detected in 7 countries (Italy [2], France, China, Brazil, Sweden, Germany, and United Kingdom) among the enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis [3] and E. faecium [2]) and CoNS (3 Staphylococcus epidermidis). Five LZD-R isolates contained 23S rRNA mutations (G2576T or G2447T), and 2 strains had undeterminable resistance mechanisms. One CoNS (Italy) contained the mobile cfr gene. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci rates ranged from 0.0% in several countries to 59.4% in Taiwan. All streptococci were linezolid susceptible (MIC(90), 1 microg/mL). In conclusion, the activity of linezolid remained uniform and stable across the sampled geographic regions studied when compared to the 2006 to 2007 results. Documented LZD-R remains rare (only 0.13% overall but highest for CoNS [0.41%] and enterococci [0.69%]) among the 24 countries sampled for the 6 different pathogen groups. Rates of clindamycin resistance and the frequency of MRSA varied by geographic region and between nations; therefore, like oxazolidinones, it requires continued surveillance for changing resistance patterns.
TI  - Isolation and activity of two antibacterial biflavonoids from leaf extracts of Garcinia livingstonei (Clusiaceae).
AB  - The antibacterial activity of the acetone extract of Garcinia livingstonei leaves was studied using bioautography and by determining the minimum antibacterial concentration against four nosocomial pathogens. Bioautograms showed that two compounds were mainly responsible for the antibacterial activity. These were isolated by a combination of solvent-solvent fractionation and bioassay-guided chromatographic fractionation and were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and 2D NMR spectroscopy as amentoflavone and 4"-methoxy amentoflavone. The antibacterial activity of the isolated compounds was determined against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Three of the tested organisms were sensitive to both compounds with MIC values ranging from 8-100 microg/mL. P. aeruginosa was resistant with MICs > 100 microg/mL. The safety of the two compounds was assessed with a tetrazolium based colorimetric assay (MTT assay) using Vero monkey kidney cells. The compounds had low toxicity against the cell line with cytotoxic concentrations to 50% of the cells (LD50) of 386 microg/mL and > 600 microg/mL for amentoflavone and 4"-methoxy amentoflavone, respectively. Berberine, the positive control had a CC50 of 170 microg/mL. 4"-Methoxy amentoflavone was more active and much less toxic than amentoflavone.
TI  - Impact of a change in antibiotic prophylaxis on total antibiotic use in a surgical intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of reducing the length of antibiotic prophylaxis for cerebro spinal shunts on total antibiotic use and key resistant pathogens. METHODS: In January 2004, the use of antibiotic prophylaxis was reduced to a single shot dose with cefuroxime in an intensive care unit (ICU). Prior to this intervention, prophylaxis with second-generation cephalosporins was administered during the entire period of external cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) drainage. The effect on the antibiotic use density (AD: DDD [defined daily doses] per 1,000 patient-days[pd]) was calculated prior to (January 2002-December 2003) and following implementation of the intervention(January 2004-December 2006) by segmented regression analysis of an interrupted time series. Resistance proportions(RP) and resistance densities (RD), defined as resistant pathogen/1,000 pd of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis or E. faecium, third-generation-resistant (3GC) Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Pseudomonus aeruginosa, were compared by the Fisher's exact test before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Total antibiotic use by 147 DDD/1,000 pd decreased after the intervention when pre-operative prophylaxis was changed into single shot prophylaxis, from an estimated mean of 1,036 DDD/1,000 pd before the intervention to 887DDD/1,000 pd post-intervention. This decrease was primarily due to a significant reduction in the amount of cefuroxime used for prophylaxis. The reduction in total antibiotic consumption was sustainable, and it did not increase again during the next 36 months. The RR and RD of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli increased after January 2004, whereas the percentage of MRSA significantly decreased. CONCLUSION: Change to single shot prophylaxis along with an ongoing antibiotic stewardship program resulted in a cut-back in total antibiotic use amounting to as much as 15%. It would therefore appear that targeting interventions aimed at reducing antibiotic prophylaxis in surgical ICUs may be very worthwhile.
TI  - Antistaphylococcal effect of enterocin AS-48 in bakery ingredients of vegetable origin, alone and in combination with selected antimicrobials.
AB  - The inhibitory effect of enterocin AS-48 against Staphylococcus aureus was investigated in various types of bakery ingredients. Antibacterial activity greatly depended on the food substrate, ranging from complete inactivation of S. aureus in liquid caramel (in which the bacterium survived poorly) to no significant inhibition (as in vanilla or chocolate creams). Significant reductions of viable counts in the range of 1.8 to 2.7 log units (P < 0.05) were achieved in substrates like pumpkin confiture or diluted almond cream stored at temperatures of 10 or 22 degrees C. Given the very low activity detected in chocolate substrates, enterocin AS-48 was tested in combination with other antimicrobials. Bactericidal activity increased markedly for the combinations of AS-48 and 0.1% eugenol (v/v), 0.5% 2-nitropropanol (v/v), or 3% Nisaplin (w/v). Enterocin AS-48 could be applied in combination with other antimicrobials for preservation of bakery ingredients against S. aureus.
TI  - Multiplex PCR-ligation detection reaction assay for simultaneous detection of drug resistance and toxin genes from Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - A multiplex PCR-ligation detection reaction (PCR-LDR) assay was developed for rapid detection of methicillin, tetracycline, and vancomycin resistance, as well as toxic shock toxin and Panton-Valentine leukocidin. The assay was tested on 470 positive blood culture bottles containing Staphylococcus aureus or enterococci. PCR-LDR exhibited a sensitivity and specificity of > or = 98% for all components except tetracycline resistance, which had a sensitivity of 94.7%. Rapid and sensitive detection of antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes could help guide therapy and appropriate infection control measures.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,919 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2007].
AB  - We have reported in this journal in vitro susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics every year since 1992. In this paper, we report the results of an analysis of in vitro susceptibilities of 12,919 clinical isolates from 72 centers in Japan to selected antibiotics in 2007 compared with the results from previous years. The common respiratory pathogens, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae maintained a high susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (FQs). The resistance of S. pyogenes to macrolides has been increasing every year and this was especially clear this year. Most strains of Enterobacteriaceae except for Escherichia coli showed a high susceptibility to FQs. Almost 30% of E. coli strains were resistant to FQs and the resistance increased further this year. FQs resistance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was approximately 95% with the exception of 45% for sitafloxacin (STFX). FQs resistance of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) was low at about 10%. FQs resistance of methicillin-resistant coagulase negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) was higher than that of methicillin-susceptible coagulase negative Staphylococci (MSCNS), but it was lower than that of MRSA. However, FQs resistance of MSCNS was higher than that of MSSA. FQs resistance of Enterococcus faecalis was 22.5% to 29.6%, while that of Enterococcusfaecium was more than 85% except for STFX (58.3%). In clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa derived from urinary tract infections, FQs resistance was 21-27%, which was higher than that of P. aeruginosa from respiratory tract infections at 13-21%, which was the same trend as in past years. Multidrug resistant strains accounted for 5.6% in the urinary tract and 1.8% in the respiratory tract. Acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to FQs. The carbapenem resistant strains, which present a problem at present, accounted for 2.7%. Neisseria gonorrhoeae showed high resistance of 86-88% to FQs. The results of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant Staphylococci, Enterococci, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and N. gonorrhoeae showed resistance tendencies, and other species maintained high susceptibility rates more than 90% against FQs, which have been used clinically for over 15 years.
TI  - Suicide and fratricide in bacterial biofilms.
AB  - Bacterial autolysis has recently been identified as a key mechanism that regulates different phases of biofilm development including microcolony formation and dispersal. However such autolytic measures are limited to a subfraction of cells within the entire biofilm population. Here we speculate on the role biofilm heterogeneity plays in limiting autolysis within biofilms and further describe the molecular regulation of suicidal and fratricidal mechanisms in biofilm development of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial properties of (-)-nor-platencin.
AB  - An asymmetric Diels-Alder reaction between acrolein and 1-benzyloxymethyl-1,3-cyclohexadiene affords a bicyclic aldehyde that was elaborated in 11 steps to nor-platencin. nor-Platencin is 4-16 times less active than platencin against several resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, macrolide-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium.
TI  - Antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities of some flavonoids.
AB  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of six plant-derived flavonoids representing two different structural groups were evaluated against standard strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis and their drug-resistant isolates, as well as fungi (Candida albicans, C. krusei) using the microdilution broth method. Herpes simplex virus Type-1 and Parainfluenza-3 virus were employed for antiviral assessment of the flavonoids using Madin-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines. Ampicillin, gentamycin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, acyclovir, and oseltamivir were used as the control agents. All tested compounds (32-128 microg/ml) showed strong antimicrobial and antifungal activities against isolated strains of P. aeruginosa, A. baumanni, S. aureus, and C. krusei. Rutin, 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and 5,7,3'-trihydroxy-flavanone-4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (0.2-0.05 microg/ml) were active against PI-3, while 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4'-O-[2''-O-(5'''-O-trans-cinnamoyl)-beta-D-apiofuranosyl] -beta-D-glucopyranoside (0.16-0.2 microg/ml) inhibited potently HSV-1.
TI  - Characterization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. isolated from US West Coast public marine beaches.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (MRCoNS) from marine water and intertidal beach sand from public beaches in Washington State, USA. METHODS: Fifty-one staphylococci from Washington State beaches were characterized using antimicrobial susceptibility testing, carriage of acquired tetracycline and/or macrolide resistance genes, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing, the BBL Crystal Gram-Positive ID System and/or 16S rRNA sequencing, coagulase test and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) for MRSA. RESULTS: Five multidrug-resistant MRSA SCCmec type I, of which three were MLST type ST45, one ST59 and one a new MLST type, ST1405, plus one susceptible non-typeable (NT) MRSA ST30 were characterized. Thirty-three MRCoNS isolates, representing 21 strains from 9 Staphylococcus spp., carried a range of SCCmec types [I (2), II (6), III (3), V (2), I/II (1) and NT (7)] and varied in their antibiotic susceptibility to other antibiotic classes and carriage of acquired tetracycline/macrolide resistance gene(s). MRSA and MRCoNS donors co-transferred tet(M) and erm(A) genes to an Enterococcus faecalis recipient at a frequency of 10(-8). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of MRSA and MRCoNS isolated from marine water and intertidal beach sand. The MLST types and antibiotic carriage of five MRSA isolates were similar to hospital MRSA isolates rather than US community-acquired MRSA isolates. Our results suggest that public marine beaches may be a reservoir for transmission of MRSA to beach visitors as well as an ecosystem for exchange of antibiotic resistance genes among staphylococci and related genera.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of several concentrations of NaOCl and Octenisept in elimination of endodontic pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to test and compare the in vitro effectiveness of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), and octenidine hydrochloride (Octenisept) at different concentrations in the elimination of resistant microorganisms including S. aureus, E. faecalis, and C. albicans over a range of time intervals. STUDY DESIGN: A broth dilution test was performed, and the timing for irrigants to kill microbial cells was recorded. Then the samples were compared by using Kruskal-Wallis test, with significance level at P less than .05. Also minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Octenisept was evaluated. RESULTS: The in vitro antimicrobial effect of the most effective concentrations of the tested irrigants were ranked from strongest to weakest as follows: 100% Octenisept, 50% Octenisept, 5.25 % NaOCl, and 2.5 % NaOCl. CONCLUSIONS: The antimicrobial action is related to type and concentration of the irrigants as well as the microbial susceptibility.
TI  - In vitro activity of nemonoxacin (TG-873870), a novel non-fluorinated quinolone,  against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae with various resistance phenotypes in Taiwan.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the in vitro activities of nemonoxacin against Gram-positive cocci with various resistance phenotypes. METHODS: MICs of nemonoxacin were determined for 798 recently collected (2005-07) and non-duplicate isolates of Gram-positive cocci by the agar dilution method. These isolates included: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 100); methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), including ciprofloxacin-susceptible (n = 50), ciprofloxacin-resistant (n = 100), vancomycin-intermediate (n = 50) and daptomycin-non-susceptible (DNS-MRSA; n = 5) isolates, and community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA; n = 101); invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (n = 150); levofloxacin-non-susceptible (MICs of 4-64 mg/L) S. pneumoniae isolates (n = 30); and enterococci (n = 212), including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE; n = 112). RESULTS: Nemonoxacin had potent activity against MSSA (MIC(90) of < or =0.03 mg/L), ciprofloxacin-susceptible MRSA (MIC(90) of < or =0.03 mg/L) and CA-MRSA (MIC(90) of 0.06 mg/L). For all invasive S. pneumoniae isolates, the activity of nemonoxacin (MIC(90) of 0.06 mg/L) was similar to that of gemifloxacin and much better than that of levofloxacin (MIC(90) of 2 mg/L) and moxifloxacin (MIC(90) of 0.25 mg/L). Nemonoxacin had a 32- to 64-fold higher activity than levofloxacin against levofloxacin-non-susceptible isolates. Nemonoxacin exerted limited activity against ciprofloxacin-resistant MRSA (MIC(90) of 1 mg/L), vancomycin-intermediate MRSA (MIC(90) of 2 mg/L), DNS-MRSA (MIC(90) of 1 mg/L), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (MIC(90) of 2 mg/L for Enterococcus faecalis and 4 mg/L for Enterococcus faecium) and VRE (MIC(90) of 4 mg/L for E. faecalis and 16 mg/L for E. faecium). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings point to a potentially useful role for nemonoxacin in the treatment of infections caused by MSSA, ciprofloxacin-susceptible MRSA and S. pneumoniae with various resistance phenotypes.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of synthetic fire ant venom: the solenopsins and isosolenopsins.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We determined the in vitro activity of 9 synthetic fire ant venom alkaloids (+/-)-solenopsin A, (2R, 6R)-solenopsin A, (2S, 6S)-solenopsin B, (+/-)-isosolenopsin A, (2S, 6R)-isosolenopsin A,(2R, 6S)-isosolenopsin A, (+/-)-isosolenopsin B, (2S, 6R)-isosolenopsin B, and (2R, 6S)-isosolenopsin B against 6 species of bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bacteriocidal concentration were determined in accordance with the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Time kill studies used American Type Culture Collection bacterial isolates tested at 5 times the minimum inhibitory concentration. RESULTS: None of the venom alkaloids inhibited E. coli or P. aeruginosa, whereas all the alkaloids inhibited S. pneumoniae. Only 4 alkaloids inhibited S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and S. maltophilia. Time-kill kinetics indicates that all 4 active alkaloids had bactericidal activity. CONCLUSIONS: Specific isomers of synthetic fire ant venom alkaloids have antibacterial activity against human pathogens.
TI  - Bacterial tracheobronchitis. A rare cause of adult airway stenosis.
AB  - Bacterial tracheobronchitis is a rare cause of airway stenosis in adults. This report describes a 73-year-old woman with a recent history of polysialadenitis, who presented with severe airway obstruction due to infection and stenosis of tracheal and bronchial tissue. Tissue culture of the bronchial mucosa showed growth of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Sputum culture showed growth of MRSE, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae and Enterococcus faecalis; the same organisms were cultured from the salivary glands. Tracheostomy and antibiotic therapy were effective in controlling the disease.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the extracts of Kefe cumin (Laser trilobum L.) fruits from different regions.
AB  - Structural properties (using gas chromatographic analyses: gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) of some compounds (pure chemicals, essential oils, extracts, etc.) and systematic investigation of antimicrobial activities (with agar dilution and agar diffusion disc methods) were determined in the fruits of Kefe cumin (Laser trilobum L.) obtained from different regions (Germany, India, and Turkey). The main components were established as limonene (41.03-72.24%) and perillaldehyde (4.23-32.75%) in the essential oils determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Mineral contents in the fruits were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer. It was determined that the fruits were rich in potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, arsenic and aluminium minerals. The highest sodium content was found to be 9,261.28 mg/kg in the samples obtained from Turkey, but the potassium content of the samples from Germany and India was higher than that of Kefe cumin fruits obtained from Turkey. The fruit extracts had a significant antimicrobial effect on pathogen bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris (FMC 1), Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus cereus (FMC 19), Aeromonas hydrophila (ATCC 7965), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 15753), Klebsiella pneumoniae (FMC 5), Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter aerogenes (CCM 2531) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739), whereas no significant antimicrobial effect of the essential oils was observed.
TI  - Propagation of anaerobic bacteria within an aerobic multi-species chronic wound biofilm model.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Most chronic wound biofilms have been shown to have significant populations of anaerobes. In order to better screen antimicrobial and antibiofilm therapeutics, we evaluated the ability of key anaerobes to incorporate and propagate within our aerobic chronic wound biofilm. METHOD: We had previously developed a rapid model to simulate polymicrobial chronic wound biofilms. This model incorporated meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The model was used along with a variety of anaerobes to determine whether this biofilm model would support propagation of anaerobes similar to that we have identified in chronic wounds. RESULTS: Using our previously defined Lubbock Chronic Wound Biofilm (LCWB) model combined with quantitative PCR, anaerobic bacteria were shown to proliferate through integration into the biofilm under aerobic conditions. Using electron microscopy we show close association between aerobes and anaerobes within the biofilm suggesting a synergistic relationship. CONCLUSION: We have expanded the utility of the LCBW to show the ability of clinically significant anaerobic bacteria to thrive in aerobic conditions. The expansion of this model can further simulate the functional characteristics of chronic wound pathogenic biofilms and the species that dwell within them allowing improved ability to evaluate therapeutics that target anaerobes.
TI  - Assessment of antimicrobial resistance transfer between lactic acid bacteria and  potential foodborne pathogens using in vitro methods and mating in a food matrix.
AB  - The transferability of antimicrobial resistance from lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to potential pathogenic strains was studied using in vitro methods and mating in a food matrix. Five LAB donors containing either erythromycin or tetracycline resistance markers on transferable elements were conjugally mated with LAB (Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis) and pathogenic strains (Listeria spp., Salmonella ssp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli). In vitro transfer experiments were carried out with the donors and recipients using both the filter and plate mating methods. The food matrix consisted of fermented whole milk (fermented with the LAB donors) with the pathogenic recipients added as contaminants during the production process. All transconjugants were confirmed by phenotypic and molecular methods. Erythromycin resistance transfer from LAB strains to Listeria spp. was observed using both in vitro mating methods at high transfer frequencies of up to 5.1 x 10(-4) transconjugants per recipient. Also, high frequency transfer (ranging from 2.7 x 10(-8) up to 1.1 x 10(-3) transconjugants per recipient) of both erythromycin and tetracycline-resistance was observed between LAB species using in vitro methods. No resistance transfer was observed to Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and E. coli. The only conjugal transfer observed in the fermented milk matrix was for tetracycline resistance between two LAB strains (at a transfer frequency of 2.6 x 10(-7) transconjugants per recipients). This study demonstrates the transfer of antimicrobial resistance from LAB to Listeria spp. using in vitro methods and also the transfer of resistance between LAB species in a food matrix. It highlights the involvement of LAB as a potential source of resistance determinants that may be disseminated between LAB and pathogenic strains including Listeria spp. Furthermore, it indicates that food matrices such as fermented milks may provide a suitable environment to support gene exchange.
TI  - Antimicrobial and toxicological studies of some metal complexes of 4-methylpiperazine-1-carbodithioate and phenanthroline mixed ligands.
AB  - A few mixed ligand transition metal carbodithioate complexes of the general formula [M(4-MPipzcdt)x(phen)y]Y (M = Mn(II), Co(II), Zn(II); 4-MPipzcdt = 4-methylpiperazine-1-carbodithioate; phen = 1,10-phenanthroline; x = 1 and y = 2 when Y = Cl; x = 2 and y = 1 when Y = nil) were synthesized and screened for their antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis by disk diffusion method. All the complexes exhibited prominent antimicrobial activity against tested pathogenic strains with the MIC values in the range <8-512 gmL(-1). The complexes [Mn(4-MPipzcdt)2(phen)] and [Co(4-MPipzcdt)(phen)2]Cl inhibited the growth of Candida albicans at a concentration as low as 8 microgmL(-1). The complexes were also evaluated for their toxicity towards human transformed rhabdomyosarcoma cells (RD cells). Moderate cell viability of the RD cells was exhibited against the metal complexes.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of methanol extract of Ruta chalapensis (L), Quercus infectoria (Oliver) and Canthium parviflorum (Lam).
AB  - The present study aimed at evaluating the antibacterial activity of methanol extract of Ruta chalapensis, L., (Rutaceae), Quercus infectoria Oliver., (Fagaceae) and Canthium parviflorum Lam., (Rubiaceae) against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella oxytocoa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. The experiment was carried out using disc diffusion method. The results revealed that the methanol extract of aerial parts of Ruta chalepensis (L) presented the highest zone of inhibition against tested pathogens. Other plants showed significant zone of inhibition.
TI  - Total synthesis and biological evaluation of (+)- and (-)-bisanthraquinone antibiotic BE-43472B and related compounds.
AB  - The bisanthraquinone antibiotic BE-43472B [(+)-1] was isolated by Rowley and co-workers from a streptomycete strain found in a blue-green algae associated with the ascidian Ecteinascidia turbinata and has shown promising antibacterial activity against clinically derived isolates of methicillin-susceptible, methicillin-resistant, and tetracyclin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, MRSA, and TRSA, respectively) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). Described herein is the first total synthesis of both enantiomers of this bisanthraquinone antibiotic, the determination of its absolute configuration, and the biological evaluation of these and related compounds. The developed synthesis relies on a highly efficient cascade sequence involving an intermolecular Diels-Alder reaction between diene (R)-61 and dienophile 55, followed by an intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic ipso substitution. Late-stage transformations included a remarkable photochemical alpha,beta-epoxyketone rearrangement [80 --> (+)-1]. Interestingly, the unnatural enantiomer [(-)-1] of antibiotic BE-43472B exhibited antibacterial properties comparable to those of the natural enantiomer [(+)-1].
TI  - Is there an association between nosocomial infection rates and bacterial cross transmissions?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Surveillance data of nosocomial infection rates are increasingly used  for public reporting and interhospital comparisons. Approximately 15% of nosocomial infections on intensive care units are the result of patient-to-patient transmissions of the causative organisms. These exogenous infections could be prevented by adherence to basic infection control measures. The association between bacterial cross transmissions and nosocomial infection rates was analyzed. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study during 24 months. SETTING: Eleven intensive care units from two university hospitals. PATIENTS: All inpatients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary isolates of six indicator organisms (Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus) cultured from clinical samples or methicillin-resistant S. aureus surveillance testing of all inpatients were genotyped. Indistinguishable isolates in > or =2 patients defined potential episodes of transmissions. Surveillance of nosocomial infection rates was performed according to the German nosocomial infection surveillance system, Krankenhaus Infektions Surveillance System. Transmission events and nosocomial infection rates were pooled by intensive care unit to calculate Spearman's rank-correlation test. During 100,781 patient days, 100,829 microbiological specimens from 24,362 patients were sampled (average investigation density: 1.0 sample per patient and day) and 3419 primary indicator organisms were cultured. Altogether, 462 transmissions (incidence density of 4.6 transmissions per 1000 patient days; range, 1.4-8.4 days) and 1216 nosocomial infections (incidence density of 12.1 per 1000 patient days; range, 6.2-16.6 days) were discerned. Correlation analysis was unable to reveal any association between the incidence of cross transmissions and nosocomial infections, duration of hospitalization, or device use. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in nosocomial infection rates between study intensive care units are not explained solely by cross transmissions. Other factors, like the severity of the patient's underlying diseases, the patient's endogenous flora, or invasive procedures, likely have a dominant effect on the magnitude of nosocomial infection rates.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of plants from northeast of Mexico.
AB  - Traditional medicine has a key role in health care worldwide. Obtaining scientific information about the efficacy and safety of the plants from our region is one of the goals of our research group. In this report, 17 plants were selected and collected in different localities from northeast Mexico. The dried plants were separated into leaves, flowers, fruit, stems, roots and bark. Each part was extracted with methanol, and 39 crude extracts were prepared. The extracts were tested for their antimicrobial activity using three Gram-negative bacterial strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii), three Gram-positive bacterial strains (Enterococcus faecalis and two Staphylococcus aureus strains), and seven clinically isolated yeasts (Candida albicans, C. krusei, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata); their antioxidant activity was tested using a DPPH free radical assay. No activity against Gram-negative bacteria was observed with any extract up to the maximum concentration tested, 1000 mug ml(-1). We report here for the first time activity of Ceanothus coeruleus against S. aureus (flowers, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) 125 mug ml(-1)), C. glabrata (MICs 31.25 mug ml(-1)) and C. parapsilosis (MICs between 31.25 and 125 mug ml(-1)); Chrysanctinia mexicana against C. glabrata (MICs 31.25 mug ml(-1)); Colubrina greggii against E. faecalis (MICs 250 mug ml(-1)) and Cordia boissieri against C. glabrata (MIC 125 mug ml(-1)). Furthermore, this is the first report about antioxidant activity of extracts from Ceanothus coeruleus, Chrysanctinia mexicana, Colubrina greggii and Cyperus alternifolius. Some correlation could exist between antioxidant activity and antiyeast activity against yeasts in the species Ceanothus coeruleus, Schinus molle, Colubrina greggii and Cordia boissieri.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of the essential oil of Cordia verbenacea from the Venezuelan Andes.
AB  - The essential oil of Cordia verbenacea D.C. (Boraginaceae) that grows in Merida-Venezuela was obtained by hydrodistillation from the aerial parts of the plant, yielding 0.21%. The oil was analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS. Thirty one components which made up 94.3% of the oil were identified. The most abundant constituents found were: tricyclene (23.9%), bicyclogermacrene (11.7%), germacrene D (9.9%) and beta-caryophyllene (8.2%). Antibacterial activity determination was carried out according to the disc diffusion assay. Activity against Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, at a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 170 microg/mL and 200 microg/mL, was found.
TI  - Microbiology of drugs for treating multiply drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Several new antimicrobials demonstrate in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and other Gram-positive bacteria. Data from large surveys indicate that linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline are almost universally active against MRSA. Linezolid and tigecycline inhibit both Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis at low concentrations; daptomycin is somewhat more potent against the latter. The investigational agents dalbavancin and telavancin are more potent than vancomycin against vancomycin-susceptible organisms. Dalbavancin inhibits vanB type VRE at low concentrations, but is not active against vanA type VRE. Telavancin is less active against VRE than against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci, but minimum inhibitory concentrations are lower than those of vancomycin against VRE. With continued careful use of available antimicrobials, the vast majority of these organisms should remain susceptible to 1 or more of the agents discussed for the foreseeable future.
TI  - In vivo activity of a novel anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin, ceftaroline, against vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecalis strains in a rabbit endocarditis model: a comparative study with linezolid and vancomycin.
AB  - We assessed the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of the novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin ceftaroline against Enterococcus faecalis in time-kill experiments and in a rabbit endocarditis model with simulated human dosing. Ceftaroline was more active than either vancomycin or linezolid against vancomycin-sensitive and -resistant isolates of E. faecalis.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-positive bacteria isolated from US medical centers: results of the Daptomycin Surveillance Program (2007-2008).
AB  - Gram-positive bacterial strains (12 443) consecutively collected during 2007 to 2008 in hospitals located in the United States were tested by reference broth microdilution methods against daptomycin and comparison agents. Methicillin (oxacillin) resistance rates were 55.9% and 74.0% for Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, respectively, and the vancomycin resistance rate among Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were 5.4% and 75.4%, respectively. Daptomycin was very active against all Gram-positive species with MIC(90) values of 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, and 2 microg/mL for staphylococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, viridans group streptococci, and enterococci, respectively. Overall, 99.9% of S. aureus, 100.0% of E. faecalis, and 99.5% of E. faecium were susceptible to daptomycin. In addition, daptomycin MIC distributions for S. aureus and enterococci from 2007 to 2008 were very similar to those from 2002 to 2003. In summary, high rates of methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci were observed in US hospitals, but daptomycin remains active against these clinically important Gram-positive organisms with no evidence of potency loss since its approval for clinical use in late 2003.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity profile of oritavancin against recent gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - Oritavancin activity was tested against 15,764 gram-positive isolates collected from 246 hospital centers in 25 countries between 2005 and 2008. Organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9,075), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 1,664), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1,738), Enterococcus faecium (n = 819), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 959), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 415), group C, G, and F streptococci (n = 84), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1,010). Among the evaluated staphylococci, 56.7% were resistant to oxacillin. The vancomycin resistance rate among enterococci was 21.2%. Penicillin-resistant and -intermediate rates were 14.7% and 21.4%, respectively, among S. pneumoniae isolates. Among nonpneumococcal streptococci, 18.5% were nonsusceptible to erythromycin. Oritavancin showed substantial in vitro activity against all organisms tested, regardless of resistance profile. The maximum oritavancin MIC against all staphylococci tested (n = 10,739) was 4 microg/ml; the MIC(90) against S. aureus was 0.12 microg/ml. Against E. faecalis and E. faecium, oritavancin MIC(90)s were 0.06 and 0.12, respectively. Oritavancin was active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, including VanA strains (n = 486), with MIC(90)s of 0.25 and 1 microg/ml against VanA E. faecium and E. faecalis, respectively. Oritavancin showed potent activity against streptococci (n = 2,468); MIC(90)s for the different streptococcal species were between 0.008 and 1 microg/ml. These data are consistent with previous studies with respect to resistance rates of gram-positive isolates and demonstrate the spectrum and in vitro activity of oritavancin against a wide variety of contemporary gram-positive pathogens, regardless of resistance to currently used drugs. The data provide a foundation for interpreting oritavancin activity and potential changes in susceptibility over time once oritavancin enters into clinical use.
TI  - In vitro activity of nemonoxacin, a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, against 2,440 clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nemonoxacin (TG-873870), a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, was tested against 2,440 clinical isolates. Nemonoxacin was at least fourfold more active than levofloxacin and moxifloxacin against most gram-positive cocci tested (shown by the following MIC(90)/range [microg/ml] values; community-associated methicillin [meticillin]-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 0.5/0.015 to 2; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.5/0.015 to 4 for methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and 2/0.12 to 2 for methicillin-resistant staphylococci; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.015/< or = 0.008 to 0.25; Enterococcus faecalis, 1/0.03 to 128). Nemonoxacin activity against gram-negative bacilli was similar to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin (MIC(90)/range [microg/ml]; Escherichia coli, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2/< or = 0.015 to 128; K. oxytoca, 0.5/0.06 to 1; Proteus mirabilis, 16/0.25 to > or = 512; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Acinetobacter baumannii, 1/0.12 to 16).
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms: tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004 to 2007.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Against Gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline MIC(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/L for Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Against Gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline MIC(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/L for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (7.0%) and K. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (45.9%) and E. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (13.8%). Tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult to treat organisms.
TI  - Evaluation of toxic side effects of clinically used skin antiseptics in vitro.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Skin antiseptics are widely used in health-care worldwide. However, there is a need to determine cytotoxicity of these medications on wounds. The aim of this study was to evaluate cytotoxic effects of five clinically used antiseptics on human skin cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five clinically used skin antiseptics (Prontosan, Lavasept, Braunol, Octenisept, and Betaisodona) were tested. The minimal inhibitory concentration was determined against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli). The cytotoxic effects on primary keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and a HaCaT cell line were determined (MTT-assay and BrdU-ELISA) at a wide range of concentrations. RESULTS: The agents tested showed effective antibacterial properties (Octenisept, Lavasept, and Prontosan showed higher efficacy than Braunol and Betaisodona) and different degrees of cytotoxicity. Lavasept and Prontosan demonstrated less toxicity on primary human fibroblasts and keratinocytes, whereas Octenisept, Betaisodona, and Braunol showed a significant (P<0.05) decrease in cell viability to 0% on keratinocytes at concentrations of 4%, 7.5%, and 12.5%, and on fibroblasts at 7.5% and 10%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Due to the cytotoxic effect of some antiseptics on human skin cells, it is advised that health care professionals balance the cytotoxicity of the medication, their antiseptic properties, and the severity of colonization when selecting a wound care antiseptic. In this study, Lavasept and Prontosan showed best result regarding antibacterial efficacy and cell toxicity.
TI  - Assay of enterocin AS-48 for inhibition of foodborne pathogens in desserts.
AB  - Enterocin AS-48 was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Listeria monocytogenes in different kinds of desserts. The highest activity against S. aureus was detected in baker cream. However, in yogurt-type soy-based desserts and in gelatin pudding, AS-48 (175 arbitrary units [AU]/g) reduced viable cell counts of S. aureus by only 1.5 to 1.8 log units at most. The efficacy of AS-48 in puddings greatly depended on inoculum size, and viable S. aureus counts decreased below detection levels within 24 h for inocula lower than 4 to 5.5 log CFU/g. For L. monocytogenes, bacteriocin concentrations of 52.5 to 87.5 AU/g reduced viable counts below detection levels and avoided regrowth of survivors. The lowest activity was detected in yogurt-type desserts. For B. cereus, viable cell counts were reduced below detection levels for bacteriocin concentrations of 52.5 AU/g in instant pudding without soy or by 175 AU/g in the soy pudding. In gelatin pudding, AS-48 (175 AU/g) reduced viable cell counts of B. cereus below detection levels after 8 h at 10 degrees C or after 48 h at 22 degrees C. Bacteriocin addition also inhibited gelatin liquefaction caused by the proteolytic activity of B. cereus.
TI  - Effect of mixed antimicrobial agents and flavors in active packaging films.
AB  - Active packaging is an emerging food technology to improve the quality and safety of food products. Many works have been developed to study the antimicrobial activity of essential oils. Essential oils have been traditionally used as flavorings in food, so they have an important odor impact but they have as well antimicrobial properties that could be used to protect the food. Recent developments in antimicrobial active packaging showed the efficiency of essential oils versus bread and bakery products among other applications. However, one of the main problems to face is the odor and taste they could provide to the packaged food. Using some aromas to mask the odor could be a good approach. That is why the main objective of this paper is to develop an antimicrobial packaging material based on the combination of the most active compounds of essential oils (hydrocinnamaldehyde, oregano essential oil, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol) together with some aromas commonly used in the food industry. A study of the concentration required to get the antimicrobial properties, the organoleptic compatibility with typical aroma present in many food systems (vanilla, banana, and strawberry), and the right combination of both systems has been carried out. Antimicrobial tests of both the mentioned aromas, the main components of some essential oils, and the combination of both groups were carried out against bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella choleraesuis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Escherichia coli), yeasts (Candida albicans, Debaryomyces hansenii, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii), and molds (Botrytis cinerae, Aspergillus flavus, Penicillium roqueforti, Eurotium repens, Penicillium islandicum, Penicillium commune, Penicillium nalgiovensis). The sensory properties of the combinations were evaluated with a triangular test and classification was by an order test; the odor threshold of the aroma compounds was also studied. The results reveal that none of the aromas had antimicrobial properties. The most antimicrobial compounds are thymol, carvacrol, and cinnamaldehyde, but none of them could be combined with banana aroma, whereas only thymol with strawberry aroma gave the right combined organoleptic profile. All of the antimicrobials under study could be combined with vanilla aroma, providing both antimicrobial property and the odor expected.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of a series of alpha-substituted acetylpiperazinyl oxazolidinones.
AB  - A series of oxazolidinone derivatives with alpha-substituted acetylpiperazinyl groups were prepared. Their in vitro antibacterial activities were studied against Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis. The compounds with chloroacetyl-piperazinyl or dichloroacetyl-piperazinyl group were found to have superior antibacterial activities to linezolid against most of tested Gram-positive pathogens. The compounds with propionylpiperaziny or fluoroacetylpiperazinyl group were found to have comparable antibacterial activities with linezolid. However, the replacement of phenyl ring of the compounds with pyridine ring resulted in the significant loss of antibacterial activity.
TI  - How common is MRSA in adult septic arthritis?
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: We determine the proportion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in adult septic arthritis patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional retrospective review in 2 urban academic EDs in northern California, one tertiary care and one public. Subjects included patients who underwent arthrocentesis in the ED from April 2006 through July 2007. We queried the microbiology laboratory databases for synovial fluid cultures sent from the ED. We reviewed synovial fluid culture results and corresponding synovial fluid analyses and then classified positive culture results as true septic arthritis or likely contaminant. For septic arthritis cases, we reviewed medical records and abstracted presenting features. We report our findings with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: One hundred nine synovial fluid cultures were sent from the EDs. Twenty-three results (21%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 14% to 30%) were positive, of which 9 were likely contaminants; 1 was from a soft tissue abscess and 1 was from bursitis. Of 12 septic arthritis cases, 6 cultures (50%; 95% CI 21% to 78%) grew MRSA, 4 (33%; 95% CI 7% to 60%) methicillin-susceptible S aureus, and 1 each (8%; 95% CI 0% to 24%) Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Of the 6 MRSA cases, 4 were in male patients; median age of patients was 47.5 years, 3 patients had previously diseased joints, 2 patients injected drugs, 2 patients were febrile, 3 patients had previously diseased joints, median synovial fluid leukocyte count was 15,184 cells/microL (range 3,400 to 34,075 cells/microL), and 5 patients received appropriate ED antibiotics. CONCLUSION: In this 2-ED population from a single geographic region, MRSA was the most common cause of community-onset adult septic arthritis. Synovial fluid cell counts were unexpectedly low in MRSA septic arthritis cases.
TI  - Crystal structures of bacterial FabH suggest a molecular basis for the substrate  specificity of the enzyme.
AB  - FabH (beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III) is unique in that it initiates fatty acid biosynthesis, is inhibited by long-chain fatty acids providing means for feedback control of the process, and dictates the fatty acid profile of the organism by virtue of its substrate specificity. We report the crystal structures of bacterial FabH enzymes from four different pathogenic species: Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Structural data on the enzyme from different species show important differences in the architecture of the substrate-binding sites that parallel the inter-species diversity in the substrate specificities of these enzymes.
TI  - Trends in udder health and emerging mastitogenic pathogens in South African dairy herds.
AB  - The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyse the results of milk samples  obtained from South African dairy herds during the period 1996 to April 2007 in order to identify possible trends in isolates of microorganisms and their pathogenicity under field conditions. Milk samples were obtained from 7 of the 9 provinces in South Africa where there are low numbers of dairy cows. Although there is scientific limitation to a country wide survey, such as the variation in herd size, management skills, parity, milk yield, milking frequency and other parameters, the size of this database helps to give a fair indication of general udder health in South Africa. Cytology and routine bacteriology were performed on 379,000 milk samples of lactating cows and bacteriology on 11,946 samples from non-lactating cows. According to the results obtained, mastitis did not decrease in South Africa over the test period. The prevalence of mastitis and teat canal infection was lowest in 2002. Mastitis and teat canal infection increased from 2002 to 2006 from 8.1% and 24.1% to 15.4 and 30.0% respectively. The percentage of mastitogenic pathogens isolated from cows over these years also varied. Previously unknown or almost eradicated mastitogenic pathogens such as alphabeta haemolytic Staphylococcus aureus which is thought to be of human origin, Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus canis were responsible for numerous mastitis outbreaks seen in the test samples. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most frequently isolated bacteria in milk samples from both lactating and dry cows, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae. Although Staphylococcus aureus remained the principal mastitogenic pathogen in South Africa, owing to its chronic nature and resultant economic losses, most cases of mastitis were caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci. This finding increases the importance of coagulase-negative staphylococci (formerly described as a minor pathogen) significantly. Isolations of Streptococcus agalactiae peaked between 2000 and 2005 and decreased again by 2007. Coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates increased from 2002 and were still on the increase in 2007. Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis and Enterococcus canis were isolated more frequently from milk samples of lactating cows compared with dry cows, while Enterococcus faecalis was isolated more frequently from dry cow samples.
TI  - Aryl rhodanines specifically inhibit staphylococcal and enterococcal biofilm formation.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus are the leading causative agents of indwelling medical device infections because of their ability to form biofilms on artificial surfaces. Here we describe the antibiofilm activity of a class of small molecules, the aryl rhodanines, which specifically inhibit biofilm formation of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and E. gallinarum but not the gram-negative species Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Escherichia coli. The aryl rhodanines do not exhibit antibacterial activity against any of the bacterial strains tested and are not cytotoxic against HeLa cells. Preliminary mechanism-of-action studies revealed that the aryl rhodanines specifically inhibit the early stages of biofilm development by preventing attachment of the bacteria to surfaces.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of vertilmicin, a new aminoglycoside antibiotic.
AB  - Vertilmicin is a novel aminoglycoside antibiotic with potent activity against gram-negative and -positive bacteria in vitro. In this study, we further evaluated the efficacy of vertilmicin in vivo in systemic and local infection animal models. We demonstrated that vertilmicin had relatively high and broad-spectrum activities against mouse systemic infections caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. The 50% effective doses of subcutaneously administered vertilmicin were 0.63 to 0.82 mg/kg, 0.18 to 0.29 mg/kg, 0.25 to 0.99 mg/kg, and 4.35 to 7.11 mg/kg against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and E. faecalis infections, respectively. The therapeutic efficacy of vertilmicin was generally similar to that of netimicin, better than that of gentamicin in all the isolates tested, and better than that of verdamicin against E. coli 9612 and E. faecalis HH22 infections. The therapeutic efficacy of vertilmicin was further confirmed in local infection models of rabbit skin burn infection and mouse ascending urinary tract infection.
TI  - Phytochemical, antibacterial, antiproliferative, and antioxidant potentials and DNA damage-protecting activity of Acacia salicina extracts.
AB  - The extract enriched in total oligomer flavonoids (TOF), and the aqueous, methanol, and ethyl acetate extracts of Acacia salicina were investigated for their polyphenolic compound content, antioxidative activity in the nitro blue tetrazolium/riboflavin assay system, antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial reference strains, antigenotoxic activity tested with the Ames assay, and cytotoxic activity against the K562 human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line and L1210 leukemia murine cells. TOF extract was effective at inhibiting nitro blue tetrazolium reduction by superoxide radical in a nonenzymatic O(2)(*-)-generating system. Significant activity against bacterial reference strains Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enteritidis, and Salmonella typhimurium was shown with all the tested extracts. These extracts significantly decreased the genotoxicity induced by sodium azide and 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine. A pronounced cytotoxic effect on both leukemia cell lines was detected in TOF, methanolic and ethyl acetate extracts. The antioxidant, antimicrobial, antigenotoxic, and cytotoxic activities exhibited by A. salicina depended on the chemical composition of the tested extracts.
TI  - Uropathogen interaction with the surface of urological stents using different surface properties.
AB  - PURPOSE: Ureteral stents commonly become infected or encrusted. Various coatings  have been developed to decrease bacterial adherence. To our knowledge there has been no in vitro testing of coating with heparin to date. We determined the effects of heparin coating on bacterial adherence of common uropathogens and physical stent properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Heparin coated Radiance ureteral stents (Cook) and noncoated Endo-Sof control stents were tested against triclosan eluting Triumph(R) stents and noneluting Polaris control stents for adherence of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa for 7 days. Adherent bacteria were determined and biofilms were visualized using fluorescent dyes. Radial, tensile and coil strength of the Radiance and Polaris stents was compared to determine the effect of heparin coating on physical stent characteristics. RESULTS: Heparin coating did not decrease bacterial adhesion compared to its control. E. coli adhesion was limited by all stents tested. The Polaris stent showed significantly greater resistance to bacterial adherence for Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and Enterococcus than the Endo-Sof and Radiance stents but was more susceptible to S. aureus adherence. The Triumph stent resisted all bacteria except Pseudomonas and Enterococcus. Mature biofilms were observed on all stents with lower viability on the Triumph stent. Radiance stents showed higher tensile and lower compression strength than its control. CONCLUSIONS: Heparin coating does not decrease bacterial adherence to ureteral stents. Drug eluting antimicrobials have an inhibitory effect on bacterial adherence and the Polaris stent showed the least bacterial adherence of the nondrug eluting ureteral stents tested.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and evaluation of antibacterial activity of some thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole incorporating diphenylsulfone moieties.
AB  - A series of thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole incorporating diphenylsulfone moieties were synthesized starting from 5-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thioles 3a-c, X=H, Cl, Br. Thus, alkylation of 1,2,4-triazoles 3 with phenacyl bromide or 4-bromophenacyl bromide afforded S-substituted 1,2,4-triazoles 4, 5. These new intermediates 4 and 5, in the presence of H(2)SO(4) (c), were cyclized to 2-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl]-6-(4-Y-phenyl)[1,3]thiazolo[3,2-b]-[1,2,4]-triaz oles 6, 7 (I) and not to isomeric thiazolo[2,3-c][1,2,4]-triazoles 6, 7 (II). The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, (1)H, (13)C NMR and elemental analysis. MS spectra confirmed the formation of thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole 6, 7 (forms I) in detriment of [2,3-c] isomeric compounds (forms II). The potential antibacterial effects of the synthesized compounds were investigated using standard bacterial strains: Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606, Citrobacter freundii ATCC 8090, Escherichia coli ATCC 11775, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of 0.5%, 1%, and 2.5% sodium hypochlorite in root canals instrumented with the ProTaper Universal system.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of 0.5%, 1% and 2.5% sodium hypochlorite in root canals instrumented with the ProTaper Universal system. STUDY DESIGN: Fifty human mandibular premolar teeth with single root canals were infected with a mixture of C. albicans, P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis, and S. aureus. The specimens were randomly divided into 5 groups with 10 root canals each according to the irrigant used: group 1: 0.5% NaOCl; group 2: 1% NaOCl; group 3: 2.5% NaOCl; group 4 (positive control): 0.85% sterile saline solution; group 5 (negative control, without microorganisms): 0.85% sterile saline solution. All root canals were instrumented with the ProTaper Universal system. The assessment of the antimicrobial action of the irrigant was performed before the biomechanical preparation (0), and after instrumentation with S1 (1), S2 (2), F1 (3), F2 (4), and F3 (5) files. RESULTS: All positive control samples showed microbial growth, whereas negative control samples showed no microbial growth before the biomechanical preparation and after the instrumentation with S1, S2, F1, F2, and F3 files. The microorganisms were eliminated after the instrumentation with S1 file in all tested irrigants, except for 1 sample in S1 at 0.5% NaOCl which showed positive growth. There was no significant statistical difference (P = 1.000) among the tested irrigants. CONCLUSION: Sodium hypochlorite, at all tested concentrations, was effective in eliminating C. albicans, P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis, and S. aureus in combination with the NiTi rotary instrumentation with the ProTaper Universal system.
TI  - [In vitro activity of daptomycin and other antimicrobial agents against 499 strains of gram-positive cocci causing bloodstream infection].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the in vitro activity of daptomycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, tigecycline, ceftobiprole and linezolid against 499 strains of blood-isolated gram-positive cocci. METHODS: Determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs) of daptomycin with microbrothdilution method and the MICs of other 9 antimicrobial agents with agar dilution method against 499 strains of blood-isolated gram positive cocci was carried out. The data was analyzed with WHONET 5.4 software. RESULTS: The susceptibility rates of staphylococci to daptomycin, tigecycline, linezolid, ceftobiprole, vancomycin and teicoplanin were 100%. All staphylococcus strains were inhibited by daptomycin at a MIC of 1 mg/L. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) of daptomycin were both 0.5 mg/L against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus coagulase-negative (MRSCoN). Among Enterococcus spp, the highest MIC of daptomycin was 4 mg/L. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) of daptomycin were both 2 mg/L against E.faecalis, whereas they were 2 mg/L and 4 mg/L against E.faecium. One strains of linezolid-resistant E.faecalis (MIC: 8 mg/L) was susceptible to daptomycin (MIC: 1 mg/L). Three strains of E.faecium carrying vanA gene with vancomycin MICs above 32 mg/L and teicoplanin MICs also 32 mg/L were susceptible to daptomycin, tigecycline and linezolid. The MIC range of daptomycin against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus viridans was 0.032 - 0.25 mg/L and 0.125 - 1.000 mg/L separately. CONCLUSIONS: Daptomycin has excellent in vitro activity against common gram-positive pathogens isolated from blood. It may be a good choice for clinicians to treat drug-resistant gram-positive cocci.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of HM-242, a novel antiseptic compound.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of N(4)-octyl-6,6-dimethyl-N(2)-(4-methylbenzyl)-1,6-dihydro-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diam ine (HM-242), a novel synthetic compound, were compared with those of chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG). HM-242 was a more potent microbicide than CHG in vitro; however, its minimal inhibitory concentrations were similar. In particular, HM-242 killed various Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, both efficiently and rapidly. HM-242 also showed potent virucidal activity against enveloped viruses such as influenza virus and herpes simplex virus. These characteristics suggest that HM-242 may well be useful as an antiseptic.
TI  - [Distribution and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria isolated from infected wounds of children after Wenchuan earthquake].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and the drug resistance pattern of pathogenic bacteria isolated from pediatric cases suffering from wounds infection following the Wenchuan earthquake. METHODS: Of the ninety-eight injured children, 50 had wound infection diagnosed by clinical examination. Specimens for culture were collected from the fifty injured children and the results of bacterial identification and antibiotic resistance were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: In the fifty injured children with wound infection, microbial growth was detected in 31 (62.0%) and 21 children suffered from mixed infections (the infection rate was 67.7%). Ninety-nine pathogens were isolated, gram positive bacteria accounted for 16.16% (16 strains), Gram negative bacteria accounted for 81.82% (81 strains), and fungus 2.02% (2 strains). Staphylococcus aureus (5 strains, 5.05%), Enterococcus faecalis (3 strains, 3.03%) and Enterococcus faecium (2 strains, 2.02%) were the primary Gram-positive bacteria identified and Gram-negative infections typically included Acinetobacter baumanii (27 strains, 27.27%), Enterobacter cloacae (18 strains, 18.18%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 strains, 13.13%). Acinetobacter baumanii was the most common organism isolated from wounds. Duration of being szeged and complications had a significant association with wound infection with Acinetobacter baumanii. Drug sensitivity tests displayed that the isolated bacteria were highly resistant to common antibiotics. One strain of Acinetobacter baumanii-calcoaceticus complex and six strains of Acinetobacter baumanii were resistant to all common antibiotics including imipenem/cilastatin. Vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive bacteria were not identified. CONCLUSION: Following the Wenchuan earthquake disaster, wound infection profiles of pediatric patients were significantly different, Acinetobacter baumanii was the main common organism isolated from wounds in contrast to the previous low isolation rate. The isolated bacteria were highly and multiple drug resistant and it was difficult to treat. Knowing the distribution and the drug resistance pattern of pathogen is of paramount importance in guiding the clinical treatment.
TI  - [Bacterial composition and resistance from urinary tract infections in females].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the bacterial composition and antibacterial resistance in female urinary tract infections (UTI) in China. METHODS: The disc diffusion test, minimum inhibition concentration (MIC), test or E-test was used to detect the antimicrobial susceptibility in 86 tertiary hospitals in China from June 1, 2006 to May 31, 2007. WHONET 5.4 was applied for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 6071 pathogenic germs were collected from urine cultures of UTI female patients in the surveillance period, which included 5958 bacterial isolates. Escherichia coli 3529 strains (59.23%), Enterococcus spp 938 strains (15.74%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae 394 strains (6. 61%) were the most common pathogens. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae had 35.7% and 34.0% extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) positive rates, and their resistant rates to quinolones were about 70% and 40%, respectively. Enterococcus faecium was much more resistant to almost all the antibiotics than Enterococcus faecalis. 0.9% Escherichia faecalis and 3. 8% Escherichia faecium were resistant to vancomycin, whereas 2.7% and 4.8% were resistant to teicoplanin. Staphylococcus epdermidis was more common in UTI than Staphylococcus aureus, 79.1% and 75.0% of the isolates being methicillin-ressitant Staphylococcus epdermidis (MRSE) or methicillin-ressitant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), respectively. No vancomycin intermediate or resistant staphylococcus was detected, but 4.9% teicoplanin intermediate rate was found in Staphylococcus epdermidis. The resistant rates to quinolones increased with the patient age. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial resistance in UTI in Chinese females is a severe problem, which could be resulted from antimicrobial irrational use. In the selection of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of UTI, doctors should refer to the results of bacterial resistant surveillance.
TI  - [Multicenter study of in vitro activity of tigecycline in clinical isolates from  30 centers in Spain].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In the last years, the increase of antibiotic resistances of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria is an important therapeutic problem. The antimicrobial activity of tigecycline, a novel glycylcycline, was evaluated against 750 bacterial isolates from 30 centers in Spain. METHODS: Multicenter and retrospective study. In 2005, thirty laboratories participated in this study. Data collected in this study included antimicrobial susceptibilities for S.aureus resistant to methicillin (MRSA), ESBL- E. coli or ESBL- K. pneumoniae, E. coli resistant to quinolons (E.coli- QR), Klebsiella spp and E. faecalis. Trains were obtained of the each Hospital s collection (5 strains of each microorganisms). The susceptibility determinations were performed locally by each laboratory following the standard method usually performed. The tigecycline susceptibility determinations were performed with E/test. RESULTS: Tigecycline was the most potent agent against MRSA, E. faecalis, E.coli-QR and ESBLs enterobacteriaceae; with MIC50-MIC90 values of: 0.125-0.25 g/ml; 0.125-0.5 g/ml; 0.25-0.75 g/ml and 0.38-1.5 g/ml; respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study confirm the excellent in vitro activity of tigecycline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, including multirresistant microorganisms.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo properties of dihydrophthalazine antifolates, a novel family of antibacterial drugs.
AB  - Racemic 2,4-diaminopyrimidine dihydrophthalazine derivatives BAL0030543, BAL0030544, and BAL0030545 exhibited low in vitro MICs toward small, selected panels of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Mycobacterium avium, though the compounds were less active against Haemophilus influenzae. The constellation of dihydrofolate reductases (DHFRs) present in 20 enterococci and 40 staphylococci was analyzed and correlated with the antibacterial activities of the dihydrophthalazines and trimethoprim. DHFRs encoded by dfrB, dfrA (S1 isozyme), dfrE, and folA were susceptible to the dihydrophthalazines, whereas DHFRs encoded by dfrG (S3 isozyme) and dfrF were not. Studies with the separated enantiomers of BAL0030543, BAL0030544, and BAL0030545 revealed preferential inhibition of susceptible DHFRs by the (R)-enantiomers. BAL0030543, BAL0030544, and BAL0030545 were well tolerated by mice during 5- and 10-day oral toxicity studies at doses of up to 400 mg/kg of body weight. Using a nonoptimized formulation, the dihydrophthalazines displayed acceptable oral bioavailabilities in mice, and efficacy studies with a septicemia model of mice infected with trimethoprim-resistant, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus gave 50% effective dose values in the range of 1.6 to 6.25 mg/kg.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a family of toxin-antitoxin systems related to the Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pAD1 par addiction module.
AB  - The par locus of the Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pAD1 is an RNA-regulated addiction module encoding the peptide toxin Fst. Homology searches revealed that Fst belongs to a family of at least nine related peptides encoded on the chromosomes and plasmids of six different Gram-positive bacterial species. Comparison of an alignment of these peptides with the results of a saturation mutagenesis analysis indicated regions of the peptides important for biological function. Examination of the genetic context of the fst genes revealed that all of these peptides are encoded within par-like loci with conserved features similar to pAD1 par. All four Ent. faecalis family members were demonstrated to produce the expected toxin-encoding and regulatory RNA products. The locus from the Ent. faecalis plasmid pAMS1 was demonstrated to function as an addiction module and Fst was shown to be toxic to Staphylococcus aureus, suggesting that a plasmid-encoded module in that species is performing the same function. Thus, the pAD1-encoded par locus appears to be the prototype of a family of related loci found in several Gram-positive species.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of in vitro anti-microbial and anti-tubercular activity  of 2-styryl benzimidazoles.
AB  - A new series of novel 5-(nitro/bromo)-styryl-2-benzimidazoles (1-12) has been synthesized by simple, mild and efficient synthetic protocol by attempted condensation of 5-(nitro/bromo)-o-phenylenediamine with trans-cinnamic acids in ethylene glycol. Screening for in vitro anti-tubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37) Rv, anti-bacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae bacterial strains and anti-fungal activity against Candida albicans and Asperigillus fumigatus fungal strains were carried out. Compounds 5, 7, 8, 9, 11 showed higher anti-tubercular activity and compounds 7, 8, 10, 11, 12 have proved to be effective with MIC (microg/ml) and emerged as lead molecules showing excellent activities against a panel of microorganisms. All synthesized compounds were characterized using IR, (1)H, (13)C NMR, GC-MS and elemental analysis.
TI  - Colonization of the tip of a thoracic catheter by Enterococcus faecalis resistant to vancomycin and linezolid.
AB  - We report the isolation of Enterococcus faecalis resistant to vancomycin and linezolid from the tip of a thoracic drainage catheter in an elderly patient. He was treated with vancomycin for a pleural empyema due to a meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus but never received linezolid. A surveillance rectal swab yielded both linezolid-susceptible and -resistant strains, and the two isolates were not genotypically related. Careful monitoring for linezolid-resistance is critical to avoid potential therapy failure and transmission of resistant E. faecalis.
TI  - Ceftobiprole: a new broad spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - Ceftobiprole, formerly designated BAL9141/Ro 63-9141, is a pyrrolidinone-3-ylidene-methyl cephalosporin with demonstrated in vitro activity against MRSA, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ceftobiprole has a low potential for inducing chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamases but it is hydrolyzed by most extended spectrum beta-lactamases and metallo-beta-lactamases. Glomerular filtration is predominantly responsible for removal of the free drug from the systemic circulation. The efficacy of ceftobiprole in the treatment of complicated skin and ski-structure infections has been recently demonstrated in two Phase III randomized clinical trials involving 1600 patients. Two other Phase III clinical trials to assess ceftobiprole's efficacy in community-acquired pneumonia and nosocomial pneumonia have also concluded. While the drug met the noninferiority criteria for community-acquired pneumonia and nosocomial pneumonia involving non-ventilator associated pneumonia, ceftobiprole was less effective than the comparator in ventilator associated pneumonia subjects. Ceftobiprole was well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with the cephalosporin class of antibiotic. The most frequent drug-related adverse event was dysgeusia. Ceftobiprole is intended for use in the hospital for the treatment of infections that frequently involve beta-lactam-resistant Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Assessment of the in vitro efficacy of the novel antimicrobial peptide CECT7121 against human Gram-positive bacteria from serious infections refractory to treatment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistant Gram-positive bacteria are causing increasing concern in clinical practice. This work investigated the efficacy of AP-CECT7121 (an antimicrobial peptide isolated from an environmental strain of Enterococcus faecalis CECT7121) against various pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria. METHODS: Strains were isolated from intensive care unit patients unresponsive to standard antibiotic treatments. Inhibitory activity of AP-CECT7121 was assessed using the agar-well diffusion method. The most resistant isolates from each species screened (Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis,Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile) were further examined in time-killing curve studies. RESULTS: These bactericidal kinetic experiments demonstrated a rapid killing effect with no viable bacteria being detected within 30 and 90 min for enterococcal and streptococcal strains and 180 min for community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus and C. perfringens: viable counts for C. difficile were threefold decreased after 90 min. CONCLUSIONS: AP-CECT7121 may provide a novel strategy for treating potentially fatal clinical infections in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Effect of three methods for cleaning dentures on biofilms formed in vitro on acrylic resin.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of three denture hygiene methods against different microbial biofilms formed on acrylic resin specimens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The set (sterile stainless steel basket and specimens) was contaminated (37 degrees C for 48 hours) by a microbial inoculum with 10(6) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml (standard strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis; field strains: S. mutans, C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. tropicalis). After inoculation, specimens were cleansed by the following methods: (1) chemical: immersion in an alkaline peroxide solution (Bonyplus tablets) for 5 minutes; (2) mechanical: brushing with a dentifrice for removable prostheses (Dentu Creme) for 20 seconds; and (3) a combination of chemical and mechanical methods. Specimens were applied onto a Petri plate with appropriate culture medium for 10 minutes. Afterward, the specimens were removed and the plates incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. RESULTS: Chemical, mechanical, and combination methods showed no significant difference in the reduction of CFU for S. aureus, S. mutans (ATCC and field strain), and P. aeruginosa. Mechanical and combination methods were similar and more effective than the chemical method for E. faecalis, C. albicans (ATCC and field strain), and C. glabrata. The combination method was better than the chemical method for E. coli and C. tropicalis, and the mechanical method showed intermediate results. CONCLUSION: The three denture hygiene methods showed different effects depending on the type of microbial biofilms formed on acrylic base resin specimens.
TI  - Novel furanylarylene arylsulfonylindolesulfonamides: synthesis and their antibacterial evaluation.
AB  - An array of furanylarylene arylsulfonylindolesulfonamides was synthesized through multi-step synthetic protocols involving bromination, stannylation, Stille cross coupling, reduction, arylsulfonylation, chlorosulfonylation, and condensation reactions. As a preliminary evaluation, these analogs were tested for antibacterial activity against a series of bacterial strains such as Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae using a two-fold serial dilution assay. Whereas analogs possessing unsubstitution, bromosubstitution, or methyl substitution on the benzene ring of benzenesulfonyl group were less active/inactive, the methoxy and chloro substituted counterparts were demonstrated to be comparatively more active. A few of them were found to exhibit better activity than the standard, streptomycin against selective organisms.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activity of Flindersine isolated from the traditional medicinal plant, Toddalia asiatica (L.) Lam.
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: The leaves and root of Toddalia asiatica (L.) Lam. (Rutaceae) are widely used as a folk medicine in India. Hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, methanol and water extracts of Toddalia asiatica leaves and isolated compound Flindersine were tested against bacteria and fungi. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antibacterial and antifungal activities were tested against bacteria and fungi using disc-diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). The compound was confirmed using X-ray crystallography technique. RESULTS: Antibacterial and antifungal activities were observed in ethyl acetate extract. One active principle Flindersine (2,6-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-5H-pyrano [3,2-c] quinoline-5-one-9cl) was isolated from the ethyl acetate extract. The MIC values of the compound against bacteria Bacillus subtilis (31.25 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (62.5 microg/ml), Staphylococcus epidermidis (62.5 microg/ml), Enterococcus faecalis (31.25 microg/ml), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (250 microg/ml), Acinetobacter baumannii (125 microg/ml) and fungi Trichophyton rubrum 57 (62.5 microg/ml), Trichophyton mentagrophytes (62.5 microg/ml), Trichophyton simii (62.5 microg/ml), Epidermophyton floccosum (62.5 microg/ml), Magnaporthe grisea (250 microg/ml) and Candida albicans (250 microg/ml) were determined. CONCLUSIONS: Ethyl acetate extract showed promising antibacterial and antifungal activity and isolated compound Flindersine showed moderate activity against bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of six pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) varieties and their relation to some of their pomological and phytonutrient characteristics.
AB  - Arils from six pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) varieties grown in the Mediterranean region of Turkey were tested for their antimicrobial properties by the agar diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods against seven bacteria: (Bacillus megaterium DSM 32, Pseudomonas aeruginosa DSM 9027, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1, Corynebacterium xerosis UC 9165, Escherichia coli DM, Enterococcus faecalis A10, Micrococcus luteus LA 2971), and threefungi (Kluvyeromyces marxianus A230, Rhodotorula rubra MC12, Candida albicans ATCC 1023). It has been observed that the pomegranate aril extracts had antimicrobial effect on all microorganisms, giving inhibition zones ranging in size from 13 to 26 mm. The MIC values for active pomegranate extracts ranged between 30 and >90 microg/mL. The results obtained appeared to confirm the antimicrobial potential of the Punica granatum varieties.
TI  - MurF inhibitors with antibacterial activity: effect on muropeptide levels.
AB  - MurF catalyzes the last cytoplasmic step of bacterial cell wall synthesis and is  essential for bacterial survival. Our previous studies used a pharmacophore model of a MurF inhibitor to identify additional inhibitors with improved properties. We now present the characterization of two such inhibitors, the diarylquinolines DQ1 and DQ2. DQ1 inhibited Escherichia coli MurF (50% inhibitory concentration, 24 microM) and had modest activity (MICs, 8 to 16 microg/ml) against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-defective E. coli and wild-type E. coli rendered permeable with polymyxin B nonapeptide. DQ2 additionally displayed activity against gram-positive bacteria (MICs, 8 to 16 microg/ml), including methicillin (meticillin)-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium isolates. Treatment of LPS-defective E. coli cells with >or=2x MIC of DQ1 resulted in a 75-fold-greater accumulation of the MurF substrate compared to the control, a 70% decline in the amount of the MurF product, and eventual cell lysis, consistent with the inhibition of MurF within bacteria. DQ2 treatment of S. aureus resulted in similar effects on the MurF substrate and product quantities. At lower levels of DQ1 (<or=1x MIC), the level of accumulation of the substrate was less pronounced (15-fold greater compared to the amount for the control). However, a 50% increase in the amount of the MurF product compared to the control was reproducibly observed, consistent with the possible upregulation of muropeptide biosynthesis upon partial inhibition of this pathway. The overexpression of cloned MurF appeared to partly alleviate the DQ1-mediated inhibition of muropeptide synthesis. The identification of MurF inhibitors such as DQ1 and DQ2 that disrupt cell wall biosynthesis suggests that MurF remains a viable target for an antibacterial agent.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of selected plant species from "the Argentine Puna" against sensitive and multi-resistant bacteria.
AB  - AIM: The plant species reported here are traditionally used in the "Puna" or "Altiplano" of Argentina for ailments related to bacterial infections. The aim of this study was to evaluate their antimicrobial properties against a panel of sensitive and multi-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of tinctures and aqueous extracts (Baccharis boliviensis, Chiliotrichiopsis keidelii, Chuquiraga atacamensis, Fabiana bryoides, Fabiana densa, Fabiana punensis, Frankenia triandra, Parastrephia lucida, Parastrephia lepidophylla, Parastrephia phyliciformis, Tetraglochin cristatum) was determined using the agar macrodilution and broth microdilution methods recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, formerly NCCLS). The antibiotic resistant clinical strains were isolated from nosocomial infection in human lesions of skin and soft parts. RESULTS: The ethanolic extracts of 11 plant species inhibited the growth of one or more of the following strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ethanol extracts (tinctures) of aerial parts of Baccharis, Fabiana and Parastrephia showed the highest levels of antibacterial activity on methicillin, oxacillin and gentamicin resistant Staphylococcus with MIC values from 20 to 150 microg/ml. Baccharis boliviensis and Fabiana bryoides were more active than the other plant species on Enterococcus faecalis with different phenotype. The most interesting activity on multi-resistant gram-negative strains was obtained from Chuquiraga atacamensis. Parastrephia species showed activity against Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. The ethanolic extracts exhibited stronger activity and broader spectrum of action than aqueous extracts. The extracts were bactericidal in most cases. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of antibacterial activity in Puna plant extracts against multi-resistant bacteria give support to their traditional use for treating conditions associated with microorganisms in humans and animals and consequently seems promising for the treatment of multi-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Bacteremia caused by an Enterococcus faecalis isolate with high-level linezolid resistance in a teenager with Crohn's disease.
AB  - Linezolid is an antibiotic used to treat highly resistant infections, including vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia occurs in pediatric patients. We present a teenager admitted for bacteremia caused by E faecalis with a distinctive pattern of resistance to linezolid. This organism has the highest MIC to linezolid reported in the literature to date.
TI  - In vitro activities of telavancin and vancomycin against biofilm-producing Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis strains.
AB  - We investigated the activities of telavancin and vancomycin against biofilm-producing Staphylococcus and Enterococcus strains. At clinically attainable concentrations, telavancin was active against bacteria embedded in biofilm (minimal biofilm eradication concentration [MBEC], 0.125 to 2 microg/ml) and inhibited biofilm formation at concentrations below the MIC. Vancomycin did not demonstrate the same activity (MBEC, > or =512 microg/ml) against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Telavancin may have a unique role in biofilm-associated infections.
TI  - The effect of adding antimicrobial peptides to milk inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus and processed by high-intensity pulsed-electric field.
AB  - The use of high-intensity pulsed-electric field (HIPEF) and antimicrobial substances of natural origin, such as enterocin AS-48 (AS-48), nisin, and lysozyme, are among the most important nonthermal preservation methods. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the combined effect on milk inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus of the addition of AS-48 with nisin or lysozyme, or both, together with the use of HIPEF. Synergy was observed in the reduction of Staph. aureus counts with the following combination methods: i) addition of AS-48 and nisin, ii) addition of AS-48 plus use of HIPEF, and iii) addition of AS-48 and nisin plus use of HIPEF. Specifically, when 28 arbitrary units/mL of AS-48 and 20 IU/mL of nisin were added to the milk, and it was treated with HIPEF for 800 mus, over 6 log reductions were observed in the microorganism. In general, Staph. aureus inactivation was dependent on HIPEF treatment time, antimicrobial doses, and medium pH. During storage of the treated milk, survivor population was related to peptide concentration and temperature. Final cell viability was influenced by the sequence in which the treatments were applied: the addition of AS-48 or AS-48 and nisin was more effective before than after HIPEF treatment. The results obtained indicate that the combination of HIPEF and antimicrobials could be of great interest to the dairy industry, although it is necessary to study further the way in which the combined treatments act.
TI  - Ceftaroline: a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Ceftaroline is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSI), including those caused by meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Ceftaroline has the ability to bind to penicillin-binding protein (PBP)2a, an MRSA-specific PBP that has low affinity for most other beta-lactam antibacterials. The high binding affinity of ceftaroline to PBP2a (median inhibitory concentration 0.90 microg/mL) correlates well with its low minimum inhibitory concentration for MRSA. Ceftaroline is active in vitro against Gram-positive cocci, including MRSA, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (not E. faecium). The broad-spectrum activity of ceftaroline includes many Gram-negative pathogens but does not extend to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing or AmpC-derepressed Enterobacteriaceae or most nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli. Ceftaroline demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis and non-fragilis Bacteroides spp. Limited data show that ceftaroline has a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. Ceftaroline fosamil (prodrug) is rapidly converted by plasma phosphatases to active ceftaroline. For multiple intravenous doses of 600 mg given over 1 h every 12 hours for 14 days, the maximum plasma concentration was 19.0 microg/mL and 21.0 microg/mL for first and last dose, respectively. Ceftaroline has a volume of distribution of 0.37 L/kg (28.3 L), low protein binding (<20%) and a serum half-life of 2.6 hours. No drug accumulation occurs with multiple doses and elimination occurs primarily through renal excretion (49.6%). Based on Monte Carlo simulations, dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min); no adjustment is needed for mild renal impairment. Currently, limited clinical trial data are available for ceftaroline. A phase II study randomized 100 patients with cSSSI to intravenous ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours or intravenous vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours with or without intravenous aztreonam 1 g every 8 hours (standard therapy) for 7-14 days. Clinical cure rates were 96.7% for ceftaroline compared with 88.9% for standard therapy. Adverse events were similar between groups and generally mild in nature. In a phase III trial, 702 patients with cSSSI were randomized to ceftaroline 600 mg or vancomycin 1 g plus aztreonam 1 g, each administered intravenously every 12 hours for 5-14 days. Ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam in treating cSSSI caused by both Gram-positive and -negative pathogens. Adverse event rates were similar between groups. Ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. In summary, ceftaroline is a promising treatment for cSSSI and CAP, and has potential to be used as monotherapy for polymicrobial infections because of its broad-spectrum activity. Further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline, and to define its role in patient care.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of nine root canal sealers: direct contact test.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this in-vitro study was to analyze the antimicrobial activity of root canal sealers by using the direct contact test. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine root canal sealers (4 resin-based sealers, 3 zinc oxide-eugenol based (ZOE) sealers, and 2 calcium hydroxide based sealers) and three microbial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Enterococcus faecalis) were used in the present study. The antimicrobial activity of root canal sealers was tested by using the direct contact test at three time intervals. Statistical analysis was conducted using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Tests of differences were analyzed by T tests and a value of p < or = 0.05 was statistically significant. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus: All sealers showed significant differences when freshly mixed except Endorez and sealapex. Candida albicans (90028): Only the 48 hours and the one week preparations of Sealapex showed significant differences. The 48 hrs preparations of Topseal and AH plus showed significant differences. The ZOE based sealers showed significant differences at all time intevals. Candida albicans (10231): All sealers showed significant differences when freshly mixed except the two calcium hydroxide based sealers that showed no significant differences at all time intervals. Enterococcus faecalis: Topseal, AH plus, AH 26, Sealite regular and Acroseal showed significant differences only when freshly mixed. The 48 hours and the week preparations of all root canal sealers showed no significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that that antimicrobial activity of the tested sealers depends on the time interval between mixing and testing. Most sealers exhibited antibacterial activity when freshly mixed that is lost over time.
TI  - Antibacterial protection by enterocin AS-48 in sport and energy drinks with less  acidic pH values.
AB  - The low pH and acid content found in sports and energy drinks are a matter of concern in dental health. Raising the pH may solve this problem, but at the same time increase the risks of spoilage or presence of pathogenic bacteria. In the present study, commercial energy drinks were adjusted to pH 5.0 and challenged with Listeria monocytogenes (drinks A to F), Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus licheniformis (drink A) during storage at 37 degrees C. L. monocytogenes was able to grow in drink A and survived in drinks D and F for at least 2 days. Addition of enterocin AS-48 (1 microg/ml final concentration) rapidly inactivated L. monocytogenes in all drinks tested. S. aureus and B. cereus also survived quite well in drink A, and were completely inactivated by 12.5 microg/ml enterocin AS-48 after 2 days of storage or by 25 microg/ml bacteriocin after 1 day. B. licheniformis was able to multiply in drink A, but it was completely inactivated by 5 microg/ml enterocin AS-48 after 2 days of storage or by 12.5 microg/ml bacteriocin after 1 day. Results from the present study suggest that enterocin AS-48 could be used as a natural preservative against these target bacteria in less acidic sport and energy drinks.
TI  - Antibacterial profile of fermented seed extracts of Ricinus communis: findings from a preliminary analysis.
AB  - The study was carried out to ascertain the antibacterial properties inherent in fermented seed extracts of Ricinus communis. Dry seeds of R. communis (Castor oil plant) were deshelled, grounded to powder, fermented, and then extracted both with alcohol and water using Soxhlet machine. Different concentrations of the extracts were tested against selected bacteria using diffusion method of susceptibility testing on sensitivity testing agar medium. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, and Staphylococcus aureus were highly susceptible to both the methanol and water extracts of the seed while Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed reduced susceptibility. Enterococcus faecalis on the other hand was resistant to all the preparations tested. The active antimicrobial ingredients in fermented R. communis seeds should be identified while its medicinal value to humans properly investigated.
TI  - Combinatorial expression of bacterial whole mevalonate pathway for the production of beta-carotene in E. coli.
AB  - The increased synthesis of building blocks of IPP (isopentenyl diphosphate) and DMAPP (dimethylallyl diphosphate) through metabolic engineering is a way to enhance the production of carotenoids. Using E. coli as a host, IPP and DMAPP supply can be increased significantly through the introduction of foreign MVA (mevalonate) pathway into it. The MVA pathway is split into two parts with the top and bottom portions supplying mevalonate from acetyl-CoA, and IPP and DMAPP from mevalonate, respectively. The bottom portions of MVA pathway from Streptococcus pneumonia, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were compared with exogenous mevalonate supplementation for beta-carotene production in recombinant Escherichia coli harboring beta-carotene synthesis genes. The E. coli harboring the bottom MVA pathway of S. pneumoniae produced the highest amount of beta-carotene. The top portions of MVA pathway were also compared and the top MVA pathway of E. faecalis was found out to be the most efficient for mevalonate production in E. coli. The whole MVA pathway was constructed by combining the bottom and top portions of MVA pathway of S. pneumoniae and E. faecalis, respectively. The recombinant E. coli harboring the whole MVA pathway and beta-carotene synthesis genes produced high amount of beta-carotene even without exogenous mevalonate supplementation. When comparing various E. coli strains - MG1655, DH5alpha, S17-1, XL1-Blue and BL21 - the DH5alpha was found to be the best beta-carotene producer. Using glycerol as the carbon source for beta-carotene production was found to be superior to glucose, galactose, xylose and maltose. The recombinant E. coli DH5alpha harboring the whole MVA pathway and beta-carotene synthesis genes produced beta-carotene of 465mg/L at glycerol concentration of 2% (w/v).
TI  - Antibacterial activity of berberine-NorA pump inhibitor hybrids with a methylene  ether linking group.
AB  - Conjugation of the NorA substrate berberine and the NorA inhibitor 5-nitro-2-phenyl-1H-indole via a methylene ether linking group gave the 13-substituted berberine-NorA inhibitor hybrid, 3. A series of simpler arylmethyl ether hybrid structures were also synthesized. The hybrid 3 showed excellent antibacterial activity (MIC Staphylococcus aureus, 1.7 microM), which was over 382-fold more active than the parent antibacterial berberine, against this bacterium. This compound was also shown to block the NorA efflux pump in S. aureus.
TI  - Dynamics of bacterial community in solid-state fermented feed revealed by 16S rRNA.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of the present study was to monitor the changes in the composition  of microbiota in solid-state fermented feed and to evaluate their biosafety. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the solid-state fermentation, six probiotic bacteria strains were used as inoculum and soybean meal were used as carbohydrate source. At 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 15 days, samples were collected for further analysis. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis showed that Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bacillus licheniformis were always present throughout the fermentation. Bifidobacterium bifidum, Enterococcus faecalis and Lactobacillus acidophilum were dominant throughout the entire fermentation as monitored by Lactobacillus-specific PCR-DGGE. Probiotics supplementation could reduce the levels of the pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) by species-specific real-time PCR. And Salmonella spp. was not detected throughout the entire fermentation. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics supplemented are always dominant throughout the whole period of solid-state fermentation and effective in preventing the growth of pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Based on the results, the high quality, stable solid-state fermented feed could be produced and applied in the pigs to improve the animal performances.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of Marrubium incanum Desr. (Lamiaceae) essential oil.
AB  - The essential oil from the aerial parts of Marrubium incanum Desr. (Lamiaceae), obtained by hydrodistillation, was analyzed by GC and GC-MS. Forty-six compounds were identified, representing 96.3% of the total oil. The main components of the oil were (E)-caryophyllene (27.0%), germacrene D (26.2%) and bicyclogermacrene (11.5%). The microbial growth inhibitory properties of the isolated essential oil were determined using the agar diffusion and broth microdilution method against seven bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, Micrococcus flavus ATCC 10240, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae NCIMB 9111, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853), and two strains of the yeast Candida albicans (ATCC 10259 and ATCC24433). The essential oil showed activity against all the microorganisms tested, but differences in microbial susceptibility were registered.
TI  - Sonication is superior to scraping for retrieval of bacteria in biofilm on titanium and steel surfaces in vitro.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Low-virulence implant infections are characterized by bacterial colonization of the implant with subsequent biofilm formation. In these cases, soft tissue biopsies often prove to be culture negative. Consequently, detachment of the causative adherent bacteria is crucial for correct microbiological diagnosis. Using an in vitro model, we compared 4 methods of biofilm sampling from metal surfaces. METHODS: Discs of titanium and steel were incubated in the presence of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Propionibacterium acnes in Mueller Hinton broth. Non-adherent bacteria were removed by repeated rinsing of the discs. 10 parallels of each disc were subjected to 1 of 4 methods for bacterial recovery: (A) sonication of the discs, (B) scraping of the discs using surgical blades followed by streaking of the blades onto agar plates, (C) scraping of the discs followed by vortex mixing of the surgical blades, and (D) scraping of the discs followed by sonication of the surgical blades. Quantitative bacterial cultures were performed for each sampling method. RESULTS: With the exception of S. epidermidis on steel, sonication efficiently and reliably dislodged biofilm bacteria. The scraping methods employed did not detach bacteria embedded in biofilm. INTERPRETATION: Scraping of metal surfaces is not an adequate method for sampling of biofilm bacteria in vitro.
TI  - Antibacterial and anticandidal screening of Tunisian Citrullus colocynthis Schrad. from Medenine.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Resistance to current antibacterial drugs and the rise of opportunistic fungal infections are growing global concerns. Traditional medicine is a potential source of new antibacterials and antifungals. Citrullus colocynthis Schrad. (Cucurbitaceae) endemic in Southern Tunisia, is used in folk medicine against dermatological, gynaecological and pulmonary infections. AIM OF STUDY: To assess in vitro antibacterial and anticandidal activity of aqueous and diluted acetone extracts of Citrullus colocynthis Schrad. MIC and MBC/MFC were determined for plant organs at different maturation stages. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Citrullus colocynthis Schrad. was harvested and its identification was verified. Aqueous and diluted acetone extracts (from the plant's roots, stems, leaves and three maturation stages of its fruit and seeds) were screened for activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis)-and various Candida spp. (Candida glabrata, Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis and Candida kreusei). RESULTS: All extracts showed activity against all strains. The highest MICs and MBCs/MFCs were obtained from the fruit aqueous extracts (MIC 0.10mg/ml against Candida albicans and Candida glabrata, 0.20mg/ml against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), lowest activity from the root extracts. CONCLUSIONS: Citrullus colocynthis Schrad. shows antibacterial and anticandidal properties. The folk medicinal use as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent is validated.
TI  - Cytotoxicity, antimicrobial activity and composition of essential oil from Tanacetum balsamita L. subsp. balsamita.
AB  - The aerial parts of Tanacetum balsamita subsp. balsamita were collected at full flowering stage from Tabriz, Iran. The essential oil was isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by combination of capillary GC and GC-MS. Twenty seven components were identified, representing 99.2% of the total oil. Carvone (51.0%), beta-thujone (20.8%), 1,8-cineole (4.4%) and alpha-thujone (3.2%) were the main components. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of T. balsamita subsp. balsamita was studied against eight Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, B. pumulis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger). The results of the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil according to the disc diffusion method and MIC values indicated that the oil exhibited moderate to high antimicrobial activity. The in vitro toxicological study based on the MTT cytotoxicity assay on human fetal skin fibroblast (HFSF) and Monkey kidney (Vero) cell lines showed IC50 values of 2500 and 1250 microg/mL, respectively.
TI  - Time-kill kinetics of oritavancin and comparator agents against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Oritavancin, a lipoglycopeptide, possesses bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria including vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci. To understand the time dependence of oritavancin activity, we have undertaken time-kill experiments against isolates of S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, including recent antibiotic-resistant strains. METHODS: Six strains of S. aureus [methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA), vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA)] and five strains of enterococci [vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (VSE) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE; both VanA and VanB)] were tested in time-kill assays; oritavancin assays included 0.002% polysorbate-80 to ensure quantitative drug recovery. Oritavancin and comparators vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid and daptomycin were tested at static concentrations approximating their free peak (fC(max)) and free trough (fC(min)) in plasma when administered at standard doses for complicated skin and skin structure infections. RESULTS: Oritavancin showed concentration-dependent killing of all strains tested: at its fC(max) predicted from a 200 mg dose in humans, oritavancin exerted bactericidal activity (> or =3 log kill relative to starting inoculum) against MSSA, MRSA and VRSA within 1 h and against VSE between 11 and 24 h. At predicted fC(max) from an 800 mg dose, oritavancin was bactericidal against VISA strains at 24 h and against VRE at 10 h. CONCLUSIONS: Oritavancin displayed concentration-dependent killing of MSSA, MRSA, VRSA, VISA, VSE and VRE. Oritavancin was more rapidly bactericidal against all strains tested than were vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid or daptomycin at physiologically relevant concentrations. These data support the conclusion that oritavancin exerts concentration-dependent bactericidal activity on recent, drug-resistant isolates of S. aureus and enterococci.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of Magainin I immobilized onto mixed thiols Self-Assembled Monolayers.
AB  - An antibacterial peptide, Magainin I, was covalently bound to a mixed 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) and 6-mercaptohexanol (C6OH) (ratio 1:3) Self-Assembled Monolayer (SAM) on gold surfaces. Each step of the surface functionalization was characterized by Polarization Modulation Reflection Absorption InfraRed Spectroscopy (PM-RAIRS) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The antibacterial activity of the anchored Magainin was tested against three Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria ivanovii, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus), and the results revealed that the adsorbed Magainin I reduced by more than 50% the adhesion of bacteria at the surface, together with the killing of the bacteria that nonetheless adhered to the surface. No release of the peptide was observed upon contact with the bacterial suspension; the activity has proven to be persistent overtime, up to six months after the first use.
TI  - At the heart of the matter.

TI  - Evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of MTAD, NaOCl against selected endodontic pathogens.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to compare the antimicrobial effects of MTAD, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and their combination on endodontic micro-organisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Zone of Inhibition (ZI) and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) were the techniques used. In ZI technique blood agar plates were inoculated with organisms, paper discs were soaked with irrigants and maximum zones of bacterial inhibition were recorded. In the MIC technique the irrigants were serially diluted in TSB tubes and 0.1 mL of the tested microbe solutions were added. Results were obtained on the basis of turbidity and growth on agar plates. Statistical analyses were carried out using ANOVA and Tukey tests. RESULTS: In ZI technique, we investigated 120 specimens including 5 microbial species, 3 irrigants and their control groups, each with 6 repetitions. The results demonstrated MTAD greater antimicrobial efficacy compared to NaOCl, and their mixture (M+N) against Staphylococcus (S) aureus, Enteric (E) bacteria and Enterococcus (E) faecalis (P<0.001). NaOCl was more effective in eradicating Candida (C) albicans than the others (P<0.01). MIC method (155 tubes) showed MTAD to be more effective against E. bacteria and S. aureus. MTAD and NaOCl were equally effective against E. faecalis; however, NaOCl was more effective against C. albicans. CONCLUSION: Bacterial species were more susceptible to MTAD than NaOCl, C. albicans, however, was more susceptible to NaOCl. The advantage of NaOCl is that it has broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. The joint solution (M+N) did not prove to be more effective than their individual use.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and essential oil composition of Satureja spicigera from Iran.
AB  - The aerial parts of Satureja spicigera were collected at full flowering stage at  Gazvin, Iran. The essential oil was isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by a combination of capillary GC and GC-MS. Fourteen compounds were identified, of which carvacrol (53.74%) and thymol (36.03%) were the main constituents, representing 99.12% of the total oil. The in vitro antibacterial activity of the essential oil was determined against six ATCC standard bacterial strains (Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) using disc diffusion as well as measurement of minimum inhibitory concentrations. The disc diffusion results and MIC values indicated high inhibitory activity against the test bacteria. The most susceptible organisms were the Gram-positive B. subtilis and S. aureus followed by E. faecalis, usually resistant to most common antibiotics. Among the Gram-negative bacteria, E. coli and K. pneumoniae were highly sensitive to the different oil concentrations in the disc diffusion method. Finally, P. aeruginosa, a highly resistant organism to most antibiotics, showed moderate susceptibility to Satureja spicigera essential oil.
TI  - Rhodomyrtone: a new candidate as natural antibacterial drug from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa.
AB  - Rhodomyrtone [6,8-dihydroxy-2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-7-(3-methyl-1-oxobutyl)-9-(2-methylpropyl)-4,9 -dihydro-1H-xanthene-1,3(2H)-di-one] from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa (Aiton) Hassk. displayed significant antibacterial activities against gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus salivarius. Especially noteworthy was the activity against MRSA with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranging from 0.39 to 0.78 microg/ml. As shown for S. pyogenes, no surviving cells were detected within 5 and 6h after treatment with the compound at 8MBC and 4MBC concentrations, respectively. Rhodomyrtone displays no bacteriolytic activity, as determined by measurement of the optical density at 620 nm. A rhodomyrtone killing test with S. mutans using phase contrast microscopy showed that this compound caused a few morphological changes as the treated cells were slightly changed in color and bigger than the control when they were killed. Taken together, the results support the view that rhodomyrtone has a strong bactericidal activity on gram-positive bacteria, including major pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of doripenem tested against prevalent Gram-positive pathogens: results from a global surveillance study (2003-2007).
AB  - Doripenem is a broad-spectrum parenteral carbapenem recently approved in the United States for treatment of complicated urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections. Although pronounced doripenem antimicrobial activity against various Gram-negative pathogens, including anaerobes, has been confirmed, limited information has been forthcoming on the activity of this agent against leading Gram-positive species. We evaluated the activity of doripenem using reference broth microdilution procedures against a large collection of staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci collected as part of a global (North America, 43.0%; Latin America, 11.7%; Europe, 31.3%; and Asia-Pacific, 14.0%) Doripenem Surveillance Program for the years 2003 to 2007. Doripenem was confirmed to be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (22 389 isolates) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2444 isolates; MIC(90) values, <or=0.06 microg/mL), with no differences noted between geographic regions. Against Enterococcus faecalis (8714 isolates), doripenem displayed modest activity (MIC(50), 4 microg/mL) but was largely inactive against Enterococcus faecium (4233 isolates). Although not currently approved for treatment of respiratory tract infections in the United States, doripenem was highly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae (10 260 isolates; MIC(90), 0.5 microg/mL) and 2-fold more active than either ceftriaxone or cefepime. Doripenem activity was even more noteworthy against beta-hemolytic streptococci (4598 isolates; MIC(90), <or=0.06 microg/mL, similar to that of penicillin) and viridans group streptococci (1887 isolates; MIC(90), 0.25 microg/mL). Doripenem appears broadly active in vitro against Gram-positive pathogens, a potency similar to that of other carbapenems, a distinct advantage that complements other attributes including beta-lactamase and dehydropeptidase stability and activity against emerging multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Leptoglycin: a new Glycine/Leucine-rich antimicrobial peptide isolated from the skin secretion of the South American frog Leptodactylus pentadactylus (Leptodactylidae).
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are components of innate immunity that is the first-line defense against invading pathogens for a wide range of organisms. Here, we describe the isolation, biological characterization and amino acid sequencing of a novel neutral Glycine/Leucine-rich antimicrobial peptide from skin secretion of Leptodactylus pentadactylus named leptoglycin. The amino acid sequence of the peptide purified by RP-HPLC (C(18) column) was deduced by mass spectrometric de novo sequencing and confirmed by Edman degradation: GLLGGLLGPLLGGGGGGGGGLL. Leptoglycin was able to inhibit the growth of Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Citrobacter freundii with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 8 microM, 50 microM, and 75 microM respectively, but it did not show antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis), yeasts (Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis) and dermatophytes fungi (Microsporum canis and Trichophyton rubrum). No hemolytic activity was observed at the 2-200 microM range concentration. The amino acid sequence of leptoglycin with high level of glycine (59.1%) and leucine (36.4%) containing an unusual central proline suggests the existence of a new class of Gly/Leu-rich antimicrobial peptides. Taken together, these results suggest that this natural antimicrobial peptide could be a tool to develop new antibiotics.
TI  - Potency and bactericidal activity of iclaprim against recent clinical gram-positive isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of iclaprim, a novel diaminopyrimidine derivative, was evaluated against 5,937 recent gram-positive clinical isolates collected in the United States and Europe. Iclaprim demonstrated potent activity against Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]), beta-hemolytic Streptococcus spp., and Enterococcus faecalis strains tested. In addition, iclaprim exhibited bactericidal activity against all S. aureus strains tested, including MRSA.
TI  - Prevention of death in bacterium-infected mice by a synthetic antimicrobial peptide, L5, through activation of host immunity.
AB  - In our previous study, we found that the antibacterial peptide KLKLLLLLKLK-NH(2)  (L5) and its d-enantiomer (DL5) activate neutrophils to produce superoxide anions (O(2)(-)) and prevent death due to infection by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, suggesting that these peptides may elicit in vivo antimicrobial activities through host inflammatory responses mediated by neutrophils. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms behind in vivo antimicrobial prophylaxis by the use of L5 for the treatment of bacterial infection introduced via intra-abdominal implantation. We found that the intraperitoneal treatment with L5 before bacterial infection markedly reduced rates of death due to infection. Treatments with L5 were highly effective in preventing death due to intraperitoneal inoculation of not only S. aureus Smith but also Enterococcus faecalis SR1004 and Escherichia coli EC14. The intra-abdominal administration of L5 induced accumulation of neutrophils, increased levels of reactive oxygen species, and augmented antibacterial activity in the abdominal cavity. In addition, administration of L5 upregulated the expression of the Mig/CXCL9 chemokine gene in thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages. Our results suggested that the prevention of death by treatment of infected mice with L5 might occur primarily through the activation of a host immune response.
TI  - The antimicrobial effect of acetic acid--an alternative to common local antiseptics?
AB  - Acetic acid has been commonly used in medicine for more than 6000 years for the disinfection of wounds and especially as an antiseptic agent in the treatment and prophylaxis of the plague. The main goal of this study was to prove the suitability of acetic acid, in low concentration of 3%, as a local antiseptic agent, especially for use in salvage procedures in problematic infections caused by organisms such as Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This study was designed to compare the in vitro antimicrobial effect of acetic acid with those of common local antiseptics such as povidone-iodine 11% (Betaisodona), polyhexanide 0.04% (Lavasept), mafenide 5% and chlohexidine gluconate 1.5% cetrimide 15% (Hibicet). Former studies suggest the bactericidal effect of acetic acid, but these data are very heterogeneous; therefore, a standardised in vitro study was conducted. To cover the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial strains were tested: Escherichia coli, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and beta-haemolytic Streptococcus group A and B. The tests showed excellent bactericidal effect of acetic acid, particularly with problematic Gram-negative bacteria such as P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. The microbiological spectrum of acetic acid is wide, even when tested at a low concentration of 3%. In comparison to our currently used antiseptic solutions, it showed similar - in some bacteria, even better - bactericidal properties. An evaluation of the clinical value of topical application of acetic acid is currently underway. It can be concluded that acetic acid in a concentration of 3% has excellent bactericidal effect and, therefore, seems to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but further clinical studies are necessary.
TI  - Community-acquired bacterial meningitis in elderly patients: experience over 30 years.
AB  - Clinical characteristics, etiologies, evolution, and prognostic factors of community-acquired bacterial meningitis in elderly patients are not well known. To improve this knowledge, all episodes of community-acquired bacterial meningitis were prospectively recorded and cases occurring in patients >or=65 years old were selected. During the period 1977-2006, 675 episodes in adults (aged >or=18 yr) were recorded, with 185 (27%) in patients aged >or=65 years old; 76 were male and 109 were female, with a mean age of 73 +/- 6 years (range, 65-93 yr). Causative microorganisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae 74, Neisseria meningitidis 49, Listeria monocytogenes 17, other streptococcal 9, Escherichia coli 6, Haemophilus influenzae 4, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus 2 each, Capnocytophaga canimorsus and Enterococcus faecalis 1 each, and unknown in 20. On admission 91% had had fever, 32% were in a coma (Glasgow Coma Scale <or=8), 9% presented with seizures, and 8% with shock. Thirty patients (16%) presented with seizures during therapy. Mortality was 58/185 (31%). Compared with patients aged 18-65 years, there were significant differences among older patients (aged >or=65 yr), who showed a higher frequency of diabetes and malignancy as underlying disease; pneumonia, otitis, and pericranial fistula as predisposing factors; and S. pneumoniae and L. monocytogenes as etiology. There were also differences in clinical presentation, complications, sequelae, and mortality. Factors independently related with mortality were age, pneumonia as a predisposing factor, coma on admission, and heart failure and seizures after therapy. Dexamethasone therapy was a protective factor. In conclusion, bacterial meningitis in elderly patients is associated with greater diagnostic difficulties and neurologic severity and more complications, as well as with increased mortality. Antiseizure prophylaxis might be useful in these patients.
TI  - Clinical investigation of isolated bacteria from urinary tracts of hospitalized patients and their susceptibilities to antibiotics.
AB  - Complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) are often difficult to treat, partly  because of the existence of isolated antibiotic-resistant strains. Even though the definition of UTI is determined by the quantity of cultured bacteria, it has been unclear if the quantity of cultured UTI bacteria affects their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. Also, the gram stain is generally performed to assume the causative bacteria and their quantity before culture results can be obtained; therefore, we could start to use effective antibiotics if the relationship between bacterial quantity and resistance to antimicrobial agents were clear. We studied patients diagnosed as having complicated UTIs at the Urological Department in Kobe University Hospital between June 2002 and March 2003 and analyzed the relationships between the quantity of cultured bacteria and their antimicrobial MICs for antibiotics. The most commonly isolated bacteria were Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. There was no significant correlation between the quantity of cultured bacteria and antimicrobial MICs in all the bacteria and antibiotics that we tested, suggesting that resistant phenotype, but not inoculum of the organism, did determine resistance to antibiotics. In conclusion, our investigation suggested the total number of isolated bacteria in urine culture did not determine the MICs and that inoculum of the bacteria might be important for this determination.
TI  - Spectrum of activity and mode of action of REP3123, a new antibiotic to treat Clostridium difficile infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize the antimicrobial profile of REP3123, a novel inhibitor of methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) in development for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection. METHODS: The spectrum of activity of REP3123 was determined by susceptibility testing of C. difficile and non-target organisms. The mode of action was studied by enzyme inhibition assays, macromolecular synthesis assays, target overexpression and selection of spontaneous resistant mutants. RESULTS: REP3123 was active against a collection of 108 clinical isolates of C. difficile and against epidemic, moxifloxacin-resistant BI/NAP1/027 strains (MIC range=0.5-1 mg/L and MIC(90) = 1 mg/L). The spectrum of activity included clinically important aerobic Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium (MIC(90)s < 1 mg/L), but REP3123 was not active against most Gram-negative bacteria. REP3123 targeted C. difficile MetRS with a calculated inhibition constant (K(i)) of 0.020 nM, and selectivity was >1000-fold over human mitochondrial and cytoplasmic MetRS. The specific mode of action within bacterial cells was demonstrated by macromolecular synthesis assays that showed inhibition of protein synthesis by REP3123, and by metS overexpression, which resulted in a 16-fold increase in MIC for REP3123. Spontaneous REP3123-resistant mutants of C. difficile (MICs, 4-128 mg/L) arose with frequencies of 10(-8)-10(-9) and harboured distinct point mutations within the metS gene, resulting in 13 different amino acid substitutions. Most of the MetRS substitutions caused reduced catalytic efficiency and a growth fitness burden. CONCLUSIONS: REP3123 demonstrated a favourable microbiological profile and was found to target C. difficile with high specificity and selectivity.
TI  - Biological activity evaluation of the oils from Laurus nobilis of Tunisia and Algeria extracted by supercritical carbon dioxide.
AB  - Isolation of essential oil from dried and ground leaves of Laurus nobilis L. from Algeria and Tunisia were obtained with two different methods: by means of classical hydrodistillation (HD) and by using carbon dioxide in the supercritical state (SFE). The effect of extraction pressure on the yield and composition of the L. nobilis volatile oil is examined. The best extraction conditions were as follows: pressure, 9.0 MPa; temperature, 323.15 K; 4 h of extraction and carbon dioxide flow, Phi = 1.2 kg h(-1). Waxes were entrapped in the first separator set at 9.0 MPa and 263.15 K. The oil was recovered in the second separator working at 2.0 bar and 288.15 K. GC/MS analysis of the leaves' volatile oil revealed that it mainly consisted of: 1,8-cineole, linalool, alpha-terpinyl acetate, methyl eugenol and sabinene. The comparison with the hydrodistilled oil did not reveal any big difference. The collection of samples at different extraction times during supercritical extraction allowed us to monitor the change of the oil composition. On the matrice exhaust owing to a SFE at 9.0 MPa, one further extraction at 323.15 K and 24.0 MPa was performed to obtain a mixture of compounds with higher molecular weight. Finally, the antibacterial and antifungal activity of the various extracts has been assayed.
TI  - TR-700 in vitro activity against and resistance mutation frequencies among Gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: TR-700, the active component of the oxazolidinone prodrug TR-701, has demonstrated potent activity against numerous Gram-positive species. In this study, single-step mutation frequencies, passaging and the activity of TR-700 were tested against a worldwide collection of linezolid-non-susceptible organisms and matched controls. METHODS: One hundred and twenty linezolid-non-susceptible and 120 controls matched by genus/species, geographic origin, site of infection and time were susceptibility tested by reference broth microdilution methods. Species of isolates were: Enterococcus faecalis (16 linezolid non-susceptible/16 wild-type strains); Enterococcus faecium (55/55), Staphylococcus aureus (8/8); coagulase-negative staphylococci (at least 7 spp., 40/40) and viridans group streptococci (2 spp., 1/1). 23S rRNA target mutations or cfr genes were detected by PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: Among linezolid-non-susceptible strains, the resistance mechanisms were G2576T (109), cfr (4) and unknown (7), with strains originating from Europe, Far East and North and South America. Most strains were multidrug-resistant and cfr isolates exhibited co-resistance to phenicols, clindamycin, linezolid, pleuromutilins and streptogramin B. TR-700 MIC values, regardless of species, were 4-32-fold lower than those of linezolid. TR-700 MIC results were < or = 4, < or = 8 or < or = 16 mg/L for 88%, 96% and > 99% of linezolid-non-susceptible strains, respectively. Spontaneous single-step mutations were undetected (<1.1 x 10(-9)) and 14 day passaging studies produced modest TR-700 MIC elevations compared with linezolid controls. CONCLUSIONS: TR-700 exhibited enhanced activity against linezolid-non-susceptible and wild-type control strains of Gram-positive cocci. A significant number (nearly 90%) of linezolid-non-susceptible strains were inhibited by potentially achievable levels (< or = 4 mg/L) of TR-700. All strains with the emerging cfr-mediated resistance determinant had TR-700 MIC results at < or = 8 mg/L.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of five herbal extracts against multi drug resistant (MDR) strains of bacteria and fungus of clinical origin.
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of the crude ethanolic extracts of five plants were screened against multidrug resistant (MDR) strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans. ATCC strains of Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus bovis, Pseudimonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans were also tested. The strains that showed resistance against the maximum number of antibiotics tested were selected for an antibacterial assay. The MDR strains were sensitive to the antimicrobial activity of Acacia nilotica, Syzygium aromaticum and Cinnamum zeylanicum, whereas they exhibited strong resistance to the extracts of Terminalia arjuna and Eucalyptus globulus. Community-acquired infections showed higher sensitivity than the nosocomial infections against these extracts. The most potent antimicrobial plant was A. nilotica (MIC range 9.75-313 microg/ml), whereas other crude plant extracts studied in this report were found to exhibit higher MIC values than A. nilotica against community acquired as well as nosocomial infection. This study concludes that A. nilotica, C. zeylanicum and S. aromaticum can be used against multidrug resistant microbes causing nosocomial and community acquired infections.
TI  - Regioselective synthetic approaches towards 1,2,8,9-tetraazadispiro[4.1.4.2]trideca-2,9-dien-6-ones of potential antimicrobial properties.
AB  - Reaction of 2,5-bis(arylmethylidene)cyclopentanones 1a-d with nitrilimines (generated in situ via triethylamine dehydrohalogenation of the corresponding hydrazonoyl chlorides 2a,b) in 1:2 molar ratio proceeds in a high regioselective manner affording monocycloadducts 3 and dicycloadducts in the form of two isomers 4, 5. Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies of the isolated crystalline form of 3c support the established structure and indicate that the formed product is 7E, 4S, 5R. Antimicrobial activity screening of the synthesized compounds 3-5, utilizing a variety of gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus fecalis and Streptococcus agalactiae), gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus vulgaris) and yeast (Candida albicans), exhibited that all the prepared analogues acquire promising activities against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria especially compounds 3b, 4a (antimicrobial active agents against gram-positive bacteria) and 3c (antimicrobial active agent against gram-negative bacteria).
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of vancomycin aglycon analogues that bear modifications  in the N-terminal D-leucyl amino acid.
AB  - The synthesis and biological evaluation of a series of vancomycin aglycon analogues bearing alternative residue 1 N-methyl-D-amino acids are described. The analogues were prepared to define whether H-bonding d-amino acids could improve the affinity for the model ligands N,N'-Ac(2)-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala (2) and N,N'-Ac(2)-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Lac (3) and improve antimicrobial activity against vancomycin-sensitive or vancomycin-resistant bacteria. Additionally, a series of analogues with appended nucleophiles (hydrazines and amines) on the residue 1 D-amino acids are described that were examined for their ability to react with the C-terminal ester of 3, forming a covalent attachment of L-Lys-D-Ala to the natural product analogues.
TI  - Potential pathogens and effective disinfectants on public telephones at a large urban United States university.
AB  - Telephones can carry potential bacterial pathogens, posing a risk for transfer of pathogens to users' hands. This study examined 25 mouthpieces of public telephones at a large urban U.S. university located in an area of rising incidence of community-acquired staphylococcal infections. Coagaulase-negative staphylococci were most commonly isolated (64% of mouthpieces). Potential pathogens isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus, and Klebsiella ozaenae. The efficacy of disinfectants on reducing bacterial counts on telephone mouthpieces was also investigated. Staphyloccocus aurens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcusfaecalis were inoculated onto mouthpieces and challenged with disinfectant wipes. Bacterial counts were reduced substantially for all three organisms by wipes containing either 70% isopropyl alcohol, 1.84% sodium hypochlorite, or quaternary ammonium compounds. The sodium hypochlorite-based cleaner demonstrated 100% efficacy at removing or killing test organisms from telephone mouthpieces. These data suggest that tested cleaners may be appropriate and needed for public telephone disinfection.
TI  - Janeway lesions with inconspicuous histological features.
AB  - Septic-embolic diseases are life threatening; survival critically depends on rapid diagnosis. Clinically, cutaneous manifestations like Janeway lesions are infrequently occurring but highly characteristic. In contrast, histological features are not clearly defined. We report the case of a 59-year-old male patient in deteriorating general condition and fever of unknown origin with lesions suggestive for Janeway lesions. Histology showed dilated blood vessels and extravasated erythrocytes throughout the dermis. Only serial sections revealed single, deep dermal vessels occluded by fibrin thrombi. Computed tomography scan identified multiple pulmonary round masses. Blood cultures showed growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. The knowledge of the described subtle histological features and a clinical-pathological correlation is essential for the diagnosis of certain cases of septic-embolic conditions.
TI  - Novel E. coli beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III inhibitors as targeted antibiotics.
AB  - Beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase (KAS) III is a condensing enzyme that initiates fatty acid biosynthesis in most bacteria. We determined three pharmacophore maps from receptor-oriented pharmacophore-based in silico screening of the X-ray structure of Escherichia coli KAS III (ecKAS III) and choose 16 compounds as candidate ecKAS III inhibitors. Binding inhibitors were characterized using saturation-transfer difference NMR spectroscopy (STD-NMR), and binding constants were determined with fluorescence quenching experiments. Based on the results, we propose that the antimicrobial compound, 4-cyclohexyliminomethyl-benzene-1,3-diol (YKAs3003), is a potent inhibitor of pathogenic KAS III, displaying minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values in the range 128-256 microg/mL against various bacteria.
TI  - Structure-activity studies of echinomycin antibiotics against drug-resistant and  biofilm-forming Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Four echinomycin antibiotics were isolated from the culture broth of a marine streptomycete, and their structures were determined by a combination of chemical and spectroscopic analyses. Antibiotic activities were measured against drug-resistant and biofilm-forming strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.01 microM to greater than 14 microM clearly defined structure-activity relationships for antibiotic potency. Echinomycin was the most active compound with a MIC of 0.03 microM against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and 0.01 microM against biofilm-forming E. faecalis.
TI  - Isothiocyanate profile and selective antibacterial activity of root, stem, and leaf extracts derived from Raphanus sativus L.
AB  - Acetone and hexane extracts derived from the root, stem, and leaf of Raphanus sativus were investigated for their antibacterial activity against foodborne and resistant pathogens, such as Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, and Escherichia coli. Total and individual isothiocyanate (ITC) components and their relationship with the antibacterial activity of R. sativus were also evaluated. Both acetone and hexane fractions of root, stem, and leaf exhibited selective antibacterial activity against the organisms tested. Antibacterial activity was strongest in the acetone fraction of root with larger zone of inhibition and lower minimum inhibitory concentration. The results obtained were comparable to that seen with standard antibiotics. Of the different parts of R. sativus studied, root tended to be more active than the stem and leaf extracts in inhibiting the bacterial growth. Gas chromatographic analysis revealed the presence of variable amounts of five different ITCs such as allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), phenyl isothiocyanate (PITC), benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), phenethyl isothiocyanate, and 4-(methylthio)-3-butenyl isothiocyanate (MTBITC) in different parts of the plant. The low linear correlation between the total ITC content and antibacterial activity implied that bacterial growth inhibitory ability of R. sativus was not dependent on the total ITC content. However, the antibacterial activity of R. sativus was well correlated with AITC, PITC, and BITC for all organisms except for Enteroc. faecalis, whose inhibitory effect was more related to MTBITC.
TI  - Endodontic microorganism susceptibility by direct contact test.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro the duration of the antimicrobial  effect of endodontic sealers by means of the Direct Contact Test. The sealers tested were: Endomethasone - Septodont, Endomethasone C-Septodont, Endion-Voco, Diaket-ESPE, Pulp Canal Sealer-SybronEndo, and AH26-Dentsply DeTrey. The endodontopathic microorganisms (MO) confronted were: Staphylococcus aureus (Sa), Candida albicans (Ca), Enterococcus faecalis (Ef), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn). Test specimens of each sealer were prepared and placed on the surface of agar plates that had been inoculated with each MO, and after predetermined periods, transfers were made from the contact area between the test specimen and the cultured agar and from the area that had not been in contact with the test specimens (control). The results were read as presence/absence of microbial growth and analyzed statistically using the Kruskal-Wallis test. It was concluded that the structural features and virulence of endodontopathic microorganisms determine their response to the sealers, independently of the time during which sealers act and the mechanism by which the antiseptic reaches the microorganism, which in this case was by direct contact.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of endodontic sealers based on calcium hydroxide and MTA.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of a new root canal sealer containing calcium hydroxide (Acroseal) and the root canal sealer based on MTA (Endo CPM Sealer), in comparison with traditional sealers (Sealapex, Sealer 26 and Intrafill) and white MTA-Angelus, against five different microorganism strains. The materials and their components were evaluated after manipulation, employing the agar diffusion method. A base layer was made using Muller-Hinton agar (MH) and wells were made by removing agar. The materials were placed into the wells immediately after manipulation. The microorganisms used were: Micrococcus luteus (ATCC9341), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC6538), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27853), Candida albicans (ATCC 10231), and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 10541). The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The results showed that Sealapex and its base paste, Sealer 26 and its powder, Endo CPM Sealer and its powder, white MTA and its powder all presented antimicrobial activity against all strains. Intrafill and its liquid presented antimicrobial activity against all strains except P. aeruginosa and Acroseal was effective only against M. luteus and S. aureus.
TI  - The impact of noncontact, nonthermal, low-frequency ultrasound on bacterial counts in experimental and chronic wounds.
AB  - Preventing wound infection and the development of resistant bacteria are important concerns in wound management. To determine if noncontact, nonthermal, low-frequency ultrasound therapy is effective in controlling wound bacterial colony counts, a series of four related experiments was conducted. First, ultrasound penetration in both wounded and intact skin was assessed in vitro. Compared to sham, noncontact ultrasound penetrated farther into both wounded (3 mm to 3.5 mm versus 0.35 mm to 0.50 mm) and intact (2.0 mm to 2.5 mm versus 0.05 mm to 0.07 mm, respectively) pig skin. Second, using an in vitro model to stain and count live/dead bacteria, 0% of sham treated and 33% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 40% of Escherichia coli and 27% of Enterococcus faecalis were dead after one ultrasound application. Minimal effects on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and S. aureus were observed. Third, using an in vivo model, after 1 week, while differences between different bacterial species were observed, overall bacterial quantity decreased with ultrasound treatment (from 7.2 +/- 0.79 to 6.7 +/- 0.91 colony forming units per gram of tissue [CFU/g]) and silver antimicrobial dressings (from 7.2 +/- 0.79 to 5.7 +/- 0.6 CFU/g) but increased to 8.6 +/- 0.15 CFU/g for sham and 8.6 +/- 0.06 CFU/g for water-moistened gauze. Fourth, 11 patients (average age 60 years) with pressure ulcers containing bacterial counts >10(5) CFU/g of tissue received 2 weeks of noncontact ultrasound therapy. The quantities of seven bacterial organisms were reduced substantially from baseline to 2 weeks post treatment. None of the wounds exhibited signs of a clinical infection during the treatment period and no adverse events were observed. Taken together, these four studies indicate that noncontact ultrasound can be used to reduce bacterial quantity. Controlled clinical studies are warranted to ascertain the efficacy of this treatment and to further elucidate its effects on various Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of tigecycline and comparative agents against clinical isolates of staphylococci and enterococci from ICUs and general hospital wards at three Swedish university hospitals.
AB  - The activities of tigecycline and comparative agents on staphylococci and enterococci isolated from patients at general hospital wards (GHWs) and intensive care units (ICUs) at 3 university hospitals in Sweden were investigated. Oxacillin disc diffusion and minimal inhibitory concentration with E-test were used. The presence of mecA, vanA or vanB genes was determined with PCR. Statistically significant higher incidence of clindamycin, fusidic acid, rifampicin and multidrug-resistant CoNS was found at ICUs compared to GHWs. Resistance rates were low among S. aureus. Tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin were the only agents with high activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and multidrug-resistant CoNS. Resistance rates were low among E. faecalis, except for high-level gentamicin-resistant (HLGR) E. faecalis. E. faecium showed high resistance rates to ampicillin, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem. The HLGR rates among E. faecium were lower than the rates for E. faecalis. Tigecycline and linezolid were the only drugs with high activity against all enterococci including vancomycin-resistant enterococci. No statistically significant differences in susceptibility rates were found between the ward levels for S. aureus and enterococcal isolates and no statistically significant differences were found between the hospitals.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some thiourea derivatives and their nickel and copper complexes.
AB  - Five thiourea derivative ligands and their Ni(2+) and Cu(2+) complexes have been  synthesized. The compounds were screened for their in vitro anti-bacterial activity using Gram-positive bacteria (two different standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Esherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter aerogenes) and in vitro anti-yeast activity (Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis). The minimum inhibitory concentration was determined for all ligands and their complexes. In vitro anti-yeast activity of both ligands and their metal complexes is greater than their in vitro anti-bacterial activity. The effect of the structure of the investigated compounds on the antimicrobial activity is discussed.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of silver-zeolite containing root-canal filling material.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro antibacterial effect of two experimental glass ionomer cements (GICs) on Streptococcus milleri, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis after 24 and 48 h incubation by using the agar diffusion inhibitory test. Silver zeolite (SZ) was added at 0.2 and 2% mass fraction concentration to GIC (Endion). The control group was Endion with no SZ. Each of them were prepared to uniform size using a custom-made Teflon mold, and the GIC materials were prepared to form disks (n = 5 per group). The effect of these materials on the growth of three bacteria associated with endodontic infections was determined using the agar diffusion inhibitory test. The amounts of silver ion release from these materials were measured with atomic absorption spectrophotometry at 10 min, 24- and 48-h periods. The pH of samples was measured with a pH-meter at 10 min, 24- and 48-h periods. After the incubation period, the agar plates were evaluated and the degrees of bacterial inhibition were measured in millimeters. A comparison of the mean of the test materials was statistically different in each group of specimens (p < 0.05). Between the two tested materials 2% SZ containing GIC showed the largest zone of inhibition on the agar plates of all the tested strains (p < 0.05). The most inhibition in bacterial growth occurred in E. faecalis. Adding 2% SZ to GIC resulted in a significant increase in the silver release into deionized water. This study demonstrated that GIC had an inhibitory affect on Streptococcus milleri, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis and that adding SZ increases that affect proportional to its concentration.
TI  - A-94964, a novel inhibitor of bacterial translocase I, produced by Streptomyces sp. SANK 60404. I. Taxonomy, isolation and biological activity.
AB  - Bacterial phospho-N-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide translocase (translocase I: EC 2.7.8.13) is a key enzyme in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and a known target of antibiotics. Here we report a novel nucleoside inhibitor against translocase I, A-94964, isolated from the culture broth of the strain Streptomyces sp. SANK 60404. A-94964 inhibited bacterial translocase I with IC50 value of 1.1 microg/ml, and showed antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis with MIC of 100 and 50 microg/ml, respectively. A-94964 did not show cytotoxicity against mammalian cell lines.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of epidural infusions.
AB  - The incidence of epidural abscess following epidural catheterisation appears to be increasing, being recently reported as one in 1000 among surgical patients. This study was designed to investigate the antibacterial activity of various local anaesthetics and additives, used in epidural infusions, against a range of micro-organisms associated with epidural abscess. The aim was to determine which, if any, epidural infusion solution has the greatest antibacterial activity. Bupivacaine, ropivacaine and levobupivacaine crystals were dissolved and added to Mueller-Hinton Agar in concentrations of 0.06%, 0.125%, 0.2%, 0.25%, 0.5% and 1%. Fentanyl, adrenaline and clonidine were also mixed with agar in isolation and in combination with the local anaesthetics. Using a reference agar dilution method, the minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined for a range of bacteria. Bupivacaine showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli with minimum inhibitory concentrations between 0.125% and 0.25%. It did not inhibit the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at any of the concentrations tested. Levobupivacaine and ropivacaine showed no activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, even at the highest concentrations tested, and minimal activity against Escherichia coli (minimum inhibitory concentrations 0.5% and 1% respectively). The presence of fentanyl, adrenaline and clonidine had no additional effect on the antibacterial activity of any of the local anaesthetic agents. The low concentrations of local anaesthetic usually used in epidural infusions have minimal antibacterial activity. While the clinical implications of this in vitro study are not known, consideration should be given to increasing the concentration of bupivacaine in an epidural infusion or to administering a daily bolus of 0.25% bupivacaine to reduce the risk of epidural bacterial growth.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts. STUDY OBJECT AND METHODS: Antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts was determined with reference cultures of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 33499, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 12459, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Bacillus cereus ATCC 8035, and fungus Candida albicans ATCC 60193. Microbiological tests were performed under aseptic conditions. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)--the highest dilution of preparation (the lowest concentration of preparation) that suppresses growth of reference microorganisms--was determined. RESULTS: Concentration of phenolic compounds in soft propolis extract that possesses antimicrobial activity against gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis) is 0.587+/-0.054 mg and 0.587+/-0.054-0.394+/-0.022 mg (P>0.05) and in purified propolis extract--0.427+/-0.044 mg and 0.256+/-0.02 mg (P>0.05). Klebsiella pneumoniae is most resistant to soft propolis extract when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 1.119+/- 0.152 mg and to purified propolis extract when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 1.013+/-0.189 mg (P>0.05). Spore-forming Bacillus subtilis bacteria are more sensitive to soft and purified propolis extracts when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 0.134+/-0.002 mg and 0.075+/-0.025 mg, respectively, and Bacillus cereus--when the concentration is 0.394+/-0.022 mg and 0.256+/-0.02 mg (P>0.05). Sensitivity of fungus Candida albicans to soft and purified propolis extracts is the same as Bacillus subtilis. Encapsulated bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae is most resistant to antimicrobial action of soft and purified propolis extracts as compared with gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis bacteria (P<0.05), gram-negative Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis (P<0.05), spore-forming Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus bacteria (P<0.05), and fungus Candida albicans (P<0.05). There is no statistically significant difference between antimicrobial effect of soft propolis extract and purified propolis extract on gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, spore-forming bacteria, encapsulated bacteria, and Candida fungus. CONCLUSIONS: Soft and purified propolis extracts possess antimicrobial activity. They could be recommended as natural preservatives in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.
TI  - In vitro efficacy of the novel peptide CECT7121 against bacteria isolated from mastitic dairy cattle.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the in vitro bactericidal activity of the novel antimicrobial peptide (AP) CECT7121 against Gram-positive bacteria from mastitic dairy cattle. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 15 Staphylococcus aureus, 10 Streptococcus dysgalactiae, 7 Strep. uberis, 1 Strep. agalactiae strains were isolated from 33 different mastitic dairy cattle, sourced from two dairies in Tandil-Argentina. Isolates from each of the bacterial species screened which developed the lowest inhibition zones in response to the peptide, were further evaluated in a series of time-killing curve studies. No survivors were detected in whole strains (from the three Streptococcal species isolated) within 120 min of incubation in presence of the peptide. The Staph. aureus isolates were less sensitive but, nevertheless, a drop in viable counts to below the detection limit was achieved for all the test strains by the final postincubation sampling point at 180 min. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated the in vitro efficacy of the AP-CECT7121 against a variety strains of Gram positives isolated from mastitic dairy cattle. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: There is urgent global interest in the development of natural alternatives for the control and prevention of mastitis. Confirmation of the in vitro activity of the novel AP-CECT7121 against Gram-positive isolates encourages further research.
TI  - In vitro multispecies Lubbock chronic wound biofilm model.
AB  - Multispecies biofilms are becoming increasingly recognized as the naturally occurring state in which bacteria reside. One of the primary health issues that is now recognized to be exacerbated by biofilms are chronic, nonhealing wounds such as venous leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, and pressure ulcers. Arguably three of the most important species associated with multispecies biofilms that our group sees clinically are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. This study was conducted to address the need for a chronic pathogenic biofilm laboratory model that allows for cooperative growth of these three organisms. We have developed a novel media formulation, simple laboratory system, quantitative polymerase chain reaction for monitoring population dynamics, and methods for objectively and subjectively measuring biofilm formation. The Lubbock chronic wound pathogenic biofilm withstood treatment with a 50-fold higher concentration of bleach than that which was completely bacteriocidal for fully turbid planktonic cultures. The Lubbock chronic wound pathogenic biofilm when treated with biofilm effectors such as gallium nitrate and triclosan responded with selective inhibition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus, respectively, as has been reported in the literature. The ability of this 24-hour model to react as predicted using known biofilm effectors suggests that it will lend itself to future work in the development and testing of first-generation chronic wounds pathogenic biofilm therapeutics. We have defined a realistic in vitro multispecies biofilm model simulating the functional characteristics of chronic pathogenic biofilms and developed effective tools for its characterization and analyses.
TI  - Monitoring major mastitis pathogens at the population level based on examination  of bulk tank milk samples.
AB  - The objective was to determine the proportions and bacterial counts of major mastitis pathogens in samples of bulk tank milk (BTM), as well as to clarify the relationship between these bacteria counts and bulk tank somatic cell count (BTSCC). The purpose was to judge the importance of the counts of mammary pathogens for BTSCC at the population level. Samples of BTM were collected from 268 randomly selected anonymous dairy herds (with approximately 29 000 dairy cows). Staphylococcus aureus, other coagulase-positive staphylococci, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus dysgalactiae were grouped as contagious pathogens, and Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium as environmental pathogens. Based on assessment of the dominant pathogen in each herd, environmental pathogens were found to dominate. Counts of specific mammary pathogens in BTM samples did not exceed a geometric mean of 1000 cfu/ml. Significant differences were documented in BTSCC between BTM samples containing Str. agalactiae, Staph. aureus, and Str. dysgalactiae and BTM samples that were pathogen-free. Geometric means of BTSCC associated with these pathogens were noticeably higher than the overall BTSCC (Str. agalactiae 243 628; Staph. aureus 205 610; Str. dysgalactiae 203 978; overall 173 000 cells/ml). It follows that the somatic cell count (SCC) associated with these pathogens contributed substantially to the overall BTSCC. Environmental pathogens predominated in samples of BTM with SCC <300x103/ml and contagious mastitis pathogens predominated in BTM samples with SCC >300x103/ml. No correlation was detected between bacterial counts of specific pathogens and BTSCC. This study revealed that the assessment of bacterial counts of mammary pathogens in samples of BTM in relation to BTSCC is applicable for the monitoring of changes in the occurrence of major mastitis pathogens in dairy herds at a national level.
TI  - Removal of radioisotopes in solution and bactericidal/bacteriostatic sterilising  power in activated carbon and metal silver filters.
AB  - Activated carbon filters play an important role in water filtration and purification from contaminants of different origin. Their limit consists in bacterial proliferation, which may occur only during prolonged periods of non-use and in their ability to remove radioactive contaminants present in waste water from Industry or Nuclear Medicine departments. In this work we tested a commercially available activated carbon filter for water purification enriched with silver plated parts incubating in static condition at room temperature different micro organisms (Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillum niger), up to 78 days. The microbial growth was in general more inhibited in the presence of metal silver into the activated carbon in respect to filters with the activated carbon alone: >4log inhibition of bacterial proliferation after 78 days of incubation the presence of silver vs. 2log without silver. When the filters were incubated empty of carbon, the sterilizing power of silver was confirmed further. The activated carbon filters proved also their ability in removing from water the principal radioisotopes used for residues liquid medical and research purposes ((131)I, (99m)Tc, (201)Tl, (67)Ga). These results contribute useful data for the use of the silver-enriched carbon filters in water filtration both for daily use at home, and professional use in a Nuclear Medicine laboratory.
TI  - Evaluation of the antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiproliferative activities of the acetone extract of the roots of Senna italica (Fabaceae).
AB  - Senna italica, a member of the Fabaceae family (subfamily Caesalpinaceae), is widely used traditionally to treat a number of disease conditions, such as sexually transmitted diseases and some forms of intestinal complications. The roots of Senna italica were collected from Zebediela subregion, Limpopo province (S.A), powdered and extracted with acetone by cold/shaking extraction method. The phytochemical composition of the extract was determined by thin layer chromatography (TLC). The chromatograms were visualised with vanillin-sulphuric acid and p-anisaldehyde reagents. The total phenolic content of the extract was determined by Folin-Ciocalteu method and expressed as TAE/g dry weight. The extract was assayed for the in vitro anticancer activity using Jurkat T cells, antioxidant activity using DPPH assay and antibacterial activity by bioautographic method and the microtitre plate method. The acetone extract of the roots of Senna italica inhibited the growth of Jurkat T cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The extract also had free radical scavenging activity as well as reasonable antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus with MICs ranging from 0,08 to 0.16 mg/ml in the same order as ampicillin the positive control. The biological activities observed in the acetone extract validated the ethnomedicinal use of Senna italica.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of extracts of three Croton species collected in Mpumalanga region in South Africa.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of three Croton species were compared using bioautography and the serial microdilution methods. The methanolic extracts of all the species had low activity against Escherichia coli. The highest activity was observed with Croton megalobotrys against Enterococcus faecalis with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 0.02 mg/ml. Croton steenkapianus extracts were the least active of the species investigated, only managing an MIC value of 0.625 mg/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Croton megalobotrys leaf powder was serially extracted using solvents of various polarities. The lowest MIC value (0.06 mg/ml) of the serially extracted fractions was observed with acetone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The liquid-liquid fractions of the methanol extract of Croton megalobotrys were also tested. The lowest MIC value of 0.02 mg/ml was observed with n-hexane fraction against Enterococcus faecalis. The carbon tetrachloride fraction was further fractionated using column chromatography with silica as the immobile phase. The resulting seven fractions were tested for activity following the bioassay-guided practice, and it emerged that the first three fractions had active compounds against Staphylococcus aureus when the bioautography method was used.
TI  - Detection of antimicrobial compounds by bioautography of different extracts of leaves of selected South African tree species.
AB  - The hexane, acetone, dichloromethane and methanol extracts of Combretum vendae A.E. van Wyk (Combretaceae), Commiphora harveyi (Engl.) Engl. (Burseraceae), Khaya anthotheca (Welm.) C.DC (Meliaceae), Kirkia wilmsii Engl. (Kirkiaceae), Loxostylis alata A. Spreng. ex Rchb. (Anacardiaceae), Ochna natalitia (Meisn.) Walp. (Ochnaceae) and Protorhus longifolia (Bernh. Ex C. Krauss) Engl. (Anacardiaceae) were screened for their antimicrobial activity. The test organisms included bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus), and fungi (Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Microsporum canis and Sporothrix schenckii). A simple bioautographic procedure, involving spraying suspensions of the bacteria or fungi on thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates developed in solvents of varying polarities was used to detect the number of antibacterial and antifungal compounds present in the extracts. All the extracts had antimicrobial activity against at least one of the test microorganisms. This activity was denoted by white spots against a red-purple background on the TLC plates after spraying with tetrazolium violet. Twenty seven TLC plates; 9 for each solvent system and 3 different solvent systems per organism were tested in the bioautographic procedure. Of the bacteria tested, S. aureus was inhibited by the most compounds separated on the TLC plates from all the tested plants. Similarly, growth of the fungus C. neoformans was also inhibited by many compounds present in the extracts. Loxostylis alata appeared to be the plant extract with the highest number of inhibition bands when compared with other plants tested against both bacteria and fungi. This species was selected for in depth further study.
TI  - Update on antimicrobial susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms in the United States: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) 2005 to 2007.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TTEST) is a global surveillance study initiated in 2004.Its goal is to assess the in vitro activity of the glycylcycline, tigecycline, and comparator antimicrobials. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the in vitro activity of a panel of antimicrobial agents against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms collected in the United States in 2005, 2006, and 2007. METHODS: Isolates were collected from 172 centers across the United States.In vitro activity was assessed using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines and CLSI or US Food and Drug Administration interpretive criteria. RESULTS: Overall, data on 20,897 gram-negative and 8949 gram-positive isolates were collected. For the majority of organisms, percentage susceptibilities were unchanged over the 3 years of collection. One exception was Acinetobacter baumannii; rates of susceptibility to the majority of agents in the panel decreased by approximately 10% over the 3 years. Rates of resistant phenotypes were relatively unchanged with mean percentages over the 3 years of: 8.9% (337/3787) for extended beta-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae; 2.1% (17/801) for ESBL-producing Klebsiella oxytoca; 2.3% (111/4861) for ESBL-pproducing Escherichia coli; 56.2% (2564/4560) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; 5.1% (97/1903) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis; and 67.2% (487/725) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (MIC(90)) for tigecycline was stable over the 3 years and was < or = 22 mg/L against non-ESBL-producing K pneumoniae, K oxytoca, E coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and A baumannii. Against methicillin susceptible and -resistant S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or = 0.25 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: This report of 3 years of data from the TEST study suggests stable susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, with the exception of decreased susceptibility rates for A baumannii. Tigecycline continued to have good activity against Enterobacteriaceae, A baumannii, S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and S agalactiae.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of five different root canal sealing materials.
AB  - The aim of this in vitro study was to assess the antibacterial effects of gray and white mineral trioxide aggregate (GMTA and WMTA), calcium hydroxide (CH), Portland cement (PC) and a new endodontic cement (NEC) on various species of microorganisms, using agar diffusion test. A base layer of Petri plates was made using Muller-Hinton agar. Five cavities were made in agar and filled with fresh mixed materials after 24 h. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and a mixture of these bacteria were seeded by pour plate. The plates were preincubated for 2 h at room temperature followed by incubation at 37 degrees C. The inhibition zone diameters were measured at 24, 48 and 72 h. The highest mean diameters of growth inhibition zones were observed around NEC and CH. According to one-way ANOVA, there was a significant difference among test groups (P < 0.001), while post-hoc test revealed no significant difference between the mean zone diameters of NEC and CH, and also between MTAs and PC. However, there was a significant difference between CH and NEC in comparison with MTAs and PC groups (P < 0.001). It appears that NEC may act as a potent antibacterial agent similar to CH.
TI  - The RepA_N replicons of Gram-positive bacteria: a family of broadly distributed but narrow host range plasmids.
AB  - The pheromone-responsive conjugative plasmids of Enterococcus faecalis and the multiresistance plasmids pSK1 and pSK41 of Staphylococcus aureus are among the best studied plasmids native to Gram-positive bacteria. Although these plasmids seem largely restricted to their native hosts, protein sequence comparison of their replication initiator proteins indicates that they are clearly related. Homology searches indicate that these replicons are representatives of a large family of plasmids and a few phage that are widespread among the low G+C Gram-positive bacteria. We propose to name this family the RepA_N family of replicons after the annotated conserved domain that the initiator protein contains. Detailed sequence comparisons indicate that the initiator protein phylogeny is largely congruent with that of the host, suggesting that the replicons have evolved along with their current hosts and that intergeneric transfer has been rare. However, related proteins were identified on chromosomal regions bearing characteristics indicative of ICE elements, and the phylogeny of these proteins displayed evidence of more frequent intergeneric transfer. Comparison of stability determinants associated with the RepA_N replicons suggests that they have a modular evolution as has been observed in other plasmid families.
TI  - DNA gyrase (GyrB)/topoisomerase IV (ParE) inhibitors: synthesis and antibacterial activity.
AB  - The synthesis and antibacterial activities of three chemotypes of DNA supercoiling inhibitors based on imidazolo[1,2-a]pyridine and [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine scaffolds that target the ATPase subunits of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV (GyrB/ParE) is reported. The most potent scaffold was selected for optimization leading to a series with potent Gram-positive antibacterial activity and a low resistance frequency.
TI  - [Comparative in vitro activity of daptomycin against gram-positive microorganisms: SENTRY surveillance program, Spain (2002-2006)].
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Daptomycin is a bactericidal lipopeptide antibiotic,  active against gram-positive bacteria. In this study, the comparative in vitro activity of daptomycin and other antimicrobial agents against isolates recovered in 3 Spanish hospitals from 2002 to 2006 was determined as part of the international SENTRY antimicrobial resistance surveillance program. The possible therapeutic role of daptomycin is addressed in the light of Spanish susceptibility data. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the microdilution method with 1398 consecutively recovered gram-positive isolates. RESULTS: All the staphylococci (n = 1024), enterococci (n = 228), and streptococci (n = 146) studied were susceptible to daptomycin. The highest MIC values were 1, 4, and 0.5 microg/mL, respectively, regardless of methicillin, vancomycin, or penicillin resistance status. All Staphylococcus aureus isolates were also susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Only daptomycin and linezolid were active against all enterococcal isolates. In addition, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and ampicillin were fully active against Enterococcus faecalis. Daptomycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin were active against all Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and S. viridans group isolates. The distribution of daptomycin MIC values in S. aureus and enterococci was homogeneously sustained along the 5-year study period. CONCLUSION: The sustained antimicrobial activity of daptomycin against staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci in Spain makes this antibiotic an excellent therapeutic option in severe infection caused by gram-positive microorganisms, including those with multiresistance.
TI  - Study of bacterial infections among the patients with suspected cutaneous leishmaniasis.
AB  - The main objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of secondary bacterial infections in the patients with cutaneous lesions. The patients admitted to leishmaniasis laboratory of faculty of health, Tehran university of medical sciences from October 2004 to June 2005 were subjected in this study. Clinical samples were analyzed using standard bacteriological and parasitological methods. One hundred seventy three patients were subjected to this study and leishmania was found in 84 (48.5%) cases. According to bacteriological experiments, 47 cases (55.9%) had been also infected by bacterial infections. The most prevalent bacterial isolates included group D Streptococcus (19.1%), Enterococcus spp. (19.1%) and Staphylococcus aureus (12.7%). The findings of current study indicated that the bacterial infections are still an important problem in the patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis and should be considered in treating these patients.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of Cochlospermum planchoni Hook.f. ex Planch essential oil from Burkina Faso.
AB  - The water distilled oil obtained from rhizomes of Cochlospermum planchonii Hook.f.ex Planch (Apocynaceae) from Burkina Faso was examined by GC and GC/MS. Cochlospermum planchonii oil presents a particular chemical composition with a high rate of oxygenated components with predominance of ketones and esters (86.4%). The essential oil was tested against twelve strains of bacteria using a broth microdilution method. The results suggest that Cochlospermum planchonii essential oil has significant bactericidal activity.
TI  - Antibacterial 5'-O-(N-dipeptidyl)-sulfamoyladenosines.
AB  - The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) class of enzymes is a validated target for antimicrobial development. Aminoacyl analogues of 5'-O-(N-L-aminoacyl)-sulfamoyladenosines are known to be potent inhibitors of aaRS, but whole cell antibacterial activity of these compounds is very limited, and poor penetration into bacteria has been proposed as the main reason for this. Aiming to find derivatives that better penetrate bacteria, we developed a simple and short method to prepare dipeptidyl-derivatives of 5'-O-(N-L-aminoacyl)-sulfamoyladenosines, and used this method to prepare 18 5'-O-(N-dipeptidyl)-sulfamoyladenosines. The antibacterial activity of these derivatives and a number of reference compounds against S. aureus, E. faecalis and E. coli was determined. Several of the new derivatives showed improved antibacterial activity and an altered spectrum of antibacterial activity.
TI  - What's new and not so new on the antimicrobial horizon?
AB  - Despite increasing antimicrobial resistance and multiple drug resistance in clinical isolates of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, there are few novel antimicrobial agents in development. The few new agents that have been recently licensed have tended to have narrow spectra of activity, focused on Gram-positive pathogens, especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). This situation is rightly causing concern among clinicians and public health authorities worldwide. This article reviews available data on three new antibacterials currently in development. The cephalosporin ceftobiprole is active against MRSA, Enterococcus faecalis and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, but otherwise has a spectrum of activity similar to that of other recent cephalosporins. In a clinical trial, ceftobiprole was non-inferior to vancomycin for the treatment of MRSA-associated complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs). Doripenem, a new carbapenem, has some activity against MRSA, but otherwise has an anti-Gram-positive spectrum of activity similar to that of imipenem and an anti-Gram-negative spectrum similar to that of meropenem. In a clinical trial, it was non-inferior to meropenem for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections. Iclaprim is a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor with greatly enhanced activity, as compared with trimethoprim, against a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. The limited literature concerning this agent has concentrated on its potential role in the treatment of infections with Gram-positive bacteria. A clinical trial has demonstrated the non-inferiority of iclaprim, as compared with linezolid, in the treatment of cSSSIs, including those associated with MRSA.
TI  - Compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of D-alanine, L-alanine, and valine:  application of diastereomer separation to delta15N and microbial peptidoglycan studies.
AB  - We have developed an analytical method to determine the compound-specific nitrogen isotope compositions of individual amino acid enantiomers using gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry. A novel derivatization of amino acid diastereomers by optically active (R)-(-)-2-butanol or (S)-(+)-2-butanol offers two advantages for nitrogen isotope analysis. First, chromatographic chiral separation can be achieved without the use of chiral stationary-phase columns. Second, the elution order of these compounds on the chromatogram can be switched by a designated esterification reaction. We applied the method to the compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of D- and L-alanine in a peptidoglycan derived from the cell walls of cultured bacteria (Firmicutes and Actinobacteria; Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus staphylolyticus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Streptomyces sp.), natural whole bacterial cells (Bacillus subtilis var. natto), (pseudo)-peptidoglycan from archaea (Methanobacterium sp.), and cell wall from eukaryota (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). We observed statistically significant differences in nitrogen isotopic compositions; e.g., delta15N ( per thousand vs air) in Staphylococcus staphylolyticus for d-alanine (19.2 +/- 0.5 per thousand, n = 4) and L-alanine (21.3 +/- 0.8 per thousand, n = 4) and in Bacillus subtilis for D-alanine (6.2 +/- 0.2 per thousand, n = 3) and L-alanine (8.2 +/- 0.4 per thousand, n = 3). These results suggest that enzymatic reaction pathways, including the alanine racemase reaction, produce a nitrogen isotopic difference in amino acid enantiomers, resulting in 15N-depleted D-alanine. This method is expected to facilitate compound-specific nitrogen isotope studies of amino acid stereoisomers.
TI  - Hylin a1, the first cytolytic peptide isolated from the arboreal South American frog Hypsiboas albopunctatus ("spotted treefrog").
AB  - RP-HPLC fractionation of the electrically stimulated skin secretion of the arboreal South American frog Hypsiboas albopunctatus ("spotted treefrog") led to the isolation of a cytolytic C-terminally amidated peptide. This novel peptide, named hylin a1 (Hy-a1), consists of 18 amino acid residues (IFGAILPLALGALKNLIK-NH(2)). The alpha-helical structure of the synthetic hylin a1 peptide was confirmed by CD spectroscopy in the presence of 60% (v/v) TFE. The synthetic peptide displayed broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and also against fungi (Candida albicans, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis and Cryptococcus neoformans). Hylin a1 was also able to disrupt human erytrocytes (HC(50)=18 microM). Similarity analysis using PSI-BLAST revealed 50-44% of identity to maximins Hv, H16, H15 and H10 from Bombina maxima and also to hylins b1 and b2 (Hy-b1 and Hy-b2) from Hypsiboas lundii (synonym: Hyla biobeba).
TI  - Microbiological and toxicological effects of Perla black bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) extracts: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  - We investigated the microbiological and toxicological effects of three Perla black bean extracts on the growth and culture of selected pathogenic microorganisms, the toxicity over Vero cell lines and an in vivo rat model. Three different solvents were used to obtain Perla black bean extracts. All three Perla black bean extracts were tested for antibacterial and antiparasitic activity and further analysed for intrinsic cytotoxicity (IC(50)). Methanol Perla black bean extract was used for acute toxicity test in rats, with the up-and-down doping method. All Perla black bean extracts inhibited bacterial growth. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Listeria monocytogenes showed inhibition, while Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes did not. Acidified water and acetic acid Perla black bean extract were tested in parasites. The best IC(50) was observed for Giardia lamblia, while higher concentrations were active against Entamoeba histolytica and Trichomonas vaginalis. The Vero cells toxicity levels (IC(50)) for methanol, acidified water and acetic acid Perla black bean extract were [mean +/- S.D. (95% CI)]: 275 +/- 6.2 (267.9-282.0), 390 +/- 4.6 (384.8-395.2) and 209 +/- 3.39 (205.6-212.4) microg/ml, respectively. In vivo acute toxicity assays did not show changes in absolute organ weights, gross and histological examinations of selected tissues or functional tests. The acetic acid and methanol Perla black bean extract proved to exhibit strong antibacterial activity and the acidified water Perla black bean extract exerted parasiticidal effects against Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba hystolitica and Trichomonas vaginalis. The three Perla black bean extracts assayed over Vero cells showed very low toxicity and the methanol Perla black bean extract in vivo did not cause toxicity.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activity of the newly synthesized 2-xanthone derivatives.
AB  - A series of 2-substituted xanthone derivatives 8-20 containing selected allyl, cinnamyl, morpholine, and imidazole moieties were synthesized and tested for their antifungal and antibacterial in-vitro properties. Of the newly synthesized derivatives, ten revealed antifungal activity especially against Trichophyton mentagrophytes (the biggest inhibition zones ranged 35 mm for 11 and 13). 2-(3-(Allylamino)propoxy)-9H-xanthen-9-one hydrochloride 9 inhibited growth of all of the examined fungal species. Significant efficacy against evaluated yeasts and dermatophytes was also observed for 6-chloro-2-methyl-9H-xanthen-9-one derivatives 11-13 containing encyclic amine moieties. Additionally, compounds 9, 11, and 12 hindered development of bacteria species but in a lesser degree. They were efficacious against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - One-pot synthesis of 5-phenylimino, 5-thieno or 5-oxo-1,2,3-dithiazoles and evaluation of their antimicrobial and antitumor activity.
AB  - We here report the synthesis and biological evaluation of rare 4-substituted-5-phenylimino, 5-thieno- and 5-oxo-1,2,3-dithiazoles. Dithiazoles were selectively obtained in moderate to high yields (25-73%) via a one-pot reaction from various ethanoneoximes with sulfur monochloride, pyridine in acetonitrile followed by treatment by corresponding nucleophiles (aniline, thioacetamide and formic acid). All the synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial (against bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonellaenterica serovar Typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus and Listeria inocua), antifungal (against pathogenic strains Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis and Issatchenkia orientalis) and antitumor (on human cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) activity. 4-(2-Pyridinyl)-5H-1,2,3-dithiazole-5-thione and 4-ethylcarboxyl-5H-1,2,3-dithiazole-5-thione (5d, 5h) that are active against Gram-positive bacteria are significantly active against fungi. 4-(2-Benzofuranyl)-5-phenylimino-5H-1,2,3-dithiazole (4e) exerts antiproliferative activity.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline: MICs, MBCs, time-kill curves and post-antibiotic effect.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs), time-kill curves, and postantibiotic effect (PAE) of tigecycline, the first in the glycylcycline class of antibiotics, were evaluated. MICs were determined against 749 clinical isolates. Time-kill curves were performed against two isolates each of Enterococcus faecalis, MSSA, and MRSA. The presence of PAE, against the same isolates, was investigated. MIC(90)s (microg/mL) were the following: Escherichia coli 0.25; Klebsiella spp 0.5; Enterobacter spp 1; Acinetobacter spp. 2; Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA+MRSA) 0.25; CNS (MS+MR) 0.25; vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis 0.12. Tigecycline exerted bacteriostatic activity against all the tested isolates, MBC(90)values being 32xMIC. Time-kill experiments showed a marked reduction in bacterial growth. A PAE at 1- to 20-fold the MIC was observed against the two enterococcal isolates (1.5-3.2h, range) and the four staphylococci (1.6-3h, range). Our findings confirm the excellent antimicrobial activity of tigecycline, adding informations on its bacteriostatic activity vs enterococci and staphylococci, whether methicillin-resistant or -susceptible, and its PAE.
TI  - Glycopeptide bone penetration in patients with septic pseudoarthrosis of the tibia.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In the treatment of bone infections, a major determinant of the clinical response is the active drug concentration at the infected site. Because of the high prevalence of meticillin (methicillin)-resistant staphylococci and enterococci, glycopeptides are widely used for the treatment of bone and joint infections, but data on their penetration into human bone are lacking. The aim of our study was to measure vancomycin and teicoplanin concentrations in infected human bone under steady-state conditions and verify their relationship with inflammatory markers, patient demographic characteristics and pharmacodynamic microbiological markers. METHODS AND PATIENTS: Twenty-seven adult orthopaedic patients undergoing surgical debridement for septic pseudoarthrosis of the tibia and receiving either intravenous vancomycin (Vancocina) 1 g twice daily) or teicoplanin (Targosid) 10 mg/kg/day) were studied from January 2004 to January 2008. Plasma and bone specimens were simultaneously collected during surgery for pharmacokinetic and microbiological assays at a variable interval after antimicrobial administration. Bone samples were dissected into cortical and cancellous bone, cleaned of soft tissues, crushed and eluted into phosphate buffer. Necrotic samples and sequestra were not analysed.Plasma and bone antimicrobial concentrations were measured by a validated method of high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection, and bone/plasma concentration ratios were calculated. Cortical and cancellous bone area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) over 24 hours (AUC(24)) values were measured by the linear-log trapezoidal rule, using WinNonlin) software, and were compared with the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the infecting agents. RESULTS: For vancomycin, the mean +/- SD concentrations were 2.66 +/- 1.2 mg/L in cortical bone and 11.53 +/- 7.8 mg/L in cancellous bone (corresponding to 20.67% and 89.39% of intraoperative plasma concentrations), and the mean +/- SD tissue AUC(24) values were 55.15 +/- 25.26 h . mg/L for cortical bone and 299.16 +/- 299.54 h . mg/L for cancellous bone. For teicoplanin, the mean +/- SD concentrations were 2.01 +/- 1.7 and 7.51 +/- 7.0 mg/L in cortical and cancellous bone, respectively (12.35% and 48.6% of intraoperative plasma concentrations), and the mean +/- SD teicoplanin tissue AUC(24) values were 34.08 +/- 23.6 h . mg/L and 155.17 +/- 132.8 h . mg/L for cortical bone and cancellous bone, respectively. The mean vancomycin AUC(24)/MIC ratios were 215.02 for plasma, 47.14 for cortical bone and 268.95 for cancellous bone. The mean teicoplanin AUC(24)/MIC ratios were 336.48, 36.27 and 197.21 for plasma, cortical bone and cancellous bone, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Bone penetration of both glycopeptides ranged from poor (<15%) to satisfactory (15-30%) in the cortical compartment, while it was far higher into the highly vascularized cancellous tissue. Vancomycin bone penetration was slightly higher than with teicoplanin, but the difference was not statistically significant. Higher bone concentrations were observed with higher inflammatory markers, possibly as a result of increased vascularization and vascular permeability under inflammatory conditions. Bone concentrations over the MIC and AUC/MIC ratios suggested that both glycopeptides achieve a satisfactory pharmacokinetic exposure in the cancellous bone, as far as Gram-positive pathogens are concerned. On the other hand, cortical bone exposure was suboptimal in most patients. Furthermore, as antimicrobial penetration may be affected by impaired blood supply, the role of radical surgical removal of purulent and necrotic tissues appears to be essential in order to shorten treatment duration and to reduce the risk of treatment failure.
TI  - Ambuic acid inhibits the biosynthesis of cyclic peptide quormones in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Quorum sensing is a cell-density-dependent regulatory system in gram-positive bacteria and is often regulated by cyclic peptides called "quormones," which function as extracellular communication signals. With an aim to discover an antipathogenic agent targeting quorum sensing in gram-positive bacteria, we screened 153 samples of fungal butanol extracts with the guidance of the inhibition of quorum-sensing-mediated gelatinase production in Enterococcus faecalis. Following the screenings, we found that ambuic acid, a known secondary fungal metabolite, inhibited the quorum-sensing-mediated gelatinase production without influencing the growth of E. faecalis. We further demonstrated that ambuic acid targeted the biosynthesis of a cyclic peptide quormone called gelatinase biosynthesis-activating pheromone. Furthermore, ambuic acid also inhibited the biosynthesis of the cyclic peptide quormones of Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria innocua. These results suggest the potential use of ambuic acid as a lead compound of antipathogenic drugs that target the quorum-sensing-mediated virulence expression of gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Novel pyridazine derivatives: Synthesis and antimicrobial activity evaluation.
AB  - A general method for the preparation of new hydrazones is reported. The 1-[4-(2-methoxybenzyl)-6-aryl pyridazin-3(2H)-ylidene] hydrazines or their tautomeric structures (1(a-d)) were condensed with different aldehydes, dialdehydes, ketones, alpha-dicarbonyl compounds and simple carbohydrates to afford the hydrazones and dihydrazones (2(a-d)), (3(a-d)), (4(a-d)), (5(a-d)), (6(d)), (7(c)), (8(a-d)), (9(a-d)), (10(a-d)), (11(a-d)), (12(a,c,d)), (13(a-d)), (14(a-d)), (15(a-d)), (16(a-d)) and (17(a-d)). The structures of all synthesized compounds were confirmed from microanalytical and spectral data. Some of the products were screened for their antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The hydrazone derivative 15(d) (1-[4-(2-methoxybenzyl)-6-methylphenyl pyridazin-3(2H)-ylidene]-2-(2-carboxydiphenyl methyl) hydrazine) showed the highest biological activity.
TI  - Isoflavonoid glycosides from the roots of Baphia bancoensis.
AB  - Chemical investigation of the methanol extract of the roots of Baphia bancoensis  led to the isolation and characterization of three new isoflavonoid glycosides (1-3). Their structures were determined on the basis of spectroscopic studies andchemical evidence. Antibacterial activity of isolated compounds was evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  - Enterococcal infections & antimicrobial resistance.
AB  - Enterococci have traditionally regarded as low grade pathogens, have emerged as an increasingly important cause of nosocomial infections in the last decade. Although about a dozen enterococcus species have been identified, only two are responsible for the majority of human infections, i.e., Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. The most common nosocomial infections produced by these organisms are urinary tract infections (associated with instrumentation and antimicrobial resistance), followed by intra-abdominal and pelvic infections. They also cause surgical wound infections, bacteraemia, endocarditis, neonatal sepsis and rarely meningitis. A major reason why these organisms survive in hospital environment is the intrinsic resistance to several commonly used antibiotics and, perhaps more importantly, their ability to acquire resistance to all currently available antibiotics, either by mutation or by receipt of foreign genetic material through the transfer of plasmids and transposons. The emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) is a cause of concern, as once established, it is very difficult to control. Moreover, there can be transfer of resistant gene from enterococci to Staphylococcus aureus thereby posing a threat to the patient safety and also challenges for the treating physicians. This review highlights the shifting spectrum of enterococcal infections, along with their geographical distribution and growing nosocomial importance. Emergence of antimicrobial resistance, pathogenicity and virulence factors, current preventive, control and treatment modalities of severe enterococcal infections are also dealt with.
TI  - Streptococci and lactococci synthesize large amounts of HPr(Ser-P)(His~P).
AB  - HPr is a protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system (PTS). In gram-positive bacteria, HPr can be phosphorylated on Ser-46 by the kinase/phosphorylase HprK/P and on His-15 by phospho-enzyme I (EI~P) of the PTS. In vitro studies with purified HPrs from Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus salivarius have indicated that the phosphorylation of one residue impedes the phosphorylation of the other. However, a recent study showed that while the rate of Streptococcus salivarius HPr phosphorylation by EI~P is reduced at acidic pH, the phosphorylation of HPr(Ser-P) by EI~P, generating HPr(Ser-P)(His~P), is stimulated. This suggests that HPr(Ser-P)(His~P) synthesis may occur in acidogenic bacteria unable to maintain their intracellular pH near neutrality. Consistent with this hypothesis, significant amounts of HPr(Ser-P)(His~P) have been detected in some streptococci. The present study was aimed at determining whether the capacity to synthesize HPr(Ser-P)(His~P) is common to streptococcal species, as well as to lactococci, which are also unable to maintain their intracellular pH near neutrality in response to a decrease in extracellular pH. Our results indicated that unlike Staphylococcus aureus, B. subtilis, and E. faecalis, all the streptococcal and lactococcal species tested were able to synthesize large amounts of HPr(Ser-P)(His~P) during growth. We also showed that Streptococcus salivarius IIABLMan, a protein involved in sugar transport by the PTS, could be efficiently phosphorylated by HPr(Ser-P)(His~P).
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of tigecycline and other antimicrobials against Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms collected from the Asia-Pacific Rim as part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST).
AB  - As part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST), Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms were collected from 31 medical centres in nine countries in the Asia-Pacific Rim between 2004 and 2007. Overall, 34.2% of Acinetobacter spp. were multidrug-resistant, and 17.0% of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 10.6% of Escherichia coli produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. A total of 39.5% of Staphylococcus aureus were meticillin-resistant and 21.7% of Enterococcus faecium were vancomycin-resistant. Tigecycline MIC(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) were <or=2mg/L against Acinetobacter spp., K. pneumoniae, E. coli, Enterobacter spp. and Serratia marcescens and <or=0.25mg/L against S. aureus, E. faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Antimicrobial resistance is widespread in the Asia-Pacific Rim. Tigecycline has excellent in vitro activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria, including resistant strains.
TI  - Daptomycin in bone and joint infections: a review of the literature.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety  of daptomycin, a novel antibiotic for the treatment of bone and joint infections, a literature search of relevant articles was conducted. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A PubMed/MEDLINE search (1990-April 2008) to identify relevant English-language literature was conducted. Search terms included bone and joint infection, osteomyelitis, daptomycin, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Additional articles were identified by reviewing the bibliographies of articles cited. Programs and abstracts from infectious disease meetings were searched, and prescribing information of antibiotics indicated for bone and joint infections consulted. All articles identified from data sources published in English were evaluated. RESULTS: Caused primarily by Gram-positive pathogens such as S. aureus and, to a lesser extent, Enterococcus faecalis, bone and joint infections are difficult to treat successfully. Surgical intervention and prolonged courses of antibiotics are frequently required, and failure of first-line antibiotic therapy is common. The emergence of S. aureus strains with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, the longstanding gold standard for bone and joint infections, has complicated the clinical scenario. Few randomized trials comparing the efficacy of different antibiotics for bone and joint infections exist. Daptomycin, a novel intravenous lipopeptide antibiotic, has shown potent in vitro activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive bacteria, including many resistant pathogens commonly associated with bone and joint infections such as MRSA and vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis. Early clinical investigation of daptomycin in bone and joint infections unresponsive to antibiotics, such as vancomycin, has found a cure rate of approximately 80%, with a low incidence of adverse events and drug resistance. CONCLUSION: Further studies are warranted to determine if limited clinical evidence, described in individual case reports and a daptomycin-specific retrospective registry, suggests daptomycin is a promising option for patients with bone and joint infections such as MRSA osteomyelitis.
TI  - Bacteriology of non-surgical wound infections in Ibadan, Nigeria.
AB  - Previous studies done on wound infections in this environment had been mostly on  the surgical variety rather than the non-surgical. However,few studies available on the non-surgical type have indicated that changes do occur in the pattern and antibiogram of the bacterial isolates of these non-surgical wound infections. This study was therefore designed to investigate the bacteriology of non-surgical wound infections in this environment. A retrospective review of seven hundred and fifty four cases of non-surgical wound infections was conducted between September 2002 and February 2005 at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. A total number of 871 bacterial, and seven fungal isolates were obtained from these wound cultures. In 477 (70.3%) cases, cultures were monomicrobial and 202 (29.8%) polymicrobial. Staphylococcus aureus (38%) was the predominant pathogen, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.7%), Klebsiella species (17%), Escherichia coli (10.6%), Proteus species (7.4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (4.4%), Streptococcus species (1.6%), Enterococcus faecalis (1.4%), and Candida albicans (0.8%). High rates of antibiotic resistance were recorded among these isolates. 53.4% of them were sensitive to ceftriaxone, 42.5% to gentamycin and 39.3% to ofloxacin. This high antibiotic resistance gives credence to the value of determining the antibiogram of these pathogens in their management. Continuous interaction between the wound care practitioners and microbiology department is also advocated.
TI  - Role of human CD36 in bacterial recognition, phagocytosis, and pathogen-induced JNK-mediated signaling.
AB  - Scavenger receptor CD36 mediates Staphylococcus aureus phagocytosis and initiates TLR2/6 signaling. We analyzed the role of CD36 in the uptake and TLR-independent signaling of various bacterium, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, S. aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Expression of human CD36 in HeLa cells increased the uptake of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria compared with the control mock-transfected cells. Bacterial adhesion was associated with pathogen phagocytosis. Upon CD36 transfection, HEK293 cells, which demonstrate no TLR2/4 expression, acquired LPS responsiveness as assessed by IL-8 production. The cells demonstrated a marked 5- to 15-fold increase in cytokine release upon exposure to gram-negative bacteria, while the increase was much smaller (1.5- to 3-fold) with gram-positive bacteria and lipoteichoic acid. CD36 down-regulation utilizing CD36 small interfering RNA reduced cytokine release by 40-50% in human fibroblasts induced by both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria as well as LPS. Of all MAPK signaling cascade inhibitors tested, only the inhibitor of JNK, a stress-activated protein kinase, potently blocked E. coli/LPS-stimulated cytokine production. NF-kappaB inhibitors were ineffective, indicating direct TLR-independent signaling. JNK activation was confirmed by Western blot analyses of phosphorylated JKN1/2 products. Synthetic amphipathic peptides with an alpha-helical motif were shown to be efficient inhibitors of E. coli- and LPS-induced IL-8 secretion as well as JNK1/2 activation/phosphorylation in CD36-overexpressing cells. These results indicate that CD36 functions as a phagocytic receptor for a variety of bacteria and mediates signaling induced by gram-negative bacteria and LPS via a JNK-mediated signaling pathway in a TLR2/4-independent manner.
TI  - Immunoadjuvant effects of bacterial genomic DNA and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides on  avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 inactivated oil emulsion vaccine in chicken.
AB  - This study investigated the immunoadjuvant effects of three types of bacterial genomic DNA and CpG oligonucleotides (CpG ODN) on the avian influenza virus (AIV) subtype H5N1 inactivated oil emulsion vaccine under two immunization strategies. The genomic DNA extracted from Escherichia coli O(2), Staphylococcus aureus,Streptococcus faecalis FQ68, and synthetic CpG ODN were used as adjuvants, and their effects on the AIV oil emulsion vaccine were examined in chickens. The results indicated that when administered separately from the vaccine, adjuvants induced lower haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titres and serum IgG titres but resulted in higher concentrations of IFN-gamma and IL-10. In contrast, when combined with the oil emulsion vaccine prior to inoculation, CpG ODN induced higher HI, IgG titres and IFN-gamma concentration but resulted in lower IL-10 concentration. These data suggest that, depending on the immunization approaches, adjuvants may exert distinct immune effects in chickens receiving AIV H5N1 oil emulsion vaccine: the prior incorporation of CpG ODN into the vaccine may augment both the humoral and Th1 type immune responses, while separate inoculation of adjuvants has not shown better adjuvanticity.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the ornamental species Salvia corrugata, a potential new crop for extractive purposes.
AB  - As a part of our search for biologically active compounds from cultivated Salvia  spp. we investigated Salvia corrugata Vahl. The activity of two isolated icetaxane diterpene quinones, fruticuline A and demethylfruticuline A, was assessed against 46 bacterial pathogens, mostly resistant to several primary antibiotics. The MIC for all the inhibited Gram-positive pathogens tested showed a very narrow distribution and ranged from 32 to 64 mg/L, regardless of their resistance patterns to other antibiotics. Demethylfruticuline A was shown to be highly bactericidal (>3 log(10) CFU decrease within 24 h) against Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis and bacteriostatic against Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. Fruticuline A manifested bacteriostatic activity against all tested strains. S. corrugata can be viewed as an interesting source for these diterpenes, which, if well tolerated in vivo, may represent new medical agents useful for the treatment of serious infections caused by resistant Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Comparative analysis of viperidae venoms antibacterial profile: a short communication for proteomics.
AB  - Bacterial infections involving multidrug-resistant strains are one of the ten leading causes of death and an important health problem in need for new antibacterial sources and agents. Herein, we tested and compared four snake venoms (Agkistrodon rhodostoma, Bothrops jararaca, B. atrox and Lachesis muta) against 10 Gram-positive and Gram-negative drug-resistant clinical bacteria strains to identify them as new sources of potential antibacterial molecules. Our data revealed that, as efficient as some antibiotics currently on the market (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 1-32 mug mL(-1)), A. rhodostoma and B. atrox venoms were active against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC = 4.5 mug mL(-1)), while B. jararaca inhibited S. aureus growth (MIC = 13 mug ml(-1)). As genomic and proteomic technologies are improving and developing rapidly, our results suggested that A. rhodostoma, B. atrox and B. jararaca venoms and glands are feasible sources for searching antimicrobial prototypes for future design new antibiotics against drug-resistant clinical bacteria. They also point to an additional perspective to fully identify the pharmacological potential of these venoms by using different techniques.
TI  - A facile synthesis, antibacterial, and antitubercular studies of some piperidin-4-one and tetrahydropyridine derivatives.
AB  - The raise in clinical significance of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens has directed us to synthesize 2,6-diarylpiperidin-4-one and Delta(3)-tetrahydropyridin-4-ol based benzimidazole and O-arylsulfonyl derivatives. X-ray crystal structure of tetrahydropyridinol (23) confirmed a change in conformation and orientation of substituents upon amide formation. Antibacterial activities evaluated against a wide number of bacterial pathogens (both sensitive and multidrug-resistant) revealed that 19, 27 against Staphylococcus aureus, 27 against Enterococcus faecalis, and 19, 21, 23, and 27 against Enterococcus faecium are significantly good at lowest MIC(90) (16 microg/mL). Inhibitory power noticed by 23 against Vancomycin-Linezolid-resistant E. faecalis and 27 against Vancomycin-resistant E. faecium are onefold better than the standard Linezolid and Trovafloxacin drugs, respectively. Moreover, antitubercular activity for the selected compounds against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv revealed that compounds 23, 24, and 27 expressed onefold improved potency compared to the standard Rifampicin drug.
TI  - Incidence of endophthalmitis after 20- and 25-gauge vitrectomy causes and prevention.
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare endophthalmitis incidence after inpatient 20-gauge (20-G) and 25-G vitrectomies, and to examine the causes and prevention of postvitrectomy endophthalmitis. DESIGN: Retrospective, interventional, comparative cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Six thousand nine hundred thirty-five consecutive patients undergoing pars plana vitrectomy. METHODS: We compared the incidence of endophthalmitis in 3592 consecutive eyes that underwent 20-G vitrectomy between January 2000 and September 2004, and 3343 consecutive eyes that underwent 25-G vitrectomy between April 2004 and December 2007. For 25-G vitrectomy, 542 eyes with sclerotomies produced by straight incision and 2801 eyes with angled incisions were also compared. From 85 eyes that underwent 20-G vitrectomy and 128 eyes that underwent 25-G vitrectomy, ocular surface irrigation fluid and vitreous samples were collected at the end of surgery for bacterial culture. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of postvitrectomy endophthalmitis. RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative endophthalmitis was 0.0278% (1 of 3592 eyes) for 20-G vitrectomies and 0.0299% (1 of 3343 eyes) for 25-G vitrectomies, with no significant difference. Two eyes developed endophthalmitis after vitrectomy, and visual acuity deteriorated to no light perception despite emergency vitreous surgery. The causative bacteria were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecali; both were resistant to postoperative antibiotics. In 25-G vitrectomy, the endophthalmitis incidence was 0.18% (1/542 eyes) for straight incision versus 0% (0/2801 eyes) for angled incision, with no significant difference (P = 0.1621). Bacterial contamination rates in ocular surface irrigation fluid and the vitreous were 5.9% (5/85 eyes) and 1.2% (1/85 eyes), respectively, in 20-G vitrectomies, and 5.5% (7/128 eyes) and 2.3% (3/128 eyes) in 25-G vitrectomies, with no significant difference. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of endophthalmitis was 0.03% for both 20-G and 25-G vitrectomies. This is the first data set to demonstrate no statistically significant difference between endophthalmitis rates in 20-G and 25-G vitrectomy. At the completion of 25-G vitrectomy, the ocular surface irrigation fluid and vitreous were, on rare occasion, contaminated by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In 25-G vitrectomy, conjunctival irrigation, ensuring sclerotomy closure, and excision of peripheral vitreous may contribute to the prevention of postvitrectomy endophthalmitis.

TI  - Combating implant infections. Remarks by a women's team.
AB  - Research on implant infections requires cooperative efforts and integration between basic and clinical expertises. An international group of women scientists is acting together in this field. The main research topics of the participants of this group are described. Formation of bacterial biofilms, antibiotic resistance and production of virulence factors like adhesins and toxins are investigated. New biomaterials, coatings and drugs designed to inhibit microbial adhesion are evaluated, and infection-resistant biomaterials are under study, such as a novel heparinizable polycarbonate-urethane (Bionate) or incorporation of diamino-diamide-diol (PIME) to reduce bacterial attachment. The correlation between biofilm production and the accessory-gene-regulator (agr) is investigated in Staphylococcus aureus. The ability to form biofilm has also been shown to be one of the important virulence factors of Enterococcus faecalis, favouring colonization of inert and biological surfaces. The study of quorum sensing has led to the discovery of a quorum sensing inhibitor termed RIP that suppresses staphylococcal biofilm and infections. The immune response and the local defence mechanisms of the host against implant-associated infections, activation and infiltration of immunocompetent cells into the sites of infection have been studied in patients with implant-associated osteomyelitis. Production of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as possible vaccines against the staphylococcal collagen-binding MSCRAMMs is in progress.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of two anaesthetic agents: dexmedetomidine and midazolam.
AB  - Some anaesthetic agents are known to inhibit microbial growth. The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate possible antimicrobial effects of two frequently used agents in intensive care units, dexmedetomidine and midazolam. Antimicrobial effect was tested on Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by broth microdilution method. Midazolam showed inhibitor and bactericidal effect on S. aureus at concentrations 256 mmicrog x ml(-1) and 512/microg x ml(-1) respectively and on E. faecalis at concentrations 128 microg x ml(-1) and 256 microg x ml(-1). Dexmedetomidine demonstrated inhibitor effect on S. aureus, E. coli and P aeruginosa at concentrations 32 microg x ml(-1), 16 microg x ml(-1) and 16 microg x ml(-1) respectively. Midazolam had inhibitor and bactericidal effects on S. aureus and E. faecalis. Dexmedetomidine had only inhibitor effects on S. aureus, E. coli and P aeruginosa. Further studies are needed to determine the antimicrobial mechanisms and clinical applications.
TI  - Ursolic, oleanolic and betulinic acids: antibacterial spectra and selectivity indexes.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ursolic acid (UA), oleanolic acid (OA) and betulinic acid (BA), three hydroxyl pentacyclic triterpenoic acids (HPTAs) naturally found in a large variety of vegetarian foods, medicinal herbs and plants have been investigated for antibacterial activity. AIM OF THE STUDY: To determine the antibacterial activity of UA, OA and BA, as well as the toxic impact on eukaryotic cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined against five reference strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 & ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853), as well as five antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates. Toxicity was evaluated against MRC-5 and HaCaT cell lines. RESULTS: No antibacterial activity was observed for BA; while OA and more particularly UA, did show a moderate to good antibacterial activity, but limited to Gram-positive bacteria. Nevertheless, OA and UA were devoid of antibacterial activities against clinical isolates. Moreover, viability and cytotoxic assays demonstrated that the three compounds induced a significant cytotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Despite of a relative similar chemical structure; UA, OA and BA harboured different antibacterial activities, with more significant ones for UA. However, considering both viability and toxicity values, these compounds seem to have a significant impact on eukaryotic cell viability.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic activity of the lantibiotic MU1140.
AB  - This study evaluated the pharmacodynamics of the lantibiotic MU1140 and the ability of selected organisms to develop resistance to this antibiotic. MU1140 demonstrated activity against all Gram-positive organisms tested, including oxacillin- and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VREF). No activity was observed against Gram-negative bacteria or yeast. Time-kill studies revealed that MU1140 was rapidly bactericidal against Streptococcus pneumoniae and multidrug-resistant S. aureus, whilst it was bacteriostatic against VREF. In vitro resistance development to MU1140, tested by sequential subculturing in subinhibitory concentrations of MU1140, revealed a stable threefold increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for S. aureus and S. pneumoniae. Subsequent subculturing of the strains with elevated MICs in antibiotic-free media for 7 days did not result in a reduction of their MIC values for MU1140. Collectively, our findings illustrate the therapeutic potential of MU1140 for management of Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Reduction in infection risk through treatment of microbially contaminated surfaces with a novel, portable, saturated steam vapor disinfection system.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surface-mediated infectious disease transmission is a major concern in various settings, including schools, hospitals, and food-processing facilities. Chemical disinfectants are frequently used to reduce contamination, but many pose significant risks to humans, surfaces, and the environment, and all must be properly applied in strict accordance with label instructions to be effective. This study set out to determine the capability of a novel chemical-free, saturated steam vapor disinfection system to kill microorganisms, reduce surface-mediated infection risks, and serve as an alternative to chemical disinfectants. METHODS: High concentrations of Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Salmonella enterica, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, MS2 coliphage (used as a surrogate for nonenveloped viruses including norovirus), Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger, and the endospores of Clostridium difficile were dried individually onto porous clay test surfaces. Surfaces were treated with the saturated steam vapor disinfection system for brief periods and then numbers of surviving microorganisms were determined. Infection risks were calculated from the kill-time data using microbial dose-response relationships published in the scientific literature, accounting for surface-to-hand and hand-to-mouth transfer efficiencies. RESULTS: A diverse assortment of pathogenic microorganisms was rapidly killed by the steam disinfection system; all of the pathogens tested were completely inactivated within 5 seconds. Risks of infection from the contaminated surfaces decreased rapidly with increasing periods of treatment by the saturated steam vapor disinfection system. CONCLUSIONS: The saturated steam vapor disinfection system tested for this study is chemical-free, broadly active, rapidly efficacious, and therefore represents a novel alternative to liquid chemical disinfectants.
TI  - Isolated peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases from different organisms produce different glycan chain lengths.
AB  - Peptidoglycan is an essential component of bacterial cell wall. The glycan strands of peptidoglycan are synthesized by enzymes called peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases (PGTs). Using a high-resolution SDS-PAGE assay, we compared the glycan strand lengths of four different PGTs from three different organisms (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus). We report that each enzyme makes a polymer having an intrinsic characteristic length that is independent of the enzyme:substrate ratio. The glycan strand lengths vary considerably, depending on the enzyme. These results indicate that each enzyme must have some mechanism, as yet unknown, for controlling product length. The observation that different PGTs produce different length glycan chains may have implications for their cellular roles and for the three-dimensional structure of bacterial peptidoglycan.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activities of new hydrazide derivatives.
AB  - The synthesis of a new series of imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazine-2-carboxylic acid arylidene-hydrazides is described. The chemical structures of the compounds were elucidated by IR, (1)H-NMR, FAB(+)-MS spectral data. Their biological activity against various bacteria, fungi species, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was investigated. Antibacterial activity was measured against Escherichia coli (NRRL B-3704), Staphylococcus aureus (NRRL B-767), Salmonella typhimurium (NRRL B-4420), Proteus vulgaris (NRLL B-123), Enterococcus faecalis (isolated obtained from Faculty of Medicine Osmangazi University, Eskisehir, Turkey), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (NRRL B-23 27853), Klebsiella spp. (isolated obtained from Faculty of Medicine Osmangazi University, Eskisehir, Turkey), while antifungal activity was evaluated against Candida albicans (isolates obtained from Osmangazi Uni. Fac.of Medicine), Candida glabrata (isolates obtained from Osmangazi Uni. Fac.of Medicine). Compounds were also evaluated for antituberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)Rv using the BACTEC 460 radiometric system and BACTEC 12B medium. The compounds showed moderate inhibitor effects against human pathogenic microorganisms., whereas the preliminary results indicated that all of the tested compounds were inactive against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)Rv.
TI  - [Infective endocarditis due to high level aminoglycoside resistant Enterococcus faecalis and methicillin resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci presenting with rheumatic manifestations].
AB  - Infective endocarditis has variable clinical presentations and may present with rheumatologic manifestations. Infective endocarditis due to high level aminoglycoside resistant enterococci represents a severe therapeutic challenge as none of the currently recommended treatment regimens are bactericidal against these isolates. In this report, a case of infective endocarditis with double aetiology, high level aminoglycoside resistant Enterococcus faecalis together with methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MR-CNS), presenting with leukocytoclastic vasculitis and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, has been presented. A 48-years-old woman was admitted to our hospital with malaise and non-pruritic purpural rush on her lower extremities. On admission she had no fever or leukocytosis. Skin biopsy showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis and steroid therapy was started. On 12th day of admission rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis was diagnosed and she received plasmapheresis and haemodialysis support. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) demonstrated 1 x 1.5 cm vegetation on the mitral valve. An initial diagnosis of infective endocarditis was made and empirical treatment with vancomycin and gentamicin was started. All blood cultures yielded high level aminoglycoside resistant E. faecalis and additionally two of them yielded MR-CNS. Vancomycin was administered in combination with high dose ampicillin and repeated blood cultures taken after administration of ampicillin, revealed no growth. The patient remained afebrile, renal functions improved and a repeat TTE done on 20th day of ampicillin therapy showed waning of the vegetation. On 42nd day of treatment repeat TTE showed new vegetation on the mitral valve and severe valve insufficiency, so the patient was scheduled for mitral valve replacement. She was treated for 12 weeks with vancomycin and ampicillin and recovered successfully. In conclusion; infective endocarditis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Physicians should document their treatment outcomes and experience with high level aminoglycoside resistant enterococcal infective endocarditis, which is a therapeutic challenge, so that the best therapeutic options can be identified.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a new resin-based endodontic sealer against endodontic pathogens.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the antimicrobial activities of a new resin-based SuperBond (SB) Sealer and five other sealers/cements against endodontic pathogens. The antimicrobial activities of SB Sealer, Sealapex, AH plus, Roeko Seal Automix, Canals N, and ProRoot mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) were examined using a double-layered method. The microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sanguinis were used. Live microorganisms were stained using triphenyltetrazolium chloride, and the zones of inhibition of microorganism growth were measured. The antimicrobial activity of SB Sealer was significantly lower than that of the other sealers, except for Pro Root MTA, against S. aureus, C. albicans, S. mutans, and S. sanguinis, but no activity against E. faecalis was detected. On the other hand, AH plus exhibited the highest antimicrobial activity. Pro Root MTA showed no antimicrobial activity against any of the microorganisms tested. SB Sealer offered no antimicrobial advantage over the other sealers tested except for Pro Root MTA.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of Turkish propolis, pollen, and laurel on spoilage and pathogenic food-related microorganisms.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of propolis extract, pollen extract, and essential oil of laurel (Laurus nobilis L.) at concentrations from 0.02% to 2.5% (vol/vol) were investigated on bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes), yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida rugosa), and molds (Aspergillus niger and Rhizopus oryzae). Pollen has no antimicrobial effects on the bacteria and fungi tested in the concentrations used. Propolis showed a bactericidal effect at 0.02% on B. cereus and B. subtilis, at 1.0% on S. aureus and E. faecalis, and at 0.2% on L. monocytogenes. The minimum inhibitory concentration of propolis for fungi was 2.5%. Propolis and laurel were ineffective against E. coli and S. typhimurium at the concentrations tested. The results showed that the antimicrobial activity were concentration dependent. Propolis and essential oil of laurel may be used as biopreservative agents in food processing and preservation.
TI  - An agar diffusion comparison of the antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide at  five different concentrations with three different vehicles.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if varying the percent (by weight) of  aqueous calcium hydroxide or using different vehicles had an effect on its antibacterial efficacy against common endodontic pathogens in a pour plate/traditional streak agar diffusion model. Mixtures of calcium hydroxide powder and sterile saline in 40, 50 and 60 percent concentrations and the commercial preparations UltraCal XS and Vitapex were tested against six known endodontic pathogens with an agar diffusion method. Each medicament was placed in one of five wells, in each of 10 agar plates (n = 10), for cultures of each bacterial species. Zones of inhibition were measured after 48 hours incubation for aerobes and 96 hours incubation for anaerobes. Multiple one-way analyses of variance and post-hoc Student Neuman Keuls evaluated the data at alpha = 0.05. Larger zones of inhibition were consistently observed for higher concentrations of calcium hydroxide with statistical significance among the bacteria, particularly between 40% and 60%. Vitapex had significantly smaller zones of inhibition than all other medicaments and 35% UltraCal XS with methylcellulose was nearly as effective as 50% Ca(OH)(2) in inhibitory activity. Formulations containing 50-60% Ca(OH)(2) or 35% Ca(OH)(2) with aqueous methylcellulose are recommended as endodontic interappointment medicaments.
TI  - Vancomycin resistance VanS/VanR two-component systems.
AB  - Vancomycin is a member of the glycopeptide class of antibiotics. Vancomycin resistance (van) gene clusters are found in human pathogens such as Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus, glycopeptide-producing actinomycetes such as Amycolotopsis orientalis, Actinoplanes teichomyceticus and Streptomyces toyocaensis and the nonglycopeptide producing actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor. Expression of the van genes is activated by the VanS/VanR two-component system in response to extracellular glycopeptide antibiotic. Two major types of inducible vancomycin resistance are found in pathogenic bacteria; VanA strains are resistant to vancomycin itself and also to the lipidated glycopeptide teicoplanin, while VanB strains are resistant to vancomycin but sensitive to teicoplanin. Here we discuss the enzymes the van genes encode, the range of different VanS/VanR two-component systems, the biochemistry of VanS/VanR, the nature of the effector ligand(s) recognised by VanS and the evolution of the van cluster.
TI  - Antibacterial and antioxidant activity of the secondary metabolites from in vitro cultures of Drosera aliciae.
AB  - The objective of this research was to evaluate antioxidant as well as antibacterial properties of secondary metabolites obtained from Drosera aliciae plants grown in vitro and examine the mechanism of their antimicrobial action. Bactericidal activity of extracts from D. aliciae as well as pure ramentaceone (naphthoquinone) present in this plant were examined against human pathogenic strains both resistant and susceptible to antibiotics. Chloroform extract proved to be more effective than methanol preparation against all of the tested strains except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates with the lowest minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) values in the case of Staphylococcus aureus (25-50 mg fresh weight ml-1). The influence of D. aliciae extracts and ramentaceone on the synthesis of DNA, RNA or proteins in cultures of Enterococcus faecalis was estimated by measurement of incorporation of radioactive precursors: [3H]thymidine, [3H]uridine or [3H]leucine, respectively. Methanol extract from D. aliciae, except for a moderate effect on DNA synthesis, had no influence on RNA and protein synthesis. Chloroform preparation caused about a 75% decrease in [3H]uridine incorporation in comparison to control after 60 min and a significant reduction in DNA and protein synthesis (44% and 30% respectively). Ramentaceone also reduced DNA and RNA synthesis but less efficiently than chloroform extract and caused no changes in [3H]leucine incorporation. Methanol extract from D. aliciae proved to be an effective antioxidant in both the DPPH and FRAP assay with the activities exceeding those of well known antioxidants - flavonoids. Chloroform extract and ramentaceone showed no antioxidative properties.
TI  - Neocitreamicins I and II, novel antibiotics with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci.
AB  - Two novel antibiotics, neocitreamicins I and II, were isolated from a fermentation broth of a Nocardia strain. This producing strain was obtained using an in situ diffusion chamber that facilitates the cultivation of soil microorganisms. The structures of neocitreamicins I and II were elucidated using UV, MS, and NMR data, and found to be related to the polycyclic xanthone antibiotics of the citreamicin class. The neocitreamicins showed in vitro activity against Gram-positive bacteria including strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - Infections in a surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital in Greece.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the clinical and microbiological characteristics of the patients who developed an infection in our surgical intensive care unit (SICU). METHODS: This was a prospective study of all patients who sustained an ICU-acquired infection from 2002 to 2004. RESULTS: Among 683 consecutive SICU patients, 123 (18.0%) developed 241 infections (48.3 infections per 1000 patient-days). The mean age of patients was 66.7+/-3.8 years, the mean APACHE II score (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) on SICU admission was 18.2+/-2.4, and the mean SOFA score (sepsis-related organ failure assessment) at the onset of infection was 8.8+/-2. Of the study patients, 51.2% were women. Infections were: bloodstream (36.1%), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP; 25.3%, 20.3/1000 ventilator-days), surgical site (18.7%), central venous catheter (10.4%, 7.1/1000 central venous catheter-days), and urinary tract infection (9.5%, 4.6/1000 urinary catheter-days). The most frequent microorganisms found were: Acinetobacter baumannii (20.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.7%), Candida albicans (13.2%), Enterococcus faecalis (10.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.2%), Enterococcus faecium (7.9%), and Staphylococcus aureus (6.7%). High resistance to the majority of antibiotics was identified. The complication and mortality rates were 58.5% and 39.0%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified APACHE II score on admission (odds ratio (OR) 4.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.69-5.26, p=0.01), peritonitis (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.03-3.25, p=0.03), acute pancreatitis (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.05-3.75, p=0.02), previous aminoglycoside use (OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.06-5.14, p=0.03), and mechanical ventilation (OR 3.26, 95% CI: 2.43-6.15, p=0.01) as risk factors for infection development. Age (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.01-1.33, p=0.03), APACHE II score on admission (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.77-3.41, p=0.02), SOFA score at the onset of infection (OR 2.88, 95% CI 1.85-4.02, p=0.02), and VAP (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04-1.85, p=0.03) were associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Infections are an important problem in SICUs due to high incidence, multi-drug resistance, complications, and mortality rate. In our study, APACHE II score on admission, peritonitis, acute pancreatitis, previous aminoglycoside use, and mechanical ventilation were identified as risk factors for infection development, whereas age, APACHE II score on admission, SOFA score at the onset of infection, and VAP were associated with mortality.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  - Human beta-defensin-3 (HBD3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. This study aimed to obtain recombinant HBD3 (rHBD3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of HBD3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. Genetic engineering was used to obtain active rHBD3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans. In an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rHBD3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. The ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. We conclude that HBD3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin against Gram-positive cocci: the first multicentre study in Greece.
AB  - A total of 10420 Gram-positive cocci (including staphylococci, enterococci and various groups of streptococci) collected from clinically significant specimens in ten Greek hospitals during 2006--2007 were tested for their susceptibility to daptomycin. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by the broth microdilution method. Daptomycin demonstrated very high activity against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC50) = 1mg/L and MIC at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC90) = 1.36 mg/L), Enterococcus faecium (MIC50 = 1.36 mg/L and MIC90 = 1.90 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC50 = 0.12 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.50mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC50 = 0.09 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC50 = 0.24 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.5 mg/L) and viridans group streptococci (MIC50 = 0.50 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.89 mg/L). Resistance to linezolid and vancomycin for enterococci and to penicillin for streptococci appears to be independent of reduced susceptibility to daptomycin. On the other hand, daptomycin was also active against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC50 = 0.44 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.78 mg/L) and meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC50 = 0.24 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.44 mg/L); however, 0.9% of the staphylococci tested had an MIC > 1mg/L, which is the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoint proposed for susceptibility. For all tested organism groups, resistance to daptomycin was not associated with glycopeptide resistance.
TI  - Lipids including cholesteryl linoleate and cholesteryl arachidonate contribute to the inherent antibacterial activity of human nasal fluid.
AB  - Mucosal surfaces provide first-line defense against microbial invasion through their complex secretions. The antimicrobial activities of proteins in these secretions have been well delineated, but the contributions of lipids to mucosal defense have not been defined. We found that normal human nasal fluid contains all major lipid classes (in micrograms per milliliter), as well as lipoproteins and apolipoprotein A-I. The predominant less polar lipids were myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acid, cholesterol, and cholesteryl palmitate, cholesteryl linoleate, and cholesteryl arachidonate. Normal human bronchioepithelial cell secretions exhibited a similar lipid composition. Removal of less-polar lipids significantly decreased the inherent antibacterial activity of nasal fluid against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was in part restored after replenishing the lipids. Furthermore, lipids extracted from nasal fluid exerted direct antibacterial activity in synergism with the antimicrobial human neutrophil peptide HNP-2 and liposomal formulations of cholesteryl linoleate and cholesteryl arachidonate were active against P. aeruginosa at physiological concentrations as found in nasal fluid and exerted inhibitory activity against other Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. These data suggest that host-derived lipids contribute to mucosal defense. The emerging concept of host-derived antimicrobial lipids unveils novel roads to a better understanding of the immunology of infectious diseases.
TI  - Novel and potent oxazolidinone antibacterials featuring 3-indolylglyoxamide substituents.
AB  - Novel oxazolidinone antibacterials bearing a variety of 3-indolylglyoxamide substituents have been explored in an effort to improve the spectrum and potency of this class of agents. A subclass of this series was also made with the diversity at C-5 terminus. These derivatives have been screened against a panel of clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens and fastidious Gram-negative organisms. Several analogs in this series were identified with in vitro activity superior to linezolid (MIC=0.25-2 microg/mL). Compounds 10a, 10c, 10e and 10f displayed activity against linezolid resistant Gram-positive organisms (MIC=2-4 microg/mL). Selected oxazolidinones were evaluated for in vivo efficacy against a mouse systemic infection model.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity of Co(II), Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes with N-benzyloxycarbonyl-S-phenylalanine.
AB  - In this paper the first complexes of M(2+) ions (M(2+) = Zn(2+), Cd(2+) and Co(2+)) with N-benzyloxycarbonyl-S-phenylalaninato ligand (1-3) are described. The new complexes were characterized by means of elemental analysis, IR and UV-vis spectroscopy, molar conductivity measurements and (1)H, (13)C and (15)N NMR spectroscopy (1D and 2D). The Co(II) complex adopts an octahedral geometry, and the Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes adopt a tetrahedral one. For the first time, the antimicrobial activity of N-benzyloxycarbonyl-S-phenylalaninato ligand (N-Boc-S-phe) and the complexes 1-3 was investigated against gram-positive: Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus subtilis and gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and two strains of the yeast Candida albicans. It was shown that the complexes were effective against most strains. The best activity was detected against the yeast C. albicans.
TI  - Antibacterial Activity of Barringtonia acutangula against Selected Urinary Tract  Pathogens.
AB  - Barringtonia acutangula (L.) Gaertn belonging to family Barringtoniaceae was investigated to evaluate In vitro antibacterial activity of aqueous, ethanolic, petroleum ether and chloroform extracts against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli the major urinary tract infection causing pathogens were tested by disc diffusion assay method and the minimum inhibitory concentration was evaluated. Ethanol (95%) extract exhibited broader spectrum of inhibition followed by chloroform, petroleum ether and aqueous extracts against the urinary tract pathogens under test. An attempt has been made to compare the activity of extracts with standard antibiotics against selected urinary tract infection causing pathogens.
TI  - Urinary infections due to multi-drug-resistant Escherichia coli among persons with HIV disease at a tertiary AIDS care centre in South India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: While the spectrum of opportunistic infections due to HIV infection has been widely discussed, there are very limited data available in south India on certain incident infections especially urinary tract infections (UTI) in HIV-infected subjects. METHODS: Bacterial aetiology of 350 symptomatic UTI in HIV-infected subjects and the drug resistance pattern of the Escherichia coli isolates tested between June 2005 and July 2007 at the YRG Centre for AIDS Research and Education, a tertiary HIV Referral Centre in Chennai has been described here. RESULTS: E. coli was the most common etiological agent of UTI in HIV patients, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus spp. and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Twenty-nine E. coli isolates were multi-drug-resistant and 83.3% of the isolates were resistant to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary pathogens in HIV-infected patients demonstrate high antimicrobial resistance and with majority of therapy for UTIs being empiric, constant updates of the aetiological agents and their drug susceptibility pattern would largely be beneficial to clinicians in choosing the right drug.
TI  - Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) accelerates identification of Gram-positive cocci in positive blood cultures.
AB  - Sepsis is a life-threatening disease with a high mortality rate. Rapid identification of blood culture isolates plays a crucial role in adequate antimicrobial therapy in sepsis patients. To accelerate microbiological diagnosis, a comprehensive panel of oligonucleotide probes for fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) targeting Gram-positive cocci was compiled and evaluated on 428 positive blood culture specimens. By combining genus-specific and species-specific probes, the assay allowed discrimination of staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci as well as differentiation of therapy-relevant pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium/durans. Furthermore, the newly designed FISH probes STREP2, ENCO and GRANU targeted Streptococcus pneumoniae/mitis, Enterococcus spp. (except E. faecalis) and Granulicatella adiacens group, respectively. The FISH assay achieved an overall sensitivity of 98.65% and a specificity of 99.0% and therefore allowed rapid and reliable molecular identification of Gram-positive cocci in blood culture specimens.
TI  - Differentiation of Streptococcus pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus [Pnc]) is a causative agent of many infectious diseases, including pneumonia, septicemia, otitis media, and conjunctivitis. There have been documented conjunctivitis outbreaks in which nontypeable (NT), nonencapsulated Pnc has been identified as the etiological agent. The use of mass spectrometry to comparatively and differentially analyze protein and peptide profiles of whole-cell microorganisms remains somewhat uncharted. In this report, we discuss a comparative proteomic analysis between NT S. pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak strains (cPnc) and other known typeable or NT pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates (including Pnc TIGR4 and R6, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes) and nonstreptococcal isolates (including Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus) as controls. cPnc cells and controls were grown to mid-log phase, harvested, and subsequently treated with a 10% trifluoroacetic acid-sinapinic acid matrix mixture. Protein and peptide fragments of the whole-cell bacterial isolate-matrix combinations ranging in size from 2 to 14 kDa were evaluated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Additionally Random Forest analytical tools and dendrogramic representations (Genesis) suggested similarities and clustered the isolates into distinct clonal groups, respectively. Also, a peak list of protein and peptide masses was obtained and compared to a known Pnc protein mass library, in which a peptide common and unique to cPnc isolates was tentatively identified. Information gained from this study will lead to the identification and validation of proteins that are commonly and exclusively expressed in cPnc strains which could potentially be used as a biomarker in the rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal conjunctivitis.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and antibacterial activity of some triazole Mannich bases carrying diphenylsulfone moieties.
AB  - A series of Mannich bases of 4-substituted 5-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl]-2,4-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiones, X=H, Cl, Br, 3 and 5 were synthesized and characterized on the basis of IR, NMR and elemental analyses. The potential antibacterial effects of the synthesized compounds were investigated using the Acinetobacter baumanii ATCC 19606; Citrobacter freundii ATCC 8090; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600; Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990; Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 strains. Some of them exhibited promising activities against A. baumanii and B. subtilis.
TI  - Surface antimicrobial activity and biocompatibility of incorporated polyethylenimine nanoparticles.
AB  - The antimicrobial effect and biocompatibility of insoluble cross-linked quaternary ammonium polyethylenimine (PEI) nanoparticles incorporated at 1 or 2%w/w in a resin composite were assayed. The antimicrobial effect against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli was tested using the direct contact test (DCT), agar diffusion test (ADT) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Biocompatibility was tested by assessing macrophage viability, and TNFalpha secretion. Samples incorporating 2%w/w nanoparticles inhibited the growth of all bacterial strains tested. Reducing the amount of the added nanoparticles to 1%w/w resulted in complete inhibition of S. aureus and E. faecalis, and decreased growth of S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa and E. coli (p<0.0001). The DCT results were confirmed by SEM. However, ADT showed no inhibition halo in all test bacteria, indicating the antimicrobial nanoparticles are not diffusing into the agar milieu. Biocompatibility tests revealed macrophage viability, and TNFalpha secretion was not altered by the presence of the nanoparticles in the resin. Incorporation of PEI nanoparticles in a resin composite had a long lasing antimicrobial effect against a wide range of bacteria with no measured effect on biocompatibility.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oil and major constituents of Salvia chloroleuca.
AB  - The aerial parts of Salvia chloroleuca were collected at full flowering stage at  Shahrestanak (Tehran province of Iran). The essential oil was isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by combination of capillary GC and GC-MS. Thirty-four components were identified, representing 98.5% of the total oil. beta-Pinene (10.6%), alpha-pinene (9.0%), beta-caryophyllene (9.0%), 1,8-cineole (9.0%) and carvacrol (7.9%) were the main components. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of S. chloroleuca was studied against seven Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger); the disc diffusion method and MIC values indicated that the oil exhibited moderate to high antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Pargamicin A, a novel cyclic peptide antibiotic from Amycolatopsis sp.
AB  - A novel cyclic peptide antibiotic, pargamicin A was isolated from the culture broth of an actinomycete strain. The producing organism, designated ML1-hF4, was identified as a member of the genus Amycolatopsis. Pargamicin A was identified as a novel cyclic hexapeptide antibiotic containing piperazic acid by various spectroscopic analyses. Pargamicin A showed potent antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus strains including MRSA and Enterococcus faecalis/faecium strains including VRE.
TI  - Mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  - The crude extract and the hexane, CH(2)Cl(2), EtOAc, n-BuOH, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of Mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of Leishmania (L. chagasi and L. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica sorovar Tythimurium, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). The antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. Phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. All samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. S. sonnei, B. cereus and C. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-BuOH and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. The lowest MIC was recorded for the CH(2)Cl(2) fraction against C. neoformans (MIC of 10 microg/ml), followed by B. cereus, S. sonnei, and E. cloacae (MIC of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). The CH(2)Cl(2) fraction was the most effective against L. chagasi (IC(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against L. amazonensis (IC(50) of 9 microg/ml). A cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and CH(2)Cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that M. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.
TI  - The in vitro pharmacological activities of 12 South African Hermannia species.
AB  - Hermannia species are widely used in traditional medicine in southern Africa, however no extensive study has been conducted on this genus. The acetone extracts of 12 indigenous Hermannia species (flowers, stems and leaves combined) were evaluated for various pharmacological activities. All investigated species displayed promising antimicrobial activity, with Hermannia saccifera being the most active against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC=19.5 microg/ml), Bacillus cereus (MIC=19.5 microg/ml) and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC=125 microg/ml). Time-kill studies on H. saccifera against S. aureus indicated bacteriostatic activity at 1.25, 2.5 and 5.0%, and a concentration of 7.5% achieved complete bactericidal activity after 4h. Ten of the 12 species indicated good free radical scavenging activity, with H. cuneifolia demonstrating the most promising activity in the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH():IC(50)=10.26 microg/ml) and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS(+)/TEAC: IC(50)=10.32 microg/ml) assays. In addition, all species exhibited moderate anti-inflammatory activity in the 5-lipoxygenase assay with the exception of H. cuneifolia (IC(50)=15.32 microg/ml). Overall, the selected species were low in cytotoxicity, except for H. saccifera and H. trifurca. Several Hermannia species indicated promising in vitro biological activity which relate to their traditional use in treating a number of disease states.
TI  - An in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of nine root canal sealers.
AB  - AIM: The purpose of this in vitro study was to analyze the antimicrobial activity of root canal sealers by using the agar diffusion test (ADT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Three categories of root canal sealers were included in the study: resin-based sealers (4), zinc oxide-based sealers (3), and calcium hydroxide-based sealers (2). The microbial strains used were: S. aureus (2 strains), C. albicans (2 strains), and E. faecalis (1 strain). Statistical analysis was conducted using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Tests of differences were analyzed using the Tukey's test with a value of p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The antimicrobial activity of root canal sealers was ranked in descending order as follows: Sealite Regular, Cortisemol, Dentalis KEZ, AH26, Sealapex, Acroseal/Topseal, and Endorez/AH plus. CONCLUSION: Root canal sealers showed different inhibitory effects depending on their types and the bacterial strains tested. Root canal sealers containing formaldehyde and eugenol proved to be effective against the microorganisms studied. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The incorporation of antimicrobial components into root canal sealers may become an essential factor in preventing the re-growth of residual bacteria and control of bacteria re-entry into the root canal system.
TI  - Bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus strains isolated from poto poto, a Congolese  fermented maize product, and genetic fingerprinting of their plantaricin operons.
AB  - Thirty one bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the Congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. Using species-specific PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as L. plantarum and L. fermentum, respectively. Cluster analysis of RAPD-PCR fingerprints revealed two main groups (G1 and G2) plus the L. fermentum isolate C4-13. Group G1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (G1-1, G1-2) each with several branches, plus the L. plantarum isolate C11. Group G2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. Using PCR amplification with specific primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in L. plantarum C11 were identified in the isolates. The number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. The L. fermentum isolate EC11 also contained the plnDEFG genes. PCR amplification of DNA from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with DNA from the control strain L. plantarum WCFS1. Amplification products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with HindIII, EcoRI and KpnI in separate reactions. Cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for EcoRI and HindII digest profiles, and an identical profile for all KpnI digests. The L. fermentum EC11 isolate clustered with L. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. The results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. However, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. Because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Thymus daenensis methanolic extract.
AB  - Medicinal plants are potential of antimicrobial compounds. The present study deals with the antibacterial activity of methanolic extract of Thymus daenensis. Aerial parts of the plant were collected from Alvand mountainside (Hamadan, Iran) in May 2005, air-dried and extracted by methanol. The dried extract was redissolved in methanol to make a 100 mg/ml solution and then filtered. Antibacterial activity of the extract was evaluated against various Gram-positive and Gram-negatives bacteria using disk diffusion technique. Blank paper disks were loaded with 40 microl of the methanol solution and then dried up. The impregnated disks were placed on Mueller-Hinton agar inoculated with bacterial suspension equal to 0.5 McFarland. The extract inhibited the growth Gram-positive bacteria, i.e., Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Entrococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, but it showed no activity against Gram-negative bacteria. The most significant effect was seen against S.aureus including MRSA, which are important nosocomial pathogens. MIC90 of the extract was determined against Gram-positive bacteria (3.12 mg/ml) and 11 MRSA strain (1.56 mg/ml).
TI  - Exploring 9-benzyl purines as inhibitors of glutamate racemase (MurI) in Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - An early SAR study of a screening hit series has generated a series of 9-benzyl purines as inhibitors of bacterial glutamate racemase (MurI) with micromolar enzyme potency and improved physical properties. X-ray co-crystal EI structures were obtained.
TI  - Newly defined in vitro quality control ranges for oritavancin broth microdilution testing and impact of variation in testing parameters.
AB  - A 9-laboratory M23-A2 quality control (QC) study was performed to evaluate reproducibility of oritavancin MICs against reference strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae using broth microdilution assays in the presence of polysorbate 80. Polysorbate 80 has previously been shown to be required for accurate measurement of oritavancin broth microdilution MICs. Greater than 95% of replicate results (n = 270/organism) fell within the following QC ranges (in micrograms per milliliter): S. aureus ATCC 29213, 0.015 to 0.12; E. faecalis ATCC 29212, 0.008 to 0.03; and S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619, 0.001 to 0.004. Oritavancin MIC QC ranges were, thus, narrow and reproducible. Parameters affecting testing results in the presence of polysorbate 80 were also evaluated. Oritavancin MICs were equivalent to or within 1 doubling dilution of those obtained under standard Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute testing conditions, regardless of incubation time (18, 24, or 48 h), Ca(2+) concentration, pH, or frozen panel storage time (up to 6 months).
TI  - In vitro antibacterial effects of topical local anesthetics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The antibacterial activities of local anesthetics are recognized. OBJECTIVE: To investigate in vitro the activity of topical local anesthetic ointments at clinical doses. METHODS: The activity of two different local anesthetic ointments including lidocaine 5% and lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5% was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis by the disc-diffusion method. Sterile discs containing topical local anesthetic drugs were prepared taking into account the doses of ointments used in clinical practice. The validity of the methodology was confirmed using topical antibacterial mupirocin. The inhibition zones of the discs were measured. RESULTS: Mupirocin inhibited all the bacteria. Both local anesthetic ointments were found to be most effective on E. coli, whereas they had no effects on P. aeruginosa. Lidocaine 5% revealed antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, S. pyogenes and E. faecalis, but lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5% showed no activity on E. faecalis and inhibited S. pyogenes only at double doses. It was also observed that the antibacterial activity was in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: In the light of these findings, it might be concluded that topical local anesthetic ointments in routine settings may have a preventive role against some bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of neuropeptides against a range of micro-organisms from skin, oral, respiratory and gastrointestinal tract sites.
AB  - Many neuropeptides are similar in size, amino acid composition and charge to antimicrobial peptides. This study aimed to determine whether the neuropeptides substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), displayed antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. SP, NPY, VIP and CGRP displayed variable degrees of antimicrobial activity against all the pathogens tested with the exception of S. aureus. These antimicrobial activities add a further dimension to the immunomodulatory roles for neuropeptides in the inflammatory and immune responses.
TI  - Infective endocarditis in an urban medical center: association of individual drugs with valvular involvement.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Injection drug users (IDUs) develop more right-sided infective endocarditis (IE) than non-IDUs, but it is not known whether this risk is specific to any particular injected drug. This study reviews the clinical characteristics of IE in an urban population and examines the association of drug type with manifestations of IE. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 247 cases of IE was analyzed. Demographic, clinical, microbiologic, and echocardiographic data were collected. RESULTS: Our cohort featured a 74% IDU rate, most with heroin. Staphylococcus aureus was the most prevalent organism. S. aureus IE was more likely to occur in IDUs versus non-IDUs (OR 5.5, p<0.0001). Enterococcus faecalis IE was less likely to occur in IDUs (OR 0.21, p=0.02). Tricuspid valve (TV) IE was more likely to occur in IDUs (OR 4.37, p=0.001), while mitral valve (MV) IE occurred less commonly in IDUs (OR 0.40, p=0.005). TV IE occurred more frequently in heroin users vs. IDUs not using heroin (OR 4.03, p=0.033). CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiology of IE in this cohort is different from that reported recently in other cohorts, likely due to the high prevalence of IDU. Heroin use may underlie the association between IDU and right-sided endocarditis.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens as evaluated by broth microdilution and Etest.
AB  - The current surveillance establishes the activity profile of tigecycline against  recent clinical U.S. isolates of target pathogens. Findings from a distributed surveillance that utilized Etest yielded a tigecycline activity profile that varied from that observed in a separate centralized broth microdilution (BMD) surveillance (D. C. Draghi et al., Poster D-0701, 46th Intersci. Conf. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., San Francisco, CA). Differences were noted among Acinetobacter spp. and Serratia marcescens and, to a lesser extent, with Streptococcus pyogenes. To address whether these differences were due to discordance in testing methodology or to variations among the analyzed populations, isolates from the current surveillance were concurrently tested by BMD and Etest. In all, 1,800 Staphylococcus aureus, 259 S. pyogenes, 226 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 93 Enterococcus faecalis, 1,356 Enterobacteriaceae, and 227 Acinetobacter baumannii strains were evaluated. Tigecycline had potent activity by BMD, with >99.6% susceptibility (%S) observed for all pathogens with interpretive criteria, excluding Enterobacter cloacae (98.3% S) and E. faecalis (86.0% S), and MIC(90)s ranged from 0.03 mug/ml (S. pyogenes/S. pneumoniae) to 1 mug/ml (Enterobacteriaceae/A. baumannii). Similar profiles were observed by Etest, with the exception of A. baumannii, although for most evaluated pathogens Etest MICs trended one doubling-dilution higher than BMD MICs. Major or very major errors were infrequent, and a high degree of essential agreement was observed, excluding A. baumannii, S. marcescens, and S. pneumoniae, for which >/=4-fold differences in MICs were observed for 29, 27.1, and 34% of the isolates, respectively. Further analysis regarding the suitability of the tigecycline Etest for testing S. marcescens, Acinetobacter spp., and S. pneumoniae is warranted.
TI  - A novel transposon, Tn6009, composed of a Tn916 element linked with a Staphylococcus aureus mer operon.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize a novel conjugative transposon Tn6009 composed of a Tn916 linked to a Staphylococcus aureus mer operon in representative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria isolated in Nigeria and Portugal. METHODS: Eighty-three Gram-positive and 34 Gram-negative bacteria were screened for the presence of the Tn6009 using DNA-DNA hybridization, PCR, hybridization of PCR products, sequencing and mating experiments by established procedures. RESULTS: Forty-three oral and 23 urine Gram-negative and Gram-positive isolates carried the Tn6009. Sequencing was performed to verify the direct linkage between the mer resistance genes and the tet(M) gene. A Nigerian Klebsiella pneumoniae, isolated from a urinary tract infection patient, and one commensal isolate from each of the other Tn6009-positive genera, Serratia liquefaciens, Pseudomonas sp., Enterococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp. isolated from the oral and urine samples of healthy Portuguese children, were able to act as donors and conjugally transfer the Tn6009 to the Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 recipient, resulting in tetracycline- and mercury-resistant E. faecalis transconjugants. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports a novel non-composite conjugative transposon Tn6009 containing a Tn916 element linked to an S. aureus mer operon carrying genes coding for inorganic mercury resistance (merA), an organic mercury resistance (merB), a regulatory protein (merR) and a mercury transporter (merT). This transposon was identified in 66 isolates from two Gram-positive and three Gram-negative genera and is the first transposon in the Tn916 family to carry the Gram-positive mer genes directly linked to the tet(M) gene.
TI  - Flow cytometry as a rapid test for detection of penicillin resistance directly in bacterial cells in Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - We studied the usefulness of flow cytometry for detection of penicillin resistance in E. faecalis and S. aureus by direct binding of commercially available fluorescent penicillin, Bocillin FL, to cells obtained from culture. There were significantly lower percentages of fluorescent cells and median and mean fluorescence values per particle in penicillin-resistant than in penicillin-sensitive strains of both species observed. The method allows rapid detection of penicillin resistance in S. aureus and E. faecalis. The results encourage further investigations on the detection of antibiotic resistance in bacteria using flow cytometry.
TI  - Ceftobiprole: a review of a broad-spectrum and anti-MRSA cephalosporin.
AB  - Ceftobiprole, an investigational cephalosporin, is currently in phase III clinical development. Ceftobiprole is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with demonstrated in vitro activity against Gram-positive cocci, including meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and meticillin-resistant S. epidermidis, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Gram-negative bacilli including AmpC-producing Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but excluding extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. Like cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime, ceftobiprole demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis and non-fragilis Bacteroides spp. In single-step and serial passage in vitro resistance development studies, ceftobiprole demonstrated a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. Ceftobiprole, like cefepime, is a weak inducer and a poor substrate for AmpC beta-lactamases.Ceftobiprole medocaril, the prodrug of ceftobiprole, is converted by plasma esterases to ceftobiprole in <30 minutes. Peak serum concentrations of ceftobiprole observed at the end of a single 30-minute infusion were 35.5 mug/mL for a 500-mg dose and 59.6 mug/mL for a 750-mg dose. The volume of distribution of ceftobiprole is 0.26 L/kg ( approximately 18 L), protein binding is 16%, and its serum half-life is approximately 3.5 hours. Ceftobiprole is renally excreted ( approximately 70% in the active form) and systemic clearance correlates with creatinine clearance, meaning that dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal dysfunction. Ceftobiprole has a modest post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of approximately 0.5 hours for MRSA and a longer PAE of approximately 2 hours for penicillin-resistant pneumococci. Ceftobiprole, when administered intravenously at 500 mg once every 8 hours (2-hour infusion), has a >90% probability of achieving f T(>MIC) (free drug concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]) for 40% and 60%, respectively, of the dosing interval for isolates with ceftobiprole MIC < or =4 and < or =2 mg/L, respectively.Currently, only limited clinical trial data are published for ceftobiprole. In a phase III trial, 784 patients with Gram-positive skin infections were randomized to treatment with either ceftobiprole 500 mg or vancomycin 1 g, each administered twice daily for 7-14 days; 93.3% of patients were clinically cured with ceftobiprole compared with 93.5% receiving vancomycin, and the eradication rate for MRSA infections was 91.8% for ceftobiprole compared with 90% for vancomycin. A phase III, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial compared ceftobiprole 500 mg every 8 hours with vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours plus ceftazidime 1 g every 8 hours in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections. Of the 828 patients enrolled, 31% had diabetic foot infections, 30% had abscesses, and 22% had wounds. No difference in clinical cure was reported in the clinically evaluable, intent-to-treat and microbiologically evaluable populations with cure rates of 90.5%, 81.9%, and 90.8%, respectively, in the ceftobiprole-treated patients and 90.2%, 80.8%, and 90.5%, respectively, in the vancomycin plus ceftazidime-treated group. Microbiologic eradication of Gram-positive cocci meticillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) [ceftobiprole 91% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 92%] and MRSA (ceftobiprole 87% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 80%), as well as Gram-negative bacilli, E. coli (ceftobiprole 89% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 92%), and P. aeruginosa (ceftobiprole 87% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 100%), was not significantly different between groups. Similar cures rates in the microbiologically evaluable population occurred in both groups for Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-positive MSSA and PVL-positive MRSA.Currently, ceftobiprole has completed phase III trials for complicated skin and skin structure infections due to MRSA and nosocomial pneumonia due to suspected or proven MRSA; phase III trials are also ongoing in community-acquired pneumonia. Ceftobiprole has so far demonstrated a good safety profile in preliminary studies with similar tolerability to comparators. The broad-spectrum activity of ceftobiprole may allow it to be used as monotherapy in situations where a combination of antibacterials might be required. Further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftobiprole and to define its role in patient care.
TI  - Frequencies of resistance to Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil and rifampicin in Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - This study was conducted to determine the frequencies at which single-step mutants resistant to tea tree oil and rifampicin occurred amongst the Gram-positive organisms Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis. For tea tree oil, resistance frequencies were very low at <10(-9). Single-step mutants resistant to tea tree oil were undetectable at two times the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for S. aureus RN4220 and derivative mutator strains or at 3 x MIC for the remaining S. aureus strains, including a clinical meticillin-resistant S. aureus isolate. Similarly, no mutants were recovered at 2x MIC for S. epidermidis or at 1x MIC for E. faecalis. Resistance frequencies determined in vitro for rifampicin (8 x MIC) ranged from 10(-7) to 10(-8) for all isolates, with the exception of the S. aureus mutator strains, which had slightly higher frequencies. These data suggest that Gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus and Enterococcus spp. have very low frequencies of resistance to tea tree oil.
TI  - The culture site of the gallbladder affects recovery of bacteria in symptomatic cholelithiasis.
AB  - AIM: Traditional methods for bile culturing may miss a large number of underlying bacterial infections that could lead to acute or chronic cholecystitis. AIM: to evaluate possible differences regarding the site of material collection and thus to detect the most suitable sample site for gallbladder culture. METHODS: A cohort of 137 patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis was enrolled. After surgical excision of the gallbladder, bile cultures were separately performed from fundus, body and neck. Identification of bacteria as well as computation of mean bacterial concentrations were performed with standard microbiological techniques. Wilcoxon's paired and Chi-square tests were used for comparison between continuous and discrete parameters, respectively. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (22.6%) demonstrated at least one positive culture sample. Positivity was 31/31 (100.0%) in neck samples, 20/31 (64.5%) in body and 13/31 (41.9%) in fundus samples (P<0.001). The microorganisms identified were Escherichia coli (14 cases) and Enterococcus faecalis (10 cases), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (3 cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae (1 case each). Mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the neck (272.2 +/- 187.5) were higher (P<0.01) when compared to those derived from both the body (38.2 +/- 28.7) and the fundus (12.5 +/- 11.3). Mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the body were higher (P<0.01) than those derived from the fundus. CONCLUSION: The neck of the gallbladder hosts the biggest bacterial load in comparison with the body and the fundus. This difference might be attributed to the presence of Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses, which is the main histological characteristic of the region.
TI  - Cytotoxic and antibacterial sesquiterpenes from Thespesia populnea.
AB  - Eight new sesquiterpenoids, named populene A-H (1-8), were isolated from dichloromethane extracts of the wood and dark heartwood of Thespesia populnea, together with 11 known compounds (9-19). Their structures were determined on the basis of spectroscopic analyses. The cytotoxic activity of isolated compounds was evaluated against four cancer cell lines: MCF-7, HeLa, HT-29, and KB. Mansonone E (11) and (+)-gossypol (18) showed significant activities. Their antibacterial properties against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis are also presented.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Brazilian copaiba oils obtained from different species  of the Copaifera genus.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of copaiba oils was tested against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, yeast, and dermatophytes. Oils obtained from Copaifera martii, Copaifera officinalis, and Copaifera reticulata (collected in the state of Acre) were active against Gram-positive species (Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterococcus faecalis) with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 31.3-62.5 microg/ml. The oils showed bactericidal activity, decreasing the viability of these Gram-positive bacteria within 3 h. Moderate activity was observed against dermatophyte fungi (Trichophyton rubrum and Microsporum canis). The oils showed no activity against Gram-negative bacteria and yeast. Scannning electron microscopy of S. aureus treated with resin oil from C. martii revealed lysis of the bacteria, causing cellular agglomerates. Transmission electron microscopy revealed disruption and damage to the cell wall, resulting in the release of cytoplasmic compounds, alterations in morphology, and a decrease in cell volume, indicating that copaiba oil may affect the cell wall.
TI  - Asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients with diabetes mellitus in Ile-Ife, South-West, Nigeria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence and associates of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in a sample of Nigerian diabetic patients. DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive and analytic study. SETTING: The Wesley Guild Hospital and Ife State Hospital, both units of Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. SUBJECTS: One hundred and thirty five diabetic patients and 57 non-diabetic patients as controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic parameters of participants were recorded. Significant bacteriuria was determined for each of the mid-stream urine specimen obtained from all the subjects. Organisms isolated were identified and evaluated for antibiotic susceptibility patterns. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the prevalence of ASB in the two groups. Prevalence of ASB was 16% and 3.5% in the diabetic patients and control respectively (p=0.03). Demographic parameters except age were not related to the presence of ASB. ASB was found in 54.4% of diabetic patients with poor glycaemia control compared with 2.9% in diabetics with good glycaemia control (p = 0.006). Organisms associated with ASB were Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella sp, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, however the most predominant was Staphylococcus aureus. These organisms were largely resistant to the common antibiotics tested such as cotrimoxazole and gentamicin but susceptible to nitrofurantoin. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of ASB is high in diabetic patients and poor glucose control can be considered a predisposing factor.
TI  - Attachment of ampicillin to expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene): surface reactions leading to inhibition of microbial growth.
AB  - The broad spectrum antibiotic, ampicillin (AM), was reacted to expanded poly (tetrafluoroethylene) (ePTFE) surfaces and resulted in the formation of antimicrobial surfaces effective against gram-positive, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Enterococcus faecalis, and gram-negative, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Salmonella enterica bacteria. These ePTFE surface modifications were accomplished by utilization of microwave maleic anhydride (MA) plasma reactions leading to the formation of acid groups, followed by amidation reactions of heterofunctional NH 2/COOH-terminated polyethylene glycol (PEG). The final step, the attachment of AM to the PEG spacer, was achieved by amidation reactions between COOH-terminated PEG and NH 2 groups of AM. This approach protects the COOH-AM functionality and diminishes the possibility of hydrolysis of the antimicrobial active portion of AM. These studies also show that approximately 90% of AM molecules are still covalently attached to PEG-MA-ePTFE surfaces after exposure to the bacteria solutions. Even after a 24 h period, the AM volume concentration changes only from 2.25 to 2.04 microg/m3, and depending upon the bacteria type, the bacteria suspensions containing AM-PEG-MA-ePTFE specimens retain 85-99% of their initial optical density.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of antibacterial, antioxidant, cytotoxic and apoptotic activities of the tubers infusion and extracts of Cyperus rotundus.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial, antioxidant, cytotoxic and apoptotic activities from  tubers extracts of Cyperus rotundus (Cyperaceae) were investigated. Antibacterial activity of different extracts was evaluated against five bacterial reference strains. A marked inhibitory effect was observed against Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis with total oligomers flavonoids (TOFs) and ethyl acetate extracts. In addition to their antibacterial activity, the same extracts showed a significant ability to inhibit nitroblue tetrazolium reduction by the superoxide radical in a non-enzymatic superoxide generating system. Apoptosis, a highly organized physiological mechanism to eliminate injured or abnormal cells, is also implicated in multistage carcinogenesis. It was observed that TOF and ethyl acetate extracts suppressed growth and proliferation of L1210 cells derived from murine lymphoblastic leukaemia. Morphological features of treated cells and characteristic DNA fragmentation revealed that the cytotoxicity was due to induction of apoptosis. This study confirms that TOF and ethyl acetate extracts of C.rotundus possess antibacterial and antioxidant properties and provoke DNA fragmentation, a sign of induction of apoptosis. These results were correlated with chemical composition of the tested extracts.
TI  - Emergence of macrolide resistance gene mph(B) in Streptococcus uberis and cooperative effects with rdmC-like gene.
AB  - Streptococcus uberis UCN60 was resistant to spiramycin (MIC = 8 microg/ml) but susceptible to erythromycin (MIC = 0.06 microg/ml), azithromycin (MIC = 0.12 microg/ml), josamycin (MIC = 0.25 microg/ml), and tylosin (MIC = 0.5 microg/ml). A 2.5-kb HindIII fragment was cloned from S. uberis UCN60 DNA on plasmid pUC18 and introduced into Escherichia coli AG100A, where it conferred resistance to spiramycin by inactivation. The sequence analysis of the fragment showed the presence of an rdmC-like gene that putatively encoded a protein belonging to the alpha/beta hydrolase family and of the first 196 nucleotides of the mph(B) gene putatively encoding a phosphotransferase known to inactivate 14-, 15-, and 16-membered macrolides in E. coli. The entire mph(B) gene was then identified in S. uberis UCN60. The two genes were expressed alone or in combination in E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Analysis of MICs revealed that rdmC-like alone did not confer resistance to erythromycin, tylosin, and josamycin in those three hosts. It conferred resistance to spiramycin in E. coli and E. faecalis but not in S. aureus. mph(B) conferred resistance in E. coli to erythromycin, tylosin, josamycin, and spiramycin but only low levels of resistance in E. faecalis and S. aureus to spiramycin (MIC = 8 microg/ml). The combination of mph(B) and rdmC-like genes resulted in a resistance to spiramycin and tylosin in the three hosts that significantly exceeded the mere addition of the resistance levels conferred by each resistance mechanism alone.
TI  - [Influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial  susceptibility test results by the automated microbial systems].
AB  - The influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results was evaluated for the three automated microbial systems, WalkAway-40 (Dade MicroScan, West Sacramento, CA, USA), VITEK 2 Compact (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) and RAISUS (Nissui Pharmaceutical, Tokyo). In the evaluation, two different species or two different strains were mixed in serial ratios and adjusted to the inoculum cell suspension for the respective systems, and then tested for the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. For the species-identification, all the three automated systems experienced incorrect identifications others from the species inoculated with higher likelihoods (> 90%), e.g. Enterobacter cloacae plus Klebsiella pneumoniae resulted in K. ornithinolytica or E. aerogenes with 93% to 97% likelihoods at the mixing ratio 9 to 1. Whereas, the mixings extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and non-producing Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant (VR) and vancomycin-susceptible (VS) Enterococcus faecalis, always resulted in correct detection of a small portion of resistant cells. However, minimum ratios of resistant cells for the correct detection varied by the systems, that is, RAISUS required 70% of MRSA, VITEK 2 Compact was 8%, and the WalkAway-40 was 1%. Also, when the cell suspension of VS E. faecalis spiked with Proteus mirabilis was tested, the WalkAway-40 reported as being very rare biotype, but both VITEK 2 Compact and RAISUS reported as the test inoculum being VR E. faecalis. With these results, it can be concluded that: First, incorrect species-identifications others from the inoculated species easily occur when the inoculum contains different species even at the ratio visibly indiscernible on the primary isolation agar plate. Secondly, the automated microbial systems always intend to detect antimicrobial resistant cells in the inoculum rather than to detect major susceptible cells to prevent us from reporting very major error interpretation.
TI  - Risk factors for major infections in Wegener granulomatosis: analysis of 113 patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterise major infectious complications and analyse potential risk factors in patients with Wegener granulomatosis (WG). METHODS: Data from 113 patients with WG (69 male) followed at least once between January 1984 and March 2006 in our internal medicine department, were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 35 patients (mean (SD) age at WG diagnosis: 50.2 (13.05) years) developed 53 major infections. Infections were: bronchopneumonias (n = 19), herpes zoster recurrences (n = 9), cellulitis (n = 4), prostatitis (n = 4), spondylodiscitis and septic arthritis (n = 3), digestive tract infections (n = 2), Enterococcus faecalis or Staphylococcus aureus septicaemia (n = 2), viral hepatitis B reactivations (n = 2), post transfusion HIV infection with fatal cerebral toxoplasmosis, oesophageal candidiasis, disseminated herpes simplex and cytomegalovirus infection, cytomegalovirus retinitis, herpetic keratitis, herpetic stomatitis, Serratia sp. node suppuration and fever resolving under broad spectrum antibiotics (n = 1 each). Half of the major infectious episodes occurred within 3 years after WG diagnosis. Eight (7%) patients died, with two (2%) infection-related deaths. Patients diagnosed with WG before 1996 had a significantly higher rate of infection than those diagnosed later (48% vs 24%, p = 0.02). Cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids were independently associated with significantly higher risk of major infection (p<0.05 and <0.001, respectively). All patients treated since 1993 received antipneumocystosis prophylaxis. CONCLUSION: Cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids were associated with higher risk of infection. Despite systematic cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, major infections, mostly bronchopneumonias and herpes zoster recurrences, were still common in the course of WG.
TI  - Method for evaluation of the efficacy of antimicrobial preservatives in cosmetic  wet wipes.
AB  - Many cosmetic formulations are now available in the form of wet wipes packaged in sealed sachets or packets. Like the majority of cosmetic products having an aqueous phase, wipes are susceptible to microbial contamination and require the addition of preservatives. The efficacy of such preservatives can be evaluated using a standard challenge test performed on the wetting liquid but this test cannot be regarded as representative for this new type of formulation. The method presented here evaluates the efficacy of preservatives used in wet wipes kept in their original packaging. Dried inoculums were prepared by membrane filtration followed by drying in an incubator. The method is applicable to bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis), Bacillus cereus spores and fungi (Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger). These inoculated carriers were inserted between two wipes in the original package, which was then re-sealed immediately. The test requires one dry inoculum per packet and one packet for each control or test. After incubation at 22.5 degrees C for 1, 2, 7, 14 or 28 days and, for the control, immediately after insertion of the membrane (time 0), microorganism counts were performed on the germ-carrier membranes as well as on adjacent wipes, after transfer into a suitable neutralizing agent. The membranes were shaken in the presence of glass beads and microorganisms were dissociated from the wipes by means of a Stomacher. The supernatants recovered after being left to stand for 20 min are counted by pour plate method or membrane filtration. The feasibility of the method was demonstrated for each of the seven above-mentioned strains. The repeatability and reproducibility of the results obtained is similar to that obtained for preservative efficacy tests in the Pharmacopoeias. The lethal rate of microorganisms during the preparation of dry inoculums ranges from 50 to 90% depending on the strain and the test (generally, a spontaneous reduction of about 1 log up to a maximum of 2 log). The recovery rate for microorganisms from dry inoculums (on membranes) at time 0 (control = T(0)) is around 90%, regardless of the strain or the test. The number of microorganisms recovered from the wipes (W(0)) is between 2 and 10% of the number recovered from membranes (T(0)) and may be considered negligible. Application of this method to different types of wipes demonstrates that the efficacy of preservatives, expressed as the logarithmic reduction in the number of microorganisms at each time point, depends on the type of wipe and on the strain tested. The results obtained are considerably different from those found with the standard challenge tests applied to wetting liquids for wipes. The differences found confirm the need for a specific method applicable to wipes.
TI  - Detection of Blastocystis from stool samples using real-time PCR.
AB  - We developed a real-time LC PCR assay to detect a 152 bp sequence in an uncharacterized region of the Blastocystis genome. The described assay detected 11 of 11 ATCC strains of Blastocystis from subtypes 1, 3, and 4. Three of three stool samples from Oregon and California military personnel that were negative for Blastocystis by an ova and parasite test as well as a conventional PCR assay were positive for Blastocystis using our real-time LC PCR assay. Diagnosis of Blastocystis infections using this sensitive method, including DNA extraction and real-time PCR, only requires 3 h. The lower limit of detection for Blastocystis in stool using the real-time LC PCR assay was calculated to be 760 cells of Blastocystis per 100 mg of stool, an estimated 760 parasites per reaction. The assay did not cross-react with Ruminococcus hansenii, Anarococcus hydrogenalis, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, or Lactobacillus acidophilus. Because of the ease of use, sensitivity, specificity, and increase in Blastocystis infections in the USA we believe this assay has the potential to be useful as a clinical diagnosis tool of Blastocystis infection.
TI  - A functional gene array for detection of bacterial virulence elements.
AB  - Emerging known and unknown pathogens create profound threats to public health. Platforms for rapid detection and characterization of microbial agents are critically needed to prevent and respond to disease outbreaks. Available detection technologies cannot provide broad functional information about known or novel organisms. As a step toward developing such a system, we have produced and tested a series of high-density functional gene arrays to detect elements of virulence and antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Our first generation array targets genes from Escherichia coli strains K12 and CFT073, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. We determined optimal probe design parameters for gene family detection and discrimination. When tested with organisms at varying phylogenetic distances from the four target strains, the array detected orthologs for the majority of targeted gene families present in bacteria belonging to the same taxonomic family. In combination with whole-genome amplification, the array detects femtogram concentrations of purified DNA, either spiked in to an aerosol sample background, or in combinations from one or more of the four target organisms. This is the first report of a high density NimbleGen microarray system targeting microbial antibiotic resistance and virulence mechanisms. By targeting virulence gene families as well as genes unique to specific biothreat agents, these arrays will provide important data about the pathogenic potential and drug resistance profiles of unknown organisms in environmental samples.
TI  - Ceftobiprole: an extended-spectrum anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize and evaluate the literature concerning ceftobiprole. DATA SOURCES: Literature identification was conducted through MEDLINE (1966-February 2008) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-February 2008) using the terms ceftobiprole, medocaril, BAL 5788, RO-5788, BAL 9141, RO 63-9141, pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, MRSA, complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSIs), community-acquired pneumonia, and nosocomial pneumonia. Additional publications were identified through a review of articles and abstracts from infectious disease meetings. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All articles in English were evaluated and all pertinent information was included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Ceftobiprole medocaril is an extended-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp., vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Inactivity includes extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus faecium. Preliminary data suggest that ceftobiprole may be effective with a 1-hour infusion of 500 mg every 12 hours for gram-positive infections and 500 mg every 8 hours with a 2-hour infusion for polymicrobial infections. Two clinical trials support these dosing regimens for cSSSIs. Ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin in suspected gram-positive cSSSIs, with cure rates of 93.3% and 93.5%, respectively. Furthermore, ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin and ceftazidime in polymicrobial cSSSIs (cure rates 90.5% vs 90.2%, respectively). Although the total number of adverse effects was similar to those of the comparator, more patients in the ceftobiprole group experienced nausea, vomiting, and dysgeusia. CONCLUSIONS: The activity of ceftobiprole and limited clinical data suggest that it may be useful as empiric monotherapy for cSSSI and in combination with other antimicrobials in lower respiratory tract infections for which Phase 3 clinical trials are currently exploring. Although not shown in vitro, ceftobiprole may induce resistance due to its broad spectrum of activity. Approval is expected for the treatment of cSSSI.
TI  - Characteristics of an environmental strain, Enterococcus faecalis CECT7121, and its effects as additive on craft dry-fermented sausages.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria are the most adequate microorganisms for natural preservation of food. In the present work, the strain of Enterococcus faecalis CECT7121 was employed in the manufacture of craft dry-fermented sausages and its performance as a biopreservative was analysed. This strain is devoid of the genes for haemolysin and gelatinase and does not produce biogenic amines. It is sensitive to almost all the antibiotics tested and opsonophagocytic assays showed that it is devoid of a capsule. This strain had a high LD50 (10(11)CFU ml(-1)) in mice. No statistical differences were found between control and sausages inoculated with E. faecalis CECT7121 regarding the production of lactic acid, pH variation over time, reaching a minimum pH value of 5.1, and sensory analysis in both series. Sausages inoculated with E. faecalis CECT7121 had lower viable counts of Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus and other Gram-positive cocci at the end of fermentation and 7 days and no viable enterobacteria and S. aureus were recovered at the end of drying. E. faecalis CECT7121 did not affect the growth of Lactobacillus spp. but it displaced the autochthonous populations of enterococci. E. faecalis CECT7121 was recovered in each time point as assessed by its inhibitory activity on Listeria monocytogenes and S. aureus. These results would indicate that the addition of E. faecalis CECT7121 during the manufacture of craft dry-fermented sausages offers an interesting alternative for biopreservation.
TI  - The antimicrobial and antifungal efficacy of tetracycline-integrated gutta-percha.
AB  - The purpose of this study was in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial and antifungal efficacy of commercially available gutta-percha containing tetracycline on some potential endodontic pathogens. The test microorganisms were Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Candida albicans . Tetracycline-integrated gutta-percha (TGP) cones, tetracycline disc, and conventional gutta-percha cones of the same size were placed on the inoculated plates. The plates were incubated at 37 degrees C aerobically or anaerobically. Growth inhibition zones on each plate were inspected at 24, 48, and 72 h. Tetracycline disc and TGP cones inhibited all the tested bacterial strains, however the greatest antimicrobial effect was seen on S. aureus. Tetracycline disc and TGP seemed less effective on E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa. However, all tested treatments were unable to affect C. albicans . Based on the results of this study, it seems that TGP offers an antimicrobial advantage over conventional gutta-percha.
TI  - Healthcare-associated infections in Finnish acute care hospitals: a national prevalence survey, 2005.
AB  - The objectives of the first national prevalence survey on healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in Finland were to assess the extent of HAI, distribution of HAI types, causative organisms, prevalence of predisposing factors and use of antimicrobial agents. The voluntary survey was performed during February-March 2005 in 30 hospitals, including tertiary and secondary care hospitals and 10 (25%) other acute care hospitals in the country. The overall prevalence of HAI was 8.5% (703/8234). Surgical site infection was the most common HAI (29%), followed by urinary tract infection (19%) and primary bloodstream infection or clinical sepsis (17%). HAI prevalence was higher in males, among intensive care and surgical patients, and increased with age and severity of underlying illness. The most common causative organisms, identified in 56% (398/703) of patients with HAIs, were Escherichia coli (13%), Staphylococcus aureus (10%) and Enterococcus faecalis (9%). HAIs caused by multi-resistant microbes were rare (N = 6). A total of 122 patients were treated in contact isolation due to the carriage of multi-resistant microbes. At the time of the survey, 19% of patients had a urinary catheter, 6% central venous line and 1% were ventilated. Antimicrobial treatment was given to 39% of patients. These results can be used for prioritising infection control measures and planning more detailed incidence surveillance of HAI. The survey was a useful tool to increase the awareness of HAI in participating hospitals and to train infection control staff in diagnosing HAIs.
TI  - Frequency and expression of mutacin biosynthesis genes in isolates of Streptococcus mutans with different mutacin-producing phenotypes.
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyse the frequency and expression of biosynthesis genes in 47 Streptococcus mutans isolates with different mutacin-producing phenotypes. Detection of the frequency and expression of genes encoding mutacin types I, II, III and IV were carried out by PCR and semi-quantitative RT-PCR, respectively, using primers specific for each type of biosynthesis gene. In addition, a further eight genes encoding putative bacteriocins, designated bsm 283, bsm 299, bsm 423, bsm 1889c, bsm 1892c, bsm 1896, bsm 1906c and bsm 1914, were also screened. There was a high phenotypic diversity; some Streptococcus mutans isolates presented broad antimicrobial spectra against other Streptococcus mutans clinical isolates, including bacteria resistant to common antibiotics, as well as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes. The expression frequency of the bsm gene was higher than that of the previously characterized mutacins (I-IV). There was no positive correlation between the number of indicator strains inhibited (antimicrobial spectra) and the number of biosynthesis genes expressed (Spearman correlation test, r=-0.03, P>0.05). In conclusion, the high diversity of mutacin-producing phenotypes, associated with high frequency of expression of the biosynthesis genes screened, reveals a broad repertoire of genetic determinants encoding antimicrobial peptides that can act in different combinations.
TI  - Multiplex polymerase chain reaction detection enhancement of bacteremia and fungemia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for simultaneous detection of multiple organisms in bloodstream infections. METHODS: Prospective observational study at the University of California Davis Medical Center (Sacramento, CA). Two hundred adult (>18 yrs) patients from the emergency room, intensive care units, and general medicine wards at risk of a bloodstream infection and who manifested signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Whole blood samples for PCR testing were collected at the same time as blood culture (BC). PCR results were compared to blood and other culture results. RESULTS: PCR detected potentially significant bacteria and fungi in 45 cases compared to 37 by BC. PCR detected the methicillin resistance (mecA) gene in all three culture-confirmed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus cases. More than 68% of PCR results were confirmed by blood, urine, and catheter culture. Independent clinical arbitrators could not rule out the potential clinical significance of organism(s) detected by PCR, but not by BC. PCR did not detect Enterococcus faecalis in five BC-confirmed cases. On average, seven patient samples could be tested simultaneously with the PCR method in 6.54 +/- .27 hrs. CONCLUSIONS: Multiplex PCR detected potentially significant bacteria and fungi that were not found by BC. BC found organisms that were not detected by PCR. Despite limitations of both BC and PCR methods, PCR could serve as an adjunct to current culture methods to facilitate early detection of bloodstream infections. Early detection of microorganisms has the potential to facilitate evidence-based treatment decisions, antimicrobial selection, and adequacy of antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - BMAP-28 improves the efficacy of vancomycin in rat models of gram-positive cocci  ureteral stent infection.
AB  - An experimental study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of BMAP-28 alone and in combination with vancomycin in animal models ureteral stent infection due to Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. Study included a control group without bacterial challenge to evaluate the sterility of surgical procedure, a challenged control group that did not receive any antibiotic prophylaxis and for each bacterial strain three challenged groups that received (a) 10 mg/kg vancomycin intraperitoneally, immediately after stent implantation, (b) BMAP-28-coated ureteral stents where 0.2-cm(2) sterile ureteral stents were incubated in 1mg/l BMAP-28 solution for 30 min immediately before implantation and (c) intraperitoneal vancomycin plus BMAP-28-coated ureteral stent at the above concentrations. Experiments were performed in duplicate. Ureteral stents were explanted at day 5 following implantation and biofilm bacteria enumerated. Our data showed that rats that received intraperitoneal vancomycin showed the lowest bacterial numbers. BMAP-28 combined with vancomycin showed efficacies higher than that of each single compound. These results highlight the potential usefulness of this combination in preventing ureteral stent-associated in gram-positive infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of telavancin against recent Gram-positive clinical isolates: results of the 2004-05 Prospective European Surveillance Initiative.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Telavancin is a novel semi-synthetic lipoglycopeptide currently in late-stage clinical development for the treatment of serious infections due to Gram-positive bacteria. The objective of this study was to provide a baseline prospective assessment of its in vitro activity against a large and diverse collection of Gram-positive clinical isolates from Europe and Israel. METHODS: Gram-positive clinical isolates, collected between October 2004 and December 2005 from 36 hospital laboratories in 15 countries, were tested by broth microdilution using CLSI methodology. RESULTS: In total, 3206 isolates were collected. Telavancin had potent activity against Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC range < or =0.015 to 2 mg/L), independent of resistance to methicillin or to multiple drugs. Telavancin had particularly strong activity against streptococcal isolates (MIC range < or =0.001 to 0.5 mg/L), including penicillin-resistant and multiple drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and erythromycin non-susceptible beta-haemolytic and viridans group streptococci. Telavancin also had excellent activity against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (MIC(90) 0.5 mg/L), and although its MICs were elevated against VanA strains (Enterococcus faecalis MIC(90) 8 mg/L and Enterococcus faecium MIC(90) 4 mg/L), its MIC(90) was substantially lower than observed with available glycopeptides. CONCLUSIONS: Telavancin has potent in vitro activity against contemporary Gram-positive clinical isolates from diverse geographic areas in Europe and Israel.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of Abrus precatorius (L) fabaceae extract on  some clinical pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts  of Abrus precatorius on some clinical isolates as resistance to available and affordable antibiotics by these pathogens is on the increase. METHOD: In this study the antimicrobial effects of the extracts of Abrus precatorius from leaves, stem and the seed oil were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, three clinical S. aureus isolates from different sources, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus (S.milleri), Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium spp (toxigenic strain of the mitis biotype), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as Candida albicans using the agar well diffusion technique. Aqueous and methanolic extraction, using the soxhlet extractor was carried out on all plant parts used while petroleum ether was the solvent used to extract the seed oil. To measure the MIC values, various concentrations of the stock, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 and 4 microg/ml were assayed against the test bacteria. RESULT: At the different concentrations of the extracts used (512 microg/ml - 4 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive organism with an MIC of 8 ug/ml for the leaf extract. Extract from the stem and seed oil were potent against some of the gram-positive bacteria and Candida albicans but not against S anginosus, E. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria tested. The pH of the extracts ranged between pH5 and pH8. This study demonstrates that Abrus precatorius particularly the seed oil has a potent antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSION: The results substantiate the ethno botanical use of different parts of Abrus precatorius for the treatment of various bacteria-related diseases. Topical application of Abrus precatorius extracts in ointments may be recommended especially for treating superficial infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Purification of bacteriocin LS1 produced by human oral isolate Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1, a human oral isolate with antagonistic activity against growth of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus flavus, and Salmonella enteritidis, probably produces more than one proteinaceous antimicrobial substance. The objective of this study was the purification of a bacteriocin, named LS1, produced by L. salivarius BGHO1. METHODS: A simple and fast procedure for bacteriocin purification was developed, consisting of reverse-phase chromatography of the ammonium sulfate precipitate of cell-free culture supernatant by fast protein liquid chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, followed by tricine sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), with the subsequent extraction of bacteriocin from the gel. RESULTS: The supernatant of L. salivarius BGHO1 culture retained its antimicrobial activity after boiling in a water bath for 15 min. Its antimicrobial activity was also maintained even after treatment for 20 min at 121 degrees C in an autoclave. Bacteriocin LS1 was purified to homogeneity. The molecular mass of bacteriocin LS1 was estimated to be approximately 10 kDa, based on tricine SDS-PAGE. During purification, another compound with antimicrobial activity, produced by L. salivarius BGHO1, was detected. The molecular mass of this compound was estimated to be approximately 5 kDa, based on tricine SDS-PAGE. CONCLUSION: Our results imply that LS1 is most probably a new bacteriocin, different from previously described bacteriocins produced by L. salivarius strains. The purification of bacteriocin LS1 enabled the further characterization of LS1 on both the molecular and genetic levels.
TI  - Bioactive metabolites from the endophytic fungus Ampelomyces sp. isolated from the medicinal plant Urospermum picroides.
AB  - Extracts of cultures grown in liquid or on solid rice media of the fungal endophyte Ampelomyces sp. isolated from the medicinal plant Urospermum picroides exhibited considerable cytotoxic activity when tested in vitro against L5178Y cells. Chromatographic separation yielded 14 natural products that were unequivocally identified based on their 1H and 13C NMR as well as mass spectra and comparison with previously published data. Six compounds (2, 4, 5, 7, 9 and 11) were natural products. Both fungal extracts differed considerably in their secondary metabolites. The extract obtained from liquid cultures afforded a pyrone (2) and sulfated anthraquinones (7 and 9) along with the known compounds 1, 3, 6 and 8. When grown on solid rice medium the fungus yielded three compounds 4, 5 and 11 in addition to several known metabolites including 6, 8, 10, 12, 13 and 14. Compounds 4, 8 and 10 showed the strongest cytotoxic activity against L5178Y cells with EC50 values ranging from 0.2-7.3microg/ml. Furthermore, 8 and 10 displayed antimicrobial activity against the Gram-positive pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis at minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 12.5microg/ml and 12.5-25microg/ml, respectively. Interestingly, 6 and 8 were also identified as constituents of an extract derived from a healthy plant sample of the host plant U. picroides thereby indicating that the production of bioactive natural products by the endophyte proceeds also under in situ conditions within the host plant.
TI  - Interactions of some common pathogenic bacteria with Acanthamoeba polyphaga.
AB  - Protozoan grazing is a major trophic pathway whereby the biomass re-enters the food web. Nonetheless, not all bacteria are digested by protozoa and the number known to evade digestion, resulting in their environmental augmentation, is increasing. We investigated the interactions of Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), with the amoeba, Acanthamoeba polyphaga. There was evidence of predation of all bacterial species except L. monocytogenes and S. aureus, where extracellular numbers were significantly higher when cultured with amoebae compared with growth in the absence of amoebae. Intracellular growth kinetic experiments and fluorescent confocal microscopy suggest that S. aureus survived and may even multiply within A. polyphaga, whereas there was no apparent intra-amoebal replication of L. monocytogenes and higher numbers were likely sustained on metabolic waste products released during coculture.
TI  - A comparative in-vitro evaluation of resistance selection after exposure to teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin in Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp.
AB  - The ability of breakpoint and serum concentrations of teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin to select resistance was compared for isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Mutation frequencies were always <10(-10), except for two isolates grown in the presence of teicoplanin at the trough serum concentration. After multistep selection, linezolid selected for resistance in staphylococci and enterococci, and serial exposure to certain concentrations of linezolid was more likely to select for stable resistance in MRSA, MSSA and enterococci than was exposure to glycopeptides and quinupristin-dalfopristin.
TI  - The role of bacteria in lactational mastitis and some considerations of the use of antibiotic treatment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of bacterial pathogens in lactational mastitis remains unclear. The objective of this study was to compare bacterial species in breast milk of women with mastitis and of healthy breast milk donors and to evaluate the use of antibiotic therapy, the symptoms of mastitis, number of health care contacts, occurrence of breast abscess, damaged nipples and recurrent symptoms in relation to bacterial counts. METHODS: In this descriptive study, breast milk from 192 women with mastitis (referred to as cases) and 466 breast milk donors (referred to as controls) was examined bacteriologically and compared using analytical statistics. Statistical analyses were also carried out to test for relationships between bacteriological content and clinical symptoms as measured on scales, prescription of antibiotics, the number of care contacts, occurrence of breast abscess and recurring symptoms. RESULTS: Five main bacterial species were found in both cases and controls: coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS), viridans streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Group B streptococci (GBS) and Enterococcus faecalis. More women with mastitis had S. aureus and GBS in their breast milk than those without symptoms, although 31% of healthy women harboured S. aureus and 10% had GBS. There were no significant correlations between bacterial counts and the symptoms of mastitis as measured on scales. There were no differences in bacterial counts between those prescribed and not prescribed antibiotics or those with and without breast abscess. GBS in breast milk was associated with increased health care contacts (p = 0.02). Women with >/= 10(7) cfu/L CNS or viridans streptococci in their breast milk had increased odds for damaged nipples (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Many healthy breastfeeding women have potentially pathogenic bacteria in their breast milk. Increasing bacterial counts did not affect the clinical manifestation of mastitis; thus bacterial counts in breast milk may be of limited value in the decision to treat with antibiotics as results from bacterial culture of breast milk may be difficult to interpret. These results suggest that the division of mastitis into infective or non-infective forms may not be practically feasible. Daily follow-up to measure the subsidence of symptoms can help detect those in need of antibiotics.
TI  - The establishment of resistance phenotypes for bacteria isolated from outpatients in urine cultures.
AB  - From 1911 outpatients, who addressed a Timisoara private clinical laboratory, from January to December 2005, we collected 1,889 urine cultures, 431 being positive. Bacteria identification was generally done using morphological, cultural, biochemical characters and pathogenicity tests. Sensitivity testing to antimicrobial medical drugs was done by using the classical diffusion Kirby-Bauer method and the automatic analyzer Osiris, also. The main bacteria involved in the etiology of these infections were represented by Enterobacteriaceae, head of the list being Escherichia coli (81.21%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.35%) and Proteus mirabilis (3.02%). We also isolated Gram positive cocci (in a much smaller proportion), mainly represented by Enterococcus faecalis (1.16%), Staphylococcus aureus (0.93%), Streptococcus agalactiae, and also Gram negative non-fermentative bacilli, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.93%) or Acinetobacter baumanii (0.23%). As soon as we performed the sensitivity tests, we divided them in resistance phenotypes: Most of the Enterobacteriaceae were integrated in the wild phenotype, followed by the penicillinase producing phenotype. An E. coli strain (0.29%) and 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains (8.33%) were integrated in the large spectrum, multidrug resistant, beta-lactamase producing phenotype, also associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; Non-fermentative bacilli did not present special resistance problems, the four Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were integrated in the wild phenotype (secreting induced chromosomal cephalosporinase). As for Staphylococcus aureus it was identified a strain having fluoroquinolone resistance, two strains secreting penicillinase and having a K (Nm) phenotype and a strain secreting penicillinase only. Antibiotic resistance represents a major concern for patients, physicians, healthcare managers, and policymakers. The use of antibiotics is closely linked with the development of acquired antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole, a novel anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin, tested against contemporary pathogens: results from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (2005-2006).
AB  - Ceftobiprole is a 1st-in-class anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) extended-spectrum cephalosporin currently in clinical trials for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs) and nosocomial pneumonia. This agent is also active against other prominent Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, making it an attractive candidate for broad-spectrum therapy. We evaluated the in vitro potency of ceftobiprole tested against the most commonly occurring bacterial pathogens as part of a global surveillance study for the years 2005 to 2006 (>60 medical centers in North America, Latin America, and Europe). All isolates (40 675) were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. Ceftobiprole inhibited 100% and >99% of tested S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at < or =4 and < or =8 microg/mL, respectively, although MIC90 values for oxacillin-resistant strains were 4-fold and 8-fold higher than oxacillin-susceptible isolates for the 2 groups. Ceftobiprole was also broadly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, inhibiting >98% of isolates at < or =0.5 microg/mL. Although ceftobiprole was generally inactive against Enterococcus faecium, the majority of Enterococcus faecalis strains (95.7%) were inhibited at < or =4 microg/mL. This agent was similar in potency to the "3rd- and 4th-generation" cephems (MIC50 values, < or =0.06 microg/mL) for all tested Enterobacteriaceae. Although cefepime provided enhanced coverage against Klebsiella spp. (86.5% at < or =8 microg/mL versus 76.9-81.7% for ceftobiprole and ceftazidime), ceftobiprole and cefepime were superior to ceftazidime against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter spp. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftobiprole was equal in potency to ceftazidime (MIC50, 2 microg/mL) and 2-fold more potent than cefepime. None of these agents inhibited >45% of Acinetobacter spp. at 8 mug/mL. Ceftobiprole is a new anti-MRSA beta-lactam with recognized activity against the most commonly occurring Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa, similar to that of extended-spectrum cephems. These characteristics warrant continued evaluation of the agent as empiric therapy for cSSSIs, and in pneumonia, especially in those institutions/regions where MRSA and P. aeruginosa may be prevalent.
TI  - Update on the appropriate use of linezolid in clinical practice.
AB  - Multi-antibiotic resistant Gram-positive cocci, which include Staphylococcus aureus, the coagulase-negative staphylococcal group, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, and other streptococci, represent emerging pathogens especially in the setting of the immunocompromised, hospitalized patients, in particular when surgery, invasive procedures, or prosthetic implants are of concern, patients are admitted in intensive care units, or underlying chronic disorders and immunodeficiency are of concern, and broad-spectrum antibiotics or immunosuppressive drugs are widely administered. During the recent years, the phenomenon of multiresistant Gram-positive cocci is spreading to the community, where the retrieval of such microorganism is progressively increasing. The spectrum of available antimicrobial compounds for an effective management of these relevant infections is significantly impaired in selection and clinical efficacy by the emerging and spread of methicillin-resistant and more recently glycopeptide-resistant Gram-positive microbial strains. The first oxazolidinone derivative linezolid, together with the recently licensed quinupristin-dalfopristin, daptomycin, and tigecycline, followed by a number of glycopeptides, fluoroquinolones, and other experimental compounds on the pipeline, represent an effective response to the great majority of these concerns, due to their innovative mechanisms of action, their maintained or enhanced activity against multiresistant pathogens, their effective pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties, their frequent possibility of synergistic activity with other compounds effective against Gram-positive pathogens, and a diffuse potential for a safe and easy administration, also when compromised patients are of concern. The main problems related to the epidemiological and clinical features of multiresistant Gram-positive infection, the potential clinical indications of all recently available compounds compared with the standard of care of treatment of resistant Gram-positive infections, and updated data on efficacy and tolerability of linezolid as the golden standard compound for vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci in multiple clinical situations, are outlined and updated on the ground of an extensive review of all the available, recent evidences coming from the international literature.
TI  - Pediatric endocarditis and stroke: a single-center retrospective review of seven  cases.
AB  - The acute management of strokes in children with infective endocarditis is limited by the paucity of published data on their clinical course and outcomes. Our retrospective study at an urban tertiary-care academic center characterized the clinical course of seven pediatric patients with endocarditis and subsequent cerebral infarcts. Among 115 patients with endocarditis, a stroke occurred in seven. Four patients manifested congenital heart disease. In six patients, the stroke occurred in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery, with no preference for the left or right hemisphere. The most common presenting sign was focal weakness. Three patients manifested mycotic aneurysms, all of which were successfully repaired. Two patients received aspirin therapy, with no adverse effects. All patients survived, but neurologic recovery was variable. The two youngest patients (aged 3 and 14 weeks) demonstrated the longest periods of hospitalization, with the most severe neurologic impairment. These findings suggest that children may have better outcomes than adults after a stroke secondary to bacterial endocarditis. Routine surveillance for mycotic aneurysms in patients with new neurologic deficits, and the use of aspirin, should be considered in the medical management.
TI  - Effect of Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococcus lactis and Enterococcus faecalis on the behaviour of Staphylococcus aureus in microfiltered milk.
AB  - The effect of four strains of Lactococcus garvieae, three strains of Lactococcus  lactis and one strain of Enterococcus faecalis on Staphylococcus aureus SA15 growth in microfiltered milk was evaluated. Lactococcus and Enterococcus strains were co-cultured with S. aureus in microfiltered milk and in medium buffered at pH 6.8. All Lactococcus and Enterococcus strains were able to inhibit S. aureus growth after 6h of incubation. Inhibition by L. lactis and E. faecalis strains could be partially attributed to the decrease in pH below 6.0 as it has been observed in medium buffered at pH 6.8. L. garvieae strains were the most effective to inhibit S. aureus growth without acidification. Inhibition of S. aureus could not be attributed neither to production of lactate, acetate or nor to antistaphylococcal substance. Amino acids competition was not involved in the inhibition by L. garvieae as addition of valine, isoleucine, threonine, methionine and phenylalanine did not suppress the inhibition of S. aureus.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine by two different  tests.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial capacity of sodium hypochlorite (1% and 5%) and chlorhexidine (0.12%, 0.5% and 1%) with or without the addition of organic material (bovine serum albumin, BSA) against some bacterial samples (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum) using two activity tests (contact and diffusion agar tests). In the contact test (first model), bacterial samples were kept in contact with each irrigating solution for different time intervals: immediately (t(0)), 5 min (t(5)), 15 min (t(15)) and 30 min (t(30)). The agar diffusion test was the second model used. In half the specimens, 0.5% BSA was added to simulate organic tissue present in the root canal. Bacterial growth was evaluated for each microorganism and activity test. Each test was repeated 10 times. In the contact test, 0.12% chlorhexidine solution (CHX) did not eliminate E. faecalis at any tested time. CHX at 0.5% eliminated all strains except E. faecalis after immediate contact. All strains were eliminated by 1% CHX, 1% NaOCl and 5% NaOCl. BSA did not interfere with the antimicrobial activity of the irrigating solutions. In the agar diffusion test, all solutions exhibited zones of antimicrobial activity; however, BSA interfered with the antimicrobial activity of NaOCl and CHX. Under the condition of the contact test, the 0.12% CHX was ineffective in eliminating E. faecalis, while 0.5% CHX, 1% CHX, 1% NaOCl and 5% NaOCl showed antibacterial effectiveness against all the tested bacterial strains. The addition of an organic load interfered with the accuracy of the agar diffusion test.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of omiganan pentahydrochloride tested against contemporary bacterial pathogens commonly responsible for catheter-associated infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Omiganan pentahydrochloride is a cidal cationic peptide with a broad  antimicrobial spectrum, including yeast, currently in development as a topical agent for the prevention of catheter-associated infections. We evaluated the spectrum and potency of omiganan against pathogens commonly associated with such infections. METHODS: A recent (2005-06) collection of bacterial isolates originating from patients with bloodstream, respiratory tract, and skin and skin structure infections in US medical centres was evaluated by reference broth microdilution methods against omiganan and comparator agents. RESULTS: All tested gram-positive (390) and -negative (167) isolates were inhibited by < or = 128 and < or = 1024 mg/L, respectively, of omiganan. The agent was the most active against coagulase-negative staphylococci (range 1-8 mg/L; MIC(50/90), 4 mg/L) and inhibited all Staphylococcus aureus at < or = 32 mg/L (MIC(50/90), 16 mg/L). Omiganan was 16-fold more active against Enterococcus faecium than Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(50/90) results, 4/8 versus 64/128 mg/L, respectively). MIC ranges and MIC(50) potencies were unaffected by methicillin resistance in staphylococci, vancomycin resistance in enterococci, and penicillin resistance in streptococci. Omiganan potency was also unaffected by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production in Escherichia coli when compared with wild-type strains (MIC(50) values 32 mg/L), although a 4-fold increase was noted among ESBL-positive Klebsiella spp. (128 versus 32 mg/L, respectively). Wild-type Enterobacter spp. displayed higher omiganan MIC(50/90) results (64/512 mg/L) compared with AmpC-hyperproducing strains (32/64 mg/L). Carbapenem-susceptible and -resistant P. aeruginosa strains exhibited omiganan MIC(50/90) values of 128/256 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: At a 1% (10 000 mg/L) topical gel formulation, omiganan can be expected to inhibit all clinically relevant bacterial species producing catheter-associated infections (all MIC values, < or = 1024 mg/L), including those with antimicrobial-resistant phenotypes.
TI  - Placental histological inflammation and reproductive tract infections in a low risk pregnant population in Latvia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the correlation of reproductive tract infections (RTI) and endogenous vaginal flora at first antenatal consultation with placental histological inflammation. METHODS: In a follow-up study, 154 low risk women with no miscarriage risk factors were examined for the presence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS), Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis (GDS) and bacterial vaginosis (BV). At delivery, outcome data were collected and the histology of the placenta was studied. RESULTS: Some 85 (56.3%) of all pregnant women had RTI or endogenous vaginal flora. Placental histological inflammation correlated with genital tract colonisation with G. vaginalis (p =0.013), BV (p =0.031), S. aureus (p =0.04) and aerobic vaginitis (p =0.017). BV and BV-related G. vaginalis correlated with the presence of parietal and placental chorioamnionitis in 53.8 and 43.5% of cases. Genital tract colonisation with GDS and other aerobic flora in combination with inflammatory vaginitis correlated with the presence of funisitis in 33.3 and 40.0% of cases. Mycoplasmas increased the risk for intrauterine infection only when present in combination with other RTIs (p =0.023). CONCLUSION: Histological placental inflammation is associated with both BV and genital tract colonisation with aerobic bacteria, while funisitis is associated with colonisation of aerobic bacteria at first prenatal visit before the 17th gestational week.
TI  - Activity of amikacin, ertapenem, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin alone and in combination against resistant nosocomial pathogens by time-kill.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the synergistic activity of amikacin/ertapenem, fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin)/ertapenem and amikacin/fluoroquinolones combinations against resistant nosocomial pathogens. METHODS: Time-kill studies were performed over 24 hours using an inoculum of 5 x 10(6) - 1 x 10(7) cfu/mL. Antibiotics were tested at the 1 x MIC and 4 x MIC concentrations. RESULTS: At MIC and/or 4 x MIC concentrations, the antibiotic combinations showed additive or synergistic activity against Acinetobacter strains and extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. In Escherichia coli strains, synergy was seen when amikacin was combined with ertapenem, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin; ertapenem in combination with fluoroquinolones demonstrated antagonism. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, synergistic effect was exhibited by ertapenem plus amikacin and ertapenem plus fluoroquinolones. The antibiotic combinations showed antagonistic interaction in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSION: The antibiotic combinations showed additive or synergistic activity against many gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Infection after the surgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: evaluation of the diagnosis, treatment, and impact on clinical outcomes.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case-control. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a single surgeon's experience with infection after surgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, with a focus on the diagnosis, treatment, and impact on radiographic and patient-reported outcomes. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although previous studies have evaluated this postoperative complication, no studies to date have looked at the impact of this complication on both radiographic and patient-reported outcomes. METHODS: From 1986 to 2004, 236 patients were identified who underwent surgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and had at least 2-year follow-up. The medical records of patients who developed infection were retrospectively reviewed in detail. Preoperative and most recent postoperative radiographic parameters and Scoliosis Research Society 24 outcomes of both infected and noninfected patients were compared. RESULTS: Of 236 patients 7 (3%) developed an infection. One was acute (17 days postoperative), and 6 were delayed (average 34.2 months postoperative). The most common presenting complaints included back pain (5 of 7) and localized swelling (4 of 7). All patients with delayed infection were treated with 1 surgery (irrigation and debridement, instrumentation removal) and 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics. Of 6 patients 3 had pseudarthrosis. Culture results were: Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 2), Propionibacterium acnes (n = 1), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1), Group A Streptococcus (n = 1), no growth (n = 1). The patient with acute infection required 6 surgical procedures and 16 weeks of antibiotics. Cultures were positive for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Serratia marscesens. Revision fusion surgery was performed 5 months after the infection was treated. Compared with the noninfected patients, those with infection had lower percent thoracic (P = 0.01) and lumbar (P = 0.06) curve correction. There was no difference in the pain, function, self-image, satisfaction, or total Scoliosis Research Society 24 scores. CONCLUSION: Postoperative infection after the surgical treatment of idiopathic scoliosis can successfully be treated with irrigation and debridement, instrumentation removal, and a course of antibiotics. Although less curve correction was achieved in the infected group, there were no differences in patient-reported outcomes when compared with the noninfected group.
TI  - Antimicrobial triterpenoids from Vladimiria muliensis.
AB  - A new triterpenoid with a rearranged ursane skeleton, 3beta-acetoxyl-11alpha-methoxybauer-8-en-7alpha-ol ( 1), two new ursane triterpenoids, 1alpha,5alpha-dioxy-11alpha-hydroxyurs-12-en-3-one ( 2) and urs-3beta,13alpha,18beta-triol ( 3), together with three known ursane triterpenoids ( 4- 6) were isolated from the rhizome of Vladimiria muliensis. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic methods (IR, EIMS, HRESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR, and X-ray crystallography diffraction). Compounds 2 and 4 exhibited modest antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - N-substituted 3-acetyltetramic acid derivatives as antibacterial agents.
AB  - In order to expand the structure-activity relationship of tetramic acid molecules with structural similarity to the antibiotic reutericyclin, 22 compounds were synthesized and tested against a panel of clinically relevant bacteria. Key structural changes on the tetramic acid core affected antibacterial activity. Various compounds in the N-alkyl 3-acetyltetramic acid series exhibited good activity against Gram-positive bacterial pathogens including Bacillus anthracis, Propionibacterium acnes, Enterococcus faecalis, and both Methicillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Comparative study of the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gel, chlorhexidine solution and sodium hypochlorite as endodontic irrigants.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the in vitro the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gluconate gel as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance compared to sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and chlorhexidine gluconate solution. The antimicrobial efficacy of the tested substances was evaluated using the agar diffusion test. The growth inhibition zones produced by 0.2%, 1% and 2% chlorhexidine gel were evaluated against 5 facultative anaerobic bacteria and 4 pigmented Gram-negative anaerobes, and compared to the results obtained by NaOCl and chlorhexidine solution. The largest growth inhibition zones were produced when the test bacteria were in contact with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate gel (11.79 mm), being significantly different (p<0.05) from the growth inhibition zones produced by all NaOCl concentrations, including 5.25% (9.54 mm). However, there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) between the growth inhibition zones obtained with equal concentrations of chlorhexidine solution and gel. The results of this study indicate that, as far as its antimicrobial properties are concerned, chlorhexidine gel has a great potential to be used as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance.
TI  - Comparative analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility among organisms from France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK as part of the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial.
AB  - As part of the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (TEST), bacterial isolates were collected from 39 centres in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK between January 2004 and August 2006. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined according to CLSI guidelines. Italy had the highest rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (36.4%), and was the only country to report vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (8.6%). Tigecycline was the only agent to which all Gram-positive isolates were susceptible. For many of the Gram-negative organisms collected, antimicrobial susceptibilities were lowest among isolates from Italy and highest among isolates from Spain. The notable exception was Acinetobacter baumannii, where the poorest susceptibility profile was among isolates from Spain. For A. baumannii, MIC(90)s of imipenem varied from 1 mg/L for isolates in France and Germany to > or =32 mg/L for isolates from Italy and Spain. Tigecycline was the only agent to maintain an MIC(90) of < or =1 mg/L against isolates from all five countries. The in-vitro activity of tigecycline against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates may make it valuable in the treatment of hospital infections, including those caused by otherwise antimicrobial-resistant organisms.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of honey from stingless honeybees (Hymenoptera; Apidae; Meliponinae).
AB  - The aim of the study was to examine antibacterial activity of the honey of stingless honeybees (Meliponinae). An agar well diffusion assay demonstrated that many honey samples of stingless honeybees inhibited the growth of test strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; moreover, they exhibited non-peroxide antibacterial activity against those strains. This is the first time that non-peroxide antimicrobial activity of honey from a number of species of stingless honeybees has been demonstrated. These antibacterial activities appear to be powerful, even when compared to those of"manuka honey" from Apinae honeybees.
TI  - Efficacy of various disinfecting agents on the reduction of bacteria from the surface of silicone and polyether impression materials.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of different disinfectants on the reduction of two resistant bacteria from the surface of impression materials. Impressions were made of a sterile metal model of the edentulous maxillary arch which had been contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus and Enterecoccus faecalis. The impressions were cultured before and after disinfection with 0.525% sodium hypochlorite, Gludex and Mikrozid spray disinfectant. For each of the three impression materials and the two microorganisms, spray disinfectant was found to be less effective than either sodium hypochlorite or Gludex.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of DX-619, a novel Des-F (6)-quinolone against clinical isolates in China.
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate in vitro antibacterial activity and bactericidal effect of DX-619 and other nine comparators against 1,101 recently collected clinical bacterial isolates in China. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antimicrobials were determined by a CLSI recommended standard agar dilution method and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were examined by the broth dilution method. Time-kill curves against representative isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and Klebsiellia pneumoniae were also conducted. DX-619 exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against 1,101 clinical isolates, especially to multi-drug resistant Gram-positive cocci. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 were < or =0.016 and 0.125 mg/L against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus, 0.062 and 0.125 mg/L against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. epidermidis, respectively, which were 8-512 and 64-128 fold lower than those of comparative fluoroquinolones. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 for penicillin-sensitive and -non-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were 0.016, 0.062, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 against Enterobacteriaceae (except for Escherichia coli) and glucose-nonfermenting bacilli were < or =4 mg/L, which were comparable to other comparators. MBCs and time-kill curves showed that DX-619 was a potent bactericidal agent. There was no significant inoculum effect on MICs. But the activities of DX-619 against S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were decreased by acidic pH and human serum. DX-619 was a potent antibacterial compound against multi-drug resistant bacteria including Gram-positive cocci, such as S. aureus and enterococci, which may warrant further exploration.
TI  - Linezolid in children: recent patents and advances.
AB  - Linezolid is the first approved member of a new generation of antibiotics, the synthetic oxazolidinones, to become available, with a broad spectrum of in vitro activity against Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. It has an excellent bioavailability both intravenously and orally and a very good safety profile both in adults and in children. With regards to its antimicrobial action, linezolid has a predominantly bacteriostatic action, rather than a bacteriocidal effect and is active against Gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics. Linezolid is currently showing great promise for the treatment of multi-resistant Gram-positive infections, both in the community and in a hospital setting. Clinical indications so far include skin and soft tissue infections, community-acquired or nosocomial pneumonia due to MRSA, VRE bacteremia and community-acquired pneumonia due to penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. We anticipate that this new generation of antimicrobial agents will provide adequate cover in the future for infections that cause significant treatment failures so far, such as VRE- associated endocarditis, bone and joint multi-drug resistant infections and possibly central nervous system infections, both in adult and children populations. Some patents on linezolid are also discussed in this review.
TI  - Coronal microleakage of two root-end filling materials using a polymicrobial marker.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate polymicrobial coronal leakage of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and amalgam. There were 108 single-rooted teeth randomly divided into 3 groups of 32 teeth each and positive and negative control groups of 6 teeth and obturated with gutta percha and either Diaket (3M/ESPE, Seefeld, Germany), AH Plus (Dentsply, De Trey, Konstanz, Germany), or Ketac Endo (3M/ESPE). These groups were further divided into 2 subgroups of 16 teeth in which root ends were resected and obturated with either MTA or zinc-free amalgam. The samples have been incorporated in a dual-chamber leakage model with a polymicrobial marker of five facultative anaerobes on the coronal part. Leakage was observing during a period of 90 days. The least leakage was found in a combination of Diaket and MTA (76.9 +/-14.8 days) followed by AH Plus and MTA (66.1 +/- 18.7), Diaket and amalgam (60.0 +/- 23.1), AH Plus and amalgam (56.9 +/- 22.1), and Ketac Endo and MTA (42.1 +/- 17.8), whereas the greatest leakage was observed in the Ketac Endo and amalgam group (40.0 +/- 17.24). Samples filled with MTA showed significantly better sealing than samples filled with amalgam (p < 0.05).
TI  - Response to emerging infection leading to outbreak of linezolid-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Linezolid was approved in 2000 for treatment of gram-positive coccal infections.  We performed a case-control study during a hospital outbreak of linezolid-resistant enterococci (LRE) infections, comparing cases of LRE infection (cases) with linezolid-sensitive enterococci infections (controls). Nasal and perirectal swab samples were obtained from all patients in a 1-day point-prevalence survey. We examined antimicrobial drug use and calculated the defined daily dose of linezolid per 1,000 patient-days. Fifteen LRE cases were identified (13 Enterococcus faecalis and 2 E. faecium); 7 were vancomycin-resistant. Compared with controls, case-patients had increased in-hospital mortality rates and lengths of stay. Multivariate analysis identified independent predictors of LRE infection: prior cultures positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 27), hospitalization duration before index culture (AOR 1.1 per day), and duration of preceding linezolid therapy (AOR 1.1 per day). Linezolid exposure and patient-to-patient transmission appear to be responsible for LRE infections, an important emeraina hospital problem.
TI  - Effect of Octenisept antiseptic on bioburden of neoplastic ulcers in patients with advanced cancer.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of octenidine dihydrochloride (Octenisept, Schulke & Mayr) on the clinical condition and bacterial flora in neoplastic ulcers. METHOD: Twenty-one patients with advanced cancer and neoplastic ulcers were included in the study. Octenisept-moistened gauze dressings were applied to the ulcers three times daily. The clinical and bacteriological status of the wounds were assessed at baseline and after three weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Thirty-three bacterial strains were cultured at baseline. After three weeks of treatment, the tests were repeated on 16 patients. Clinical observations confirmed an improvement in the clinical condition of the ulcers, characterised by a reduction in necrosis, exudate levels, erythema and oedema. According to the bacteriological assessment, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Proteus mirabilis were eradicated from the wounds. Enterococcus faecalis persisted in two patients, Escherichia coli in one patient and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in another patient. CONCLUSION: Octenispet was an effective antimicrobial: Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis were eradicated in all ulcers. After three weeks of treatment, none of the ulcers developed an infection and there was an improvement in their clinical condition.
TI  - Survival of enteric microorganisms on grass surfaces irrigated with treated effluent.
AB  - Treated effluent can be reused for the irrigation of parks and sports grounds but there is an associated potential public health risks from microbial pathogens present on the grass surface, particularly when used for contact sports. The main aim of this study was to investigate the survival of pathogenic and indicator microorganisms on the grass surface of a sports ground irrigated with treated effluent under differing climatic conditions. Results showed that Salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus decayed faster under direct sunlight than MS2 with one log(10) reduction (T(90)) varying from 3 to 11 hours. Rapid decay (T(90) 3 to 4 hours) of bacterial pathogens occurred in both sunlight and shade during the summer. In contrast, T(90) times for the bacteria during the winter varied from 6 to 11 hours in direct sunlight and from 23 to 38 hours in shade. No significant seasonal variation was observed in the inactivation of the bacteriophage MS2. Enteric viruses are expected to show inactivation rates similar to MS2. The results show that rapid inactivation of enteric bacteria can be expected on grass surface irrigated with treated effluent at higher ambient temperatures, in direct sunlight and low moisture content.
TI  - [Omphalitis with fatal outcome in new-born baby boy].
AB  - Omphalitis is a serious condition with important morbidity and mortality, especially in developing countries. The most commonly involved micro-organisms are Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We describe a Danish patient with cellulitis, severe septicaemia, and portal vein thrombosis as fatal complications of omphalitis. In spite of early recognition and prompt treatment in this case, it was not possible to save the child.
TI  - Succession of dominant and antagonistic lactic acid bacteria in fermented cucumber: insights from a PCR-based approach.
AB  - The goal of the investigation was to study the succession of major groups of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and their antagonism in salt-fermented cucumber using PCR. In a direct detection method as well as a short enrichment process, PCR enabled detection of Leuconostoc and Lactobacillus during early hours of fermentation. Subsequently, Lactobacillus and Pediococcus emerged as the dominant genera. Nucleic acid sequence of culture-independent clones confirmed the detection of Pediococcus as a dominant genera emerging during late stages of fermentation. PCR also revealed time-dependent emergence of mesentericin, pediocin and plantaricin A producers and accounted for the LAB succession in the fermenting samples. A total of 328 LAB isolates were obtained collectively from 30 cucumber samples, of which PCR could identify an overwhelming 186 Lactobacillus isolates followed by 113 Pediococcus and 29 Leuconostoc isolates, respectively. Based on antimicrobial assay against target strain Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B640, 28% of the LAB were bacteriocin producers, of which pediocin producers were substantial, followed by plantaricin A and mesentericin producers. The bacteriocins elaborated by the isolates were active against a large number of Gram-positive target LAB strains and pathogenic bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Anthocleistenolide, a new rearranged nor-secoiridoid derivative from the stem back of Anthocleista vogelii.
AB  - A new rearranged nor-secoiridoid, anthocleistenolide ( 1), along with the known 1-hydroxy-3,7-dimethoxyxanthone ( 2), 1-hydroxy-3,7,8-trimethoxyxanthone ( 3), 7 alpha-hydroxysitosterol ( 4) and sitosterol 3- O-beta- D-glucopyranoside ( 5), were isolated from the stem back of Anthocleista vogelii. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectral studies and comparison with published data. Compounds 1 - 3 and 5 were evaluated for their antibacterial and antifungal activities. Relatively low anti-staphylococcal (MIC = 200 microg/mL against Staphylococcus aureus) and anti-enterococcal (MIC = 100 microg/mL against Enterococcus faecalis) activities were observed for 1, while compounds 2 and 3 were active against Candida parapsilosis (MIC = 200 microg/mL for 2 and 25 microg/mL for 3). Compound 5 was inactive against all the bacterial and fungal species used.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal properties of polyether impression materials.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial and antifungal properties of polyether impression materials using the agar diffusion test. Three different types of polyether impression materials (P2, Penta Soft and Penta) were tested to determine their ability to inhibit the growth of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. The areas of inhibition zones were measured visually with a 0.1-mm incremental Boley gauge. In all groups, none of the samples of the P2 polyether impression material exhibited antibacterial or antifungal activity against any of the microorganisms. All Penta Soft and Penta samples exhibited antibacterial activity against E. faecalis and S. aureus, and only Penta samples exhibited antifungal effect against C. albicans, which decreased progressively as the setting time of the material increased.
TI  - Triclosan-loaded poloxamine micelles for enhanced topical antibacterial activity  against biofilm.
AB  - Our research group is interested in the study of different technological approaches to treat hospital biofilm as a means to constrain nosocomial-acquired infections. The present work investigated the effect of the incorporation of the antibacterial agent triclosan (TS) into polymeric micelles of poloxamine T1107 (MW=15 kDa, 70 wt% PEO). The aggregation phenomenon was primarily investigated by means of Critical Micellar Concentration in a broad range of pH. Then, the effect of the polymer concentration on the micellar size was evaluated by Dynamic Light Scattering. Solubility levels increased up to 4 orders of magnitude. The drug inclusion affected the micellization, resulting in size increase and micellar fusion. This phenomenon was only apparent in TS-saturated systems. TS-loaded aggregates proved to be active in vitro against a broad spectrum of bacteria but more importantly, also against two representative clinical pathogens: methicilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VREF). While the former was sensitive to even very low TS levels attainable in poloxamine-free aqueous media, the later was inhibited only when exposed to higher drug levels affordable exclusively using an inclusion system. These findings indicated the release of the drug from the reservoir. Finally, the activity of a TS-containing 5% poloxamine combination of pH 7.4 was assessed on biofilms of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Results showed a significant decrease (p<0.001) in the number of Colony-Formation Units when the biofilm was exposed to the TS/poloxamine as compared to the limited activity of the polymer-free TS control.
TI  - [In vitro activity of ertapenem against strains isolated from diabetic foot infections].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors aimed to evaluate the in vitro activity of ertapenem against bacterial strains isolated from diabetic foot infections (DFI). METHODOLOGY: All diabetic patients hospitalized for a first episode of DFI (stages 2 to 4, according to the International Working Group of Diabetic Foot Classification) were selected in the Nimes University hospital between January 2005 to December 2005. MICs were determined using both E-test strips and dilution methods on bacterial strains isolated from foot samples. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-two bacteria (154 Gram-positive cocci including 94 Staphylococcus aureus, 80 Gram-negative bacilli with 56 Enterobacteriaceae, and 18 anaerobes) were studied. Ertapenem was active against all Streptococcus spp., Enterobacteriaceae, anaerobes, and also against 89.8% of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates. However, this antibiotic was active only against 31.5% of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 21.8% of Enterococcus faecalis, and 15.8% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that ertapenem may be a useful agent to treat patients suffering from DFI after bacterial identification.
TI  - Domain requirement of moenomycin binding to bifunctional transglycosylases and development of high-throughput discovery of antibiotics.
AB  - Moenomycin inhibits bacterial growth by blocking the transglycosylase activity of class A penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which are key enzymes in bacterial cell wall synthesis. We compared the binding affinities of moenomycin A with various truncated PBPs by using surface plasmon resonance analysis and found that the transmembrane domain is important for moenomycin binding. Full-length class A PBPs from 16 bacterial species were produced, and their binding activities showed a correlation with the antimicrobial activity of moenomycin against Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. On the basis of these findings, a fluorescence anisotropy-based high-throughput assay was developed and used successfully for identification of transglycosylase inhibitors.
TI  - Screening of the enterocin genes and antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria in Enterococcus strains obtained from different origins.
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of 139 Enterococcus isolates (48 E. faecium and 91 E. faecalis) obtained from canine feces, boiler meat samples, swine feces, wild waterfowl feces, and human feces were examined against respective bacteria, including Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Enteritidis, and Escherichia coli. Bacteriocin (BAC) production assay revealed that the antimicrobial activity against at least one of 6 indicator strains (BAC+ phenotype) was found in 51 (37%) isolates (29 E. faecium and 22 E. faecalis). Twenty-four of 46 isolates positive for at least one of the enterocin structural genes (entA, entB, entL50AB, and cylL) showed a BAC+ phenotype. The existence of other enterocins or nonenterocin factors was implied because the BAC+ phenotype was detected in a total of 27 Enterococcus isolates that had none of the enterocin genes tested. The antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative strains (Salmonella Enteritidis and E. coli) was detected in the 6 Enterococcus isolates that had either the entA, entB, entL50AB or cylL genes. Moreover, the proportion of the antimicrobial activity against L. monocytogenes among the cylL-positive E. faecalis isolates showing beta-hemolysis (10/16) was significantly (p<0.01) higher than among those lacking beta-hemolysis (2/15). The results suggested that certain characteristics are likely to be associated with the antimicrobial activity against specific organisms.
TI  - Antimicrobial action of a filling paste used in pulp therapy in primary teeth under different storage conditions.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Compare the antimicrobial effectiveness of common antimicrobial paste  immediately after pulp therapy and in different storage conditions. STUDY DESIGN: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Enterococcus faecalis; Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis sample were used. The storage conditions utilized were: at room temperature--the paste was subjected to a natural aging process at room temperature for a 24-hour and 7, 14, 28, 60 and 90 day periods (GPRT). Refrigerator storage--the paste was placed to a natural aging process in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C for a 24 hour and 7.14, 28, 60 and 90 day periods (GPR). To perform the immediate effect analysis (GPi or zero time), of each mixture either at room or refrigerator temperature, the preparation procedure was similar, although GPR, iodoform, Rifocort and camphorated paramonochlorophenol were stored in the refrigerator and then taken out, dosed and manipulated, and had their immediate effect tested after a 1-week period at storage of 4 degrees C average temperature. The testing methodology was Dilution in Solid Medium-Agar. The Wilcoxon Test and Friedman variance analyses were used. RESULTS: The GP paste showed antimicrobial activity at all experimental times. CONCLUSION: The pastes presented antimicrobial effectiveness at all experimental times.
TI  - A class IIa peptide from Enterococcus mundtii inhibits bacteria associated with otitis media.
AB  - Peptide ST4SA, produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST4SA, inhibits the growth of Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients diagnosed with middle ear infections. The peptide adsorbed at a level of 94% to S. pneumoniae 40, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 25 and E. faecium HKLHS. Low concentrations of peptide ST4SA (51200 arbitrary units (AU)/mL) caused DNA and enzyme leakage from target cells, whilst 1638400AU/mL caused cell lysis. No decrease in antimicrobial activity was observed when tested on solid medium with human blood as base. Peptide ST4SA revealed a similar level of activity compared with tetracycline (30 microg), but much higher activity compared with nasal sprays, aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, lincosamides, macrolides, nitroimidazole, penicillin, quinolones, sulphonamides, chloramphenicol, furazolidone, fusidic acid, rifampicin, trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin when tested in vitro. Peptide ST4SA dissipates the proton-motive force and may be used in the treatment of multidrug-resistant strains where antibiotics are excluded from cells by efflux pumps dependent on the membrane proton gradient.
TI  - Cleaning and handling implements as potential reservoirs for bacterial contamination of some ready-to-eat foods in retail delicatessen environments.
AB  - This study assessed the association of bacteria with cleaning tools, such as floor mops (n = 25) and cleaning cloths (n = 39), and handling devices, such as disposable plastic gloves (n = 20), used during filled baguette and assorted salad preparation in four selected retail delicatessens in Johannesburg, South Africa. Samples of each cleaning or handling tool were prepared for aerobic (APC), coliform (CC), Escherichia coli (EC), Bacillus cereus (BCC), and Staphylococcus aureus (SAC) counts, as well as tested for the incidence of Listeria monocytogenes (LM) and Salmonella (SALM) by standard plating methods. Bacterial populations attached to the cleaning and handling tools were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Ten selected gram-positive isolates were further analyzed by 16S rRNA sequence analysis and compared with isolates from filled baguettes and assorted salads. The floor mops consistently yielded the highest APCs, CCs, and ECs (5.7, 4.1, and 3.0 log CFU/g, respectively), while gloves had the lowest corresponding counts (3.6, 2.0, and 1.0 log CFU/g, respectively). Low BCCs and SACs were recorded in this study (ca. 1.2 log CFU/g), while SALM and LM were each detected in five cleaning tool samples. SEM showed rods and cocci attached to handling and cleaning tools. Furthermore, results of 16S rRNA sequence analysis indicated that several gram-positive isolates were identified as S. aureus, Staphylococcus pasteuri, Staphylococcus sciuri, and Enterococcus faecalis. Genetically similar strains (100% similarity) were isolated from cleaning and handling tools and associated ready-to-eat (RTE) foods. Cleaning and handling tools may act as reservoirs of contamination for RTE foods during preparation in retail delicatessens in South Africa. The transfer of potential pathogens, such as S. aureus, to foods from cleaning and handling tools may hold food safety implications.
TI  - Synthesis of caprazamycin analogues and their structure--activity relationship for antibacterial activity.
AB  - Synthesis of palmitoyl caprazol 7, which possesses a simple fatty acyl side chain at the 3' ''-position of the diazepanone moiety, was carried out and their antibacterial activity was evaluated. The key elements of our approach include the improved synthesis of the key 5'-beta-O-aminoribosyl-glycyluridine derivative, installation of the palmitoyl side chain to the cyclization precursor, and the construction of the diazepanone by an intramolecular reductive amination. The second generation synthesis of (+)-caprazol was also established. Palmitoyl caprazol 7 exhibited antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis ATCC607 (MIC = 6.25 microg/mL) with potency similar to that of the caprazamycins (CPZs). Palmitoyl caprazol 7 and N6'-desmethyl palmitoyl caprazol 28 also exhibited antibacterial activity against drug-resistant bacteria including methyciline-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) strains (MIC = 3.13-12.5 microg/mL).
TI  - Comparative bactericidal activities of daptomycin, glycopeptides, linezolid and tigecycline against blood isolates of Gram-positive bacteria in Taiwan.
AB  - In-vitro MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, vancomycin and teicoplanin against Gram-positive bacteria were determined using the broth microdilution method for ten blood isolates each of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), including two vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis. One strain of VISA was tested in a time-kill synergism assay of daptomycin combined with oxacillin, imipenem, rifampicin and isepamicin. Daptomycin showed excellent in-vitro bactericidal activity against all the isolates tested, with no tolerance or synergism effects when combined with other agents, except with rifampicin against VISA. Vancomycin had better bactericidal activity against MRSA and MSSA than did teicoplanin. Linezolid had the poorest bactericidal activity against the isolates tested, with 100% tolerance by the MSSA and VRE isolates, and 80% tolerance by the MRSA isolates. Tolerance towards tigecycline was exhibited by 40% of the MRSA isolates, 100% of the MSSA and vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis isolates, and 90% of the vancomycin-resistant E. faecium isolates.
TI  - Determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration of four medicaments used as intracanal medication.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of iodoform, calcium hydroxide, IKI (iodine potassium iodine) and CFC (ciprofloxacin, Flagyl (metronidazole) and calcium hydroxide) required to kill S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and B. fragilis. In the experiment, medicaments were added to bacterial species into test tubes, in 10 different concentrations. The MIC was the lowest concentration of the drug at which bacterial growth could not be observed. In this investigation, CFC was the most effective medicament against all bacteria. All drugs were able to eliminate E. faecalis and B. fragilis, while IKI was not effective against S. aureus. IKI and calcium hydroxide were not able to eliminate P. aeruginosa as well.
TI  - Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates associated with Inc18-like vanA plasmids in Michigan.
AB  - Five of the seven cases of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) infection identified to date have occurred in southeastern Michigan. VRSA isolates from the four most recent cases (all from Michigan) were characterized. The vanA gene was localized to a single plasmid in each VRSA isolate. The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns of chromosomal DNA and the restriction profile of the plasmid demonstrated that the four isolates were unique and differed from the first three VRSA isolates. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) isolates, all of which were Enterococcus faecalis, were recovered from case patients 4 to 6. Each VRE isolate transferred vancomycin resistance to E. faecalis JH2-2 by conjugation. PCRs for vanA and the Inc18-like plasmid genes traA and repR confirmed the presence of an Inc18-like vanA plasmid in all VRE isolates and transconjugants. An Inc18-like vanA plasmid was identified in the VRSA isolate from case patient 7. These findings suggest a role of Inc18-like plasmids as vanA donors.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in 11 hospitals in Puerto Rico: results of an antimicrobial resistance management (ARM) program.
AB  - PURPOSE: The Antimicrobial Resistance Management Program (ARMP) was established in 1997 at the University of Florida as an ongoing project to document trends in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in inpatient/outpatient isolates and track resistance that may occur with specific antibiotic use. METHODS: Institutions are enrolled at no charge and provide a minimum of 3 years of antibiogram/sensitivity report data, which are reviewed to create a customized analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility trends benchmarked against national/regional comparators. The data, in a HIPAA-compliant non-identifying format, comprise a national aggregate database of 28.4 million isolates from 358 institutions. This database was interrogated to determine resistance rates for eleven hospitals in Puerto Rico from 1998-2003 and, as comparators, those in the database from the State of Florida and all U.S. institutions. RESULTS: Between 1996-2003, data on 328,837 isolates collected from 11 hospitals throughout Puerto Rico, 5,388,897 isolates from 46 institutions in Florida, and 24,951,098 isolates from 358 U.S. institutions for the following organisms (number of antibiotics tested against) were reviewed for susceptibility: coagulase-negative staphylococci (14)/Staphylococcus epidermidis (18), Enterococcus faecalis (7), Enterococcus faecium (5), Enterococcus species (4), Escherichia coli (24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (24), Proteus mirabilis (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), Serratia marcescens (22), Staphylococcus aureus (23), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9). Antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico varied organism to organism from that observed in Florida and nationally. CONCLUSIONS: This first broad analysis of antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico provides important baseline data, both for sentinel surveillance programs and for determining strategies for intervention.
TI  - Application of clindamycin in therapy of orthopaedic infections with special regard to applicability in outpatients practice.
AB  - Background. There is presented the applicability of clindamycin alone or combined with chinolon group antibiotics in therapy of orthopaedic infections. <br /> Material and methods. In the period 1998-2002 a group of 47 patients underwent therepy due to soft tisue infection within extremities (9 patients), osteomyelitis (30) and periprosthetic infection (8). In 21 cases there was acute (within 1 month) and in 26 cases chronic infection. Etiologicaf factors include: Staphylococcus aureus (35), Acinetobacter baumani, Corynebacterium parvum, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Serratia liquaefaciae, Morganella Morgagni. According to complex therapy protocol - procedure in deep infections included antimicrobial therapy and surgical debridement with application of garamycin spongue.<br /> Results. Goud results i.e. permanent infection control was achiewed in 18 cases. Acceptable results i.e. temporary infection healing was achiewed in 16 cases. Poor result i.e. insatisfactory infection control was stated in 13 cases. <br /> Conclusions. Clinical effectiveness of clindamycin therapy as only agent or part of complex therapy in orthopaedic infections is varying depending on chronicity of infection and possibilities of radical surgical intervention. In empiric antimicrobial therapy a combination of clindamycin with chinolon group antibiotics is favourable.
TI  - Improved diagnosis specificity in bone and joint infections using molecular techniques.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The microbiological diagnosis of osteoarticular infections currently  relies on microbiological cultures, to specifically target treatment. However, these conventional methods sometimes lack of sensitivity and of specificity to establish definitive diagnosis. This study was conducted to determine whether molecular method could improve bacterial bone and joint infection diagnosis. METHODS: We evaluated the performance of nucleic acid extraction with the semi-automated NucliSens miniMAG instrument coupled to 16S rDNA sequencing on 76 samples collected from 51 patients with suspected infections: prosthetic-joint infection (15), spondylodiscitis (7) acute septic arthritis (11) and 18 controls. No pre-treatment of the sample was done before nucleic acid extraction. Classification in infected group required an accumulation of arguments. RESULTS: Our molecular method identified a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fastidious bacteria like Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The overall PCR sensitivity was 73.3%: 53.8% for prosthetic-joint infections and 88.2% for infections without prostheses. The overall PCR specificity was 95.2%, whereas culture specificity was only 85.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The instrument was simple to use and provided nucleic acids free of PCR inhibitors and free of contamination by foreign bacterial DNA. Our study highlights the need for still improved molecular diagnostic sensitivity.
TI  - Bacillus subtilis: a shocking message from a probiotic.
AB  - How probiotics such as Bacillus subtilis exert a protective effect has been much  debated. In this issue of Cell Host & Microbe, Fujiya et al. reveal that a B. subtilis quorum-sensing signal molecule, the competence- and sporulation-stimulating factor (CSF), is internalized via the mammalian oligopeptide transporter OCTN2, where it induces the heat shock protein Hsp27, which protects intestinal cells against oxidant-mediated tissue damage and loss of barrier function.
TI  - A Staphylococcus aureus regulatory system that responds to host heme and modulates virulence.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus, a bacterium responsible for tremendous morbidity and mortality, exists as a harmless commensal in approximately 25% of humans. Identifying the molecular machinery activated upon infection is central to understanding staphylococcal pathogenesis. We describe the heme sensor system (HssRS) that responds to heme exposure and activates expression of the heme-regulated transporter (HrtAB). Inactivation of the Hss or Hrt systems leads to increased virulence in a vertebrate infection model, a phenotype that is associated with an inhibited innate immune response. We suggest that the coordinated activity of Hss and Hrt allows S. aureus to sense internal host tissues, resulting in tempered virulence to avoid excessive host tissue damage. Further, genomic analyses have identified orthologous Hss and Hrt systems in Bacillus anthracis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis, suggesting a conserved regulatory system by which Gram-positive pathogens sense heme as a molecular marker of internal host tissue and modulate virulence.
TI  - Reduction of bacteria on spinach, lettuce, and surfaces in food service areas using neutral electrolyzed oxidizing water.
AB  - Food safety issues and increases in food borne illnesses have promulgated the development of new sanitation methods to eliminate pathogenic organisms on foods and surfaces in food service areas. Electrolyzed oxidizing water (EO water) shows promise as an environmentally friendly broad spectrum microbial decontamination agent. EO water is generated by the passage of a dilute salt solution ( approximately 1% NaCl) through an electrochemical cell. This electrolytic process converts chloride ions and water molecules into chlorine oxidants (Cl(2), HOCl/ClO(-)). At a near-neutral pH (pH 6.3-6.5), the predominant chemical species is the highly biocidal hypochlorous acid species (HOCl) with the oxidation reduction potential (ORP) of the solution ranging from 800 to 900mV. The biocidal activity of near-neutral EO water was evaluated at 25 degrees C using pure cultures of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis. Treatment of these organisms, in pure culture, with EO water at concentrations of 20, 50, 100, and 120ppm total residual chlorine (TRC) and 10min of contact time resulted in 100% inactivation of all five organisms (reduction of 6.1-6.7log(10)CFU/mL). Spray treatment of surfaces in food service areas with EO water containing 278-310ppm TRC (pH 6.38) resulted in a 79-100% reduction of microbial growth. Dip (10min) treatment of spinach at 100 and 120ppm TRC resulted in a 4.0-5.0log(10)CFU/mL reduction of bacterial counts for all organisms tested. Dipping (10min) of lettuce at 100 and 120ppm TRC reduced bacterial counts of E. coli by 0.24-0.25log(10)CFU/mL and reduced all other organisms by 2.43-3.81log(10)CFU/mL.
TI  - [Transfer of erythromycin-resistance among strains and species of bacteria: plasmid conjugation method in enterococcal isolates].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study if the resistance to macrolide in Enterococcus can be transferred between strains, and species of the same and different genera. METHODS: Agar dilution was used to screen 30 enterococcal isolates that were resistant to erythromycin. Conjugation was performed by filter mating method. The 30 donor bacteria included 13 strains of Enterococcus faecalis, 16 strains of E. faecium, and 1 strain of E. hirae. The recipient bacteria included 1 strain of E. faecalis sensitive to erythromycin and resistant to tetracycline, and 1 strain of Staphylococcus aureus with the MIC against erythromycin of 0.25 approximately 1 microg/ml. Polymerase chain reaction was used to test the existence of ermB gene and the tranposons Tn1545 and Tn917 in the enterococcal isolates before and after filter mating. RESULTS: The transfer rate between different strains and species of the same genus were all 100%. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) against erythromycin of 13 conjugates were both 512 microg/ml, and Tn1545 and Tn917 were found in the ermB gene of 12 conjugates. 17 conjugates were obtained from 16 strains of donor E. faecium and 1 strain of E. hirae with the MIC(50) and MIC(90) both of 512 microg/ml. The ermB gene was found in 16 of the 17 conjugates, and 11 of the 16 conjugates showed the existence of Tn1545 and Tn917, Tn1545 existed in the ermB gene of 4 conjugates, and Tn917 existed in the ermB gene of 1 conjugate. 30 conjugates of Staphylococcus aureus were obtained by plasmid conjugation and transfer with a transfer rate of 100% and the MIC(50) and MIC(90) both of 512 microg/ml. The ermB gene was found in 28 of the 30 conjugates. Both Tn1545 and Tn917 were found in the ermB gene of 23 of the 28 conjugates, Tn1545 was found in the ermB gene of 4 conjugates, and Tn917 was found in the ermB gene of 1 conjugate. CONCLUSION: The resistance to macrolide of Enterococcus, related with the existence of ermB gene and transposons Tn1545 and Tn917, can be transferred between strains and species of same and different genera.
TI  - [Typical bacteria in an intensive care burn unit in severely burned patients and  their importance with regard to mortality: retrospective study 1995 - 2004].
AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify risk profiles for wound infection of severely burned patients in a retrospective analysis of patients of an intensive care burn unit during 1995 - 2004. The goal of this study was to identify risk factors on wound infection in severely burned patients. Possible influences on mortality were to be discussed. Inclusion criteria of the study population was a minimum age of 18 years and a body surface area burned of at least 40 % during the time period 1995 - 2004. 912 patients were screened and 96 patients were enrolled. Logistic regression was performed to investigate factors influencing wound infection and mortality in the study population. The initially detectable bacteria in the burn wounds were Staphylococcus aureus (21.1 %), Staphylococcus epidermidis (16.2 %) and Enterococcus faecalis (16.2 %). Of all swabs taken the most frequent initial discovered bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (18.2 %), Staphylococcus epidermidis (12.7 %), Enterococcus faecalis (12.7 %) and Escherichia coli (13.3 %). The majority of positive swabs were the burn wound followed by nose and tracheal secretion. The risk of a wound infection was more likely in the period 2000 - 2004 in comparison to 1995 - 1999 with an Odds Ratio of 0.17 (95 % KI [0.05 - 0.63], p = 0.008). Wound infection was promoted by longer hospitalization on the burn intensive care unit with an Odds Ratio of 2.62 (95 % KI [1.34 - 5.11], p = 0.005) and by bacterial detection in the unburned parts of the body with an Odds Ratio of 5.36 (95 % KI [1.30 - 22.24], p = 0.02). Death was significantly promoted by age (over 50 years) with an Odds Ratio of 11.62 (95 % KI [2.76 - 48.92], p = 0.0008), wound infection with an Odds Ratio of 0.12 (95 % KI [0.03 - 0.52], p = 0.004) and inhalation injury with an Odds Ratio of 5.95 (95 % KI [1.72 - 20.55], p = 0.005). During the study period a rise of wound infections could be notified. Promoting factors were longer hospitalization on the burn intensive care unit and bacterial detection in the unburned parts of the body. Regarding mortality, higher age, wound infection and inhalation injury were prognostic factors.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Antimicrobial lexitropsins containing amide, amidine, and alkene linking groups.
AB  - The synthesis and properties of 80 short minor groove binders related to distamycin and the thiazotropsins are described. The design of the compounds was principally predicated upon increased affinity arising from hydrophobic interactions between minor groove binders and DNA. The introduction of hydrophobic aromatic head groups, including quinolyl and benzoyl derivatives, and of alkenes as linkers led to several strongly active antibacterial compounds with MIC for Staphylococcus aureus, both methicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains, in the range of 0.1-5 microg mL-1, which is comparable to many established antibacterial agents. Antifungal activity was also found in the range of 20-50 microg mL-1 MIC against Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans, again comparable with established antifungal drugs. A quinoline derivative was found to protect mice against S. aureus infection for a period of up to six days after a single intraperitoneal dose of 40 mg kg-1.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of RWJ-54428 against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis in a neutropenic mouse thigh infection model.
AB  - RWJ-54428 (also known as MC-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with promising activity against gram-positive bacteria. The pharmacodynamics (PDs) of RWJ-54428 against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis were studied in a neutropenic mouse thigh infection model. The RWJ-54428 MICs ranged from 0.25 to 1 mg/liter. Mice with ca. 10(6) CFU/thigh at the initiation of therapy were treated intraperitoneally with RWJ-54428 at doses that ranged from 3 to 1,200 mg/kg of body weight/day (in 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 divided doses) for 24 h. The maximal reductions in bacterial counts in thigh tissues at 24 h for the methicillin-resistant S. aureus, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, and E. faecalis strains were -2.8, -3.8, and -1.7 log10 CFU/thigh, respectively. The percentage of a 24-h dosing interval that the unbound serum RWJ-54428 concentrations exceeded the MIC (fT>MIC) was the pharmacokinetic (PK)-PD parameter that best described the efficacy of RWJ-54428. The fT>MICs for a bacteriostatic effect (no net change in the numbers of CFU/thigh over 24 h) ranged from 14 to 20% for staphylococci and streptococci; for maximal reductions in the numbers of CFU/thigh, the fT>MICs ranged from 22 to 36% for these strains. For E. faecalis, the ranges of fT>MICs for static and maximal effects were 30 to 46% and 55 to 60%, respectively. These data show that treatment with RWJ-54428 results in marked antibacterial effects in vivo, with the PK-PD parameters for efficacy being comparable to those for the efficacy of penicillins and carbapenems active against staphylococci and pneumococci.
TI  - Postoperative pneumonia after major pulmonary resections: an unsolved problem in  thoracic surgery.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotics currently recommended for prophylaxis in thoracic surgery are first-generation and second-generation cephalosporins. Despite this prophylaxis, postoperative pneumonia after major pulmonary resections remains frequent and severe. However, in the medical literature, the origin of these infections is poorly documented. METHODS: To evaluate the efficiency of current prophylactic regimens, we retrospectively analyzed 312 consecutive cases of major pulmonary resection, performed between January 2000 and December 2004. For patients who experienced postoperative pulmonary infection, the microbiologic agents and their antibiotic susceptibility were studied. RESULTS: A postoperative pneumonia was diagnosed in 76 patients (24.4% +/- 0.43%). Sixty patients (78.9%) experienced the infection in the first 5 postoperative days. A microbiologic documentation was obtained in 44 cases (57.9%) with 56 microorganisms involved. Pathogens responsible for the infections were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 10), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 8), group B Streptococcus organisms (n = 1), nongroupable Streptococcus organisms (n = 2), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1), Haemophilus spp. (n = 9), Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 2), Enterobacteriaceae (n = 15), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1), and Candida spp. (n = 4). According to the antibiotic susceptibility testings, the prophylactic regimen by cefazolin proved ineffective for 84% of the microbiologically documented cases. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the inefficiency of current prophylaxis against pathogens involved in postoperative pneumonia after major lung resections. Evaluation of new and more-adapted approaches of antibiotic prophylaxis should be the subject of prospective multicenter trials.

TI  - Bacterial examination of endodontic infections by clonal analysis in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine the diversity of bacterial  species in the infected root canals of teeth associated with endodontic abscesses by cloning and sequencing techniques in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. METHODS: Samples collected from five infected root canals were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with universal 16S ribosomal DNA primers. Products of these PCRs were cloned and sequenced. Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) was used as a screening method to reduce the number of clones necessary for DNA sequencing. RESULTS: All samples were positive for the presence of bacteria and a range of 7-13 different bacteria were found per root canal sample. In total, 48 different oral clones were detected among the five root canal samples. Olsenella profusa was the only species present in all samples. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Dialister pneumosintes, Dialister invisus, Lachnospiraceae oral clone, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Enterococcus faecalis were found in two of the five samples. The majority of the taxa were present in only one sample, for example Tannerella forsythia, Shuttleworthia satelles and Filifactor alocis. Some facultative anaerobes that are frequently isolated from endodontic infections such as E. faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus and Lactobacillus spp. were also found in this study. CONCLUSION: Clonal analysis of the microflora associated with endodontic infections revealed a wide diversity of oral species.
TI  - Pretreatment with the protegrin IB-367 affects Gram-positive biofilm and enhances the therapeutic efficacy of linezolid in animal models of central venous catheter infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biofilms play an important role in the pathogenesis of several chronic infections and nosocomial infections related to indwelling medical devices. METHODS: To assess the efficacy of IB-367 and linezolid (LZD) in the treatment of central venous catheter (CVC) infections using the antibiotic-lock technique, in vitro and in vivo studies were performed. The in vitro antibiotic susceptibility assay for Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis biofilms developed on 96-well polystyrene tissue culture plates was performed to determine the activity of the compounds. Efficacy studies were performed in rat models of Gram-positive CVC infection. Silastic catheters were implanted into the superior cava of adult male Wistar rats. Twenty-four hours after implantation, the catheters were pretreated by filling with IB-367. Thirty minutes later, rats were challenged via the CVC with 1.0 x 10(6) CFU (colony forming units) of S aureus strain diffuse Smith and clinical isolate of slime-producing E faecalis. Administration of LZD into the CVC at a concentration equal to the minimum bacteriocidal concentration observed using adherent cells or at a much higher concentration (1024 microg/mL) began 24 hours later. RESULTS: Both for S aureus and E faecalis, the killing activities of LZD against adherent bacteria were at least 4-fold to 8-fold lower than that against freely growing cells. For both strains, in IB-367-pretreated wells, LZD strongly increases its activity. The in vivo studies showed that when CVCs were pretreated with IB-367, Gram-positive biofilm bacterial load was further decreased to 10(1) CFU/mL and bacteremia was not detected. CONCLUSIONS: IB-367 has potential as an adjunctive agent to LZD in the treatment of Gram-positive biofilm infections such as CVC infections.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of extended 9-glycyl-amido-minocyclines.
AB  - The need for self-protecting polymer or alloy implants resistant to a broad spectrum of bacterial challenges led us to investigate covalent bonding of minocycline (MIN), a tetracycline derivative, to polystyrene beads and to titanium alloy foils by oligoethylene glycol spacers. 9-Hydrazino-acetyl-amido-MIN, and simpler glycylcycline derivatives, retained minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against Staphylococcus aureus comparable to MIN. However, PEG-glycyl-amido-MIN showed very low activity. Hence, we coupled 9-hydrazino-acetyl-amido-MIN to the aldehyde termini of oligoethylene glycol spacers bonded to polystyrene and titanium alloy surfaces to form acid-releasable hydrazone linkages. 9-Hydrazino-acetyl-amido-MIN was released from the monolayers more rapidly at pH 5.0 than at pH 7.4.

TI  - Preoperative sterilization and disinfection of drill guide templates.
AB  - The aim of the in vitro study was to evaluate the decontamination potential of common antiseptic solutions for heat-sensitive implantological drill guide templates. One hundred implantologists were evaluated on the basis of a questionnaire for their measures of disinfection. On the basis of these results, 80% alcohol, Octenidine 0.1%, and Chlorhexidine 0.12% were tested in an in vitro model for their decontamination efficacy for heat-sensitive plastic material infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. The microorganisms were selected on the basis of results of environmental testing of dental laboratories. The results of the questionnaire revealed that Chlorhexidine was used by 30%, 80% alcohol by 23%, and Octenidine by 7% of the dentists. Using the in vitro model, with the exception of S. aureus, Chlorhexidine was not able to completely eliminate the microorganisms after 15 min of application. In contrast, the treatment with Octenidine revealed no further growth of the tested microorganisms after that time. The 80% alcohol was more efficient. No growth of microorganisms could be detected in any of the tests after 5 min of incubation. On the basis of our results and due to the fact that suitable installations for sterilization were hardly used by the dental practitioners, the disinfection of templates should be preferentially performed with 80% alcohol or Octenidine using an incubation time of 15 min with ultrasonication.
TI  - In vitro activity of novel rifamycins against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - We describe novel rifamycins that have improved activity, compared with rifampin, against clinical isolates of staphylococci and streptococci, with MIC(90)s of 0.008 and 0.0005 microg/ml, respectively. This enhanced antibacterial activity, along with their potential lack of drug-drug interactions, are considerations that suggest the potential of these novel rifamycins in combination therapy to treat serious Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Controlled release of vancomycin from cross-linked gelatine.
AB  - This paper explores the possibility of using biodegradable cross-linked gelatines as antibiotic devices for a long-term elution (80 days). Capillary electrophoresis (CE) has been utilized to evaluate the mass percentage of vancomycin and gelatine contemporary released from differently cross-linked vancomycin loaded gelatine samples in an elution time ranging from 24 to 1920 h. While the solubilization kinetic of gelatine samples differently cross-linked can be very close described by the simplified Higuchi model, the vancomycin release kinetic is contemporary governed by both the Fickian diffusion process trough the gelatine matrix network and the dissolution process of the matrix due to its degradation. Comparing the antibiotic eluting kinetics from gelatine at diverse cross-linking degree we observed that the degradation of the proteic matrix appears to have a minor influence in the drug release control. Vancomycin released from all the gelatine partially cross-linked samples results active against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis which represent the most pathogens commonly isolated in orthopaedic infections. Vancomycin overcomes the minimum inhibitory concentration for both the bacteria in the whole range of elution time. Cross-linked gelatine devices appear to represent a useful biodegradable delivery system for local anti-infective therapy in arthoplasty.

TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some Salvia species essential oils from Iran.
AB  - The aerial parts of Salvia multicaulis, S. sclarea and S. verticillata were collected at full flowering stage. The essential oils were isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by combination of capillary GC and GC-MS. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oils were studied against eight Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumulis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger). The results of antibacterial activity tests of the essential oils according to the disc diffusion method and MIC values indicated that all the samples have moderate to high inhibitory activity against the tested bacteria except for P. aeruginosa which was totally resistant. In contrast to antibacterial activity, the oils exhibited no or slight antifungal property, in which only the oil of S. multicaulis showed weak activity against two tested yeasts, C. albicans and S. cerevisiae.
TI  - Mathematical models of cobalt and iron ions catalyzed microwave bacterial deactivation.
AB  - Time differences for Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli survival during microwave irradiation (power 130 W) in the presence of aqueous cobalt and iron ions were investigated. Measured dependencies had "bell" shape forms with maximum bacterial viability between 1 - 2 min becoming insignificant at 3 minutes. The deactivation time for E. faecalis, S. aureus and E.coli in the presence of metal ions were smaller compared to a water control (4 -5 min). Although various sensitivities to the metal ions were observed, S. aureus and E. coli and were the most sensitive for cobalt and iron, respectively. The rapid reduction of viable bacteria during microwave treatment in the presence of metal ions could be explained by increased metal ion penetration into bacteria. Additionally, microwave irradiation may have increased the kinetic energy of the metal ions resulting in lower survival rates. The proposed mathematical model for microwave heating took into account the "growth" and "death" factors of the bacteria, forming second degree polynomial functions. Good relationships were found between the proposed mathematical models and the experimental data for bacterial deactivation (coefficient of correlation 0.91 - 0.99).
TI  - Functional and structural properties of CbpA, a collagen-binding protein from Arcanobacterium pyogenes.
AB  - Arcanobacterium pyogenes, an opportunistic pathogen of economically important food animals, is the causative agent of liver abscesses in feedlot cattle, osteomyelitis in turkeys, and pneumonia and arthritis in pigs. Previous studies identified the first A. pyogenes adhesin, CbpA, a protein located on the bacterial surface which has the ability to bind collagen and promotes adhesion to the host cells. The protein has an N-terminal ligand-binding region (region A) and a C-terminal repetitive domain (region B). In this study we found that CbpA bound to almost all the collagen types tested but not to other proteins, and it displayed a propensity to interact with several collagenous peptides derived by CNBr cleavage of type I and II collagens. The K(D) values of CbpA for type I and II collagens and collagen peptides determined by solid-phase binding assay and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence were in the range of 1-15 nM. It was also found that CbpA and its A region bound fibronectin, and that collagen and fibronectin interacted with distinct subsites. Anti-CbpA antibodies were effective at inhibiting both binding of isolated CbpA and bacterial adhesion to immobilized collagen, suggesting that CbpA is a functional collagen-binding adhesin. Analysis of the immunological cross-reactivity of CbpA with antibodies against other bacterial collagen-binding proteins indicated that CbpA is immunologically related to ACE from Enterococcus faecalis but not to CNA from Staphylococcus aureus or Acm from Enterococcus faecium. Far-UV and near-UV circular dichroism spectra showed that full-length CbpA and its region A are mainly composed of beta-sheet with only a minor alpha-helical component and that both the proteins have a well-defined tertiary structure.
TI  - Characterization and technological properties of Staphylococcus xylosus strains isolated from a Tunisian traditional salted meat.
AB  - The technological properties of strains of Staphylococcus xylosus were studied to select the most suitable for use as starter cultures for the production of dried fermented meat products. Strains of S. xylosus were isolated from traditional salted Tunisian meat and were identified by biochemical and molecular methods. Thirty strains of S. xylosus were studied to evaluate their catalase, nitrate reductase, lipolytic, proteolytic and antibacterial activities as well as growth ability at different temperatures, pH's and NaCl concentrations. All strains of S. xylosus had catalase activity and were able to reduce nitrates to nitrites. The nitrate reductase activity increased when the strains were kept under anaerobic conditions. Proteolytic activity on milk and on gelatin agar was demonstrated for 100% and 83.3% of the S. xylosus isolates, respectively. However extracellular proteolytic activity as assessed by the azocasein method was poor in all the strains. Lipolytic activity as assessed by the agar method showed that 76.6% of strains of S. xylosus could hydrolyze Tween 20 against 33.3% that could hydrolyze tributyrin. Tween 80 was hydrolyzed by only 10% of strains. Strains of S. xylosus hydrolyzed pork fat better than beef and lamb fat. The majority of strains had antibacterial activity against Salmonella arizonae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeuroginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - New antimicrobial agents as therapy for resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Vancomycin- and methicillin-resistant gram-positive cocci have emerged as an increasingly problematic cause of hospital-acquired infections. We conducted a literature review of newer antibiotics with activity against vancomycin-resistant and methicillin-resistant gram-positive cocci. Quinupristin/dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline have in vitro activity for methicillin-resistant staphylococci and are superior to vancomycin for vancomycin-resistant isolates. Dalbavancin, telavancin, and oritavancin are new glycopeptides that have superior pharmacodynamic properties compared to vancomycin. We review the antibacterial spectrum, clinical indications and contraindications, pharmacologic properties, and adverse events associated with each of these agents. Daptomycin has rapid bactericidal activity for Staphylococcus aureus and is approved for use in bacteremia and right-sided endocarditis. Linezolid is comparable to vancomycin in patients with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and has pharmacoeconomic advantages given its oral formulation. Quinupristin/dalfopristin is the drug of choice for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections but has no activity against Enterococcus faecalis. Tigecycline has activity against both enterococcus species and MRSA; it is also active against Enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes which allows for use in intra-abdominal and diabetic foot infections. A review of numerous in vitro and animal model studies shows that interaction between these newer agents and other antistaphylococcal agents for S. aureus are usually indifferent (additive).
TI  - Characterization of the organ donor with bacteremia.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The presence of bloodstream infection in the donor is a common finding that could be transmitted to the recipient. To safely expand the donor pool, we examined its relevance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We described the clinical characteristics of organ donors grafted in our center between 1997 and 2006 who had bacteremia detected in blood cultures obtained during organ procurement. RESULTS: Among 1353 organ donors, 75 were non-heart-beating donors type II and the others brain-dead donors. Only 186 donors (14%) showed bacteremia during retrieval. This mean age was 49.8 years (range 12 to 86 years, SD 18) including 63% men. Causes of death were cerebrovascular accident in 60%; craneoencephalic trauma, 25%; and other causes, 15%. The average length of the intensive care unit stay was 3 days (interquartile range: 2 to 7 days). Twenty-nine percent of donors presented previous infectious complications (90% from respiratory origin). The most prevalent pathogen isolated in blood cultures was coagulase negative Staphylococci (46,2%), followed by S aureus (15%), Streptococcus group viridans (9.1%), enterobacteria (9%), Enterococcus faecalis (7.5%) and gram-negative bacilli nonfermentative (6.2%). In 3.1%, the bloodstream infections were polymicrobial. The bronchial aspiration cultures were positive in 50% of cases and the urine culture in 8,6%. In 17% of donors the isolated microorganism was coincident between blood and bronchial cultures. Pseudomonas spp and S aureus were more common than the others (P = .004 and P = .058, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of bacteremia in our cohort was 14%. The respiratory tract was the most common clinical focus. Pseudomonas spp or S aureus isolated in bronchial cultures are risk factors to develop bacteremia. According to these findings, it is important to start specific antibiotics against those microorganisms in the donor and the recipients.
TI  - Quantitative detection of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis DNA in  blood to diagnose bacteremia in patients in the intensive care unit.
AB  - Direct detection of bacterial DNA in blood offers a fast alternative to blood culture and is presumably unaffected by the prior use of antibiotics. We evaluated the performance of two real-time PCR assays for the quantitative detection of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and for Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia directly in blood samples, without prior cultivation. Whole-blood samples for PCR were obtained simultaneously with blood cultures from patients admitted to the intensive care unit of our hospital. After the extraction of DNA from 200 mul of blood, real-time PCR was performed for the specific detection and quantification of S. aureus and E. faecalis DNA. The sensitivity for bacteremia of the S. aureus PCR was 75% and that of the E. faecalis PCR was 73%, and both tests had high specificity values (93 and 96%, respectively). PCR amplification reactions were positive for S. aureus for 10 (7%) blood samples with negative blood cultures, and 7 (4%) PCR reactions were positive for E. faecalis. The majority of these PCR results were likely (50%) or possibly (42%) related to infection with the specific microorganism, based on clinical data and radiological and microbiological investigations. PCR results were concordant for 95% of paired whole-blood samples, and blood culture results were concordant for 97% of the paired samples. We conclude that the detection of S. aureus and E. faecalis DNA in blood by real-time PCR enables a rapid diagnosis of bacteremia and that a positive DNAemia is related to proven or possible infection with the specific microorganism in the majority of patients with negative blood cultures.

AB  - The antimicrobial activity in the vapor-phase of laboratory-made flexible films of polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene/ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (PE/EVOH) incorporating essential oil of cinnamon ( Cinnamomum zeylanicum), oregano ( Origanum vulgare), clove ( Syzygium aromaticum), or cinnamon fortified with cinnamaldehyde was evaluated against a wide range of microorganisms: the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella choleraesuis; the Gram-positive bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis; the molds Penicillium islandicum, Penicillium roqueforti, Penicillium nalgiovense, Eurotium repens, and A spergillus flavus and the yeasts Candida albicans, Debaryomyces hansenii, and Zigosaccharomyces rouxii. Films with a nominal concentration of 4% (w/w) of fortified cinnamon or oregano essential oil completely inhibited the growth of the fungi; higher concentrations were required to inhibit the Gram-positive bacteria (8 and 10%, respectively), and higher concentrations still were necessary to inhibit the Gram-negative bacteria. PP films were more effective than PE/EVOH films. The atmospheres generated by the antimicrobial films inside Petri dishes were quantitatively analyzed using headspace-single drop microextraction (HS-SDME) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The analyses showed that the oregano-fortified PP films released higher levels of carvacrol and thymol, and the cinnamon-fortified PP films released higher levels of cinnamaldehyde, during the first 3-6 h of incubation, than the corresponding PE/EVOH films. Shelf-life tests were also performed, demonstrating that the antifungal activities of the films persisted for more than two months after their manufacture. In addition, migration tests (overall and specific) were performed, using both aqueous and fatty simulants, to ensure that the films meet EU regulations regarding food contact materials. Following contact with the tested films, the substances that had migrated into the aqueous simulants were recovered by direct immersion-single drop extraction (DI-SDME) and then analyzed by GC-MS. The fatty stimulant (isooctane) was directly injected into the chromatographic system.
TI  - Diversity of bacterial isolates from commercial and homemade composts.
AB  - The diversity of heterotrophic bacterial isolates of three commercial and two homemade composts was studied. The commercial composts were produced from poultry litter (PC), sewage sludge (SC), municipal solid waste (MC), and homemade composts (thermal compost [DC] and vermicompost [VC]) from food wastes. The taxonomic and physiological diversity of the heterotrophic culturable bacteria was assessed using phenotypic and genotypic characterization and the analysis of the partial 16S rRNA gene sequence. Composts DC and SC presented the higher genotypic diversity, as could be inferred from the number of distinct genotypic patterns observed, 28 and 21, respectively. Gram-positive bacteria, mainly Firmicutes, were predominant in all the composts. Some organisms related with taxa rarely reported in composts, as Rhodanobacter spathiphylli, Moraxella osloensis, Lysobacter, Corynebacterium, Pigmentiphaga kullae, and new taxa were also isolated. The highest relative proportion of isolates able to degrade starch was found in compost SC (> 70%), to degrade gelatine in compost DC (> 70%), to degrade Tween 80 in compost PC (> 90%), and to degrade poly-epsilon-caprolactones in compost DC (> 80%). Compost MC presented the lowest relative proportions of isolates able to degrade starch (< 25%), gelatine (< 20%), and poly-epsilon-caprolactone (< 40%). When compared with the others, the homemade composts presented higher relative proportions of Gram-positive isolates able to inhibit the target organisms Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In compost MC, none of the Gram-positive isolates was able to inhibit those targets.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among organisms from the Asia/Pacific Rim, Europe and Latin and North America collected as part of TEST and the in vitro activity of tigecycline.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe antimicrobial susceptibility among bacterial isolates associated with hospital infections collected from 266 centres in Asia/Pacific Rim (n = 1,947), North America (n = 24,283), Latin America (n = 1,957) and Europe (n = 8,796). METHODS: Isolates were collected from blood, respiratory tract, urine, skin, wound, body fluids and other defined sources between January 2004 and August 2006. Only one isolate per patient was accepted. In vitro MICs for the isolates were determined according to the CLSI (formerly NCCLS) guidelines. RESULTS: Key organisms collected were Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2,902), Enterobacter spp. (n = 5,731), Escherichia coli (n = 6,504), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4,916), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 5,128), Serratia marcescens (n = 2,313), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 2,701), Enterococcus faecium (n = 1,035) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5,753). Rates of methicillin resistance among S. aureus and of vancomycin resistance among enterococci were highest in North America (2,016/3,809, 52.9% and 571/2,544, 22.4%, respectively) and lowest in Europe (337/1,340, 25.1% and 36/916, 3.9%, respectively). Tigecycline was the only antimicrobial to maintain activity against all Gram-positive isolates (MIC(90) values of <or=0.25 mg/L). Overall, tigecycline and imipenem were the most active (>93% susceptibility in all regions) antimicrobials against the Gram-negative species, except for A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. Piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin were the most active against P. aeruginosa. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers among K. pneumoniae occurred most frequently in Latin America (124/282, 44.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Tigecycline is a novel broad-spectrum antimicrobial that is active against the common organisms associated with infections.
TI  - Susceptibility of staphylococci and enterococci to antimicrobial agents at different ward levels in four north European countries.
AB  - A multicentre susceptibility study was performed on staphylococci and enterococci isolated from patients at 3 different ward levels: primary care centres (PCCs), general hospital wards (GHWs) and intensive care units (ICUs), in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. There was a markedly higher incidence of resistance among CoNS in ICUs compared to GHWs and PCCs. Resistance rates were low among S. aureus isolates and no differences were found between the ward levels. Oxacillin resistance was found among 1.6% of S. aureus and 47% of CoNS isolates. 14% of CoNS and 0.9% of S. aureus isolates were glycopeptide intermediate. The prevalence of E. faecium isolates in this study differed significantly between the ward levels with the lowest prevalence found at PCCs. High level gentamicin resistant (HLGR) enterococci occurred in 11-25% of E. faecium and 6-20% of E. faecalis isolates. The HLGR rate was significantly higher among E. faecalis from hospitalized patients (GHWs and ICUs) compared to patients at PCCs. For enterococcal isolates, no other significant differences in antimicrobial resistance were found between the ward levels. All enterococci were teicoplanin susceptible, but decreased susceptibility to vancomycin was found among 2.0% and 0.6% of the E. faecium and E. faecalis isolates, respectively.
TI  - [Species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility tests by the fully automated RAISUS using an early-harvested cell suspension].
AB  - We evaluated the usefulness of an early-harvested bacterial cell suspension to the fully automated RAISUS (Nissui Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., Tokyo) to provide the results of species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testings within a day after overnight-incubation of the primary cultures. A single, well-separated colony appeared on the primary culture plate was transferred onto a blood agar or chocolate agar plates, then incubated for 3 to 6 hours. The cell suspension to the RAISUS was properly prepared to the McFarland 0.5 turbidity from the early-harvested bacterial cells. When the five ATCC reference strains, consisting of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, were repeatedly tested for the species-identification, all the identification results were acceptable. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were evaluated with the above five strains and Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247. The results obtained indicated that the most susceptibility test results were comparable to those MICs obtained by the standard test procedure, but some strains, in particular, H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa gave significantly discrepant MICs for certain antimicrobial agents. The significant discrepancy in MIC determinations regarded the difference of viable cell concentrations in the cell suspension prepared respectively. Through the analysis of laboratory workflow, it became to apparent that 18S to 20S of the tests were completed by 5:00 p.m., and it required to wait until 3:00 a.m. to complete 90S of the tests. With these results, the early-harvested bacterial cell suspension is applicable to species-identification by RAISUS, but it is necessary to adjust viable cell concentrations to antimicrobial susceptibility test. Also, it is urgent to reconstitute a daily workflow to improve the rapidity of RAISUS test function.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis constitutes an unusual bacterial model in lysozyme resistance.
AB  - Lysozyme is an important and widespread compound of the host constitutive defense system, and it is assumed that Enterococcus faecalis is one of the few bacteria that are almost completely lysozyme resistant. On the basis of the sequence analysis of the whole genome of E. faecalis V583 strain, we identified two genes that are potentially involved in lysozyme resistance, EF_0783 and EF_1843. Protein products of these two genes share significant homology with Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan O-acetyltransferase (OatA) and Streptococcus pneumoniae N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase (PgdA), respectively. In order to determine whether EF_0783 and EF_1843 are involved in lysozyme resistance, we constructed their corresponding mutants and a double mutant. The DeltaEF_0783 mutant and DeltaEF_0783 DeltaEF_1843 double mutant were shown to be more sensitive to lysozyme than the parental E. faecalis JH2-2 strain and DeltaEF_1843 mutant were. However, compared to other bacteria, such as Listeria monocytogenes or S. pneumoniae, the tolerance of DeltaEF_0783 and DeltaEF_0783 DeltaEF_1843 mutants towards lysozyme remains very high. Peptidoglycan structure analysis showed that EF_0783 modifies the peptidoglycan by O acetylation of N-acetyl muramic acid, while the EF_1843 deletion has no obvious effect on peptidoglycan structure under the same conditions. Moreover, the EF_0783 and EF_1843 deletions seem to significantly affect the ability of E. faecalis to survive within murine macrophages. In all, while EF_0783 is currently involved in the lysozyme resistance of E. faecalis, peptidoglycan O acetylation and de-N-acetylation are not the main mechanisms conferring high levels of lysozyme resistance to E. faecalis.
TI  - The antimicrobial and antifungal activity of a root canal core material.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The authors conducted an in vitro study to determine the antimicrobial and antifungal activity of a recently introduced thermoplastic, synthetic, polymer-based polyester root canal core material (Resilon, Resilon Research, Madison, Conn.) against five different microorganisms by means of the agar diffusion test over different periods. METHODS: The microorganisms tested were Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Porphyromonas endodontalis and Candida albicans. A microbiologist transferred Resilon cones and gutta-percha cones to the inoculated agar and incubated them at 37 C, either aerobically or anaerobically, as required for optimal growth. RESULTS: The Resilon cones exhibited no antimicrobial effect against any of the bacteria tested, except for S. aureus. It showed antimicrobial efficacy against S. aureus during the first 24-hour period (P < .05). However, after 48 and 72 hours, Resilon cones no longer inhibited the growth of S. aureus. In addition, the material demonstrated no antifungal activity during any of the three testing periods. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that the antibacterial and antifungal efficacy of the Resilon cone is not superior to that of conventional gutta-percha. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Clinicians should not use the new root canal core material for its antimicrobial or antifungal efficacy.
TI  - Bacteria induce CTGF and CYR61 expression in epithelial cells in a lysophosphatidic acid receptor-dependent manner.
AB  - Cysteine-rich protein 61 (Cyr61/CCN1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) are members of the CCN (CYR61, CTGF, nephroblastoma overexpressed gene) family and exert pleiotropic functions such as regulation of adhesion, migration, extracellular matrix deposition, or cell differentiation, and play an important role in wound healing. This study focused on the nature of the so far unknown CTGF and CYR61 mRNA expression of epithelial cells after infection with bacteria. We demonstrate that infection of epithelial cells with attenuated Yersinia enterocolitica lacking the virulence plasmid pYV leads to the expression of CYR61 and CTGF. Virulent Y. enterocolitica bearing the pYV virulence plasmid suppressed the mRNA expression of these genes. Yersinia-mediated inhibition of CTGF and CYR61 mRNA expression is partially mediated by the cysteine protease YopT. Further characterization of the Yersinia factors, which trigger CTGF and CYR61 mRNA expression, demonstrated that these factors were secreted and could be enriched in lipid extracts. Beside Yersinia, several other bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, or Staphylococcus aureus, as well as supernatants of these bacteria induced CTGF and CYR61 expression. Blocking experiments with the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor-specific inhibitor Ki16425 suggest a general involvement of LPA receptors in bacteria-triggered CTGF and CYR61 expression. These data suggest that LPA receptor-dependent expression of CTGF and CYR61 represents a common host response after interaction with bacteria.
TI  - Penetration of gatifloxacin eye drops into the aqueous humor in humans.
AB  - The authors topically administered gatifloxacin (GFLX) into the eye before cataract surgery and measured the concentrations of this agent to determine its penetration into aqueous humor. Seventy-seven patients with age-related cataracts who underwent cataract surgery were enrolled in this study. They received 0.3% GFLX ophthalmic solution 4 times at 30-min intervals, beginning 2 h before surgery. Aqueous humor was aspirated from the anterior chamber and assayed for GFLX concentration using high-performance liquid chromatography. The mean intraoperative GFLX concentration in aqueous humor was 0.485 +/- 0.328 microg/mL. GFLX level was 0.573 +/- 0.367 microg/mL in elderly patients, at least 70 years of age, and was significantly higher than that (0.322 +/- 0.135 microg/mL) in the patients less than 70 years old. This concentration was close to or higher than the minimum inhibitory concentrations required to inhibit the growth of 90% of major pathogens of endophthalmitis (MIC90), such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis associated with poor prognosis, other than Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) in vitro. The GFLX concentrations found in aqueous humor samples were sufficient to kill bacteria other than S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa, and MRSA in vitro.
TI  - Development of a surgical site infection (SSI) surveillance system, calculation of SSI rates and specification of important factors affecting SSI in a digestive organ surgical department.
AB  - We have developed an original system to conduct surgical site infection (SSI) surveillance. This system accumulates SSI surveillance information based on the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) System and the Japanese Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (JNIS) System. The features of this system are as follows: easy input of data, high generality, data accuracy, SSI rate by operative procedure and risk index category (RIC) can be promptly calculated and compared with the current NNIS SSI rate, and the SSI rates and accumulated data can be exported electronically. Using this system, we monitored 798 patients in 24 operative procedure categories in the Digestive Organs Surgery Department of Mazda Hospital, Mazda Motor Corporation, from January 2004 through December 2005. The total number and rate of SSI were 47 and 5.89%, respectively. The SSI rates of 777 patients were calculated based on 15 operative procedure categories and Risk Index Categories (RIC). The highest SSI rate was observed in the rectum surgery of RIC 1 (30%), followed by the colon surgery of RIC3 (28.57%). About 30% of the isolated infecting bacteria were Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. Using quantification theory type 2, the American Society of Anesthesiology score (4.531), volume of hemorrhage under operation (3.075), wound classification (1.76), operation time (1.352), and history of diabetes (0.989) increased to higher ranks as factors for SSI. Therefore, we evaluated this system as a useful tool in safety control for operative procedures.
TI  - LEADER surveillance program results for 2006: an activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid using clinical isolates from the United States (50 medical centers).
AB  - Surveillance for emerging linezolid resistance among commonly occurring Gram-positive pathogens in the United States began with the 2002 ZAAPS program and more recently (2004) expanded as the LEADER program. The 2006 LEADER program processed 5374 strains from 50 medical centers (100 per site) located within the 9 US census regions; species and number tested by broth microdilution (% linezolid susceptible) included Staphylococcus aureus (2913, >99.9), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNSs) (808, 98.4), enterococci (547, 97.4), Streptococcus pneumoniae (546, 100.0), viridans group streptococci (189, 100.0), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (371, 100.0). In addition to 1 linezolid-nonsusceptible S. aureus, 3 strains were daptomycin-nonsusceptible, 4 were quinupristin/dalfopristin-intermediate, 2 were vancomycin-intermediate (vancomycin MIC values, 4 mug/mL), and all were methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Among the linezolid-resistant isolates (1 S. aureus, 13 CoNSs, 3 Enterococcus faecalis, and 10 Enterococcus faecium isolates), all but 3 Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates had the G2567T mutation. Overall, 99.55% of the tested 2006 LEADER program isolates remained susceptible to linezolid at current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints.
TI  - Infective endocarditis associated with spondylodiscitis and frequent secondary epidural abscess.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although many patients with IE complain of joint, muscle, and back pain, infections at these sights are rare. Indeed, in patients with back pain and endocarditis, less than 4% actually demonstrate spondylodiscitis. CASE DESCRIPTION: We recently encountered 4 patients with this complication, one each caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus mitis, and Enterococcus faecalis, and wondered whether the nature of the infecting organism determined the development of spondylodiscitis and epidural abscess. In a literature review, 36 patients with endocarditis and spondylodiscitis were identified. Only 9 (25%) were caused by Streptococcus viridans and the remainder by staphylococci, enterococci, and other streptococci. Usually more than 50% of all cases of IE were caused by Streptococcus viridans, although more recent studies would indicate an incidence of about 40%. CONCLUSION: We conclude that spondylodiscitis with epidural abscess is more likely to occur in those patients with endocarditis who are infected by organisms with pyogenic potential.
TI  - QSAR studies on benzoylaminobenzoic acid derivatives as inhibitors of beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III.
AB  - Fatty acid biosynthesis is essential for most of the bacterial survival. Components of this biosynthetic pathway have been identified as attractive targets for the development of new antibacterial agents. FabH, beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III, is a attractive target since it is central to the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies have been carried out on a series of benzoylaminobenzoic acid derivatives as potent inhibitors of FabH and antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Neisseria meningitidis and Escherichia coli, which demonstrate FabH inhibitory activity in cell free and whole cell system. The QSAR studies revealed that inhibitory activity increases with increase in hydrophobicity, molar refractivity, aromaticity, and presence of OH group (on x position of the nucleus). On the other side presence of hetero-atoms like N, O, or S at R(1) position of the nucleus decreases the inhibitory activity. The comparison of QSAR between the FabH inhibitory activity and antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, E. faecalis, N. meningitidis also demonstrates that the hydrophobicity, aromaticity and presence of OH group (on x position of the nucleus) are conducive for the inhibitory activity.
TI  - Pumilicin 4, a novel bacteriocin with anti-MRSA and anti-VRE activity produced by newly isolated bacteria Bacillus pumilus strain WAPB4.
AB  - A total of 34 bacterial strains with anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) activity were isolated from 69 soil and water samples collected from four areas of Thailand. One strain, WAPB4 identified as Bacillus pumilus, showed remarkable antibacterial activity against MRSA, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), and several Gram-positive test bacteria. Bacteriocin produced by WAPB4 was designated as pumilicin 4. It was heat stable up to 121 degrees C, 15 min and active within the pH range of 3-9. Its activity disappeared when treated with pronase E, chymotrypsin, and trypsin, demonstrating its proteinaceous nature. At high dosage (80 AU mL(-1)), the effect of pumilicin 4 was bactericidal to both MRSA and VRE. Bacteriostasis was observed for a low dose of bacteriocin (20 AU mL(-1)). Purification of pumilicin 4 was performed by a three-step procedure, i.e., solvent extraction, solid phase extraction, and reversed-phase chromatography. The molecular mass of purified pumilicin 4 as determined by mass spectrometry was 1994.62 Dalton. This present study is the first report of a novel bacteriocin, pumilicin 4, produced by B. pumilus that has potential for use as an alternative antibacterial agent for the treatment of infection with MRSA and VRE.
TI  - Gram-positive bloodstream infections in liver transplant recipients: incidence, risk factors, and impact on survival.
AB  - The objective of the study was to assess the incidence, risk factors, and survival of gram-positive bloodstream infections (GP-BSI(s)) among liver transplant recipients during the first year after transplantation. Between October 2000 and September 2006, 42 episodes of GP-BSI(s) occurred in 205 patients with an overall incidence of 0.20 episodes/patient. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were detected in 45.2% of cases, Enterococcus species in 42.9% (E faecalis, eight; E faecium, seven; E avium, two; E gallinarum, one) and Staphylococcus aureus in 11.9%. Retransplantation was the only independent risk factor for GP-BSI (odds ratio [OR], 0.253; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.089 to 0.715; P = .009). Thirty-day mortality rate was 28.5% and S aureus infections were related to a poorer outcome. It is noteworthy that all the isolates of S aureus were methicillin-resistant. Ampicillin was inactive against all the strains of E faecium and 50% of E avium isolates, but active against all E faecalis and E gallinarum strains. All the isolates were glycopeptide-susceptible. No significant differences in mortality rate were observed in relation to sex, etiologies of end-stage liver disease, cytomegalovirus infection/reinfection, type of donor, rejection, or retransplantation. GP-BSI, the only independent risk factor for death (OR, 0.262; 95% CI, 0.106 to 0.643; P = .003), reduced the survival rate by 26% in the first year posttransplant. In conclusion, GP-BSI(s) impact significantly on morbidity and mortality posttransplant, particularly among retransplantations. Control measures are required to reduce the incidence of GP-BSI(s) in liver transplant recipients. These findings must be considered when empirical antimicrobial therapy is indicated while awaiting blood-culture results.
TI  - A distal methyl substituent attenuates mitochondrial protein synthesis inhibition in oxazolidinone antibacterials.
AB  - Oxazolidinone analogs bearing substituted piperidine or azetidine C-rings are described. Analogs with a methyl group at the 3-position of the azetidine ring or the 4-position of the piperidine ring exhibited reduced mitochondrial protein synthesis inhibition while retaining good antibacterial potency.
TI  - Gram-positive microorganisms isolated from patients treated in the Department and Clinic of Rehabilitation at Rydygier Medical University in Bydgoszcz, Poland, 2000-2001.
AB  - Background. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the occurrence of Gram-positive microorganisms isolated from patients hospitalized in the Department and Clinic of Rehabilitation at the Rydygier Medical University in Bydgoszcz. Materials and methods. The material analyzed consisted of 533 clinical samples collected from patients hospitalized in 2000-2001. The study included 485 Gram-positive bacterial strains isolated from clinical material. Morphological characteristics provided the basis for the identification of bacteria. The species were identified by using API 20 STREP and API STAPH tests (bioMerieux). The isolates were screened for antimicrobial susceptibility by the disk-diffusion method. Results. The most often isolated bacteria were Enterococcus spp. (46,8%) and Staphylococcus spp. (31,5%), followed by Corynebacterium spp. (9,1%) and Streptococcus spp. (6,6%). The most frequently identified Enterococcus species were E. faecalis (92,9%) and E. faecium (7,1%). All the Enterococcus strains were susceptible to glycopeptides. More than 90% of the Enterococus isolates were sensitive to nitrofurantoine, about 44% to high concentrations of gentamycin, 17,9% to ciprofloxacin. During this period, and S. simulans, and 21 strains of S. auerus (46,7%). 92% of all the tested CNS strains (80%) than in the S. aureus isolates (10%). Conclusions. The most frequently observed bacterium was E. faecalis, which showed significant resistance to quinolones and to high level aminoglycosides. The CNS strains showed a high level of resistance to methicilline. All these strains were susceptible to glycopeptides.
TI  - Factors influencing broth microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility test results for dalbavancin, a new glycopeptide agent.
AB  - Performance of antimicrobial susceptibility tests with new agents requires careful consideration of the properties of the antimicrobial to ensure that the tests are standardized, reproducible, and reflect the true potency of the drug. Dalbavancin is a new glycopeptide with potent activity against gram-positive bacterial species. The investigations described here demonstrated that methodologic modifications of procedures are necessary to ensure consistent test results, both for quality control and for routine testing of clinical isolates. Dimethyl sulfoxide is the preferred primary solvent. The addition of 0.002% polysorbate-80 (a surfactant) to dalbavancin-containing wells in the reference broth microdilution assay resulted in consistent and reproducible MIC results for three quality control strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619. The same degree of consistency was observed among clinical isolates of gram-positive bacterial species tested in several clinical laboratories. These results indicate that the addition of 0.002% (final concentration) of the surfactant in broth microdilution tests produces optimal dalbavancin MICs required for accurate and reproducible clinical laboratory tests, without untoward influences of substrate binding or media constituents.
TI  - Enterococci and streptococci.
AB  - Besides Staphylococcus aureus, other Gram-positive bacteria have become multidrug-resistant and cause therapeutic problems, particularly amongst hospitalised patients. The acquisition of vancomycin resistance by strains of Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis is of particular concern and has resulted in treatment failures. Some of the infections caused by these bacteria do respond to treatment with new antibiotics that have been released in the last few years, however more options are required as not all enterococci are inherently susceptible and resistance is beginning to emerge amongst those that were susceptible. Resistance to commonly used antibiotics is also emerging in Streptococcus spp., particularly to the tetracyclines and macrolides. In both genera, multiresistant strains spread between patients and between hospitals. In the laboratory, these bacteria show considerable susceptibility to tigecycline, with little propensity to develop resistance, indicating that tigecycline could assume an important role in controlling infections caused by these Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Activity of meropenem as serine carbapenemases evolve in US Medical Centers: monitoring report from the MYSTIC Program (2006).
AB  - The Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Surveillance Program was designed to monitor the antimicrobial potency and spectrum of meropenem, and selected broad-spectrum comparison agents against pathogens from hospitalized patients. In the 2006 (year 8 of the study) United States sample, a total of 2841 isolates (94.7% compliance) including 641 Escherichia coli, 619 Klebsiella spp., 606 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 456 oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 300 streptococci, 149 Enterococcus faecalis, and 70 Gram-positive anaerobic organisms were tested by reference broth microdilution or agar dilution susceptibility methods. The carbapenems, especially meropenem, consistently demonstrated the lowest resistance rates against Enterobacteriaceae strains, and the fluoroquinolones had the highest and increasing resistance rates. The presence of qnr-mediated fluoroquinolone resistance was investigated using polymerase chain reaction methods but was only observed at very low levels (2.1%) and was not clonally associated. Confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase rates for E. coli and Klebsiella spp. were only 4.8% and 5.0%, respectively, with mobile AmpC (CMY-2 and FOX-5) enzymes shown in 13 additional Enterobacteriaceae isolates. Clonally related KPC-type serine carbapenemase production (57 strains, 9.5%) was observed at a rate 2-fold greater than the prior year among Klebsiella spp. isolates, primarily from 1 geographic region (Middle Atlantic States). These MYSTIC Program (2006) results demonstrate the continued need to monitor the carbapenem class potency and spectrum of activity against Enterobacteriaceae as well as P. aeruginosa because of the documented presence of serine carbapenemases and rare incidence of metallo-beta-lactamases that may further compromise their activity and that of other beta-lactam agents.
TI  - Intrathecal baclofen does not inhibit the growth of different bacterial species and Candida albicans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The antimicrobial activity of intrathecal baclofen was investigated.  Several different microorganisms were used: Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase-positive and beta-lactamase-negative strains); S epidermidis; Enterococcus faecalis; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and Candida albicans. METHODS: Three experimental approaches were used to assess baclofen antimicrobial activity: (1) determination of the MIC; (2) determination of the MBC; and (3) kinetic time-kill assay. Experiments were performed according to current methods of the NCCLS. RESULTS: As compared with control organisms exposed to physiologic saline, organisms exposed to baclofen over a 10-day period failed to reduce the number of viable cells by at least 3 log(10), as requested by NCCLS criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Because the viability of the investigated organisms was not reduced over that of microbial suspensions exposed to physiologic saline, we conclude that intrathecal baclofen has no measurable activity against different bacterial species and C albicans.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of silver-containing dressings on wound microorganisms using an in vitro biofilm model.
AB  - Antimicrobial dressings such as those containing silver are now being used widely to control wound bioburden, and tests to demonstrate their efficacy predominantly involve in vitro models using free-living or planktonic bacteria. In this present study a wide range of antibiotic-sensitive and resistant bacteria were tested in their quasi-sessile state using a standard agar assay and a second method used a poloxamer gel (true biofilm state - poloxamer encourages microorganisms to exhibit a more clinically relevant biofilm phenotype) technique. The antimicrobial activity of two silver dressings, a silver-containing Hydrofiber (SCH) dressing and a nanocrystalline silver-containing dressing (NCS), were evaluated on a variety of microorganisms, using a zone-of-inhibition (ZOI) test. When grown on agar (presenting a quasi-sessile state of each organism), the antibiotic-susceptible microorganisms were generally more susceptible to the SCH dressing compared with the NCS. ZOIs associated with SCH dressing ranged between 5.7 and 17.5 mm; those for the NCS against the same group of organisms ranged between 1.9 and 8.6 mm. When grown on poloxamer gel, (presenting the biofilm state of each organism) the same group of microorganisms were less susceptible to both dressings. The SCH dressing was most effective against strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus (ZOI range: 2.6-6 mm); the NCS was most effective against strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli (i.e. ZOI range: 1-2.8 mm). Similarly to the antibiotic-susceptible microorganisms, nine of ten antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains when grown on agar were more susceptible to the SCH dressing compared with the NCS. Although the microorganisms tested were universally less susceptible to the silver dressings when in their biofilm state, in the majority of cases, the SCH dressing demonstrated greater biofilm-inhibiting activity than the NCS.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of silver-containing antimicrobial dressings and drugs.
AB  - Wound dressings containing silver as antimicrobial agents are available in various forms and formulations; however, little is understood concerning their comparative efficacy as antimicrobial agents. Eight commercially available silver-containing dressings, Acticoat 7, Acticoat Moisture Control, Acticoat Absorbent, Silvercel, Aquacel Ag, Contreet F, Urgotol SSD and Actisorb, were tested to determine their comparative antimicrobial effectiveness in vitro and compared against three commercially available topical antimicrobial creams, a non treatment control, and a topical silver-containing antimicrobial gel, Silvasorb. Zone of inhibition and quantitative testing was performed by standard methods using Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. Results showed all silver dressings and topical antimicrobials displayed antimicrobial activity. Silver-containing dressings with the highest concentrations of silver exhibited the strongest bacterial inhibitive properties. Concreet F and the Acticoat dressings tended to have greater antimicrobial activity than did the others. Topical antimicrobial creams, including silver sulfadiazine, Sulfamylon and gentamicin sulfate, and the topical antimicrobial gel Silvasorb exhibited superior bacterial inhibition and bactericidal properties, essentially eliminating all bacterial growth at 24 hours. Silver-containing dressings are likely to provide a barrier to and treatment for infection; however, their bactericidal and bacteriostatic properties are inferior to commonly used topical antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro activity of tigecycline against multiresistant Gram-positive cocci containing tetracycline resistance determinants.
AB  - This study was undertaken to test the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 117 clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens and to correlate this activity with their resistance gene content. Overall, tigecycline showed a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 0.015-0.5mg/L, able to inhibit potently all multiresistant streptococci, enterococci and MR staphylococci. Tigecycline was active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and enterococci, with MICs for 90% of the organisms (MIC(90)) of 0.25 mg/L and 0.12 mg/L, respectively, being more active than linezolid (MIC(90)=2 mg/L) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (MIC(90)=0.5 and 2-4 mg/L, respectively). Molecular characterisation of resistance determinants demonstrated the concomitant presence of different classes of genes: in particular, tet(M), erm(B) and erm(C) in Streptococcus agalactiae; tet(O), variably associated with different erm genes, in Streptococcus pyogenes; vanA, tet(M) and erm(B) in Enterococcus faecalis, and vanA and erm(B) in Enterococcus faecium. All the MRSA strains harboured SCCmec and erm genes and 50% possessed tet(K) with tet(M) genes. Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were only resistant to erythromycin. These results clearly demonstrate that tigecycline has a MIC(90) range of 0.015-0.5 mg/L both against tetracycline-susceptible and -resistant isolates carrying other resistance determinants, suggesting that this drug could play an important role in the treatment of infections caused by these multiresistant Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - In vitro activity of para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene against susceptible and antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria has encouraged vigorous efforts to develop antimicrobial agents with new mechanisms of action. In this study, the in vitro antibacterial activity of para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene was evaluated and compared with that of its constitutive monomer, para-guanidinoethylphenol. Hexamidine, a widely used antiseptic, and synthalin A, an old antidiabetic and anti-trypanosomal compound, were chosen as references. METHODS: MIC and MBC were determined for five reference strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853), as well as five antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates. Toxicity on MRC-5 and HaCaT eukaryotic cell lines was also evaluated by MTT and Neutral Red assays. RESULTS: No antibacterial activity was observed for para-guanidinoethylphenol (MIC >or= 512 mg/L) and synthalin A (MIC >or= 64 mg/L). Conversely, para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene and hexamidine: (i) showed a broad antibacterial spectrum, both on Gram-positive and on Gram-negative bacteria (MIC = 4 mg/L against E. coli and 8 mg/L against S. aureus for para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene), to a lesser degree against E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa (MIC = 32 mg/L); (ii) were bacteriostatic (MBC >or= 256 mg/L); and (iii) MICs and MBCs obtained for clinical isolates were similar to those obtained with reference strains. Both compounds, the monomer and the calixarene, showed no apparent cytotoxicity, whereas hexamidine and synthalin A had significant toxic effects that increased with time and concentration and in a range of 100-1000 times that for calixarene. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, results confirm para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene as a broad-spectrum new agent or an auxiliary in antimicrobial chemotherapy.
TI  - Role of a qnr-like gene in the intrinsic resistance of Enterococcus faecalis to fluoroquinolones.
AB  - Fluoroquinolones are poorly active against enterococci. Recently, plasmid-borne resistance to fluoroquinolones due to the qnr gene was reported in members of the Enterobacteriaceae family. The gene encodes a pentapeptide repeat protein that protects DNA gyrase from inhibition by fluoroquinolones. We have identified in the genome of Enterococcus faecalis V583 a qnr-like gene, named E. faecalis qnr (qnr(E. faecalis)), encoding a putative pentapeptide repeat protein that shares 25% identity with Qnr. To assess its potential role in the intrinsic resistance of E. faecalis to fluoroquinolones, qnr(E. faecalis) was inactivated in E. faecalis JH2-2 by insertion of the thermosensitive vector pG1KT. This strain was then complemented with qnr(E. faecalis) cloned in the multicopy plasmid pORI23. The effects of its overexpression were also studied. Inactivation of the qnr(E. faecalis) gene resulted in twofold decreases in the MICs of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. When the gene was complemented or overexpressed, MICs of fluoroquinolones increased four- to nine-fold, leading to MICs of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin equal to 32 mug/ml and 8 mug/ml, respectively. The E. faecalis Qnr (Qnr(E. faecalis)) protein was produced and purified. Qnr(E. faecalis) protein protected Escherichia coli DNA gyrase from inhibition by ofloxacin. The qnr(E. faecalis) gene was then introduced into E. coli DH10B, Staphylococcus aureus RN4220, and Lactococcus lactis IL-1419 to study its heterologous expression. MICs of the various fluoroquinolones tested increased 4- to 16-fold, showing that Qnr(E. faecalis) conferred resistance to fluoroquinolones in various bacterial backgrounds. Overexpression of qnr(E. faecalis) in enterococci or mobilization of the gene to other bacterial species may be anticipated as a possible new mechanism for fluoroquinolone resistance.
TI  - Synthesis, physicochemical properties and antimicrobial evaluation of new (E)-chalcones.
AB  - In a wide search program towards new and efficient antimicrobial agents, a series of 40 substituted chalcones have been synthesized and tested for their in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities. The structures of these compounds have been investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Among the (E)-4-aminoalkylthiochalcones and (E)-4-aminoalkoxychalcones tested, compounds 7, 10, 11, 30 and 31 have exhibited good antibacterial property against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus subtilis.
TI  - Antiviral and antimicrobial activities of three sesquiterpene lactones from Centaurea solstitialis L. ssp. solstitialis.
AB  - Three sesquiterpene lactones (centaurepensin = chlorohyssopifolin A, chlorojanerin and 13-acetyl solstitialin A) isolated from the aerial parts of Centaurea solstitialis L. ssp. solstitialis (Asteraceae) were investigated for antimicrobial and antiviral activities. For the antimicrobial activity assessment, both standard and isolated strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and C. parapsilosis were employed by the microdilution method. Herpes simplex type-1, a DNA virus, and Parainfluenza, an RNA virus, were employed for the determination of the antiviral activity of these three sesquiterpene lactones using Vero cell lines. Ampicilline, ofloxocine, ketoconazole, fluconazole, acyclovir and oseltamivir were used as the reference drugs. 13-Acetyl solstitialin A displayed remarkable antibacterial activity against isolated strains of E. faecalis at 1 microg/ml concentration, which was close to the effective concentrations of ampicillin. The same compound also showed significant activity against the DNA virus, being as potent as the reference compound acyclovir at maximum and minimum concentrations of 16-<0.00006 microg/ml. This is the first report showing that 13-acetyl solstitialin A possesses significant antiviral activity.
TI  - Evaluation of ceftobiprole medocaril against Enterococcus faecalis in a mouse peritonitis model.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ceftobiprole is a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with good in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. The objective of this study was to assess the in vivo activity of ceftobiprole against four strains of E. faecalis, including beta-lactamase- producing (Bla+) and vancomycin-resistant strains. METHODS: Mice were infected intraperitoneally with strains of E. faecalis: (i) the Bla+ strain HH22; (ii) two vancomycin-resistant strains (TX2484 and V583); and (iii) OG1RF (a laboratory strain), using 10 x the LD50 for each strain. Ceftobiprole doses of 25, 12.5 and 6.25 mg/kg (single doses) and ampicillin 50, 25, 12.5 and 6.25 mg/kg (single and double doses) were administered subcutaneously immediately after bacterial challenge and mice were monitored for 96 h. RESULTS: All four E. faecalis had ceftobiprole MICs <or=0.5 mg/L. Despite being susceptible in vitro at the standard inoculum, ampicillin (single and double doses) did not protect mice against intraperitoneal challenge with Bla+ E. faecalis HH22, with a 50% protective dose (PD50) of >100 mg/kg, whereas ceftobiprole was protective (PD50 of 2 mg/kg). Ceftobiprole PD50s for vancomycin-resistant isolates TX2484 and V583 were 7.7 and 5.2 mg/kg, respectively, similar to those of single dose ampicillin (12.5 and 16.4 mg/kg, respectively). For OG1RF, both ampicillin and ceftobiprole protected all mice at doses of 25 and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively, with a PD50 of 4.2 and 8 mg/kg for ceftobiprole and ampicillin, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Ceftobiprole had comparable in vivo activity to that of ampicillin against vancomycin-resistant and ampicillin-susceptible strains of E. faecalis in the mouse peritonitis model. Ceftobiprole was superior in vivo to ampicillin against the Bla+ strain HH22. Our data support the further study of ceftobiprole as a therapeutic agent in humans infected with E. faecalis.
TI  - Bactericidal synergism through enterocin AS-48 and chemical preservatives against Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the effectiveness of enterocin AS-48 on Staphylococcus aureus  CECT 976 in combination with chemical preservatives at acidic and neutral pH. METHODS AND RESULTS: At pH 4.5, the activity of AS-48 increases in the presence of lactic acid (1.0%), acetic acid (0.5% and 1.0%), and citric acid (0.3% and 0.6%). This synergistic effect has also been observed during the first 8 h of incubation with benzoate (0.06% and 0.12%) and sorbate (2% and 3%). Interestingly, at pH 7, lactate (1%) increases the inhibitory effect of AS-48, reducing the S. aureus population by 6 log units compared with the control culture. At neutral pH, combinations of AS-48 and sodium tripolyphosphate, STPP (0.3% and 0.5%) also eliminate this pathogen after 24 h. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that enterocin AS-48 could be applied in combination with a range of chemical preservatives in order to increase its efficacy in inhibiting S. aureus. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study supports the potential use of enterocin AS-48 as a biopreservative to control S. aureus in combination with other food-grade chemical hurdles.
TI  - Characterization and mechanistic studies of type II isopentenyl diphosphate:dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase from Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The recently identified type II isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP):dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) isomerase (IDI-2) is a flavoenzyme that requires FMN and NAD(P)H for activity. IDI-2 is an essential enzyme for the biosynthesis of isoprenoids in several pathogenic bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis, and thus is considered as a potential new drug target to battle bacterial infections. One notable feature of the IDI-2 reaction is that there is no net change in redox state between the substrate (IPP) and product (DMAPP), indicating that the FMN cofactor must start and finish each catalytic cycle in the same redox state. Here, we report the characterization and initial mechanistic studies of the S. aureus IDI-2. The steady-state kinetic analyses under aerobic and anaerobic conditions show that FMN must be reduced to be catalytically active and the overall IDI-2 reaction is O2-sensitive. Interestingly, our results demonstrate that NADPH is needed only in catalytic amounts to activate the enzyme for multiple turnovers of IPP to DMAPP. The hydride transfer from NAD(P)H to reduce FMN is determined to be pro-S stereospecific. Photoreduction and oxidation-reduction potential studies reveal that the S. aureus IDI-2 can stabilize significant amounts of the neutral FMN semiquinone. In addition, reconstitution of apo-IDI-2 with 5-deazaFMN resulted in a dead enzyme, whereas reconstitution with 1-deazaFMN led to the full recovery of enzyme activity. Taken together, these studies appear to support a catalytic mechanism in which the reduced flavin coenzyme mediates a single electron transfer to and from the IPP substrate during catalysis.
TI  - [Epidemiological profile of enterobacteria isolated from neutropenic patients].
AB  - Thirteen patients treated with gut decontamination were screened over a period of three years for digestive colonization and acquisition of resistant strains, in fact 297 strains had been isolated from 226 stool cultures within 120 enterobacteria and other species. Our study pointed out a betaLSE digestive colonization rate of 30.8% of the total enterobacteria isolated, these strains exhibit resistance of most beta-lactams especially against third generation cephalosporins. This analysis showed that these strains are endogen and specific for each patient, the common multiresistance resulted from the selective pressure of gut decontamination.
TI  - Crystal structure of ACE19, the collagen binding subdomain of Enterococus faecalis surface protein ACE.
AB  
TI  - Visible light inactivation of bacteria and fungi by modified titanium dioxide.
AB  - Visible light induced photocatalytic inactivation of bacteria (Escherichia coli,  Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) and fungi (Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger) was tested. Carbon-doped titanium dioxide and TiO2 modified with platinum(IV) chloride complexes were used as suspension or immobilised at the surface of plastic plates. A biocidal effect was observed under visible light irradiation in the case of E. coli in the presence of both photocatalysts. The platinum(IV) modified titania exhibited a higher inactivation effect, also in the absence of light. The mechanism of visible light induced photoinactivation is briefly discussed. The observed detrimental effect of photocatalysts on various microorganism groups decreases in the order: E. coli > S. aureus approximately E. faecalis>>C. albicans approximately A. niger. This sequence results most probably from differences in cell wall or cell membrane structures in these microorganisms and is not related to the ability of catalase production.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline (PPI-0903M, T-91825) against bacteria with defined resistance mechanisms and phenotypes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ceftaroline (PPI-0903M, T-91825) is a novel cephalosporin, administered as an N-phosphono prodrug. We investigated its in vitro activity and resistance selection potential. METHODS: MICs were determined by CLSI agar dilution, but with varied inocula. Mutant selection was investigated in single- and multi-step procedures. RESULTS: MICs for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were 0.5-2 mg/L, compared with 0.12-0.25 mg/L for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus; corresponding values for coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.25-2 and 0.06-0.12 mg/L, respectively. Even with 2% NaCl added, all MRSA were susceptible at 2 mg/L. MICs for Enterococcus faecalis were from 0.25 to 8 mg/L; E. faecium was resistant. MICs for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Morganella morganii and Proteeae without acquired resistance were 0.06-0.5 mg/L versus 0.12-1 mg/L for Enterobacter, Serratia and Citrobacter spp. and 2-8 mg/L for Acinetobacter spp. MICs rose to 1-2 mg/L for many Enterobacteriaceae with classical TEM beta-lactamases, and were much higher for those with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), hyperproduced AmpC or K1 enzymes. MICs for strains with classical TEM/SHV beta-lactamases rose if the inoculum was increased to 10(6) cfu/spot; this effect was even more marked for those with ESBLs. Resistance due to Class A beta-lactamases was reversed by clavulanate. Geometric mean MICs were 0.005, 0.05 and 0.09 mg/L for penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, respectively-lower than for any comparator beta-lactam. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible, although with marginally raised MICs for beta-lactamase-positive Moraxella strains and for haemophili with chromosomal ampicillin resistance. Ceftaroline selected AmpC-derepressed Enterobacter mutants similarly to cefotaxime in single-step experiments; in multi-step procedures it selected ESBL variants of blaTEM in E. coli. Resistance selection was not seen with S. aureus, H. influenzae or pneumococci. CONCLUSIONS: Ceftaroline has impressive anti-MRSA and anti-pneumococcal activity. Slight lability to classical TEM and SHV beta-lactamases is exceptional for an oxyimino-cephalosporin, but was reversible with clavulanate, as was the greater resistance mediated by ESBLs. Resistance selection occurred with Enterobacteriaceae, not MRSA.
TI  - Synthesis and preliminary biological characterization of new semisynthetic derivatives of ramoplanin.
AB  - Ramoplanin is a glycolipodepsipeptide antibiotic active against Gram-positive bacteria including vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Ramoplanin inhibits bacterial cell wall biosynthesis by a mechanism different from that of glycopeptides and hence does not show cross-resistance with these antibiotics. The systemic use of ramoplanin has been so far prevented because of its low local tolerability when injected intravenously. To overcome this problem, the fatty acid side chain of ramoplanin was selectively removed and replaced with a variety of different carboxylic acids. Many of the new ramoplanin derivatives showed antimicrobial activity similar to that of the natural precursor coupled with a significantly improved local tolerability. Among them the derivative in which the 2-methylphenylacetic acid has replaced the di-unsaturated fatty acid side chain (48) was selected as the most interesting compound and submitted to further in vitro and in vivo characterization studies.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of oleanolic acid from Salvia officinalis and related compounds on vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).
AB  - An extract from Salvia officinalis (Sage) leaves showed antimicrobial activity against vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). We isolated the effective compound and identified it as oleanolic acid, a triterpenoid. We also tested antimicrobial activity of similar triterpenoids, ursolic acid, uvaol, betulinic acid and betulin. We found that ursolic acid also showed antimicrobial activity against VRE. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of oleanolic acid and ursolic acid were 8 and 4 microg/ml, respectively. These two compounds also showed antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). These compounds showed bactericidal activity against VRE at least for 48 h when added at concentrations that were two-times higher than their MICs.
TI  - Comparison of the antibacterial activity of honey from different provenance against bacteria usually isolated from skin wounds.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of honey samples provided by apiarists and honey packers was tested against microorganisms usually isolated from skin wounds. The antibacterial activity was tested using the well-agar diffusion assay. The honey samples were tested without dilution, and at 75, 50, 30, and 10% (w/v) dilution. Most of the undiluted honey samples inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Some honey samples provided by apiarists also inhibited the growth of S. aureus even at 50% dilution. Undiluted honey samples also inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus uberis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, although to a lesser extent. No inhibition of Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis growth was detected. The diameters of the inhibition zones generated by honey samples provided by apiarists were larger than those generated by honey samples provided by honey packers. This observation may be explained by considering the provenance of the honey samples.
TI  - Bactericidal and cytotoxic effects of chloramine-T on wound pathogens and human fibroblasts in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate cytotoxicity and bactericidal effects of chloramine-T. METHODS: In vitro study of various concentrations and exposure times to preparations containing human fibroblasts or 1.5 x 10 colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) of 3 gram-positive bacteria-Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S aureus, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis-and 2 gram-negative bacteria-Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa-with and without fetal bovine serum present. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percentage reduction of bacterial growth and percentage of viable fibroblasts 48 hours after exposure. RESULTS: All gram-positive growth was reduced by 95% to 100%, regardless of dose, with or without serum. E coli (gram-negative; with/without serum) was reduced 94% to 100% at antiseptic concentrations of 300 and 400 ppm. At 200 ppm, E coli growth was fully inhibited without serum present and by 50% with serum. P aeruginosa (gram-negative) was not significantly affected under any conditions. At 100 and 200 ppm, cell viability remained greater than 90% under all experimental conditions. A 300-ppm, 3-minute exposure to chloramine-T resulted in cell viability of up to 70%, with longer exposures producing lower viabilities. Serum did not affect cell viability in any condition. CONCLUSIONS: In vitro, chloramine-T at 200 ppm for 5 to 20 minutes was effective against 3 virulent gram-positive bacteria without fibroblast damage. At 300 ppm and 3 and 5 minutes, 30% of fibroblasts were damaged and 95% to 100 % of E coli were inhibited, respectively.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-positive bacterial isolates from the Asia-Pacific region and an in vitro evaluation of the bactericidal activity of daptomycin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin: a SENTRY Program Report (2003-2004).
AB  - Medical centres in eight countries in the Asia-Pacific region provided 2391 isolates for the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program during 2003-2004 to determine their susceptibility to several antimicrobial classes, including daptomycin. Daptomycin, vancomycin and teicoplanin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined for 120 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, which included wild-type (WT) methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and strains with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin (hetero-vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hVISA)). Oxacillin-resistant staphylococcal isolates were much less susceptible to the other tested agents compared with oxacillin-susceptible strains. Vancomycin resistance was higher among Enterococcus faecium (10.3%) than Enterococcus faecalis (0.4%), and macrolide resistance was high both for beta-haemolytic (17.7%) and viridans group (48.7%) streptococci. Daptomycin (MIC for 90% of the organisms (MIC(90))=0.5-1mg/L) was two-fold more potent than vancomycin, with >99% susceptibility when tested against staphylococci. All tested isolates of E. faecalis (MIC(90)=2mg/L) and beta-haemolytic streptococci (MIC(90)=0.5mg/L) were susceptible to daptomycin. Daptomycin MIC and MBC values were slightly higher for the hVISA isolates compared with WT-MRSA, with MBC/MIC ratios of only 1-2 for both groups. The MBC/MIC ratio for vancomycin was often greater when tested against these strains, particularly hVISA. In contrast, teicoplanin MBC/MIC ratios were significantly higher, with many of the strains showing values consistent with tolerance (>or=32). Daptomycin was demonstrated to have excellent in vitro activity when tested against Gram-positive isolates collected from Asia-Pacific countries, including hVISA strains.
TI  - Mathematical model of manganese ion catalyzed microwave deactivation of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli survival was investigated using microwave irradiation (power 130 W) both in a water control and in the presence of a 1 microM manganese ion solution. Measured survival dependencies had "bell" shape form with maximum bacterial viability between 1-2 min of microwave heating. Additional heating revealed bacteria survival decreasing up to 3 min of microwave heating when viability became insignificantly small. The total deactivation time of bacteria in the presence of manganese ions was significantly smaller then that of bacteria irradiated in the microwave without manganese ions present (4-5 min). One possible explanation for the rapid reduction of bacterial survival during microwave irradiation in the presence of manganese ions is that increasing manganese ion penetration into bacteria along with microwave irradiation related to an increase of kinetic energy of ions, and damaging of bacteria by metal ions. The proposed mathematical model for microwave heating took into account "growth" and "death" factors of bacteria. It assumes that rates of bacterial growth and decay are linear functions of water temperature, and rate of bacterial decay that relates with metal concentration into water is also linear, which influenced the differential equation for the dependence between number of survival bacteria and temperature water. By using proportionality between the time of microwave heating and water temperature we derived the differential equation, between bacterial viability and time of microwave irradiation which was used as mathematical model for microwave heating in the presence of metal ions. This model had forms of second-degree polynomial functions. We received good relationships (with coefficient of correlation 0.92-0.99) between proposed mathematical model and experimental data for all bacterial deactivation.
TI  - Mathematical models for conventional and microwave thermal deactivation of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.
AB  - Temperature dependencies of survival fecal coliforms such as Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in water were investigated between 25-65 degrees C. Measured dependencies had "bell" shaped form with maximum bacterial viability at 35-45 degrees C. The rates of growth and decay of bacterial viability depend on specific forms of bacteria. At temperatures of 60-65 degrees C the number of viable bacteria decreased in one hundred times in comparison with the maximum value. Similar "bell" shape forms were found for dependencies between bacterial viability and time of microwave (dielectric) heating of water. The dependencies had maximum value at 1-2 min of microwave heating. Then, the number of viable bacteria decreased, and at 4-5 min of microwave heating, became insignificantly small. The proposed mathematical models for conventional and microwave heating took into account "growth" and "death" factors of bacteria, and had forms of second degree polynomial functions. The results showed good relationships (with coefficient correlation 0.84-0.99) between the proposed mathematical models and experimental data for both conventional and microwave heating.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of seven hypericum entities from central Italy.
AB  - Methanol-acetone extracts from aerial parts of seven entities of the genus Hypericum [H. perforatum L. subsp. perforatum, H. perforatum L. subsp. veronense (Schrank) Ces., H. montanum L., H. hyssopifolium Chaix, H. hirsutum L., H. hircinum L. subsp. majus (Aiton) N. Robson, H. tetrapterum Fr.] growing in the Appennino Umbro-Marchigiano (central Italy) were tested in vitro for their antimicrobial activity against two Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis), two Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and the yeast Candida albicans, by the Kirby-Bauer agar diffusion method. The two H. perforatum subspecies were particularly active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, supporting the use of these plants in the traditional medicine of central Italy to treat wounds, skin and infectious diseases. However significant values of inhibition were given also by H. hirsutum against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, and by H. hyssopifolium, H. hircinum subsp. majus and H. tetrapterum against C. albicans. These results suggest that hypericin and hyperforin are the main components responsible for antimicrobial activity, but not the only ones, as other extracts, showing a low level of these compounds, possess evident activity. Isolation of pure compounds from the most active extracts is in progress.
TI  - Resistance to disinfectants in epidemiologically defined clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Decreased susceptibility to biocides may contribute to epidemic spread of Acinetobacter baumannii in the hospital. This study was conducted to evaluate the susceptibility of different clinical A. baumannii strains to disinfectants. Twenty A. baumannii strains were examined, ten of which were outbreak-related and ten that were sporadic. Clinical isolates were selected on the basis of demonstrating a unique pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern. The in-vitro activities of propanol, combination of 1-propanol, 2-propanol and mecetronium ethylsulphate, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-iodine, triclosan and chlorhexidine were determined using a broth macrodilution method. Exposure times to the disinfectant ranged from 15 s to 2 min and concentrations ranged from undiluted to a 1:4000 dilution in order to investigate the impact of inadvertent dilution that might occur in clinical practice. Five American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) type strains (A. baumannii, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus) were used as controls. All disinfectants inhibited growth of all isolates at concentrations and contact times recommended by the respective manufacturer. With most of the disinfectants tested, a relevant number of viable bacteria remained if contact times < 30s or diluted agents were used. No significant differences in susceptibility between outbreak-related and sporadic strains were detected, but larger studies would be required to confirm this. Resistance to currently used disinfectants is probably not a major factor in the epidemic spread of A. baumannii. However, even minor deviations from the recommended procedures leading to decreased concentrations or exposure times may play a role in nosocomial cross-transmission.
TI  - Comparative in vitro antimicrobial activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline compound, in freshly prepared medium and quality control.
AB  - The in vitro spectra of activity of tigecycline and tetracycline were determined  for 2,490 bacterial isolates representing 50 different species or phenotypic groups. All isolates were tested simultaneously by broth microdilution using freshly prepared Mueller-Hinton broth and by disk diffusion. Portions of these data were submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in support of the sponsor's application for new drug approval. In a separate study, MIC and disk diffusion quality control ranges were determined. The tigecycline MICs at which 50%/90% of bacteria were inhibited were (in microg/ml) as follows: for Streptococcus spp., 0.06/0.12; for Moraxella catarrhalis, 0.06/0.12; for Staphylococcus spp., 0.12/0.25; for Enterococcus spp., 0.12/0.25; for Listeria monocytogenes, 0.12/0.12; for Neisseria meningitidis, 0.12/0.25; for Haemophilus spp., 0.25/0.5; for Enterobacteriaceae, 0.05/2.0; for non-Enterobacteriaceae, 0.5/8.0. Tigecycline was consistently more potent than tetracycline against all species studied. The data from this study confirm the FDA-approved MIC and disk diffusion breakpoints for tigecycline for Streptococcus spp. other than Streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococci, and Enterobacteriaceae. Provisional breakpoints for Haemophilus spp. and S. pneumoniae are proposed based on the data from this study. The following MIC and/or disk diffusion quality control ranges are proposed: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml; S. aureus ATCC 25923, 20 to 25 mm; Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml and 20 to 27 mm; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, 9 to 13 mm, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, 0.03 to 0.12 microg/ml; S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619, 0.015 to 0.12 microg/ml and 23 to 29 mm; Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247, 0.06 to 0.5 microg/ml and 23 to 31 mm; and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ATCC 49226, 30 to 40 mm.
TI  - In-vitro profile of a new beta-lactam, ceftobiprole, with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Ceftobiprole is a novel, broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in-vitro activity against common Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. It forms a stable inhibitory complex with Staphylococcus aureus penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2' (2a), resulting in enhanced activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). In recent studies of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, the ceftobiprole MIC(90) value was most frequently < or =1.0 mg/L (MIC range < or =0.25-1.0 mg/L). For MRSA, MIC(90) values were generally 2.0 mg/L (MIC range < or =0.06-4.0 mg/L). MICs for all streptococcal species, except penicillin-resistant Streptococcus viridans but including penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, ranged from < or =0.008 to 2.0 mg/L. Ceftobiprole is active against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(90) = 4 mg/L), but not generally active against Enterococcus faecium (MIC(90) > 16 mg/L). Ceftobiprole displayed bactericidal activity against Gram-negative pathogens comparable to that of cefepime, ceftazidime or piperacillin-tazobactam in early studies. However, recent data show activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of cefepime but less than that of ceftazidime. Ceftobiprole, like cefepime, is stable in the presence of most class A non-extended spectrum beta-lactamases and inducible class C beta-lactamases. Ceftobiprole is a poor inducer of AmpC beta-lactamase and a poor substrate for hydrolysis by AmpC beta-lactamase. Studies of ceftobiprole in several animal models have demonstrated potent in-vivo efficacy against infections caused by MRSA, including strains intermediately resistant to vancomycin. It was also efficacious in murine infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria with MIC values < or =2 mg/L. The broad spectrum of activity demonstrated by ceftobiprole in vitro and in vivo suggests that it may have potential for empirical treatment of suspected Gram-negative and Gram-positive infections, including those caused by MRSA.
TI  - Vapor-phase activities of cinnamon, thyme, and oregano essential oils and key constituents against foodborne microorganisms.
AB  - The aim of the study presented here was to gain knowledge about the vapor-phase antimicrobial activity of selected essential oils and their major putatively active constituents against a range of foodborne bacterial and fungal strains. In a first step, the vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of three commercially available essential oils (EOs)-cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), and oregano (Origanum vulgare)-were evaluated against a wide range of microorganisms, including Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella choleraesuis), Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis), molds (Penicillium islandicum and Aspergillus flavus), and a yeast (Candida albicans). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were generally lower for oregano EO than for the thyme and cinnamon EOs, especially against the relatively resistant Gram-negative. The persistence of the EOs' antimicrobial activities over time was assessed, and changes in the composition of the atmosphere they generated over time were determined using single-drop microextraction (SDME) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and subsequent analysis of the data by principal component analysis (PCA). More relevant chemicals were selected. In addition, the vapor-phase activities of putatively key constituents of the oils were screened against representative Gram-positive (L. monocytogenes) and Gram-negative (S. choleraesuis) bacteria, a mold (A. flavus), and a yeast (C. albicans). Of the tested compounds, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol showed the strongest antimicrobial effectiveness, so their MICs, defined as the minimum vapor concentrations that completely inhibited detectable growth of the microorganisms, were calculated. To check for possible interactions between components present in the EOs, cinnamon EO was fortified with cinnamaldehyde and thyme EO with thymol, and then the antimicrobial activities of the fortified oils were compared to those of the respective unfortified EOs using fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices and by plotting inhibition curves as functions of the vapor-phase concentrations. Synergistic effects were detected for cinnamaldehyde on A. flavus and for thymol on L. monocytogenes, S. choleraesuis, and A. flavus. In all other cases the fortification had additive effects, except for cinnamaldehyde's activity against S. choleraesuis, for which the effect was antagonistic. Finally, various microorganisms were found to cause slight changes over time to the atmospheres generated by all of the EOs (fortified and unfortified) except the fortified cinnamon EO.
TI  - An in vitro system for the comparison of excision and wet-dry swabbing for microbiological sampling of beef carcasses.
AB  - An in vitro system for the comparison of wet-dry swabbing and surface tissue excision was developed to ascertain whether the commonly accepted statement of the advantage (in terms of bacterial recovery) of the tissue excision method is also legitimate when different kinds of bacteria are used. A total of 1,770 sections (2.5 by 10 cm) of bovine skin were individually inoculated on the subcutaneous fat side by spreading various suspensions of marker organisms (nalidixic acid-resistant Escherichia coli, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) at different concentrations and sampled by two standard methods: cotton wet-dry swabbing and excision. Most counts from cuts sampled by excision were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the wet-dry swabs; however, no differences were observed between the control and the sampling method when sections were inoculated with bacterial solutions at a concentration of 10(3) CFU/ml and sampled by excision. For sections inoculated with bacterial solutions at a concentration of 10(3) CFU/ml, counts given as log CFU/25 cm2 ranged from 1.97 (S. aureus sampled by wet-dry swab) to 3.06 (S. aureus sampled by excision). For sections inoculated at a concentration of 10(4), counts given as log CFU/25 cm(2) ranged from 2.15 (E. faecalis sampled by wet-dry swab) to 3.19 (S. aureus sampled by excision). For sections inoculated at 10(5), counts given as log CFU/25 cm(2) ranged from 2.94 (E. faecalis, wet-dry swab) to 3.98 (S. aureus, excision), and for sections inoculated at 106, counts given as log CFU/25 cm(2) ranged from 3.53 (E. coli, wet-dry swab) to 4.69 (S. aureus, excision). The proposed system, which enabled a considerable amount of samples to be analyzed under controlled experimental conditions and a large number of data to be generated in a short time, demonstrated among the tested microorganisms that whereas the excision method recovered the highest number of bacteria, control means were always (with the exception of an inoculum of 10(3)/ml) significantly higher than means from either of the sampling methods. Our results indicate that particular attention should be paid to the diverse microflora that can contaminate carcasses in a given slaughterhouse and that it is not appropriate to generalize by saying that the destructive method is the reference technique for the bacteriological sampling of carcasses in slaughterhouses, especially when the contamination is higher than 10(3) CFU/25 cm(2).
TI  - Application of real-time quantitative PCR for the detection of selected bacterial pathogens during municipal wastewater treatment.
AB  - Bacteria were detected at five stages of municipal wastewater treatment using TaqMan(R) real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Thirteen probe and primer sets were tested for diverse pathogens that may be present in wastewater, including Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp., and Staphylococcus aureus. The sensitivity of the assay was 100 fg of genomic DNA (=22 gene copies), based on a standard curve generated using A. hydrophila purified DNA. Samples from five stages of wastewater treatment were collected, including raw wastewater, primary effluents, mixed liquor, waste activated sludge and final effluents. In duplicate samples, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, C. perfringens and E. faecalis were detected throughout the wastewater process, and their numbers decreased by 3.52-3.98, 4.23-4.33, 3.15-3.39, and 3.24 orders of magnitude respectively, between the raw wastewater and final effluent stage. This qPCR method was effective for the detection of pathogens in wastewater and confirmed that the risk of exposure to pathogens in the wastewater discharge was well within the Environment Canada guidelines.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro evaluation of substituted phenyl-piperazinyl-phenyl oxazolidinones against Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - With the incidence of linezolid-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium and Staphylococcus aureus, modification of linezolid at the 5- and/or 3-positions led to the development of a series of 3-(methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl-phenyl oxazolidinone analogues. These compounds were tested in vitro against six gram-positive standard organisms (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. pneumoniae, S. albus, Streptococcus enteridis and S. nonhemolyticus). 5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinones bearing fluorine at 3'-position of phenyl ring showed activities against several gram-positive bacteria (MIC: 3.13-6.25 mug/mL). The position of methoxyl group on the phenyl ring of piperazine group affected antibacterial spectrum. 3-(4'- (para-methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl)-(3'-fluoro)-phenyl-5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinone was found active against 5 gram-positive organisms except S. nonhemolyticus, whereas 3-(4'-(ortho-methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl)-(3'-fluoro)-phenyl-5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinone was found active only against 2 gram-positive organisms, namely S. albus, S. enteridis.
TI  - [Preoperatively administered flomoxef sodium concentration in aqueous humor].
AB  - PURPOSE: We intravenously administered flomoxef sodium (FMOX) 0.5-3.5 hours before cataract surgery and measured the concentration of the agent in the aqueous humor to investigate its penetration into the aqueous humor and its efficacy in the prevention of postoperative endophthalmitis. METHODS: 56 patients who underwent cataract surgery were enrolled in this study. They received 1 g FMOX via a 20-minute intravenous drip beginning 0.5-3.5 hours before the operation. Aqueous humor was aspirated from the anterior chamber and assayed for FMOX concentration using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The mean intraoperative FMOX concentrations in the patients' aqueous humor were 0.79 +/- 0.24 microg/ml (administered 3.5 hours before surgery)--1.47 0.79 microg/ml (administered 1.5 hours before surgery). These concentrations administered 0.5-3.0 hours before surgery sufficiently exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 90 values against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Propionibacterium acnes, but did not achieve the MIC90 values against Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: The FMOX concentrations in the aqueous humor sampling were adequate to kill bacteria in vitro. This drug may be efficacious in the prevention of postoperative endophthalmitis in patients undergoing cataract surgery.
TI  - The post-antibiotic effects of linezolid against Gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of linezolid against methicillin-resistant and -susceptible staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococci. METHODS: Clinical strains of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) were isolated from hospitalized patients at Ege University Medical Faculty Hospital between June and September 2005. This study was made between September and December 2005. The PAE of linezolid was determined at the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and 4 times the MIC concentrations for 60 minutes in Mueller-Hinton Broth (MHB). The duration of the PAE was obtained by following the recovery of bacterial growth in antibiotic free MHB measured colony forming units on Mueller-Hinton agar. RESULTS: All the straines were susceptible to linezolid. The PAE was greater at 4 times the MIC (0.5 - 2.4 hours) that at the MIC (0 - 1.7 hours) for linezolid against all organisms tested. The PAE for linezolid was slightly higher against E. faecalis strains than other organisms. CONCLUSION: In this study, it was demonstrated that linezolid had a moderate in vitro PAE against S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E.faecalis strains.
TI  - N'-(alpha-aminoacyl)- and N'-alpha-(N-alkylamino)acyl derivatives of vancomycin and eremomycin. II. Antibacterial activity of N'-(alpha-aminoacyl)- and N'-alpha-(N-alkylamino)acyl derivatives of vancomycin and eremomycin.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of the series of novel N'-(alpha-aminoacyl)- and N'-alpha-(N-akylamino)acyl derivatives of eremomycin and vancomycin containing hydrophobic moieties have been investigated. The N'-(N-alkylglycyl) derivatives of vancomycin are more active against vancomycin-susceptible staphylococci and enterococci and glycopeptide intermediate-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (GISA) than the corresponding eremomycin derivatives, but except for N'-[N-(p-octyloxybenzyl)glycyl-vancomycin] (28) and N'-[N-(p-octyloxybenzyl)-L-alanyl-vancomycin (33)--they are less active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE). Derivatives 28 and 33 are the most active compounds (MIC's for glycopeptide-sensitive staphylococci and enterococci are 0.25 approximately 1 microg/ml, for GISA 1 approximately 2 microg/ml, for GRE 2 approximately 6 microg/ml). In in vivo studies, derivative 28 was active against S. aureus infections in mice with ED(50) 1 mg/kg versus 2 mg/kg for vancomycin (iv). In general N'-(N-alkylglycyl)-derivatives of vancomycin and eremomycin were more active than the corresponding N'-aminoacylated derivatives of these antibiotics containing other than glycin amino acids (L-Lys, L-Met, L-Orn, L- and D-Ala) and also L- and D-Phe or benzyl-O-L-Tyr.
TI  - Reduced mucosal antimicrobial activity in Crohn's disease of the colon.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In order to maintain the mucosal barrier against luminal microorganisms the intestinal epithelial cells synthesise various broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptides including defensins and cathelicidins. Recent studies indicate that both may be deficient in Crohn's disease. To elucidate the possible functional consequences of this deficiency antimicrobial activity in colonic mucosa from patients with inflammatory bowel disease and healthy controls was investigated. METHODS: A flow cytometric assay was established to quantitate bacterial killing and test the antibacterial activity of cationic peptide extracts from colonic biopsies taken from patients with active or inactive ileocolonic or colonic Crohn's disease (n = 22), ulcerative colitis (n = 29) and controls (n = 13) against clinical isolates of Bacteroides vulgatus and Enterococcus faecalis or the reference strains Escherichia coli American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. RESULTS: Compared with controls and ulcerative colitis there was a reduced antimicrobial effect in Crohn's disease extracts that was most evident against B. vulgatus. The antimicrobial effect against E. coli and E. faecalis was significantly lower in Crohn's disease compared with ulcerative colitis. Activity against S. aureus disclosed a similar pattern, but was less pronounced. The differences were independent of the inflammation status or concurrent steroid treatment. Bacteria incubated with biopsy extracts from ulcerative colitis patients frequently showed a characteristic change in cell size and granularity, compatible with more extensive membrane disintegration, compared with bacteria incubated with extracts from controls or Crohn's disease. CONCLUSION: Crohn's disease of the colon is characterized by a diminished functional antimicrobial activity that is consistent with the reported low antibacterial peptide expression.
TI  - Daptomycin antimicrobial activity tested against methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolated in European medical centers (2005).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide with potent activity and broad spectrum against Gram-positive bacteria currently used for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections and bacteremia, including right sided endocarditis. We evaluated the in vitro activity of this compound and selected comparator agents tested against clinical strains of staphylococci and enterococci collected in European medical centers in 2005. METHODS: A total of 4,640 strains from 23 medical centers located in 10 European countries, Turkey and Israel (SENTRY Program platform) were tested for susceptibility by reference broth microdilution methods according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines and interpretative criteria. Mueller-Hinton broth was supplemented to 50 mg/L Ca++ for testing daptomycin. Results for oxacillin (methicillin)-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci were analyzed separately. RESULTS: Oxacillin resistance rates among Staphylococcus aureus varied from 2.1% in Sweden to 42.5% in the United Kingdom (UK) and 54.7% in Ireland (29.1% overall), while vancomycin resistance rates varied from 0.0% in France, Sweden and Switzerland to 66.7% in the UK and 71.4% in Ireland among Enterococcus faecium (17.9% overall). All S. aureus strains were inhibited at daptomycin MIC of 1 mg/L (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/L; 100.0% susceptible) and only one coagulase-negative staphylococci strain (0.1%) showed an elevated (>1 mg/L) daptomycin MIC value (4 mg/L). Among E. faecalis (MIC50/90, 0.5/1 mg/L; 100% susceptible) the highest daptomycin MIC value was 2 mg/L; while among E. faecium (MIC50/90, 2/4 mg/L; 100% susceptible) the highest MIC result was 4 mg/L. CONCLUSION: Daptomycin showed excellent in vitro activity against staphylococci and enterococci collected in European medical centers in 2005 and resistance to oxacillin, vancomycin or quinupristin/dalfopristin did not compromise its activity overall against these pathogens. Based on these results and those of previous publications, daptomycin appears to be an excellent therapeutic option for serious infections caused by oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci in Europe.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of endodontic sealers, MTA-based cements and Portland cement.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of different root-end filling materials - Sealer 26, Sealapex with zinc oxide, zinc oxide and eugenol, white and gray Portland cement, white and gray MTA-Angelus, and gray Pro Root MTA - against six different microorganism strains. The agar diffusion method was used. A base layer was made using Muller-Hinton agar (MH) and wells were formed by removing the agar. The materials were placed in the wells immediately after manipulation. The microorganisms used were: Micrococcus luteus (ATCC9341), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC6538), Escherichia coli (ATCC10538), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27853), Candida albicans (ATCC 10231), and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 10541). The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride 0.05% gel was added for optimization, and the zones of inhibition were measured. Data were subjected to the Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests at a 5% significance level. The results showed that all materials had antimicrobial activity against all the tested strains. Analysis of the efficacy of the materials against the microbial strains showed that Sealapex with zinc oxide, zinc oxide and eugenol and Sealer 26 created larger inhibition halos than the MTA-based and Portland cements (P < 0.05). On the basis of the methodology used, it may be concluded that all endodontic sealers, MTA-based and Portland cements evaluated in this study possess antimicrobial activity, particularly the endodontic sealers.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Brazilian Amazon plant extracts.
AB  - Infections caused by multiresistant bacteria are a widespread problem, especially in intensive care units. New antibiotics are necessary, and we need to search for alternatives, including natural products. Brazil is one of the hottest spots in the world in terms of biodiversity, but little is known about the chemical and pharmacological properties of most of the plants found in the Amazon rain forest and the Atlantic Forest. We screened 1,220 organic and aqueous extracts, obtained from Amazon and Atlantic rain forest plants, against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E. coli. Seventeen organic and aqueous extracts obtained from 16 plants showed activity against both Gram-positive bacteria. None of the extracts showed relevant activity against the Gram-negative E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Antibacterial and cytotoxic activity of the acetone extract of the flowers of Salvia sclarea and some natural products.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial and the cytotoxic activity of the acetone extract of the flowers of Salvia sclarea and of some natural products (sclareol, sclareolide and ambrox). The antibacterial and the cytotoxic activity were determined by the dilution method. Sclareolide, ambrox and sclareol demonstrated a good antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27950, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212. The acetonic extract of the flowers of Salvia sclarea has a significant cytotoxic activity against Hep-2 cells.
TI  - Reversal of resistance in microorganisms by help of non-antibiotics.
AB  - Intracellular efflux pumps have been largely the research focus in multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms and parasites including cancers. However, drug efflux mechanisms other than pumps per se have been observed, supported by the effects of isomeric, non-antibiotic depressant (DPR), phenothiazines and thixenes, and antidepressant (ADPR) phenylpiperidine neurotropic drugs, alone or in combination with classical antimicrobials on MDR Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Of the non-antibiotics we investigated, the DPR l-thioridazine, trans-clopenthixol and isomers of phenylpiperidines NNC 20-4962 (isomer of femoxetine) and NNC 20-7052 (isomer of paroxetine) were potent antimicrobials with the least neurotropic activity, pointing to a possible general isomeric structure-activity relationship. These compounds may be regarded as new efflux inhibitors. Moreover, these isomers have considerably reduced, in some cases absent, neurotropism and reduced mammalian toxicity. This may alleviate concerns about adverse effects and therapeutic safety for infected patients in life-threatening situations where the non-antibiotic dosage would be in the lower, non-chronic dosage ranges generally prescribed for individuals with mild mental health problems. The results point to the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms' phospholipid/protein domain involvement of the cationic, amphiphilic, non-antibiotic DPR and ADPR, with the phospholipids being the initial sites attracting and concentrating the neurotropes to induce a form of suspended animation, followed by gross changes of cell wall and membrane structure, and thereby potentiating their destructive or immobilizing effects on various as yet only hinted at resistance and efflux mechanisms. Combination of appropriate isomeric non-antibiotic DPR and ADPR of low neurotropism and toxicity with conventional and classical antimicrobials promises early, new therapeutic strategies salutary against microbial resistance, resistance development, pathogenicity and virulence.
TI  - A new antibacterial compound produced by an indigenous marine bacteria--fermentation, isolation, and biological activity.
AB  - The use of microorganisms for biological purpose has become an effective alternative to control pathogens. A marine bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from Eal fish of Baluchistan coast of Pakistan. This strain produced a bactericidal antibiotic against environmental and clinical isolates. In this study, we purified bactericidal antibiotic from the ethyl acetate extract of the cells of P. aeruginosa and analyzed its chemical structure. Based on spectrometric analysis, this compound 1 is proposed to be 1-methyl-1,4 dihydroquinoline and is active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Vibrio aliginolyticus, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter faecium but it is not active against G streptococci, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger. Minimal inhibitory concentration for Gram-positive bacteria was between 50 and 75 microg mL(-1) and for Gram-negative bacteria 75-100 microg mL(-1).
TI  - The Enterococcus faecalis MSCRAMM ACE binds its ligand by the Collagen Hug model.
AB  - We have determined the crystal structure of the ligand binding segment of the Enterococcus faecalis collagen binding MSCRAMM ACE (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules adhesin of collagen from enterococci). This segment is composed of two subdomains, N(1) and N(2), each adopting an IgG-like fold and forming a putative collagen binding surface at the interface between the two subdomains. This structure is very similar to that recently reported for CNA, the collagen binding MSCRAMM of Staphylococcus aureus, for which a unique ligand binding mechanism called the Collagen Hug was proposed. We suggest that ACE binds collagen by a similar mechanism and present the first biochemical evidence for this binding model. Replacing residues in the putative collagen binding trench of ACE N(2) with Ala residues affected collagen binding. A closed conformation of ACE stabilized by an engineered disulfide bond is unable to bind collagen. Finally, the importance of the residues in the N(2) extension in stabilizing the MSCRAMM-ligand complex is demonstrated by selected point and truncation mutations.
TI  - Emerging plasmid-encoded antisense RNA regulated systems.
AB  - Classic antisense RNA research has focused on detailed examination of a few plasmid-encoded systems whilst more recent efforts have focused on chromosomally encoded small RNAs. Recent work on newly identified plasmid-encoded antisense RNAs suggest that there is still much to learn from them about the versatility of regulatory RNAs. The alpha-proteobacterial repABC plasmids produce an antisense RNA that regulates the replication initiator independently of the partition proteins encoded in the same operon. The Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pSK41 produces an antisense RNA that regulates the replication initiator protein by a translational attenuation mechanism. Enterococcus faecalis pheromone-responsive plasmids produce plasmid-specific variants of an antisense RNA that regulates conjugation structural genes by a transcriptional attenuation mechanism. E. faecalis plasmid pAD1 encodes an antisense RNA-regulated addiction module that combines features of classic plasmid-encoded and trans-regulated chromosomally encoded antisense systems. Studies on these systems will expand our understanding of the repertoire of small RNA regulators.
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus strains that are hypersusceptible to resistance gene transfer from enterococci.
AB  - We identified naturally occurring Staphylococcus aureus mutants of the restriction modification pathway SauI, including bovine lineage ST151. In a model of vancomycin resistance transfer from Enterococcus faecalis, ST151 isolates are 500 times more susceptible than human S. aureus isolates. The eradication of "hyperrecipient" strains may reduce the evolution of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus.
TI  - Anti-MRSA beta-lactams in development, with a focus on ceftobiprole: the first anti-MRSA beta-lactam to demonstrate clinical efficacy.
AB  - Ceftobiprole is the first of the investigational beta-lactam antibiotics with in  vitro activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci to reach and complete Phase III therapeutic trials. Its antibacterial spectrum includes methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, penicillin-resistant streptococci and many Gram-negative pathogens. It has demonstrated in vivo activity against many experimental infections caused by these pathogens. Ceftobiprole has completed Phase III clinical trials for complicated skin and skin structure infections, is being studied in Phase III pneumonia trials and has demonstrated non-inferiority compared with vancomycin in a Phase III complicated skin and skin structure infections trial, resulting in > 90% clinical cures of infections caused by MRSA. Other anti-MRSA beta-lactams in therapeutic clinical trials include the carbapenem CS-023/RO-4908463 and the cephalosporin ceftaroline (PPI-0903). The future of all of these agents will depend on their clinical efficacy, safety and their ability to be accepted as beta-lactams for the reliable treatment of a broad spectrum of infections, including those caused by MRSA.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of autologous platelet gel enriched with growth factors and  other active substances: an in vitro study.
AB  - Platelet-rich plasma is a new inductive therapy which is being increasingly used  for the treatment of the complications of bone healing, such as infection and nonunion. The activator for platelet-rich plasma is a mixture of thrombin and calcium chloride which produces a platelet-rich gel. We analysed the antibacterial effect of platelet-rich gel in vitro by using the platelet-rich plasma samples of 20 volunteers. In vitro laboratory susceptibility to platelet-rich gel was determined by the Kirby-Bauer disc-diffusion method. Baseline antimicrobial activity was assessed by measuring the zones of inhibition on agar plates coated with selected bacterial strains. Zones of inhibition produced by platelet-rich gel ranged between 6 mm and 24 mm (mean 9.83 mm) in diameter. Platelet-rich gel inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and was also active against Escherichia coli. There was no activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moreover, platelet-rich gel seemed to induce the in vitro growth of Ps. aeruginosa, suggesting that it may cause an exacerbation of infections with this organism. We believe that a combination of the inductive and antimicrobial properties of platelet-rich gel can improve the treatment of infected delayed healing and nonunion.
TI  - Coniothyrione, a chlorocyclopentandienylbenzopyrone as a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor discovered by antisense technology.
AB  - Bacterial protein synthesis inhibitors interact mainly with rRNA and to some extent ribosomal proteins, which are potential targets for developing new antibacterial agents. Specifically, the ribosomal protein S4 of the 30s ribosomal subunit known as ribosomal protein small-subunit D (rpsD) may be useful as a target. The antisense-rpsD gene-sensitized two-plate assay led to the discovery of a novel chlorinated cyclopentandienylbenzopyrone antibiotic, coniothyrione, C14H9ClO6, isolated from Coniothyrium cerealis MF7209. It exhibited liquid MICs of 16-32 microg/mL against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis and >64 microg/mL against Escherichia coli. Isolation, structure elucidation, and antibacterial activity of coniothyrione are described.
TI  - Treatment of vegetable sauces with enterocin AS-48 alone or in combination with phenolic compounds to inhibit proliferation of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of enterocin AS-48 against Staphylococcus aureus was tested in vegetable sauces, alone and in combination with phenolic compounds. When added alone at 25 microg/ml, AS-48 inactivated all detectable staphylococci in napoletana and pesto sauces stored at 22 degrees C, but it only caused limited growth inhibition when these sauces were stored at 10 degrees C, as well as in other sauces such as carbonara and green sauce for fish. At 80 microg/ml, AS-48 eliminated all detectable staphylococci in napoletana, pesto, and green sauce for fish regardless of storage temperature, but it still had much more limited effect in carbonara sauce. Antistaphylococcal activity was potentiated significantly when AS-48 was used in combination with the phenolic compounds carvacrol, geraniol, eugenol, terpineol, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, citral, and hydrocinnamic acid. The efficacy of the combined treatments depended both on the phenolic compound and the type of sauce. In carbonara sauce stored at 22 degrees C, the combinations of 80 microg/ml AS-48 and 20 mM hydrocinnamic acid or 126 mM carvacrol reduced viable counts of staphylococci below detection limits for up to 30 days.
TI  - Preparation and antibacterial activity of copper and cobalt complexes of 4-chloro-3-nitrobenzoate with a nitrogen donor ligand.
AB  - Copper and cobalt complexes with 4-chloro-3-nitrobenzoate (ClNBz) and the nitrogen ligands 1,3-diaminopropane (1,3-DAP) or o-phenylenediamine (o-PDA), were prepared and characterized. The complexes [Cu(ClNBz)2(1,3-DAP)] (1), [Cu(ClNBz)(o-PDA)]Cl (2), [Co(ClNBz)2(1,3-DAP)] (3) and [Co(ClNBz)2(o-PDA)2] (4) were characterized by FTIR, UV-Visible absorption, elemental analysis and thermal analysis. Complex [Cu(ClNBz)(o-PDA)]Cl (2) shows high antibacterial activity as indicated by its ability to inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - CW-270033, a novel pyrrolidinyl-thio carbapenem, has potent antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - CW-270033, an injectable carbapenem, is a novel, synthesized pyrrolidinyl-thio carbapenem. In the present study, the in-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activities of CW-270033 against wild-type strains and clinical isolates were compared with those of imipenem and meropenem. CW-270033 was more active than imipenem against Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) clinical isolates, but was slightly less active than meropenem. Against the Gram-positive clinical isolates methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), CW-270033 was slightly more active than meropenem, but was less active than imipenem. CW-270033 displayed potent in-vivo activity against E. coli ATCC 25922, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and S. aureus SMITH in the mouse systemic infection model; the efficacy of CW-270033 in this model was 2--7 fold higher than that of meropenem. This activity was comparable to the in-vitro activity of CW-270033. An intravenous injection of CW-270033 showed that the half-life of CW-270033 in serum in mice was about 20 min, which was about two times that of meropenem. CW-270033 was also found to be resistant to hydrolysis by the mouse renal dehydropeptidase I (DHP-I) enzyme.
TI  - Potent, synergistic inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus upon exposure to a combination of the endopeptidase lysostaphin and the cationic peptide ranalexin.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Successful treatment of infections involving multiply drug-resistant  methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is becoming increasingly difficult. In this work, we have investigated the potential of combining lysostaphin with cationic antimicrobial peptides to effectively inhibit Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS: S. aureus strains were grown in 96-well plates in the presence of increasing concentrations of lysostaphin and the peptides ranalexin, dermaseptin S3(1-16) or magainin 2. Growth was determined visually after 48 h and the plates imaged, or by automated optical density readings in a plate reader. Susceptibility to the combination of lysostaphin and ranalexin was also determined by viable cell counts. The efficacy of combined lysostaphin and ranalexin on a solid surface was tested via disc diffusion assays. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Combination of lysostaphin with ranalexin resulted in potent, synergistic inhibition of S. aureus MSSA476 and MRSA252. Synergistic inhibition was specific for lysostaphin-susceptible staphylococci and was not observed with clinical isolates of the Gram-negative Escherichia coli, or other Gram-positive organisms, such as Enterococcus faecalis. Lysostaphin was not specifically synergistic with ranalexin alone. Synergy was also observed with two other cationic antimicrobial peptides, magainin 2 and dermaseptin s3(1-16); although combination with ranalexin was most potent. Synergistic inhibition by ranalexin in combination with lysostaphin resulted in an enhanced bactericidal effect. Importantly, synergy between lysostaphin and ranalexin was also observed after impregnation and drying in filter paper discs that clearly inhibited growth of S. aureus on the surface of agar; a solid, porous matrix. Thus, the combination could represent a novel route to target wounds infected with drug-resistant MRSA via dressings impregnated with the two compounds.
TI  - Semisynthetic approaches to laspartomycin analogues.
AB  - Laspartomycin C (1), a lipopeptide antibiotic related to amphomycin, consists of  a cyclic peptide core and an aspartic acid unit external to the core and linking this to a C15-2,3-unsaturated fatty acid. This was reported initially to be active against Staphylococcus aureus, and more recent studies have shown that it is active against VRE, VISA, and MRSA isolates. The enzymatic cleavage of the fatty acid tail was accomplished with a deacylase produced by Actinoplanes utahensis and resulted in two peptides, designated Peptide 1 and Peptide 2. Semisynthetic derivatives of both peptides have been made, and the principal requirement for biological activity appears to be the presence of an acylaspartic acid.
TI  - Characterization of macrolide resistance in Gram-positive cocci from Colombian hospitals: a countrywide surveillance.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The characterization of macrolide resistance in Gram-positive cocci recovered from Colombian hospitals. METHODS: The resistance profiles and mechanism of macrolide resistance were investigated in isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (1679), Staphylococcus aureus (348), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (175), and Enterococcus spp (123). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for erythromycin (ERY) and clindamycin (CLI), detection of macrolide resistance genes, phenotypic characterization, and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of macrolide-resistant pneumococci were performed. RESULTS: Resistance to ERY and CLI was 3.3% and 2.3% for S. pneumoniae, 58% and 57% for S. aureus (94% for both compounds in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)), and 78.6% and 60.7% in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, respectively. ERY resistance was 62% in Enterococcus faecalis and 82% in Enterococcus faecium. The MLS(B)-type accounted for 71% of S. pneumoniae and 100% of MRSA. The erm(A) gene was prevalent in MRSA, erm(B) in S. pneumoniae and enterococci, and erm(C) in CoNS isolates. Efflux pump genes (mef(A) genes) were mostly identified in S. pneumoniae (24%). The most common genotype amongst ERY-resistant pneumococci was the Spain(6B)-2 clone. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of macrolide resistance is low in Colombian pneumococci and high in MRSA (cMLS(B)-type).
TI  - Molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. METHODS: Samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. On the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. The isolates were determined as Lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16S rDNA. Sequencing of 16S rDNA genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies levels. RESULTS: Predominant species were Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus cellobiosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus gasseri were also present. The isolates Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1, Lactobacillus fermentum BGHO36 and BGHO64, Lactobacillus gasseri BGHO89 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis BGHO99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus flavus, Salmonella enteritidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of Candida albicans. Moreover, the isolates L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 were tolerant to low pH and high concentration of bile salts. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings imply that L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of some tetrahydronaphthalene-benzimidazole derivatives.
AB  - Novel retinoid derivatives containing a benzimidazole moiety were synthesized and tested for their antimicrobial activity. Their antimicrobial activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida krusei and Candida albicans were evaluated. While some of the compounds exhibited moderate activity against MRSA, S. aureus, E. faecalis, C. krusei and C. albicans, none of the compounds showed activity against E. coli and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - In vitro growth control of selected pathogens by Lactobacillus acidophilus- and Lactobacillus casei-fermented milk.
AB  - AIMS: Food-borne pathogen inhibition was tested in the presence of a mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei during fermentation under controlled pH conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS: The growth of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella serotype Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria innocua, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis was evaluated for 48 h at 37 degrees C. In the presence of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB), an increase of the generation time was observed for all the gram-positive bacteria evaluated. Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive strain showing an increase of the generation time by 210%. However, for all the gram-negative bacteria evaluated, no inhibition occurred after 8 h of fermentation. The soluble portion of Lact. acidophilus- and Lact. casei-fermented milk was recuperated and tested for its antimicrobial activity. Listeria innocua and Staph. aureus were the most sensitive to the presence of fermented milk supernatant showing an inhibition of 85.9% and 84.7%, respectively. This soluble fraction was neutralized to eliminate the antimicrobial effect of the organic acids produced; the most sensitive strains were L. innocua and E. coli O157:H7 showing an inhibition of 65.9% and 61.9%, respectively. Finally, the soluble fraction was neutralized and irradiated at 45 kGy using a (60)Co source to eliminate the possible antimicrobial effect of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like substances. Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli O157:H7 and Staph. aureus were the most affected bacteria by this fraction, showing 39.1, 32 and 31.2% inhibition, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study suggest the implication of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances in the antimicrobial activity observed in the soluble fraction of the probiotic preparation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study revealed the antimicrobial mechanisms of action of Lact. acidophilus- and Lact. casei-fermented milk used to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
TI  - [National Study of Control of Nosocomial Infection in Intensive Care Units. Evolutive report of the years 2003-2005].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Describe the national rates of acquired invasive device-related infections in the ICU during 2003, 2004 and 2005, their etiology and evolution of the multiresistance markers. DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. SCOPE: Intensive Care Unit or other units where critical patients are admitted. PATIENTS: 21,608 patients admitted for more than 24 hours in the participating ICUs. MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST: Device related infections: pneumonias related with mechanical ventilation (N-MV), urinary infections related with urethral probe (UI-UP) and primary bacteriemias (PB) and/or those related with at risk vascular catheters (BCV). RESULTS: In 2,279 (10.5%) patients, 3,151 infections were detected: 1,469 N-MV, 808 UI-UP and 874 PB/RVC. Incidence rates ranged from 15.5 to 17.5 N-MV per 1,000 days of mechanical ventilation, 5.0 to 6.7 UI-UP per 1,000 days of urethral probe and 4.0 to 4.7 PB/RVC per 1,000 days of vascular catheter. The predominant etiology in the N-MV was meticillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. The UI-UP were originated predominantly by Escherichia coli, Candida albicans and Enterococcus faecalis. A. baumannii and E. coli have increased their resistance to imipenem and ciprofloxacin or cefotaxime, respectively, in the last year controlled. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated rates persist in all the infections controlled, without change in the etiology and increase of resistance of gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - [Bacterial meningitis in Denmark 2002-2003. A nation-wide laboratory-based registration].
AB  - Notification of bacterial meningitis (BM) is likely to be incomplete, and a recent Danish study indicated that unbalanced notification may bias expected aetiology of BM. Therefore the Danish Bacterial Meningitis Group initiated a national registration of culture-positive BM. METHODS: Laboratory data on all bacterial isolates from cerebrospinal fluid deemed to be clinically relevant were identified on a national basis during 2002 and 2003. Bacterial findings were compared to cases notified during the same period. RESULTS: A total of 404 BM cases were identified. The distribution of bacterial species differed from the national notification data during the same period especially with respect to Staphylococcus aureus (6.7% vs. 0.6%), Escherichia coli (3.5% vs. 0%) and non-Streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci (10% vs. 1.9%). The overall notification-rate was 66%, and was below 20% for S. aureus, E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis, non-S. pneumoniae streptococci and for 13 cases of "other bacteria". Sensitivity to antibiotics in the BM cases was as expected for Northern Europe. Reduced sensitivity to penicillin was found in 2/202 S. pneumoniae, in 2/10 Listeria monocytogenes, and 21/27 S. aureus were penicillin resistant. E. coli was resistant to ampicillin in 5 of 13 cases and to gentamicin in 1 of 11 cases. DISCUSSION: A suboptimal notification rate with an unbalanced species distribution was found. Laboratory based data thus constitute an improved basis for future recommendations for empirical treatment of BM. A continued national collaboration may promote the development of quality indicators for diagnosis and initial treatment of BM.
TI  - Synthesis of rigidly-linked vancomycin dimers and their in vivo efficacy against  resistant bacteria.
AB  - A novel and efficient avenue for the preparation of dimeric vancomycins is described, and the dimers exhibited excellent antibacterial activities in the murine infection model.
TI  - Identification and quantitation of usnic acid from the lichen Usnea species of Anatolia and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Six species of lichens, such as Usnea florida, Usnea barbata, Usnea longissima, Usnea rigida, Usnea hirta and Usnea subflorida, were collected from different areas of Anatolia (district of Antalya, Karabuk, Qankiri, Giresun and Trabzon) in Turkey. Their usnic acid amounts in acetone extracts were determined by HPLC. In addition, antimicrobial activities of these extracts were determined against Escherichia coli (ATCC 35218), Enterococcus faecalis (RSKK 508), Proteus mirabilis (Pasteur Ens. 235), Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus megaterium. It was shown that with increasing amount of usnic acid, the antimicrobial activity increased. Usnic acid contents of Usnea species varied between 0.22-6.49% of dry weight.
TI  - Synthesis and structure-antibacterial activity relationship investigation of isomeric 2,3,5-substituted perhydropyrrolo[3,4-d]isoxazole-4,6-diones.
AB  - The synthesis of 2,3,5-substituted perhydropyrrolo[3,4-d]isoxazole-4,6-diones (44 compounds) has been accomplished by the cycloaddition reaction of N-methyl-C-arylnitrones with N-substituted maleimides. The compounds were screened for their antibacterial activities and most of them exhibited activity against Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923). cis-3a and cis-3d were found fairly effective against E. faecalis (ATCC 29212) and S. aureus (ATCC 25923) with MIC values of 25 and 50microg/ml. With the changes of cis isomers of the compounds to trans, their antibacterial activities also changed against the bacteria studied. First, pharmacophoric fragments had been calculated in accordance with the rules of the electronic-topological method (ETM). Next, both active compounds and pharmacophores had been projected to the nodes of Kohonen's self-organizing maps (SOM) to obtain the weights of pharmacophore fragments as numerical descriptors, that were used after this for the associative neural networks (ASNN) training. A model for the activity prediction was developed as the result of training the ASNNs.
TI  - Evaluation of the growth inhibitory activities of Triphala against common bacterial isolates from HIV infected patients.
AB  - The isolation of microbial agents less susceptible to regular antibiotics and the rising trend in the recovery rates of resistant bacteria highlights the need for newer alternative principles. Triphala has been used in traditional medicine practice against certain diseases such as jaundice, fever, cough, eye diseases etc. In the present study phytochemical (phenolic, flavonoid and carotenoid) and antibacterial activities of aqueous and ethanol extracts of Triphala and its individual components (Terminalia chebula, Terminalia belerica and Emblica officinalis) were tested against certain bacterial isolates (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella sonnei, S. flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella paratyphi-B, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhi) obtained from HIV infected patients using Kirby-Bauer's disk diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods. T. chebula was found to possess high phytochemical content followed by T. belerica and E. officinalis in both aqueous and ethanol extracts. Further, most of the bacterial isolates were inhibited by the ethanol and aqueous extracts of T. chebula followed by T. belerica and E. officinalis by both disk diffusion and MIC methods. The present study revealed that both individual and combined aqueous and ethanol extracts of Triphala have antibacterial activity against the bacterial isolates tested.
TI  - Potentiation of antimicrobial activity of aminoglycosides by carnosol from Salvia officinalis.
AB  - We found that a crude extract from Salvia officinalis (sage) reduced the minimum  inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of aminoglycosides in vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). We isolated the effective compound from the extract and identified it as carnosol, one of diterpenoids. Carnosol showed a weak antimicrobial activity, and greatly reduced the MICs of various aminoglycosides (potentiated the antimicrobial activity of aminoglycosides) and some other types of antimicrobial agents in VRE. Carnosic acid, a related compound, showed the similar activity. The effect of carnosol and carnosic acid with gentamicin was synergistic.
TI  - Bacterial isolates from severe infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in Italy: a nationwide study in the hospital setting.
AB  - The most frequent agents of severe bacterial infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns were determined in patients admitted to 45 Italian hospitals over the years 2002-2003. The most common diagnoses were: sepsis (33.8%), pneumonia (9.4%), intravascular catheter-associated infections (9.3%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (8.1%). Overall, 5115 bacterial isolates were identified from 4228 patients. Three bacterial species, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, accounted for more than 50% of the isolates. Other prevalent bacterial isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis, while Acinetobacter baumanii ranked third among all Intensive Care Unit (ICU) isolates. 7% of S. aureus had intermediate resistance to vancomycin. Although E. faecalis displayed no vancomycin resistance, 34% of vancomycin-resistant isolates were found among Enterococcus faecium, one of the highest rates found to date, emphasizing the difference between these two enterococcal species. All the Gram-positive pathogens were susceptible to linezolid, with the exception of approximately 2% of the enterococcal isolates that were intermediate with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)=4 microg/ml. Almost 10% of Escherichia coli, 14% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 22% of Serratia marcescens and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae were non-susceptible to cefotaxime. Amikacin was the most active antibiotic against P. aeruginosa that showed lack of susceptibility to ceftazidime, gentamicin, piperacillin and ciprofloxacin ranging from 20 to 35%. Finally, Acinetobacter baumanii showed a high level of resistance to all the antibiotics tested including imipenem (58%). The results obtained in this study, the first of its kind in Italy, offer indications for guiding empirical therapy and implementing specific interventions to fight antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and their transmission in the hospital setting in Italy.
TI  - Role of bacterial and host factors in infectious endophthalmitis.
AB  - Endophthalmitis is a frequent blinding complication of globe-penetrating injury and ocular surgery. The outcome of this intraocular infection depends both on the organism involved and management of the ensuing inflammation. The role of various toxins and bacterial factors in the pathogenesis of this infection is beginning to be delineated, but appears to be organism specific. Because of the immune-privileged environment of the eye, principles important in the resolution of infection at extraocular sites cannot be extrapolated to understanding the host-parasite dynamics in eye infection. Moreover, some factors that suppress the intraocular immune environment appear to have unexpected roles in activating phagocytic cells of the innate immune system in response to the presence of bacteria. Therefore, considerable additional information characterizing the precise role of bacterial and host factors in the pathogenesis of endophthalmitis will be required in order to develop new therapies to improve the outcome of this often blinding infection.
TI  - Antimicrobial analysis of different root canal filling pastes used in pediatric dentistry by two experimental methods.
AB  - The objective of this study was to compare, by two experimental methods, the antimicrobial efficacy of different root canal filling pastes used in pediatric dentistry. The tested materials were: Guedes-Pinto paste (GPP), zinc oxide-eugenol paste (OZEP), calcium hydroxide paste (CHP), chloramphenicol + tetracycline + zinc oxide and eugenol paste (CTZP) and Vitapex. Fiven microbial strains (S. aureus, E. faecalis, P. aeruginosa, B. subtilis and C. albicans) obtained from the American Type Culture Collection were inoculated in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. For the direct exposure test (DET), 72 paper points were contaminated with the standard microbial suspensions and exposed to the root canal filling pastes for 1, 24, 48 and 72 h. The points were immersed in Letheen Broth (LB), followed by incubation at 37 degrees C for 48 h. An inoculum of 0.1 mL obtained from LB was then transferred to 7 mL of BHI, under identical incubations conditions and the microbial growth was evaluated. The pastes showed activity between 1 and 24 h, depending on the material. For the agar diffusion test (ADT), 30 Petri plates with 20 mL of BHI agar were inoculated with 0.1 mL of the microbial suspension, using sterile swabs that were spread on the medium. Three cavities were made in each agar plate (total = 90) and completely filled with one of the filling root canal pastes. The plates were pre-incubated for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 to 48 h. The inhibition zone around each well was recorded in mm. The complete antimicrobial effect in the direct exposure test was observed after 24 h on all microbial indicators. All root canal filling materials induced the formation of inhibition zones, except for Vitapex (range, 6.0-39.0 mm).
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of endodontic sealers.
AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the endodontic sealers: N-Rickert, Sealapex, AH Plus, Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) and portland cement. The Agar diffusion method was used in plates previously inoculated with the following microorganisms: C. albicans, S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. coli. The diameters of microbial inhibition zones were measured after 24 hours of incubation in kiln at 37 degrees C. According to the methodology used, it was possible to conclude that only the sealers AH Plus and N-Rickert presented antimicrobial activity against C. albicans, S. aureus, and E. coli; no antimicrobial activity in MTA, Sealapex and portland cement was observed. N-Rickert presented the largest inhibition zones varying from 8 to 18 mm, and the microorganism E. faecalis was resistant against all sealers tested.
TI  - Genotypic and phenotypic diversity of Lactococcus lactis isolates from Batzos, a  Greek PDO raw goat milk cheese.
AB  - The genotypic and phenotypic variability of 40 Lactococcus lactis isolates obtained from three cheese-making trials of Batzos cheese made one in each, winter, spring and summer was investigated. RAPD-PCR, plasmid profiling and PFGE were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. Results showed a high degree of heterogeneity among strains. According to PFGE data, all strains except one were clustered together (at a similarity level of approximately 50%) with the L. lactis subsp. lactis reference strain and eleven groups of isolates consisting of 2-8 strains each were distinguished. Plasmid profiling results revealed that there were eight isolates lacking plasmids and nine having unique plasmids. Twenty-three isolates were allocated into six groups. There was an interesting similarity between the plasmid profiling groups and those formed according to PFGE. Clustering of strains according to RAPD-PCR was in agreement with results obtained by both plasmid profiling and PFGE for the majority of the strains. In addition, results obtained by molecular methods indicate a grouping of most of the strains according to the season of cheese production. All strains inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli O157:H7. Their ability to affect the growth of Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus faecalis was strain dependent. In 42.5% of the isolates high acidifying ability in milk after 24 h was recorded and these were isolates, mainly, from fresh cheese. The 75% of the isolates from winter cheese exhibited higher Lys- than Leu-aminopeptidase activity while the approximately 67% of the isolates from summer cheese showed higher Leu- than Lys-aminopeptidase activity. Their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk for 24 h was significant with preference for alpha(s)-casein degradation. The majority (90%) of the strains formed methanethiol from methionine and this ability was strain dependent. These results suggest that among the wild lactococcal population from Batzos cheese there are interesting strains appropriate to be used as starters for the dairy industry.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro activity of daptomycin against 19615 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci collected in North American hospitals (2002-2005).
AB  - We evaluated the antimicrobial activity of daptomycin against 19,615 clinical strains consecutively collected by numerous centers located across the United States and Canada (2002-2005). Daptomycin was very active against all indicated species (>99% susceptible), with the highest MIC results being 2, 8, 0.5, and 1 microg/mL for staphylococci, enterococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci, respectively, and no significant loss in potency was observed over the period studied.
TI  - Catheter associated infections in hemodialysis patients.
AB  - Hemodialysis catheter related infections (HCRI) are one of the major causes of increasing mortality, morbidity and cost of therapy in hemodialysis patients. Prevention of HCRI requires the identification of predisposing risk factors. To determine the frequency of HCRI risk factors, we studied 116 patients (54% male, mean age of 49.5+/-16 years) patients with HCRI between 2003-2004. Forty one percent of the patients were diabetic. There was a history of previous catheter placement and infection in 41% and 32% of patients, respectively. Pathogenic organisms isolated from blood cultures included Staphylococcus-aureus 42%, Coagulase-negative Staphylococci 20%, E. Coli 19%, Enterococci 7%, Streptococcus D 7%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 4%, and Klebsiella 1%. Bacterial resistance to vancomycin and amikacin was present in 7% and 4% of the cases, respectively. Hemodialysis catheter related blood borne infections comprised 67% of the total blood-borne infections in our hospital. No significant statistical association was found between HCRI and age, gender, diabetes mellitus, serum albumin level <30 g/L, leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anatomical location of catheter, mean duration of antibiotic therapy, mean catheter duration, frequency of hemodialysis sessions, pathogenic organisms, and history of previous catheter infection. We conclude that the prevalence of pathogenic organisms of HCRI were similar to previous studies. However, bacterial resistance to antibiotics was low. The mean duration of catheter usage was longer than previously reported.
TI  - Histidine-rich glycoprotein exerts antibacterial activity.
AB  - Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRGP), an abundant heparin-binding protein found in  plasma and thrombocytes, exerts antibacterial effects against Gram-positive bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Fluorescence studies and electron microscopy to assess membrane permeation showed that HRGP induces lysis of E. faecalisbacteria in the presence of Zn2+ or at low pH. Heparin blocked binding of the protein to E. faecalis and abolished antibacterial activity. Furthermore, truncated HRGP, devoid of the heparin-binding and histidine-rich domain, was not antibacterial. It has previously been shown that peptides containing consensus heparin-binding sequences (Cardin and Weintraub motifs) are antibacterial. Thus, the peptide (GHHPH)4, derived from the histidine-rich region of HRGP and containing such a heparin-binding motif, was antibacterial for E. faecalis in the presence of Zn2+ or at low pH. The results show a previously undisclosed antibacterial activity of HRGP and suggest that the histidine-rich and heparin-binding domain of HRGP mediates the antibacterial activity of the protein.

TI  - In vitro activity of the oxazolidinone RWJ-416457 against linezolid-resistant and -susceptible staphylococci and enterococci.
AB  - RWJ-416457, a novel oxazolidinone, had modal MICs of 0.5 to 1 microg/ml for linezolid-susceptible staphylococci and enterococci, versus linezolid MICs for these organisms of 1 or 2 microg/ml. RWJ-416457 MICs for mutants with 23S rRNA mutations were 2 to 32 microg/ml, versus linezolid MICs of 8 to 64 microg/ml; actual values reflected the proportion of gene copies mutated.
TI  - [Distribution of bacteria isolated from urine cultures in Malatya University Hospital laboratory (letter)].
AB  - The aim of this letter was to report the distribution of bacterial species isolated from the urine samples of patients in Malatya, which is located in Estern Anatolia part of Turkey. A total of 3.774 urine cultures were performed in the period of April-June 2006, and 792 (21%) of them yielded bacterial growth. The isolates have been identified by conventional methods and confirmed by Phoenix 100 (Becton-Dickinson) system. As a result, 702 (89%) Gram negative and 90 (11%) Gram positive bacteria were isolated from the samples. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli (58%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (14%), Pseudomonas spp. (6.4%), Enterococcus spp. (5%), Staphylococcus spp. (3.8%) and Streptococcus spp. (1.7%). The species distribution was found as follows; K. pneumoniae ssp pneumoniae (95/110), P. aeruginosa (48/51), E.faecalis (27/40), E. cloacae (19/29), P.mirabilis (19/22), C.freundii (8/12), coagulase negative staphylococci (19/30) and S. aureus (11/30). The first three array were shared by E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas spp. for the samples of both outpatients and inpatients, while Pseudomonas spp. and E. coli were the most frequently isolated bacteria from the urine samples of intensive care unit patients. Our data was found parallel to the results of other national and international studies.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of daptomycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium using human peak free serum drug concentrations.
AB  - The bactericidal activities of daptomycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid  at human peak free serum concentrations (C(max,free)) were determined against Staphylococcus aureus (one methicillin-susceptible and two methicillin-resistant strains), Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium (one vancomycin-susceptible and one vancomycin-resistant strain of each). Daptomycin was rapidly bactericidal against 7/7 strains at C(max,free) of 22.0 mg/L (corresponding to 63% protein binding) and against 3/7 strains at 4.8 mg/L (corresponding to 92% protein binding). Vancomycin (18.0 mg/L) was bactericidal against only two strains. Both teicoplanin (4.5 mg/L) and linezolid (10.4 mg/L) were consistently bacteriostatic. Daptomycin is a useful option for the treatment of Gram-positive infections owing to its strong bactericidal activity.
TI  - A review of the current place of glycopeptides in turkish medical practice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glycopeptide antibiotics are considered by many investigators to be the last resort in the treatment of gram-positive bacterial infections. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to assess the place of glycopeptides in the treatment of common gram-positive bacteria in accordance with the current epidemiologic data in Turkey. METHODS: A search of both the English- and Turkish-language literature indexed on MEDLINE, Ulakbim (Turkey), and Pleksus (Turkey) was performed using the terms: vancomycin, teicoplanin, and glycopeptides, or their Turkish-language counterparts. The complete texts of the articles found in these databases were obtained from the electronic library of Gulhane Medical Academy, Ankara, Turkey. Articles from regional journals, without the support of an electronic format, were obtained by direct communication. Articles of interest were those based on studies occurring in Turkish populations, with special consideration given to publications in press after 2002. RESULTS: Staphylococci were the most frequent gram-positive pathogens encountered in Turkish hospitals. Studies have found that approximately 74% of strains were Staphylococcus aureus and the remaining strains were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). Overall methicillin resistance in staphylococci was reported as approximately 60%. In Turkey, S aureus was one of the most common infectious agents found inside hospitals and is deemed a growing threat in the community. While the rate of methicillin resistance in community-acquired isolates is approximately 4%, the data from hospitals suggest that reduced resistance comprises most of the isolates. In the studies reviewed, older quinolones like ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin seem to be ineffective in nearly half of the S aureus isolates. Alternatives like rifampicin, gentamicin, tetracycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), clindamycin, and erythromycin have had substantial resistance profiles in >50% of the strains. In recent Turkish studies, in vitro profiles of linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin (QD), and daptomycin have had positive results. As in the S aureus isolates, resistance trends have been observed in the CoNS group of pathogens. The possible use of beta-lactams seems restricted, and alternative approaches have become necessary. Quinolones, gentamicin, tetracycline, TMP/SMX, clindamycin, and erythromycin have resistance profiles of >50%. Although glycopeptide resistance was not detected, the frequency of heterogenous vancomycin-intermediate S aureus, a precursor to future resistance, was 13% in 1 study. Current studies in Turkey have found that Enterococcus faecalis comprises three quarters of enterococci while the rest are comprised of Enterococcus faecium. Initial studies performed with linezolid, QD, and daptomycin suggest that these drugs might be effective alternatives for future enterococcal infections that may have high glycopeptide resistance. Approximately 8% of the Streptococcus pneumoniae strains had high-level resistance in Turkey. However, 10 million units of crystallized penicillin or 3 g of oral amoxicillin maintains the optimum treatment of pneumococcal infections outside the central nervous system (CNS). Resistance profiles in third-generation cephalosporins in Turkey range between 2% and 2.5%. CONCLUSIONS: In Turkey, a review of the existing literature found that the current use of glycopeptides in pneumococcal infections is restricted to CNS infections facing therapeutic failure in due course. However, the belief that these drugs are the last resort, either in staphylococcal or enterococcal infections, is no longer valid. If a patient has a critical status due to probable gram-positive microorganisms, clinicians should consider the empiric use of glycopeptides. However, new molecules such as linezolid, QD, and daptomycin, offered for use in the treatment of gram-positive bacterial diseases, should be reserved for the future, when glycopeptides eventually become obsolete.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of crude extracts from plants Bryophyllum pinnatum and Kalanchoe crenata.
AB  - Extracts from the leaves of Bryophyllum pinnatum and Kalanchoe crenata were screened for their antimicrobial activities. Solvents used included water, methanol, and local solvents such as palmwine, local gin (Seaman's Schnapps 40% alcoholic drink,) and "omi ekan-ogi" (Sour water from 3 days fermented milled maize). Leaves were dried and powdered before being soaked in solvents for 3 days. Another traditional method of extraction by squeezing raw juice from the leaves was also employed. All extracts were lyophilized. These extracts were tested against some gram-negative organisms (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella paratyphi, Citrobacter spp); gram-positive organisms Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25213, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis) and a fungus (Candida albicans). Agar well diffusion and broth dilution methods were used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) at concentrations of 512 mg/ml to 4 mg/ml. All the organisms except Candida albicans were susceptible to the extracts obtained from the traditional method. The squeezed-leaf juice of Kalanchoe crenata was the most active one with MIC of 8 mg/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bacillus subtilis, 32 mg/ml against Shigella flexneri, 64 mg/ml against Escherichia coli and 128 mg/ml against the control strain Staphylococcus aureus while its MBC is 256 mg/ml against these organisms except Bacillus subtilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The gram-positive organisms were more sensitive to the methanol and local gin-extract of Bryophyllum pinnatum. Extracts from other solvents showed moderate to weak activity.
TI  - Exploring the antibacterial and hemolytic activity of shorter- and longer-chain beta-, alpha,beta-, and gamma-peptides, and of beta-peptides from beta2-3-aza- and beta3-2-methylidene-amino acids bearing proteinogenic side chains--a survey.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of 31 different beta-, mixed alpha/beta-, and gamma-peptides, as well as of beta-peptides derived from beta2-3-aza- and beta3-2-methylidene-amino acids were assayed against six pathogens (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and the results were compared with literature data. The interaction of these peptides with mammalian cells, as modeled by measuring the hemolysis of human erythrocytes, was also investigated. In addition to those peptides designed to fold into amphiphilic helical conformations with positive charges on one face of the helix, one new peptide with hemolytic activity was detected within the sample set. Moreover, it was demonstrated that neither cationic peptides used for membrane translocation (beta3-oligoarginines), nor mixed alpha/beta- or gamma-peptides with somatostatin-mimicking activities display unwanted hemolytic activity.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of diterpenoids from hairy roots of Salvia sclarea L.: salvipisone as a potential anti-biofilm agent active against antibiotic resistant Staphylococci.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of crude dichloromethane fractions from acetone extracts of Agrobacterium rhizogenes transformed roots and roots of field-grown plants of Salvia sclarea as well as four pure abietane diterpenoids isolated from the hairy root cultures were determined. The growth of Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis) but not Gram-negative ones (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) or pathogenic fungi (Candida albicans) was inhibited by fractions tested at concentrations of 37.5-75.0 microgml(-1). Abietane diterpenoids: salvipisone, aethiopinone, 1-oxoaethiopinone and ferruginol were shown to be bacteriostatic as well as bacteriocidal for the cultures of S. aureus and S. epidermidis strains, regardless of their antibiotic susceptibility profile. This was demonstrated by using simultaneously the optical density measuring method and 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide-reduction assay. The highest activity was shown by salvipisone which demonstrated also a very interesting activity when its effect on 24-h-old staphylococcal biofilm cells viability was examined. It limited the survival of biofilms formed by S. aureus as well as by S. epidermidis, putting this compound to the list of potential anti-biofilm agents, better than most of known antibiotics.
TI  - Use of linezolid in children: an overview of recent advances.
AB  - Linezolid is the first member of a new generation of antibiotics, the synthetic oxazolidinones, to become available, with a broad spectrum of in vitro activity against gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium. Linezolid is showing great promise currently for the treatment of multiresistant gram-positive bacterial infections, especially complicated skin infections, catheter-induced bacteremia or nosocomial pneumonia both in the community and in a hospital setting, in children and in adults. Although most recent reports are favorable and anticipatory of a more extensive use of linezolid in appropriately selected pediatric population groups in the near future, following treatment failure of conventional antimicrobial agents, more clinical trials are, however, required to investigate the safety profile and tolerability of this new antibiotic in the pediatric population.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against quinolone-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Tigecycline is a glycylcycline with promising broad-spectrum activity, including  resistant Gram-positive organisms. This study characterizes in vitro activity of tigecycline against quinolone-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (QRSP), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). An in vitro pharmacodynamic model generated specific bacterial kill profiles for tigecycline against clinical isolates of QRSP, MRSA and VRE. Tigecycline produced a 6.6 log total reduction and cleared QRSP from the pharmacodynamic model by 18 h. Tigecycline and vancomycin were unable to achieve 3-log reductions in the MRSA and VRE isolates; log reductions in MRSA and VRE were 1.5 and 1.2 logs for tigecycline and 2.8 and zero for vancomycin, respectively. Area under the concentration time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) values for tigecycline ranged from 79 to 158 microg h/mL and tigecycline concentrations remained above the MIC (T>MIC) throughout the simulated dosing interval. Tigecycline showed in vitro activity against the QRSP, MRSA and VRE isolates studied. Low MIC values, prolonged elimination half-life and the associated post-antibiotic effect (PAE) observed with tigecycline are desirable attributes that make it a potentially attractive option for treating resistant Gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Comparison of BACTEC PLUS blood culture media to BacT/Alert FA blood culture media for detection of bacterial pathogens in samples containing therapeutic levels of antibiotics.
AB  - Blood culture bottles with antimicrobial removal systems are recommended for patients who develop fever while on antibiotics. This study compared the ability of Becton Dickinson (Sparks, MD) BACTEC PLUS bottles and bioMerieux (Durham, NC) BacT/Alert FA bottles to effectively remove vancomycin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, and a combination of gentamicin/penicillin, thus allowing bacterial pathogens to grow. Each bottle was spiked with 10 ml of human blood, antibiotic, and strains of organisms susceptible to the antibiotic evaluated. The organisms used were type strains and clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible and resistant), Streptococcus pneumoniae, a viridans streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Testing was completed in triplicate, using 10 to 100 CFU/ml of organisms with various concentrations of each antibiotic. Two rounds of testing were completed per antibiotic/organism combination. Bottles were mixed and loaded onto their respective instruments as per the manufacturer's instructions. Antimicrobial removal was evaluated on the basis of time to detection of organism growth, for up to 5 days of incubation. Overall, the BacT/Alert FA system recovered 25.1% of strains from test bottles and 96.9% of strains from growth control bottles (no antibiotic added), and the BACTEC PLUS system recovered 95.1% of strains from test bottles and 100% of strains from growth control bottles. Both systems performed well in the detection of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of gentamicin. In the presence of ceftriaxone, neither system was able to recover Streptococcus pneumoniae. The ability to remove vancomycin and cefoxitin was also determined by measuring antibiotic levels remaining in bottles after 1 h of incubation. The results demonstrated remaining levels of 72 to 90% of vancomycin and 71 to 72% of cefoxitin in the BacT/Alert system. For the BACTEC system, remaining levels were 0 to 30% of vancomycin and 0% of cefoxitin. Under these simulated conditions, the BACTEC PLUS system was superior to the BacT/Alert FA system in recovering gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics, gentamicin/penicillin, and vancomycin.
TI  - Infective endocarditis: changing epidemiology and predictors of 6-month mortality: a prospective cohort study.
AB  - AIMS: The aim here is to analyse epidemiology, optimal treatment, and predictors  of 6-month mortality in infective endocarditis (IE). METHODS AND RESULTS: A prospective observational cohort study included 193 patients with 203 episodes of definite IE by the modified Duke criteria. Thirty-four percent of episodes involved prosthetic valves. Thirty-three percent of episodes were nosocomial. Forty-three percent included staphylococci, 26% streptococci, and 17% enterococci. At least one complication occurred in 79% of the episodes and 63% had surgical intervention. Six-month mortality was 22%: 33% for staphylococci, 24% for enterococci, and 8% for streptococci. Seventy-four percent of patients with a contraindication to surgery died when compared with 7% with medical treatment without a contraindication and 16% with surgical treatment. In multivariable logistic regression, predictors of 6-month mortality were age (P=0.03), the causative microorganism (P=0.04), and treatment group (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Compared with older series, we observed more prosthetic valve IE, nosocomial IE, and surgery. Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis were predominant microorganisms. Age, staphylococci, and a contraindication to surgery predicted 6-month mortality. Nearly half of deaths had a contraindication to surgery. Six-month mortality did not differ significantly between patients who received surgical treatment as against those who received medical treatment without a contraindication to surgery.
TI  - Synthesis of a novel inhibitor against MRSA and VRE: preparation from zerumbone ring opening material showing histidine-kinase inhibition.
AB  - Zerumbone ring-opening derivative 2 inhibited autophosphorylation of the essential histidine protein kinase (HPK), YycG, existing in Bacillus subtilis constituting a two-component system (TCS). However, it did not inhibit drug-resistant bacterium such as MRSA and VRE. Tryptophan derivative 34 also could be regulated by a TCS system like 2. In addition, 34 showed good inhibition against MRSA and VRE.
TI  - Effect of solar radiation on survival of indicator bacteria in bathing waters.
AB  - Sunlight exposure is considered to be the most important cause of "natural disinfection" in surface water environments. The UV-B portion of the solar spectrum is the most bactericidal, causing direct (photo-biological) DNA damage. In the present experimental study, the effect of solar radiation on the elimination of bacteria in water, especially in surface water, was studied. The influence of depth and UV-B transmittance of water was determined. Comparing Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis proved to be the most resistant organism. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was shown to be the most sensitive indicator bacterium among the tested microorganisms. Results show a significant correlation between radiation intensity and reduction rates. Best elimination of microorganisms occurs on the water surface; with increasing water depth, there is less UV radiation to inactivate bacteria. High turbidity substantially reduces UV-B transmittance in water causing decreased elimination efficiency. The results of the present study show that sunlight, given an appropriate intensity and good water transparency is suitable to inactivate fecal indicator bacteria within a few hours in surface waters and therefore also in bathing waters.
TI  - Comparison of routine prophylaxis with vancomycin or cefazolin for femoral neck fracture surgery: microbiological and clinical outcomes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of antibiotic prophylaxis on the emergence of vancomycin-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus and the incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) after vancomycin or cefazolin prophylaxis for femoral neck fracture surgery. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: A hospital with a high prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) carriage. PATIENTS: All patients admitted with a femoral neck fracture from March 1, 2004 through February 28, 2005 were prospectively identified and screened for MRSA and vancomycin-resistant (VRE) carriage at admission and at day 7. Deep incisional and organ/space SSIs were also recorded. RESULTS: Of 263 patients included in the study, 152 (58%) received cefazolin and 106 (40%) received vancomycin. At admission, the prevalence of MRSA carriage was 6.8%; it was 12% among patients with risk factors and 2.2% among patients with no risk factors (P=.002). At day 7 after surgery, there were 6 patients (2%) who had hospital-acquired MRSA, corresponding to 0.7% in the cefazolin group and 5% in the vancomycin group (P=.04); none of the MRSA isolates were resistant to glycopeptides. The rate of VRE carriage at admission was 0.4%. Three patients (1%) had acquired carriage of VRE (1 had E. faecium and 2 had E. faecalis); all 3 were in the cefazolin group (2% of patients) and none in the vancomycin group (P=.27). Eight SSIs (3%) occurred, 4% in the cefazolin group and 2% in the vancomycin group (P=.47). CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study demonstrates that cefazolin and vancomycin prophylaxis have similar impacts on the emergence of glycopeptide-resistant pathogens. Neither MRSA infection nor increased rates of SSI with other bacteria were observed in the vancomycin group, suggesting that a larger multicenter study should be initiated.
TI  - In-vitro activity of triclosan-eluting ureteral stents against common bacterial uropathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ureteral stents are commonly used in urology today, but the biofilms that form on them within hours of placement may harbor bacteria that can result in infection or encrustation. Triclosan is an antimicrobial commonly used in consumer and medical products that inhibits bacterial fatty-acid synthesis. The bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect of a triclosan-eluting ureteral stent was tested against clinical isolates of common bacterial uropathogens in an in-vitro setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Triclosan eluted from a drug-loaded ureteral stent was suspended in artificial urine with bacterial pathogens (Escherichia coli C1214, Proteus mirabilis 296, Enterococcus faecalis 1131, Klebsiella pneumoniae 280, Staphylococcus aureus Newman, Pseudomonas aeruginosa AK1) to assess growth, virulence-promoter activity, and bacterial adherence to the stent. Generic stents were utilized as controls. RESULTS: Triclosan inhibited the growth of E. faecalis, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and P. mirabilis in a dose-dependent manner. Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance. Lower concentrations of triclosan downregulated E. coli virulence-factor promoters of outer membrane protein X and p-fimbriae. Triclosan stents had significantly fewer adherent viable bacteria than control stents. CONCLUSIONS: Triclosan-eluting ureteral stents inhibit the growth of common bacterial uropathogens and thus may reduce the incidence of urinary-tract infections and, potentially, encrustation. This drug-eluting stent provides both mechanical drainage of the upper urinary tract and local antibiosis.
TI  - Structure-antimicrobial activity relationship for silanols, a new class of disinfectants, compared with alcohols and phenols.
AB  - Triorganosilanols (R(CH(3))(2)SiOH) were recently reported to exhibit unexpectedly strong disinfectant properties. The antimicrobial activities of silanols were significantly higher than their analogous alcohols. A study of the structural dependence of their antimicrobial activity was conducted against four bacteria, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. Silanols, alcohols with structures analogous to the silanols (R(CH(3))(2)COH) and substituted phenols were evaluated as a single class of materials. The minimum lethal concentrations (MLCs), defined as the concentration required for a 7-log reduction in viable bacteria after 1h exposure, were used to measure antimicrobial activity. Octanol-water partition coefficients (logP) and hydrogen bond acidities (deltanu), measured as the shift in frequency of the OH stretching band between free OH and hydrogen-bonded OH to diethyl ether oxygen by infrared spectroscopy, were utilised as dispersive and polar structural parameters, respectively. The correlation established by multiple regression analysis between antimicrobial activities and structural properties of silanols, alcohols and phenols against the four bacteria treated as a single family produced the following equation, log(1/MLC)=0.679 logP+0.0036deltanu-1.909 (n=282, r=0.96, s=0.22). This equation and the significantly high correlation coefficient supported the hypothesis that the lipophilic properties and the H-bond acidities are primary factors for the antimicrobial action of silanols, alcohols and phenols. The high antimicrobial activity of silanols is explained by their greater H-bond acidity and their enhanced lipophilicity.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and composition of the essential oil of Gontscharovia popovii from Iran.
AB  - The aerial parts of Gontscharovia popovii (B. Fedtsch. and Gontsch.) Boriss. were collected at full flowering stage. The essential oil was isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by a combination of capillary GC and GC-MS. Thirty-one components were identified with the main constituent being carvacrol (71.9%), followed by linalool (5.5%), p-cymene (4.5%) and gamma-terpinene (4.4%). The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of G. popovii was studied against seven Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger). The results of the bioassays showed that the oil exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against all the tested fungi and bacteria except for the resistant bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Antiviral and antimicrobial assessment of some selected flavonoids.
AB  - In the current study, the results of antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activity tests of four flavonoid derivatives, scandenone (1), tiliroside (2), quercetin-3,7-O-alpha-L-dirhamnoside (3), and kaempferol-3,7-O-alpha-L-dirhamnoside (4), are presented. Antibacterial and antifungal activities of these compounds were tested against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterococcus faecalis, as well as the fungus Candida albicans by a micro-dilution method. On the other hand, both DNA virus Herpes simplex (HSV) and RNA virus Parainfluenza-3 (PI-3) were employed for antiviral assessment of the compounds using Madin-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines. According to our data, all of the compounds tested were found to be quite active against S. aureus and E. faecalis with MIC values of 0.5 microg/ml, followed by E. coli (2 microg/ml), K. pneumoniae (4 microg/ml), A. baumannii (8 micro/g/ml), and B. subtilis (8 microg/ml), while they inhibited C. albicans at 1 microg/ml as potent as ketoconazole. However, only compound 3 displayed an antiviral effect towards PI-3 in the range of 8-32 microg/ml of inhibitory concentration for cytopathogenic effect (CPE).
TI  - A new series of glycopeptide antibiotics incorporating a squaric acid moiety. Synthesis, structural and antibacterial studies.
AB  - The aglycones of the antibiotics eremomycin, vancomycin and ristocetin (3, 4 and  6, respectively) were prepared by deglycosidation of the parent antibiotics with hydrogen fluoride, and complete assignation of their 1H, 13C and 15N spectra was performed. The squaric acid amide esters (11-14), were prepared from dimethyl squarate. The corresponding asymmetric diamides (16-19, 22, 23) were also synthesized using 4-phenylbenzylamine and triglycine. The advantage of the method is the high regioselectivity and that no protecting group strategy is required. Electrospray mass spectroscopic method was elaborated for the determination of the site of substitution of the modified antibiotics. The antibacterial activity of the prepared compounds is discussed in detail.
TI  - Appropriateness of empiric gentamicin and vancomycin therapy for bacteremias in chronic dialysis outpatient units in the era of antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Bacteremias in inpatient chronic HD units have been described, but there is little information on bacteremias in ambulatory HD units. To determine the frequency of bacteremia and pathogen distribution in ambulatory chronic HD units, we retrospectively reviewed our experience with 107 bacteremias in 5 chronic ambulatory HD units over a 3 year period. The object of the study was twofold. The first objective was to determine if bacteremias in ambulatory HD setting were substantially different in frequency or type than in the inpatient HD setting. Secondly, febrile patients suspected of having bacteremia in chronic HD patients are often empirically treated with vancomycin and gentamicin. Chronic HD patients require repeated and frequent venous access for HD. Bacteremias are common in chronic HD patients and may be primary or secondary and are often related to venous access site infections. The distributions of bacteremia pathogens in chronic HD patients are predominantly reflective of skin flora, i.e., staphylococci and to lesser extent aerobic Gram-negative bacilli. After S. aureus (MSRA/MSSA) and coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CoNS), enterococci are the next most important Gram-positive pathogens in bacteremic HD patients. Most strains of E. faecalis are sensitive to vancomycin and for practical purposes should be considered as vancomycin sensitive enterococci (VSE). In contrast, most strains of E. faecium are resistant to vancomycin and should be considered as vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE). We retrospectively reviewed 107 patients on chronic ambulatory HD to determine the adequacy of empiric vancomycin and gentamicin prophylaxis. We found amikacin is preferred to gentamicin and that meropenem is an effective alternate substitution for gentamicin and vancomycin combination therapy.
TI  - DNA microarray for detection of antibiotic resistance determinants in Bacillus anthracis and closely related Bacillus cereus.
AB  - We developed a multiplex PCR for amplification of ten genes involved in resistance to ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, rifampin, and vancomycin in Bacillus anthracis and closely related Bacillus cereus. Enzymatic labelling of PCR products followed by hybridization to oligonucleotide probes on a DNA microarray enabled simultaneous detection of resistance genes tetK, tetL, tetM, tetO, vanA, and vanB and resistance-mediating point mutations in genes gyrA, gyrB, parC, and rpoB. The presented assay allows detection of clinically relevant antibiotic resistance determinants within 4h and can be used as a time-saving tool supporting conventional culture-based diagnostics.
TI  - Dual targeting of GyrB and ParE by a novel aminobenzimidazole class of antibacterial compounds.
AB  - A structure-guided drug design approach was used to optimize a novel series of aminobenzimidazoles that inhibit the essential ATPase activities of bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV and that show potent activities against a variety of bacterial pathogens. Two such compounds, VRT-125853 and VRT-752586, were characterized for their target specificities and preferences in bacteria. In metabolite incorporation assays, VRT-125853 inhibited both DNA and RNA synthesis but had little effect on protein synthesis. Both compounds inhibited the maintenance of negative supercoils in plasmid DNA in Escherichia coli at the MIC. Sequencing of DNA corresponding to the GyrB and ParE ATP-binding regions in VRT-125853- and VRT-752586-resistant mutants revealed that their primary target in Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae was GyrB, whereas in Streptococcus pneumoniae it was ParE. In Enterococcus faecalis, the primary target of VRT-125853 was ParE, whereas for VRT-752586 it was GyrB. DNA transformation experiments with H. influenzae and S. aureus proved that the mutations observed in gyrB resulted in decreased susceptibilities to both compounds. Novobiocin resistance-conferring mutations in S. aureus, H. influenzae, and S. pneumoniae were found in gyrB, and these mutants showed little or no cross-resistance to VRT-125853 or VRT-752586 and vice versa. Furthermore, gyrB and parE double mutations increased the MICs of VRT-125853 and VRT-752586 significantly, providing evidence of dual targeting. Spontaneous frequencies of resistance to VRT-752586 were below detectable levels (<5.2x10(-10)) for wild-type E. faecalis but were significantly elevated for strains containing single and double target-based mutations, demonstrating that dual targeting confers low levels of resistance emergence and the maintenance of susceptibility in vitro.
TI  - Monotherapy versus combination therapy.
AB  - The science of antibiotic therapy for infectious diseases continues to evolve. In many instances where empiric coverage is necessary, treatment with more than one agent is considered prudent. If an etiology is identified, antibiotics are modified based on culture and susceptibility data. Even when the organism is known, more than one antibiotic may be needed. Decisions about antibiotics should be made after assessments of pertinent clinical information, laboratory and microbiology information, ease of administration, patient compliance, potential adverse effects, cost, and available evidence supporting various treatment options. Clinicians also need to consider synergy and local resistance patterns in selecting therapeutic options. In this article, the authors outline monotherapy and combination therapy options for several common infectious diseases.
TI  - Antimicrobial therapy of multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance among pneumococci, enterococci, and staphylococci has become increasingly important in recent decades. Clinicians should be familiar with the nuances of antibiotic susceptibility testing and interpretation in selecting antibiotics for these infections. The clinical significance of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, macrolide-resistant S pneumoniae, and multidrug-resistant S pneumoniae is discussed. The clinical spectrum and therapeutic approach to Enterococcus faecalis (i.e., vancomycin-sensitive enterococci) and E faecium (i.e., vancomycin-resistant enterococci) are discussed. Differences in therapeutic approach between methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) infections are reviewed. Differences between in vitro susceptibility testing and in vivo effectiveness of antibiotics for hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) are described. Finally, the clinical features of infection and therapy of HA-MRSA and community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) infections are compared.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2004). III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - The bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from patients diagnosed as urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 14 institutions in Japan were collected between August 2004 and July 2005. The susceptibilities of these bacteria to various antimicrobial agents were measured. The bacteria were divided into 2 groups consisting of uncomplicated UTIs and complicated UTIs (with and without indwelling catheter) based on their isolation origins. The results were compared with those obtained between 1995 and 2003. The drug sensitivity of S. aureus in this year was similar to those in up to the previous year and S. aureus showed the best susceptibility to vancomycin (VCM) and arbekacin (ABK). The drug sensitivity of E. faecalis in this year also was similar to those in up to the previous year. The susceptibility of E. coli to cephems in this year was generally good and was similar to those in up to the previous year. MIC90 of cefozopran (CZOP) was the most stable and 0.125 microg/mL or less since 1995. The susceptibility of E. coli to cefpirome (CPR) and cefotiam (CTM) also was good but to cefaclor (CCL), cefixime (CFIX), and cefpodoxime (CPDX) was largely decreased in complicated UTI groups. The sensitivity of E. coli to carbapenems also was good but to carumonam (CRMN) tended to decrease. The susceptibility of E. coli to quinolones, however, has largely changed and has decreased since 2003 in uncomplicated UTIs and 2000 in complicated UTIs. That was suggested the development of the resistance to the drug. The susceptibility of Klebsiella spp. to cefazolin (CEZ), CTM, CCL, CPDX, and cefditoren (CDTR) decreased in the previous year and recovered to the year before the previous year in this year. The susceptibility of Klebsiella spp. to other cephems was stable since 1995, especially against CZOP, the highest sensitivity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL) was maintained. The susceptibility of Klebsiella spp. to carbapenems and CRMN also was good. The susceptibility of Klebsiella spp. to aminoglycosides was lower than to CZOP but was stable since 1995. The susceptibility of P. aeruginosa was generally low and has largely changed against the majority of the agents since 1995. The susceptibility of P. aeruginosa isolated from uncomplicated UTIs has largely changed against ceftazidime (CAZ), cefsulodin (CFS), CZOP, imipenem (IPM), meropenem (MEPM), aztreonam (AZT), CRMN, gentamicin (GM), and tobramycin (TOB). The susceptibility of P. aeruginosa isolated from complicated UTIs has largely changed against CSF, CZOP, MEPM, GM, and ciprofloxacin (CPFX). The susceptibility of P. aeruginosa isolated from complicated UTIs has been stable against amikacin (AMK). For annual changes in MIC50, TOB and IPM had a relatively stable and high activity (MIC50: 0.5-2 microg/mL).
TI  - Topical ethyl chloride fine spray. Does it have any antimicrobial activity?
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to assess whether ethyl chloride fine spray (Cryogesic) has antimicrobial activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Blood agar plates supplemented with 5% horse blood were inoculated with five different organisms, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis. The plates were assessed for growth inhibition at 24 and 48 h by the microbiologist and compared with the non-sprayed control plates. RESULTS: The model showed a highly significant (p<0.0001) reduction in bacterial count for the plates treated with fine ethyl chloride spray. The estimate of the percentage of bacteria remaining after spraying with ethyl chloride was 42.7%, with a 95% confidence interval of 35.9-50.9%. There was no evidence that the effect of ethyl chloride fine spray was different for the different organisms (p=0.49). CONCLUSION: The use of ethyl chloride shows bacterial count reduction but the clinical implication of this needs to be determined. The authors postulate that any statistically significant reduction can only be helpful in reducing the infection rates. This coupled with the already proven local anaesthetic effects of ethyl chloride will make it an important tool for procedures like arthrocentesis and venepunctures.
TI  - [Regulation of nitrogen metabolism in gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - We searched for new members of the TnrA and GlnR regulons controlling assimilation of nitrogen in gram-positive bacteria. We identified the regulatory signals for these transcription factors with consensuses ATGTNAWWWWWWWTNACAT for GlnR and TGTNAWWWWWWWTNACA for TnrA. We described the structure and found new potential members for the TnrA/GlnR regulons in Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, Geobacillus kaustophilus, Oceanobacillus iheyensis, for the TnrA regulon in B. halodurans and for the GlnR regulons in Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. mutans, S. agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and St. epidermidis.
TI  - Experimental evaluation of an automated endoscope reprocessor with in situ generation of peracetic acid for disinfection of semicritical devices.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a high-level disinfection solution generated inside an endoscope processing system for decontaminating external and internal surfaces of experimentally contaminated heat-sensitive medical devices. METHODS: The American Society for Testing and Materials Simulated-Use Test protocol (E1837-02), which incorporates a soil load in each inoculum, was used to evaluate the efficacy of the system when processing 4 common types of endoscopes contaminated separately with 5 types of nosocomial pathogens: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 15442), spores of Clostridium difficile (ATCC 9689), a glutaraldehyde-resistant strain of Mycobacterium chelonae, a vancomycin-resistant strain of Enterococcus faecalis, and a methicillin-resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus. Rinse solution samples from channels and from surfaces of the processed endoscopes were tested for any microbicidal residues. RESULTS: For all organisms tested, the baseline level of contamination of the endoscopes ranged from 5 log(10) to greater than 7 log(10) at each external surface site and internal channel. All tests showed reductions in viability of the test organisms to undetectable levels. All rinse solution samples from external and internal sites of the endoscopes proved to be free of any residual microbicidal activity. CONCLUSIONS: The endoscope reprocessor, with its processor-generated high-level disinfection solution, successfully reduced the numbers of selected, clinically relevant pathogens to undetectable levels both in the channels and on the outside surfaces of the 4 representative endoscopes tested in this study.
TI  - High-level vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates associated with a  polymicrobial biofilm.
AB  - Glycopeptides such as vancomycin are the treatment of choice for infections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. This study describes the identification of high-level vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) isolates in a polymicrobial biofilm within an indwelling nephrostomy tube in a patient in New York. S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Micrococcus species, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated from the biofilm. For VRSA isolates, vancomycin MICs ranged from 32 to >128 microg/ml. VRSA isolates were also resistant to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, penicillin, and tetracycline but remained susceptible to chloramphenicol, linezolid, rifampin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The vanA gene was localized to a plasmid of approximately 100 kb in VRSA and E. faecium isolates from the biofilm. Plasmid analysis revealed that the VRSA isolate acquired the 100-kb E. faecium plasmid, which was then maintained without integration into the MRSA plasmid. The tetracycline resistance genes tet(U) and tet(S), not previously detected in S. aureus isolates, were identified in the VRSA isolates. Additional resistance elements in the VRSA isolate included a multiresistance gene cluster, ermB-aadE-sat4-aphA-3, msrA (macrolide efflux), and the bifunctional aminoglycoside resistance gene aac(6')-aph(2")-Ia. Multiple combinations of resistance genes among the various isolates of staphylococci and enterococci, including vanA, tet(S), and tet(U), illustrate the dynamic nature of gene acquisition and loss within and between bacterial species throughout the course of infection. The potential for interspecies transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes, including resistance to vancomycin, may be enhanced by the microenvironment of a biofilm.
TI  - Sensitive quantitative detection of commensal bacteria by rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-PCR.
AB  - A sensitive rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) method was developed for exact and sensitive enumeration of subdominant bacterial populations. Using group- or species-specific primers for 16S or 23S rRNA, analytical curves were constructed for Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the threshold cycle value was found to be linear up to an RNA amount of 10(-3) cell per RT-PCR. The number of bacteria in culture was determined by RT-qPCR, and the results correlated well with the CFU count over the range from 10(0) to 10(5) CFU. The bacterial counts obtained by RT-qPCR were the same as the CFU counts irrespective of the growth phase in vitro, except for C. perfringens during starvation periods; the viable cell counts obtained by using a combination of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining and SYTO9-propidium iodide double staining were in good agreement with the RT-qPCR counts rather than with the CFU counts. The RT-qPCR method could detect endogenous Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa in feces of hospitalized patients (n = 38) at a level of 10(3) cells per g of feces, and for enumeration of S. aureus or P. aeruginosa spiked into human peripheral blood, the lower detection limit for RT-qPCR quantification of the bacteria was 2 cells per ml of blood, suggesting that this method was equivalent to the conventional culture method. As only 5 h was needed for RT-qPCR quantification, we suggest that rRNA-targeted RT-qPCR assays provide a sensitive and convenient system for quantification of commensal bacteria and for examining their possible invasion of a host.
TI  - Biofilm-associated proteins.
AB  - Although exopolysaccharides are important and often essential compounds of the biofilm matrix, recent evidences suggest that a group of surface proteins plays a leading role during the development of the microbial communities. The first member of this group of proteins was described in a Staphylococcus aureus bovine mastitis isolate and was named Bap, for biofilm-associated protein. Later on, other surface proteins homologous to Bap and involved in biofilm development have been described in many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. In this review, we have summarized our knowledge about three members of this group of proteins: Bap of S. aureus, Esp of Enterococcus faecalis and BapA of Salmonella enterica ser. Enteritidis.
TI  - High prevalence of ceftazidime-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and increase of imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. in Korea: a KONSAR program in 2004.
AB  - A nationwide antimicrobial resistance surveillance has been conducted since 1997  in Korea. In this study, susceptibility test data generated in 2004 by KONSAR group hospitals were analyzed and compared to those at a commercial laboratory. In hospitals, the rank orders of organisms in 2004 were identical to those in 2003. The most prevalent species was Staphylococcus aureus (20.2%) in hospitals, but Escherichia coli (29.7%) in the commercial laboratory. The proportions of Enterococcus faecium to all isolates of Enterococcus faecalis plus E. faecium were 47.2% in hospitals and 24.9% in the commercial laboratory. The mean resistance rates of significant antimicrobial-organism combinations in hospitals were: oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (68%), oxacillin-resistant (penicillin- nonsusceptible) Streptococcus pneumoniae (68%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (25%), cefotaxime-resistant E. coli (14%), ceftazidime- and cefoxitin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (34% and 32%, respectively), and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17% and 24%, respectively). In conclusion, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant K. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa were prevalent in 2004. Increasing trends were observed for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, cefoxitin- resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa. Certain antimicrobial- organism combinations were also prevalent among the commercial laboratory-tested strains.
TI  - Postantibiotic effect of ceftobiprole against 12 Gram-positive organisms.
AB  - The in vitro postantibiotic effects (PAEs), postantibiotic sub-MIC effects (PA-SMEs), and sub-MIC effects of ceftobiprole were determined for 12 gram-positive organisms. Pneumococcal, staphylococcal, and enterococcal PAEs were 1.4 to 3.1 h, 0 to 1.8 h, and 0 to 0.9 h, respectively. The PA-SMEs (0.4 times the MIC) for pneumococci, staphylococci, and enterococci were 4.8 to >10.3 h, 1.5 to 9.6 h, and 3.8 to >10.7 h, respectively.
TI  - Serum bactericidal activities of high-dose daptomycin with and without coadministration of gentamicin against isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus species.
AB  - The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal titers (SBTs) of daptomycin alone and in combination with gentamicin against strains of Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci to determine if there might be any benefit to the addition of the aminoglycoside. A multiple-dose, randomized crossover study was performed in 11 healthy volunteers to evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetic profile of 6 mg/kg of body weight daptomycin once daily with or without 1 mg/kg gentamicin every 8 h. SBTs were determined against clinical isolates of nosocomial (MRSA 494) and community-acquired (CA-MRSA 44) methicillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (VSEF 49452), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF 80), and quality control strains of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (ATCC 29213) and vancomycin-susceptible E. faecalis (ATCC 29212). Enhancement of bactericidal activity was evaluated by calculating and comparing the areas under the bactericidal curve (AUBC) for each dosing regimen against each isolate. The area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h and clearance for daptomycin alone were 645 +/- 91 microg.h/ml and 9.47 +/- 1.4 mg/h/kg, respectively, compared with 642 +/- 69 microg.h/ml and 9.45 +/- 1.0 mg/h/kg for daptomycin plus gentamicin. Daptomycin alone displayed sustained bactericidal activity against five of the six isolates over the entire 24-h dosing interval; bactericidal activity was maintained for 8 h against VREF 80. Mean AUBCs for daptomycin alone ranged from 935 to 1,263 and 36 to 238 against staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates, respectively, compared with 902 to 972 and 34 to 213 against staphylococci and enterococci when coadministered with gentamicin. The results of this study suggest that the addition of gentamicin does not alter the pharmacokinetic profile or enhance the bactericidal activity of daptomycin against staphylococcal or enterococcal isolates.
TI  - Evaluation of inhibition and cross-reaction effects on real-time PCR applied to the total DNA of wastewater samples for the quantification of bacterial antibiotic resistance genes and taxon-specific targets.
AB  - In order to evaluate the applicability of six primer and probe sets for TaqMan real-time RCR on DNA of wastewater samples, effects of the sample matrix and DNA background on target quantification were studied with respect to differences between functional genes and taxonomically used rDNA targets. Primer/probe assays for real-time PCR (TaqMan) designed to quantitatively detect the antibiotic resistance genes bla(VIM), vanA, ampC, mecA, and taxon-specific 23S rDNA sequences for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecium/faecalis were tested for their sensitivity and amplification robustness. The amplification of their gene targets in DNA extracts of wastewater ("wastewater DNA") and reference strains ("reference DNA") was compared with their amplification in "model DNA" which was composed of wastewater DNA and reference DNA. Target detection was quantifiable along up to seven decimal orders of magnitude. For the detection of the resistance genes bla(VIM), vanA, ampC, and mecA as well as the enterococci directed PCR only weak or no inhibition due to the impurities or wastewater DNA matrix were demonstrated for the applied target concentrations. The taxonomically applied detection system for the quantification of P. aeruginosa showed a limited performance. For the analysis of the amplification dynamics of possibly similar nucleotide sequences of organisms related to P. aeruginosa a SYBR Green assay was employed. Competitive amplification of similar sequences was identified to be a major mechanism of reduced sensitivity. Hence, the primers were modified for an optimised detection. With the resulting reduction of cross reactions an increased sensitivity was achieved for the detection and quantification of P. aeruginosa in wastewater DNA.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial and antifungal effects of iodoform-integrating gutta-percha.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The antibacterial and antifungal effects of medicated gutta-percha (MGP) over different time periods have not been evaluated. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial and antifungal effectiveness of MGP and regular gutta-percha cones over different time periods using the disk diffusion method. METHODS: Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were spread onto Mueller-Hinton agar, and Candida albicans was spread onto Sabouraud agar supplemented with glucose. Same-size MGP cones, conventional gutta-percha cones and disks impregnated with povidone-iodine were placed on the inoculated plates. The dishes were incubated at 37 degrees C aerobically. Growth inhibition zones were inspected and measured at 24, 48 and 72 hours. For each strain, experiments were performed in triplicate. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare k independent samples. RESULTS: The disks impregnated with povidone-iodine inhibited all bacterial strains for up to 72 hours. No inhibition zones were seen around regular gutta-percha cones. MGP inhibited the growth of all bacteria over 24 hours, but in some cases these effects did not continue over longer periods. Specifically, the antimicrobial properties of MGP cones against E. coli and P. aeruginosa disappeared by 48 and 72 hours. Regardless of time and bacterial strain, MGP was statistically more effective than regular gutta-percha (p < 0.05). Povidone-iodine and MGP were effective against C. albicans for up to 72 hours, but regular gutta-percha exhibited no antifungal activity. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial and antifungal characteristics of MGP may offer additional advantages over conventional gutta-percha.
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin against clinical isolates with reduced susceptibilities to linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin.
AB  - An initiative was taken to determine the in vitro activity of daptomycin against  85 Gram-positive isolates with reduced susceptibilities to linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin. Daptomycin had potent activity against all strains, with a Staphylococcus spp. minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) < or =2 microg/mL and an Enterococcus spp. MIC < or =8 microg/mL. Resistance to linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin appears to be independent of reduced susceptibility to daptomycin.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  - Treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. Treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. Ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. It is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. The aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. Gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella ozaenae, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers and non-producers). Gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic Bacteroides fragilis. Ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs). Killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. Ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the first few hours of the kinetic curves against E. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (CFU) reduction in the first 2h), B. fragilis (4 log(10) CFU reduction in 4h), MSSA (3 log(10) CFU reduction in 4-6h), K. ozaenae (ESBL+), K. pneumoniae (ESBL+ and -), E. cloacae (ESBL-) in 1h and P. mirabilis (ESBL+) in the first 2h. The potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of E. coli-B. fragilis and E. coli-B. fragilis-E. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of S. aureus-P. mirabilis. These results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some ethnomedicinal plants used by Paliyar tribe from Tamil Nadu, India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial activity of 18 ethnomedicinal plant extracts were evaluated against nine bacterial strains (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Ervinia sp, Proteus vulgaris) and one fungal strain (Candida albicans). The collected ethnomedicinal plants were used in folk medicine in the treatment of skin diseases, venereal diseases, respiratory problems and nervous disorders. METHODS: Plants were collected from Palni hills of Southern Western Ghats and the ethnobotanical data were gathered from traditional healers who inhabit the study area. The hexane and methanol extracts were obtained by cold percolation method and the antimicrobial activity was found using paper disc diffusion method. All microorganisms were obtained from Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India. RESULTS: The results indicated that out of 18 plants, 10 plants exhibited antimicrobial activity against one or more of the tested microorganisms at three different concentrations of 1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg/disc. Among the plants tested, Acalypha fruticosa, Peltophorum pterocarpum, Toddalia asiatica,Cassia auriculata, Punica granatum and Syzygium lineare were most active. The highest antifungal activity was exhibited by methanol extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum and Punica granatum against Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: This study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of the some ethnomedicinal plants used in folkloric medicine. Compared to hexane extract, methanol extract showed significant activity against tested organisms. This study also showed that Toddalia asiatica, Syzygium lineare, Acalypha fruticosa and Peltophorum pterocarpum could be potential sources of new antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Comparative stability and growth requirements of S. aureus and faecal indicator bacteria in seawater.
AB  - The fate (stability, multiplication) of S. aureus, E. coli and E. faecalis was determined in three classes of recreational waters (seawater, estuarine, stream) supplemented with nutrients in the form of sewage and peptone. In the absence of sunlight (24 +/- 2 degrees C), all bacteria in all water samples did not multiply and were slowly (days) inactivated. When 50% sewage was added to all water samples, E. coli and E. faecalis multiplied but S. aureus did not. When peptone (0.05%, 0.5%) was the added nutrient, the three bacteria multiplied. In the presence of sunlight (15-27 degrees C), S. aureus was inactivated rapidly (hours) in all water samples. These results show that when their nutritional requirements are met, S. aureus, E. coli and E. faecalis can multiply in the high salinity conditions of seawater. However, under environmental conditions, sunlight is an effective natural bactericidal agent.
TI  - [Towards new antibacterial drugs. Interest of para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene].
AB  - We present here the results concerning the antibacterial properties evaluation of para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene, compared with its constitutive monomer, the para-guanidinoethylphenol, and hexamidine (Hexomedine), an antiseptic from the diamidine family widely used in therapeutic, chosen as a reference in this study for its resemblance in terms of functional groups. Antibacterial activities of those three compounds were evaluated by microdilution methods, in Mueller Hinton broth, onto 5 bacterial strains: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 & ATCC 29213 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, according to CA-SFM and CLSI (formerly NCCLS) approved standards. In parallel, the effects of these three compounds on MRC-5 eukaryotic cell viability were evaluated with MTT assay. The results obtained here confirm a lack of activity for the monomer compound (MIC> or =512 mg/l) and a real antibacterial activity for the calixarene, comparable to hexamidine. This activity is expressed, both on Gram+and Gram- bacteria (MIC=4 mg/l for E. coli, 8 mg/l on both S. aureus strains) and at a lesser degree on E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa (MIC=32 mg/l). Similarly, both compounds, monomer and calixarene, slightly induce any modification on MRC-5 cells viability, and this until 168 h of treatment for concentrations reaching 10(-4) mol/L while hexamidine demonstrates a significant and increasing effect during the time of experiment and this for 100 to 1000 times lower concentrations. Thus, this study tends to confirm the significance of the organization of the para-guanidinoethylphenol monomer into its cyclic calixarenic tetramer for the gain of an antibacterial activity, similar to a widely used antiseptic one.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine against  selected single-species biofilms.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the antimicrobial activity of 2.5% and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite and 2.0% chlorhexidine gel and liquid as endodontic-irrigating substances against selected single-species biofilms. METHODS: Single-species biofilms of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum were generated on a cellulose nitrate membrane placed on agar medium. The biofilms were then immersed in the endodontic-irrigating substances for 30 s and also for 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 min, with and without mechanical agitation. Sterile saline was used as control. After each time period, the membrane filters were then transferred to tubes containing 2 mL of fresh broth medium plus neutralizers (in order to prevent the residual action of the tested substances). The micro-organisms were suspended using a vortex, and the inoculum was serially diluted 10-fold. Aliquots of the dilutions were plated on 5% sheep blood agar medium, and incubated under adequate gaseous conditions. Colony-forming units were calculated. The samples were compared using the Friedman and Tukey test, when necessary, at a significance level of P < 0.05. RESULTS: Mechanical agitation promoted the effectiveness of the antimicrobial agents, resulting in less time to eliminate the same micro-organisms, except for S. aureus with 2.5% NaOCl. Antimicrobial agents in liquid presentation, especially 5.25% NaOCl and 2% chlorhexidine, killed the tested micro-organisms more rapidly. Saline did not inhibit the growth of any of the tested micro-organisms, with or without agitation, being statistically different (P < 0.05) from NaOCl and chlorhexidine. P. intermedia, P. gingivalis, P. endodontalis and F. nucleatum were eliminated in 30 s by all antimicrobial agents, with our without agitation, in contrast with the facultative and aerobe strains. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical agitation improved the antimicrobial properties of the chemical substances tested using a biofilm model, favouring the agents in liquid presentation, especially 5.25% NaOCl and 2% chlorhexidine.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among pathogens collected from hospitalized patients in the United States and in vitro activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antimicrobial.
AB  - The activities of tigecycline and comparators against isolates collected from 76  U.S. centers between January 2004 and September 2005 were assessed. Tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or =2 microg/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae.
TI  - Topoisomerase mutations and efflux are associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - To understand better the mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance in Enterococcus faecalis, fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants isolated from Ent. faecalis ATCC 29212 by stepwise selection with sparfloxacin (SPX) and norfloxacin (NOR) were analysed. The results showed the following. (i) In general, fluoroquinolone-resistance mechanisms in Ent. faecalis are similar to those in other Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, namely, mutants with amino acid changes in both GyrA and ParC exhibited high fluoroquinolone resistance, and single GyrA mutants and a single ParC mutant were more resistant to SPX and NOR, respectively, than the parent strain, indicating that the primary targets of SPX and NOR in Ent. faecalis are DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, respectively. (ii) Alterations in GyrB (DeltaKGA, residues 395-397) and ParE (Glu-459 to Lys) were associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in some mutants. Moreover, the facts that the NOR MIC, but not the SPX MIC, decreased in the presence of multidrug efflux pump inhibitors, that NOR accumulation decreased in the cells, and that the EmeA mRNA expression level did not change, strongly suggested that a NorA-like efflux pump, rather than EmeA, was involved in resistance to NOR.
TI  - Pyrazolidine-3,5-diones and 5-hydroxy-1H-pyrazol-3(2H)-ones, inhibitors of UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvyl glucosamine reductase.
AB  - A series of pyrazolidine-3,5-dione and 5-hydroxy-1H-pyrazol-3(2H)-one inhibitors  of Escherichia coli UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvyl glucosamine reductase (MurB) has been prepared. The 5-hydroxy-1H-pyrazol-3(2H)-ones show low micromolar IC(50) values versus E. coli MurB and submicromolar minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against Staphylococcus aureus GC 1131, Enterococcus faecalis GC 2242, Streptococcus pneumoniae GC 1894, and E. coli GC 4560 imp, a strain with increased outer membrane permeability. None of these compounds show antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans, a marker of eukaryotic toxicity. Moreover, these compounds inhibit peptidoglycan biosynthesis, as assessed by measuring the amount of soluble peptidoglycan produced by Streptococcus epidermidis upon incubation with compounds. A partial least squares projection to latent structures analysis shows that improving MurB potency and MIC values correlate with increasing lipophilicity of the C-4 substituent of the 5-hydroxy-1H-pyrazol-3(2H)-one core. Docking studies using FLO and PharmDock produced several binding orientations for these molecules in the MurB active site.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide combined with chlorhexidine gel used as intracanal medicament.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) combined with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) gel against endodontic pathogens and to compare the results with the ones achieved by Ca(OH)2 mixed with sterile water and by CHX gel alone. Two methods were used: the agar diffusion test and the direct contact test. Ca(OH)2 + 2% CHX gel produced inhibitory zones ranging from 2.84 to 6.5 mm, and required from 30 seconds to 6 hours to eliminate all tested microorganisms. However, 2% CHX gel showed the largest microbial growth zones from 4.33 to 21.67 mm, and required 1 minute or less to inhibit all tested microorganisms. A paste of Ca(OH)2 plus sterile water inhibited only the microorganisms with which it was in direct contact and required from 30 seconds to 24 hours to kill all tested microorganisms. In conclusion, 2% CHX gel + Ca(OH)2 showed better antimicrobial activity than Ca(OH)2 manipulated with sterile water.
TI  - Evaluation of the hygienic quality and associated public health hazards of raw milk marketed by smallholder dairy producers in the Dar es Salaam region, Tanzania.
AB  - A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine three parameters of the quality of the raw milk marketed by milk selling points (MSPs) in Dar es Salaam region. Total bacterial count (TBC) was used as an indicator of the microbial quality of the milk; antimicrobial residues were determined; and the California mastitis test (CMT) was used to screen for milk somatic cells as an indication of the mastitis level in the cows that provided the milk. Moreover, a water sample at each MSP was taken for bacteriological culturing. Finally, a questionnaire survey was conducted with the milk sellers at the MSPs to identify risk factors for poor milk hygiene. A total of 128 milk samples and corresponding water samples were collected from randomly selected milk selling points in Dar es Salaam region. The mean TBC was (8.2 +/- 1.9) x 10(6) cfu/ml, and major bacterial isolates from the milk samples were Escherichia coli (6.3%), Bacillus cereus (6.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (6.3%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (6.3%), Enterobacter aerogenes (5.6%) and Enterococcus faecalis (4.7%). In most cases, the organisms identified in milk corresponded to those isolated from the corresponding water samples. Of milk samples, 79.0% were positive to the CMT and 7.0% were positive for antimicrobial residues. TBC was normalized by log-transformation, and the possible predictors of TBC were identified by fitting two linear regression models. In a random effect model, water microbial quality, frequency of cleaning the milk containers, frequency of milk supply, milk storage time and the type of containers, and mixing of fresh and previous milk were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with the mean log TBC. In a fixed effect model, in addition to these indicators, water shortage, water source and the refrigerator condition were significantly (p < or = 0.01) associated with log TBC. It was concluded that the milk sold in Dar es Salaam region is of poor quality and is of public health significance.
TI  - Multiple bacterial species reside in chronic wounds: a longitudinal study.
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the bacterial profile of chronic venous leg ulcers and the importance of the profile to ulcer development. Patients with persisting venous leg ulcers were included and followed for 8 weeks. Every second week, ulcer samples were collected and the bacterial species present were identified. More than one bacterial species were detected in all the ulcers. The most common bacteria found were Staphylococcus aureus (found in 93.5% of the ulcers), Enterococcus faecalis (71.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (52.2%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (45.7%), Proteus species (41.3%) and anaerobic bacteria (39.1%). Resident bacterial species were present in all the ulcers. In 76% of the ulcers, two or more (up to five) resident bacterial species were found. The most common resident bacterial species were S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, ulcers with P. aeruginosa were found to be significantly larger than ulcers without the presence of P. aeruginosa (P < 0.005). Our study demonstrated that the chronic wound is colonised by multiple bacterial species and that once they are established many of them persist in the wound. Our results suggest that the presence of P. aeruginosa in venous leg ulcers can induce ulcer enlargement and/or cause delayed healing.
TI  - FT-IR microspectroscopy for early identification of some clinically relevant pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the potentials and limitations of Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy as a tool to identify, at the level of microcolonies, pathogenic bacteria frequently isolated in the clinical environment. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1570 FT-IR spectra from 164 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients were recorded from 6 to 10-h old microcolonies of 50-150 microm size. A classification of 100% was obtained for the most frequent gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium at the species level. An average accuracy of about 80% was reached with Gram negative bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonaceae families; Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella spp., and Citrobacter koseri; and Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Results were comparable with FT-IR measurements on dried suspensions from 18-h cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of young microcolonies is feasible with FT-IR microscopy with a very high accuracy for gram-positive bacteria. Some improvement in the transfer of microcolonies is necessary to increase the accuracy for gram-negative bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Combination of FT-IR microscopy and multivariate data analysis could be a complementary, rapid, and reliable tool for screening and discriminating, at species and subspecies level, micro-organisms of clinical, food-borne, or environmental origins.
TI  - Adverse effects of increased intra-abdominal pressure on small bowel structure and bacterial translocation in the rat.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) on intestinal structures and bacterial translocation in the rat. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three experimental groups of 14 rats each: the sham group underwent insertion of a balloon-tipped catheter; the IAP-15 group was subjected to a 15 mm Hg pneumoperitoneum for 60 minutes; and the IAP-25 group was subjected to a 25 mm Hg pneumoperitoneum for 60 minutes. Intestinal structural changes (bowel circumference, overall bowel and mucosal weight, mucosal DNA and protein, villus height, and crypt depth) and bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, portal blood, and peripheral blood were determined 24 hours following pneumoperitoneum. RESULTS: IAP-15 and IAP-25 rats demonstrated a significant decrease in: bowel and mucosal weight in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum; mucosal DNA and protein in the jejunum and ileum; villus height in the jejunum: and crypt depth in the jejunum and ileum compared to the sham rats. Bacterial translocation was demonstrated in 60% of IAP-15 rats and in 80% of IAP-25 rats. CONCLUSION: Elevated IAP results in mucosal injury of the gut, causing mucosal hypoplasia, and increases bacterial translocation.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in the southeastern Mediterranean--preliminary results from the ARMed project.
AB  - Sporadic reports from centres in the south and east of the Mediterranean have suggested that the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in this region appears to be considerable, yet pan-regional studies using comparable methodology have been lacking in the past. Susceptibility test results from invasive isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium and faecalis routinely recovered from clinical samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid within participating laboratories situated in Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Tunisia and Turkey were collected as part of the ARMed project. Preliminary data from the first two years of the project showed the prevalence of penicillin non-susceptibility in S. pneumoniae to range from 0% (Malta) to 36% (Algeria) [median: 29%] whilst methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus varied from 10% in Lebanon to 65% in Jordan [median: 43%]. Significant country specific resistance in E. coli was also seen, with 72% of isolates from Egyptian hospitals reported to be resistant to third generation cephalosporins and 40% non-susceptible to fluoroquinolones in Turkey. Vancomycin non-susceptibility was only reported in 0.9% of E. faecalis isolates from Turkey and in 3.8% of E. faecium isolates from Cyprus. The preliminary results from the ARMed project appear to support previous sporadic reports suggesting high antibiotic resistance in the Mediterranean region. They suggest that this is particularly the case in the eastern Mediterranean region where resistance in S. aureus and E. coli seems to be higher than that reported in the other countries of the Mediterranean.
TI  - C-terminal WxL domain mediates cell wall binding in Enterococcus faecalis and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Analysis of the genome sequence of Enterococcus faecalis clinical isolate V583 revealed novel genes encoding surface proteins. Twenty-seven of these proteins, annotated as having unknown functions, possess a putative N-terminal signal peptide and a conserved C-terminal region characterized by a novel conserved domain designated WxL. Proteins having similar characteristics were also detected in other low-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria. We hypothesized that the WxL region might be a determinant of bacterial cell location. This hypothesis was tested by generating protein fusions between the C-terminal regions of two WxL proteins in E. faecalis and a nuclease reporter protein. We demonstrated that the C-terminal regions of both proteins conferred a cell surface localization to the reporter fusions in E. faecalis. This localization was eliminated by introducing specific deletions into the domains. Interestingly, exogenously added protein fusions displayed binding to whole cells of various gram-positive bacteria. We also showed that the peptidoglycan was a binding ligand for WxL domain attachment to the cell surface and that neither proteins nor carbohydrates were necessary for binding. Based on our findings, we propose that the WxL region is a novel cell wall binding domain in E. faecalis and other gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of some unsymmetrical diorganyltellurium(IV) dichlorides.
AB  - Six unsymmetrical diorganyltellurium(IV) dichlorides RR'TeCl2 (where R= phenacyl-, 1-naphthacyl-, and styrylacyl- and R' = p-methoxyphenyl, p-hydroxyphenyl-, and 3-methyl-4-hydoxyphenyl-) were tested for their antibacterial activity against gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Salmonella sp.) bacteria. Antibacterial activity was measured by disk diffusion method. Inhibition zones demonstrated that all the compounds showed good activity against gram-negative strains. Phenacyl (3-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl) tellurium(IV) dichloride and naphthacyl (3-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl) tellurium(IV) dichloride showed significant activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative strains. Among the tested compounds, the former exhibited maximum activity against gram-positive bacteria, while the latter against all the bacteria under study and styrylacyl (p-methoxyphenyl) tellurium(IV) dichloride against all the three gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of crude methanolic extract and its fractions of aerial parts of Anthemis tinctoria.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of the methanolic extract and its fractions of aerial  parts of Aniheinis tinctoria (Asteraceae) was investigated against representative gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) and gram-negative strains Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853). The activity was concentrated mainly in the dichloromethane (DCM) and hexane fractions of crude methanolic extract. The 5 mg of DCM extract per disk produced 15-16 mm of inhibition zone against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, however, no activity was found against E. faecalis and E. coli. The hexane fraction showed activity against S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis. As DCM fraction showed the highest antibacterial activity in the disk diffusion assay, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values of only this fraction was determined against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. These values were found to be in the range of 1.25 to 10 mg/ml.
TI  - Disinfection of root canals using Er:YAG laser at different frequencies.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated, in vitro, the degree of disinfection of the Er:YAG laser in root canals contaminated with Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans, for 28 days. METHODS: Forty-six single-rooted human teeth were divided into five groups of eight teeth each; three teeth were used as negative controls and three as positive controls. After contamination, the root canals were prepared mechanically. Three groups were irradiated with Er:YAG laser at 100 mJ, varying the frequency (7, 10, and 16 Hz). Two groups were irrigated with 1.0% and 2.5% NaOCl solution. After treatment, two sterilized paper cones were placed in the root canals for 5 min. One cone was transferred to 2.0 mL of Letheen broth culture medium, incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h, and then 0.1 mL of that solution was placed in 2.0 mL of brain heart infusion for 48 h to determine microbial growth. The other cone was transferred to a test pipette with peptone and water for serial dilution and spread in Mueller Hinton medium. After 24 h of incubation, the colony-forming units (CFUs) were counted. RESULTS: There was a microbial reduction of 85.33% for the group irradiated with Er:YAG laser at 100 mJ/7 Hz, 74.58% at 100 mJ/10 Hz, and 89.50% at 100 mJ/16 Hz. For the groups irrigated with 1.0% and 2.5% NaOCl solution, 83.15% and 84.46% values of microbial reduction were obtained respectively. CONCLUSION: All the groups showed statistically similar results (p > 0.05%). No method totally eliminated microorganisms.
TI  - Comparative phytochemical and antimicrobial investigations of Hypericum perforatum L. subsp. perforatum and H. perforatum subsp. angustifolium (DC.) Gaudin.
AB  - The aerial parts of H. perforatum subsp. perforatum and H. perforatum subsp. angustifolium were investigated for their chemical composition and antimicrobial activity. Spectrophotometric analysis indicated that H. perforatum subsp. perforatum is richer in flavonoids and tannins than the other subspecies. HPLC analysis confirmed the higher yield of flavonoids in H. perforatum subsp. perforatum and gave also a higher content of phenolic acids. H. perforatum subsp. angustifolium contained more hypericin. The presence of rutin was proven only in H. perforatum subsp. perforatum. The antimicrobial activity of the extracts of both subspecies was evaluated based on the inhibition zone diameters using the hole-plate diffusion method. The MeOH extracts, dichloromethane and petroleum ether fractions were effective against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus subtilis. The results indicate that H. perforatum subsp. angustifolium had a stronger antimicrobial effect than the other subspecies.
TI  - 1H NMR spectroscopy in the diagnosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  - The (1)H NMR spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (UTI). K. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD), acetate, ethanol and succinate. The quantity of 1,3-PD produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. Other common bacteria causing UTI (except for Citrobacter frundii), such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter baumanii, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus gp B and Staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. Citrobacter frundii (C. frundii) also gives the same NMR results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary tract infection. The method provides a single-step documentation of K. pneumoniae (and C. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. Out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of UTI was obtained in 516 cases (84%). The NMR-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. In the present authors' experience, the results of NMR spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.
TI  - Ceftobiprole Medocaril: BAL5788, JNJ 30982081, JNJ30982081, RO 65-5788, RO 655788.
AB  - Ceftobiprole medocaril [BAL 5788, RO 65-5788, JNJ 30982081] is a prodrug in phase III clinical development with Basilea Pharmaceutica and Cilag AG (Johnson & Johnson) for the potential treatment of serious bacterial infections, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Ceftobiprole medocaril is the water-soluble prodrug of the pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, ceftobiprole [BAL 9141, RO 63-9141]. Because of the low water solubility of ceftobiprole, its clinical application was limited and Basilea began its investigations into ceftobiprole medocaril for further development. Ceftobiprole medocaril is being developed for IV administration and is currently undergoing phase III trials for complicated skin and skin structure infections (including MRSA) and hospital-acquired (nosocomial) pneumonia. Ceftobiprole medocaril has a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive bacteria (including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-resistant pneumococci and Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative bacteria. Ceftobiprole medocaril inhibits all transpeptidases, including the penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2a, by a unique combination of features. PBP 2a is the primary enzyme responsible for beta-lactam drug resistance in MRSA; PBP 2a also acts as a key defense mechanism by interacting with the bacterial cell wall to form a chemical barricade that is impervious to antibiotics. Ceftobiprole medocaril has been designed specifically to bind to this penicillin-resistant target. Ceftobiprole medocaril is bactericidal and has not shown resistance development in vitro or in stringent animal models. Studies conducted by Basilea have demonstrated that ceftobiprole medocaril is readily converted to ceftobiprole, and shows markedly improved water solubility. In February 2005, Basilea Pharmaceutica AG entered into an exclusive worldwide agreement with Cilag AG International (Johnson & Johnson) to develop, manufacture and market ceftobiprole medocaril. Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical (Johnson & Johnson) will market ceftobiprole medocaril in the US, and its affiliate companies, known as Janssen-Cilag, will market the product outside the US (entered as World in the Licensee table). Basilea has retained an option to co-promote ceftobiprole medocaril in the US, major European countries, Japan and China. Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development LLC will develop ceftobiprole medocaril in collaboration with Basilea. Roche previously retained an opt-in right on ceftobiprole medocaril. However, following Roche's decision not to exercise this right in May 2004, Basilea gained full global commercialisation rights for ceftobiprole medocaril. Roche retains its major shareholding in Basilea. Ceftobiprole medocaril is currently in phase III trials for complicated skin and skin structure infections due to MRSA, and nosocomial pneumonia (including ventilator-associated pneumonia) due to suspected or proven MRSA, and community-acquired pneumonia. The US FDA has granted fast-track status to the compound for these two indications. Phase III results are expected in 2006 and an NDA is expected to be submitted to the FDA in 2007. An additional pivotal phase III trial (STRAUSS 2, STudy of Resistant Staphyloccocus aureus in Skin and Skin structure infections) of ceftobiprole medocaril was initiated in October 2005 for complicated skin infections, including diabetic foot infections. This trial will be conducted in conjunction with Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2004). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 490 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 14 institutions in Japan were collected between August 2004 and July 2005. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were measured. Of them, 577 strains were estimated as causative bacteria and used for the measurement. The strains consisted of 156 gram-positive bacterial strains (27.0%) and 421 gram-negative bacterial strains (73.0%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, arbekacin (ABK), vancomycin (VCM) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 2 microg/mL. Against Enterococcus faecalis, ampicillin (ABPC) and VCM showed a strong antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially cefozopran (CZOP) and cefpirome (CPR) showed the strongest activity (MIC90: < or = 125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli [MIC of ciprofloxacin (CPFX): > or = 4 microg/mL] was detected at frequency of 18.8%, which was higher than that in the last year. Against Klebsiella pneumoniae, CZOP, meropenem (MEPM), and carumonam (CRMN) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/mL or less. The antibacterial activity of the other cephems was relatively good, and decrease in their activity observed in the last year study was not recognized. Against Serratia marcescens, imipenem (IPM) and gentamicin (GM) had the strongest antibacterial activity. Against Proteus mirabilis, CRMN showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/mL or less. MEPM prevented the growth of all strains with 0.25 microg/mL. Next, cefmenoxime (CMX), ceftazidime (CAZ), CZOP, cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), and cefditoren (CDTR) showed a strong activity. The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs was ranged from 32 to > 128 microg/mL except IPM and MEPM having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activities of CZOP and CAZ were considered to be relatively good on MIC50 comparison (MIC50: 2 microg/mL).
TI  - Pyrrolidine bis-cyclic guanidines with antimicrobial activity against drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens identified from a mixture-based combinatorial library.
AB  - The rapid rise in antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive bacterial infections prompted us to explore the development of novel strategies for synthesis of large chemical libraries amenable to high-throughput screening for antimicrobial activities. Here we report the solid-phase synthesis of a 738,192 member pyrrolidine bis-cyclic guanidine chemical library with 26 different amino acids at three positions of diversity and 42 carboxylic acids at the fourth position. This synthetic combinatorial library was developed for positional scanning and screened for bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities against the important human pathogen methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The eight compound mixtures exhibiting bactericidal activity (10 microg/mL) against MRSA were used to direct the synthesis of 36 individual compounds that were then screened for activity against MRSA, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), and two Gram-negative bacterial species. At least 20 individual compounds were bactericidal for MRSA at 2.5 microg/mL, with a subset of these compounds showing bactericidal activities (10 microg/mL) against the other species tested. This approach demonstrates the capability to synthesize and screen a complex library to yield promising antimicrobials that address a critical need for novel infectious disease therapeutics.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria isolated from European medical centres: results of the Daptomycin Surveillance Programme (2002-2004).
AB  - The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of 9322 contemporary (2002-2004) gram-positive bacterial isolates collected from 31 medical centres in 14 countries in Europe were evaluated by broth microdilution methods according to CLSI guidelines. The isolates collected comprised Staphylococcus aureus (4842 isolates), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 1942 isolates), Enterococcus faecalis (1147 isolates), Enterococcus faecium (391 isolates), beta-haemolytic streptococci (660 isolates) and viridans group streptococci (340 isolates). The organisms were tested against daptomycin and more than 20 comparator agents in Mueller-Hinton broth, supplemented with calcium to 50 mg/L when testing daptomycin. Overall, methicillin (oxacillin) resistance rates were 26.7% and 77.0% for S. aureus (MRSA) and CoNS, respectively, and the vancomycin resistance rate among enterococci was 6.1%. MRSA rates varied from 0.6% in Sweden to 40.2-43.0% in Belgium, Greece, Ireland, the UK and Israel, and VRE rates varied from 0% in Switzerland to 21.2% in Ireland. More than 99.9% of isolates tested were considered susceptible to daptomycin according to breakpoints established by the United States Food and Drug Administration and the CLSI. Daptomycin was active against all gram-positive species, with the highest MIC being 2, 8, 0.5 and 2 mg/L for staphylococci, enterococci, beta-haemolytic streptococci and viridans group streptococci, respectively. Daptomycin activity was not influenced adversely by resistance to other agents among staphylococci or enterococci. This novel lipopeptide (daptomycin) appears to be an excellent alternative therapeutic option for serious infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-positive organisms isolated in Europe.
TI  - [Preventing nosocomial infections. Dressings soaked in polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB)].
AB  - Polyhexamethlene biguanide (PHMB) is an antibacterial agent included in the chlorhexidine group which is active against a wide number of microorganisms including Staphylococcus Aureus Methycilin Resistant (MRSA), Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus Faecalis (VRE) and Acinetobacter baumannii which all cause antibiotic-resistant infections. Traditionally gauze dressings have been used to cover and protect wounds although their porous structure does not constitute an efficient barrier against bacterial penetration, especially when a dressing becomes wet due to the effects of a wound oozing and draining. Recently the use of a dressing soaked in a 0.2% PHMB solution which works as a biological barrier against pathogenic agents has been introduced in clinical practice. On the one hand, this PHMB soaked dressing inhibits bacterial growth in the areas where it is applied and, on the other hand, it prevents the penetration of microorganisms through the dressing itself. Simultaneously while a PHMB soaked dressing carries out these actions, it creates an environment favorable to the proliferation of the normal flora found in the epidermis. As opposed to porous gauze dressings, a PHMB dressing remains active during 72 hours even in wet environs. Its wide anti-micro-bacterial range prevents infections in surgical, acute or chronic wounds and in any type of intra-corporal access susceptible to infection, such as by means of intravascular catheters, tracheotomies, or thoracic tubes. A PHMB dressing can also be used as a primary covering to treat a chronic wound since it does not interfere in the process of tissue reepithelization.
TI  - Antibiotic bisanthraquinones produced by a streptomycete isolated from a cyanobacterium associated with Ecteinascidia turbinata.
AB  - Chemical studies of a streptomycete isolated from a cyanobacterium associated with the tropical tunicate Ecteinascidia turbinata led to the bioassay-guided purification of two antibacterial bisanthraquinone metabolites and a cytotoxic artifact. The structures, including relative configurations of these octacyclic compounds, were established by spectroscopic analyses. Their potent antibacterial properties (IC(50) = 0.15-130 microM) versus methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and cytotoxic effects against HCT-116 cells are presented.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Dicyclophora persica Boiss. from Iran.
AB  - The chemical composition of the essential oil of Dicyclophora persica Boiss. was  identified by GC and GC-MS analysis. The analysis of the oil resulted in the identification of forty-five components constituting 98.6% of the total oil. The main constituents were a-pinene (31.5%), (Z)-beta-ocimene (23.3%), p-cymene (6.7%) and (E)-beta-ocimene (5.4%). The antimicrobial activity of the oil was tested by the disk diffusion method against four Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis) and three Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria together with a fungus (Aspergillus niger). The oil showed strong inhibition activity toward all the tested microorganisms except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Topical negative pressure for the treatment of complex cavity wounds associated with osteitis.
AB  
TI  - Antibacterial and cytotoxic activity of Brazilian plant extracts--Clusiaceae.
AB  - Twelve extracts obtained from nine plants belonging to six different genera of Clusiaceae were analyzed against Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) bacteria using the microdilution broth assay. Tovomita aff. longifolia, T. brasiliensis, Clusia columnaris, Garcinia madruno, Haploclathra paniculata, and Caraipa grandifolia extracts showed significant results against the bacteria. The organic extract obtained from the leaves of T. aff. longifolia showed minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 70 microg/ml and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) = 90 microg/ml against E. faecalis and the organic extract made with the stem of C. columnaris showed MIC = 180 microg/ml and MBC = 270 microg/ml against P. aeruginosa. None of the antibacterial extracts showed lethal activity against brine shrimp nauplii. On the other hand, both aqueous and organic extracts obtained from the aerial organs of Vismia guianensis that were cytotoxic to brine shrimp nauplii did not show a significant antibacterial activity in the assay.
TI  - Design and synthesis of quinolinones as methionyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitors.
AB  - Five new structural analogues of substituted-1H-quinolinones (19, 20, 23, 24, and 26) have been synthesized and evaluated for Staphylococcus aureus methionyl-tRNA synthetase enzyme inhibitory activity. These compounds were also tested against pathogens of six S. aureus, two Enterococcus faecalis, and one Enterococcus faecium. Among all the synthesized quinolinones, compound 20 displayed significant inhibitory activities in the strains of E. faecalis and E. faecium.
TI  - Isolation of bacteriocinogenic Lactobacillus plantarum strains from ben saalga, a traditional fermented gruel from Burkina Faso.
AB  - A collection of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ben saalga, a traditional fermented gruel from Burkina Faso, was screened for bacteriocin production. Seven isolates were selected for their broad antimicrobial spectra, which overall included strains of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus licheniformis, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Cluster analysis of RAPD-PCR patterns revealed that six of the isolates represent different strains. The six selected strains were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum by 16S rDNA sequencing, species-specific PCR and multiplex PCR of the recA gene. PCR amplification revealed the presence of genes of the plantaricin cluster described in L. plantarum C11. Among them, strain 5.2.2 carried the largest number of genes from this cluster.
TI  - Microbial drug efflux proteins of the major facilitator superfamily.
AB  - Drug efflux proteins are widespread amongst microorganisms, including pathogens.  They can contribute to both natural insensitivity to antibiotics and to emerging antibiotic resistance and so are potential targets for the development of new antibacterial drugs. The design of such drugs would be greatly facilitated by knowledge of the structures of these transport proteins, which are poorly understood, because of the difficulties of obtaining crystals of quality. We describe a structural genomics approach for the amplified expression, purification and characterisation of prokaryotic drug efflux proteins of the 'Major Facilitator Superfamily' (MFS) of transport proteins from Helicobacter pylori, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Brucella melitensis, Campylobacter jejuni, Neisseria meningitides and Streptomyces coelicolor. The H. pylori putative drug resistance protein, HP1092, and the S. aureus QacA proteins are used as detailed examples. This strategy is an important step towards reproducible production of transport proteins for the screening of drug binding and for optimisation of crystallisation conditions to enable subsequent structure determination.
TI  - Automated detection and quantitation of bacterial RNA by using electrical microarrays.
AB  - Low-density electrical 16S rRNA specific oligonucleotide microarrays and an automated analysis system have been developed for the identification and quantitation of pathogens. The pathogens are Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, which are typically involved in urinary tract infections. Interdigitated gold array electrodes (IDA-electrodes), which have structures in the nanometer range, have been used for very sensitive analysis. Thiol-modified oligonucleotides are immobilized on the gold IDA as capture probes. They mediate the specific recognition of the target 16S rRNA by hybridization. Additionally three unlabeled oligonucleotides are hybridized in close proximity to the capturing site. They are supporting molecules, because they improve the RNA hybridization at the capturing site. A biotin labeled detector oligonucleotide is also allowed to hybridize to the captured RNA sequence. The biotin labels enable the binding of avidin alkaline phophatase conjugates. The phosphatase liberates the electrochemical mediator p-aminophenol from its electrically inactive phosphate derivative. The electrical signals were generated by amperometric redox cycling and detected by a unique multipotentiostat. The read out signals of the microarray are position specific current and change over time in proportion to the analyte concentration. If two additional biotins are introduced into the affinity binding complex via the supporting oligonucleotides, the sensitivity of the assays increase more than 60%. The limit of detection of Escherichia coli total RNA has been determined to be 0.5 ng/microL. The control of fluidics for variable assay formats as well as the multichannel electrical read out and data handling have all been fully automated. The fast and easy procedure does not require any amplification of the targeted nucleic acids by PCR.
TI  - Assessment of antibacterial activity of EndoREZ.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate antibacterial activity  of a new resin based sealer, EndoREZ in comparison with 5 other sealers: AH 26, Diaket, Sultan, Apexit, and RoekoSeal. STUDY DESIGN: The effect of 6 different sealers on the growth of 3 bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was measured using the agar diffusion test (ADT) and direct contact test (DCT). For ADT, 200 microL bacterial suspensions were spread on agar plates and freshly mixed sealers were applied to uniform wells punched in the agar. The zones of inhibition of bacterial growth were measured at 24 hours, 48 hours, 7 days, and 10 days. For DCT, 2 sets of sealers were prepared: fresh and 24-hour samples. Fresh samples were used within 20 minutes of mixing time while 24-hour samples were allowed to set in a humid atmosphere at 37 degrees C for 24 hours before testing. Sealers were mixed and placed on the walls of microtiter plate wells and 10-microL bacterial suspensions were allowed to directly contact the sealers for 1 hour. Fresh media were added and 15 microL were transferred from this plate to another plate containing fresh medium (215 microL). Bacterial growth of this last plate was then measured using spectrophotometer every hour over 16 hours. RESULTS: ADT results indicated that EndoREZ, Apexit, and RoekoSeal did not show any antibacterial activity. In DCT results, AH 26 and Sultan were potent bacterial growth inhibitors. CONCLUSION: EndoREZ is not as potent a bacterial growth inhibitor as Sultan and AH 26.
TI  - Coenzyme Q10 production in recombinant Escherichia coli strains engineered with a heterologous decaprenyl diphosphate synthase gene and foreign mevalonate pathway.
AB  - In the present work, Escherichia coli DH5alpha was metabolically engineered for CoQ(10) production by the introduction of decaprenyl diphosphate synthase gene (ddsA) from Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Grown in 2YTG medium (1.6% tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, and 0.5% glycerol) with an initial pH of 7, the recombinant E. coli was capable of CoQ(10) production up to 470 microg/gDCW (dry cell weight). This value could be further elevated to 900 microg/gDCW simply by increasing the initial culture pH from 7 to 9. Supplementation of 4-hydroxy benzoate did not improve the productivity any further. However, engineering of a lower mevalonate semi-pathway so as to increase the isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) supply of the recombinant strain using exogenous mevalonate efficiently increased the CoQ(10) production. Lower mevalonate semi-pathways of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were tested. Among these, the pathway of Streptococcus pneumoniae proved to be superior, yielding CoQ(10) production of 2,700+/-115 microg/gDCW when supplemented with exogenous mevalonate of 3 mM. In order to construct a complete mevalonate pathway, the upper semi-pathway of the same bacterium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, was recruited. In a recombinant E. coli DH5alpha harboring three plasmids encoding for upper and lower mevalonate semi-pathways as well as DdsA enzyme, the heterologous mevalonate pathway could convert endogenous acetyl-CoA to IPP, resulting in CoQ(10) production of up to 2,428+/-75 microg/gDCW, without mevalonate supplementation. In contrast, a whole mevalonate pathway constructed in a single operon was found to be less efficient. However, it provided CoQ(10) production of up to 1,706+/-86 microg/gDCW, which was roughly 1.9 times higher than that obtained by ddsA alone.
TI  - Triterpenoid saponins from the fruits of Caryocar villosum.
AB  - Fourteen new triterpenoid saponins (1-14) were isolated from the methanol extract of the fruits of Caryocar villosum along with 10 known saponins. Their structures were established on the basis of extensive NMR (1H, 13C, COSY, TOCSY, ROESY, HSQC, and HMBC) and ESIMS studies. The toxicity of the methanolic extracts of the peel and the pulp of fruits and the crude saponin fraction of the peel was assessed using the Artemia salina test. The antimicrobial activities of caryocarosides IV-21 (14), II-1 (16), III-1 (17), and IV-9 (20) and of saponin 23 were also studied in vitro on Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Enterococcus faecalis bacteria.
TI  - Capillary isoelectric focusing of microorganisms in the pH range 2-5 in a dynamically modified FS capillary with UV detection.
AB  - The isoelectric points of many microbial cells lie within the pH range spanning from 1.5 to 4.5. In this work, we suggest a CIEF method for the separation of cells according to their isoelectric points in the pH range of 2-5. It includes the segmental injection of the sample pulse composed of the segment of the selected simple ampholytes, the segment of the bioanalytes and the segment of carrier ampholytes into fused silica capillaries dynamically modified by poly(ethylene glycole). This polymer dissolved in the catholyte, in the anolyte and in the injected sample pulse was used for a prevention of the bioanalyte adsorption on the capillary surface and for the reduction of the electroosmotic flow. Between each focusing run, the capillaries were washed with the mixture of acetone/ethanol to achieve the reproducible and efficient CIEF. In order to trace of pH gradients, low-molecular-mass pI markers were used. The mixed cultures of microorganisms, Escherichia coli CCM 3954, Candida albicans CCM 8180, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, CCM 8223, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiela pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus CCM 3953, Streptococcus agalactiae CCM 6187, Enterococcus faecalis CCM 4224 and Staphylococcus epidermidis CCM 4418, were focused and separated by the CIEF method suggested here. This CIEF method enables the separation and detection of the microbes from the mixed cultures within several minutes. The minimum detectable number of microbial cells was less than 10(3).
TI  - Broad-spectrum microbicidal activity, toxicologic assessment, and materials compatibility of a new generation of accelerated hydrogen peroxide-based environmental surface disinfectant.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Concerns on human and environmental safety and label claims of many microbicides point to the need for safer, faster acting, and broad-spectrum substitutes. ACCEL TB, a 0.5% accelerated H(2)O(2) (AHP)-based disinfectant described here, is a potential candidate. METHODS: ACCEL TB was tested for its broad-spectrum microbicidal activity, safety and materials compatibility using internationally accepted protocols. Activity against bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella choleraesuis) was tested with the AOAC use-dilution method and the first tier of a quantitative carrier test (QCT-1). Mycobactericidal activity was tested against Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium terrae using a quantitative suspension test (QST) and QCT-1, respectively. Fungicidal activity (Trichophyton mentagrophytes) was determined with the AOAC test and QCT-1. Activity against several enveloped and nonenveloped viruses was evaluated using the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) method No. E-1053. Sanitizing action was tested against 7 types of vegetative bacteria with method No. DIS/TSS-10. All microbicidal tests contained an added soil load; in all AOAC tests, it was 5% fetal bovine serum, and, in QCT-1, a mixture of 3 types of proteins in phosphate buffer was used instead. The methods to test for acute oral, dermal, inhalation toxicities, and dermal and eye irritation as well as skin sensitization complied with the requirements of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the US Environmental Protection Agency (OPPTS 870). Standard methods were also used to test compatibility with metals and plastics. RESULTS: At 20 degrees C, the full-strength product was bactericidal and virucidal in 1 minute and mycobactericidal and fungicidal in 5 minutes. It was nonirritating to skin and eyes. The acute oral LD(50) (lethal dose 50%) was >5000 mg/kg. It was compatible with 12 types of plastic and 3 out of 4 metals. CONCLUSION: The tested formulation showed a high safety and materials compatibility profile in addition to being a fast acting, intermediate-level disinfectant.
TI  - Capillary isoelectric focusing of proteins and microorganisms in dynamically modified fused silica with UV detection.
AB  - We suggest a method for the reproducible and efficient capillary isoelectric focusing of proteins and microorganisms in the pH gradient 3-10. The method involves the segmental injection of the simple ampholytes, the solution of the selected electrolytes, and the sample mixture of bioanalytes and carrier ampholytes to the fused silica capillaries dynamically modified by poly(ethylene glycol), PEG 4000, which is added to the catholyte, the anolyte and injected solutions. In order to receive the reproducible results, the capillaries were rinsed by the mixture of acetone/ethanol between analyses. For the tracing of the pH gradients the low-molecular-mass pI markers were used. The simple proteins and the mixed cultures of microorganisms, Saccharomyces cerevisiae CCM 8191, Escherichia coli CCM 3954, Candida albicans CCM 8180, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae CCM 6187, Enterococcus faecalis CCM 4224, Staphylococcus epidermidis CCM 4418 and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, were focused and separated by the method suggested. The minimum detectable number of microbial cells was 5x10(2) to 1x10(3) with on-column UV detection at 280 nm.
TI  - Assessment of two commercial susceptibility test methods for determination of daptomycin MICs.
AB  - Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic with activity against several important gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including drug-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. Because the mechanism of action of daptomycin is calcium-dependent depolarization of the cell membrane, susceptibility testing requires medium supplemented with a physiological level of calcium. This study assessed two Food and Drug Administration-cleared commercial test devices for determination of daptomycin MICs, Etest and JustOne. A collection of 220 selected isolates, including Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, E. avium, E. durans, E. casseliflavus, and E. gallinarum, were tested by both methods. Included in the collection were 22 S. aureus and 14 Enterococcus sp. isolates that were recovered from patients and were nonsusceptible on the basis of the daptomycin MICs. As the reference method for comparison, all isolates were tested by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute broth microdilution method incorporating cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth with 50 microg/ml calcium. Daptomycin MICs agreed, within 1 twofold dilution, for 97% of the isolates by Etest and for 100% by JustOne. However, daptomycin MICs determined by Etest were 1 dilution lower than the reference MICs for 65% of the Enterococcus sp. isolates tested. This resulted in 28.5% very major (VM) errors (4/14) with enterococci (all E. faecium) but none (0/22) with staphylococci. Use of JustOne yielded MICs that were 1 dilution lower than the reference MICs for 69% of the staphylococci and 25% of the enterococci. This resulted in 13.6% VM errors (3/22) with staphylococci and 14.3% VM errors (2/14) with enterococci. The manufacturer-recommended JustOne inoculum preparation resulted in mean colony counts of only 5 x 10(4) to 1 x 10(5) CFU/ml in the wells of the strip. Increasing the inoculum to 3 x 10(5) to 4 x 10(5) CFU/ml eliminated two of five VM errors upon retesting. No major interpretive errors occurred with either device. In summary, daptomycin MICs generated by the Etest or JustOne method generally agreed within 1 dilution of the reference daptomycin MICs. However, both devices produced slightly lower MICs that resulted in some VM errors.
TI  - Antimicrobial and toxicological profile of the new biocide Akacid plus.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Akacid plus is a new member of the polymeric guanidine family of disinfectants. It was especially developed to enhance the antimicrobial activity of this class with significantly less toxicity. The in vitro activity of Akacid plus compared with chlorhexidine digluconate and mupirocin was tested against a total of 369 recent clinical isolates. METHODS: The organisms tested by CLSI reference methods included the following: Staphylococcus aureus (98), Staphylococcus epidermidis (9), Bacillus spp. (2), Enterococcus faecalis (32), Klebsiella spp. (45), Enterobacter spp. (20), Escherichia coli (65), Salmonella spp. (6), Shigella spp. (2), Yersinia enterocolitica (1), Acinetobacter spp. (4), Proteus spp. (7), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (59), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4), Candida spp. (10) and Aspergillus spp. (7). In vitro selection of resistance to Akacid plus was carried out on 24 strains. Toxicological analyses were also performed. RESULTS: All tested agents were more effective against Staphylococcus spp. and Bacillus spp. than against E. faecalis and Gram-negative bacteria. The MIC90s of chlorhexidine and mupirocin showed a 4-fold and 32-fold increase for methicillin-resistant S. aureus in comparison with methicillin-susceptible strains, while MIC values of Akacid plus were similar for antibiotic-susceptible and multiresistant strains. Bactericidal action of Akacid plus was observed at 1-2x MIC. The in vitro selection of resistance test showed no increase in MIC values of Akacid plus for any isolate after 30 passages. In addition, Akacid plus showed low oral and dermal toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results demonstrate the broad antimicrobial properties of Akacid plus, which makes it a promising tool for topical application in the prophylaxis and treatment of bacterial and fungal infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Gram-positive bacteria are common causes of bloodstream and other infections in hospitalized patients in the United States, and the percentage of nosocomial bloodstream infections caused by antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria is increasing. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are of particular concern. In the United States, approximately 60% of staphylococcal infections in the intensive care unit are now caused by MRSA, and percentages continue to rise. Outbreaks of hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) are typically the result of clonal spread by MRSA being transferred from patient to patient, frequently using healthcare personnel as intermediaries. HA-MRSA strains are generally multidrug resistant. Vancomycin is the standard treatment for serious MRSA infections, but a few cases of vancomycin-resistant S aureus (VRSA) have recently emerged in the United States. Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) is also increasing. Soft tissue infections are the most frequent presentations of CA-MRSA, but life-threatening invasive infections occur as well, including necrotizing pneumonia. The mechanisms of methicillin resistance are the same for CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA, but susceptibilities to non-beta-lactam antibiotics often differ. CA-MRSA exhibits broader antibiotic susceptibility than does HA-MRSA. The proportion of enterococci resistant to vancomycin continues to rise in the hospital setting, with the overwhelming majority of infections due to Enterococcus faecium. Clonal spread of VRE has been documented, but polyclonal outbreaks associated with antimicrobial use are also common. The relations between antibiotic use and VRE colonization are complex and related to the antienterococcal activity, biliary excretion, and antianaerobic activity of the antibiotic. Recent results show a decline in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) since the introduction of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and suggest that, where available, vaccines may be useful in the battle to slow the spread of resistant gram-positive cocci.
TI  - DNA microarray for detection of macrolide resistance genes.
AB  - A DNA microarray was developed to detect bacterial genes conferring resistance to macrolides and related antibiotics. A database containing 65 nonredundant genes selected from publicly available DNA sequences was constructed and used to design 100 oligonucleotide probes that could specifically detect and discriminate all 65 genes. Probes were spotted on a glass slide, and the array was reacted with DNA templates extracted from 20 reference strains of eight different bacterial species (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides fragilis) known to harbor 29 different macrolide resistance genes. Hybridization results showed that probes reacted with, and only with, the expected DNA templates and allowed discovery of three unexpected genes, including msr(SA) in B. fragilis, an efflux gene that has not yet been described for gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Incidence and complication rate of infective endocarditis in the Dutch region of  Walcheren: a 3-year retrospective study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure the incidence of infective endocarditis (IE) in the region  of Walcheren and to estimate the complication and comorbidity rate of IE, we conducted a 3-year retrospective study of IE in the only hospital (Ziekenhuis Walcheren) of the region between January, 2002 and December, 2004. RESULTS: The total number of cases was 32. The calculated yearly incidence of IE was 9.61 cases per 100.000 inhabitants per year. The median age was 64 years (range 36-81 years). When applying the Duke criteria 28 patients (87.5%) were classified as definite IE and 4 patients (12.5%) as possible IE. Blood cultures were positive in 27 patients (84.4%). The most commonly isolated organisms were streptococci (37.5%). Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 31.3% of positive blood cultures. Enteroccocus faecalis was identified in 3 cases (9.4%). In only 15.6% of the cases was the course of IE uncomplicated. The most frequent complications were heart failure (59.4%) and embolic events (34.4%). Cardiac surgery was performed in 37.5% of the cases. Concomitant morbidity was found in 75% of the patients. Especially, the high incidences of diabetes mellitus (28.1%), chronic renal failure (28.1%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (21.9%) were remarkable. CONCLUSION: The calculated incidence of IE of 9.61 cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year was more than five times higher than the one reported in a nation-wide Dutch study of 1992. The present study demonstrates that IE remains a disease with a considerable mortality and complication rate. The majority of the patients with IE had non-cardiac comorbidity. Especially, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure in our population of patients with IE is remarkable.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial efficacy of a new chlorhexidine slow-release device.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide slow-release devices on oral bacteria. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The agar diffusion test was used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of the slow-release devices Activ Point (chlorhexidine; Roeko) and Calcium Hydroxide Plus Point (Roeko) on 8 anaerobic and 2 facultative oral bacterial strains, as well as 2 bacterial cultures randomly sampled from necrotic root canals and incubated in anaerobic and aerobic broth for 48 hours. The efficiency of the medicaments against the various strains was evaluated using a nonparametric test (Friedman type) and a second nonparametric test (Wilcoxon's signed rank test). RESULTS: Activ Point produced significantly larger inhibition zones (P < .001) than the calcium hydroxide slow-release device around all tested bacterial strains. CONCLUSION: The chlorhexidine slow-release device (Activ Point) exhibited significant antibacterial activity in the agar diffusion test and merits study as an intracanal medicament.
TI  - [Antibiotic-resistance in Italy: activity of the first year of the surveillance project AR-ISS].
AB  - The antibiotic resistance surveillance project AR-ISS, started in 2001, is based  on a network of 62 sentinel microbiological laboratories throughout the country. The laboratories collect and transmit data to the Istituto Superiore di Sanita on the antibiotic susceptibility of bloodstream isolates of 7 species: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis/faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca ed Escherichia coli. They also send selected bacterial strains for further characterization. Results of the first year of surveillance are presented and are compared with data from the previous study EARSS-Italia and from other European countries. Oxacillin resistance in S. aureus appears to be stable, however, it remains one of the highest in Europe (41,5%). No strain with intermediate susceptibility or resistance to vancomycin has been isolated. In S. pneumoniae, the level of penicillin resistance is moderate (10,8%), but macrolide resistance has increased greatly (37,6% versus 28,6% of the previous study), following a tendency common to several European countries. Unexpectedly, vancomycin resistance in E. faecium was found to be 18%, the highest in Europe. Presumptive ESBL production in Gram-negative organisms can be estimated at 20% in Klebsiella and 1% in E. coli. Ampicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance in E. coli (respectively 50% and 18%) are among the highest in Europe. In conclusion, the rate of antibiotic resistance in the species studied is worrisome and requires continuing monitoring. Although some activities of AR-ISS need improvements, the surveillance has the potentiality to produce relevant and representative data about antibiotic resistance in Italy that can be used for comparison at the European level.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect in vitro of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide impregnated  gutta-percha points.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of points containing antiseptics used for temporary obturation in endodontics. Points containing calcium hydroxide (Roeko and Hygienic), and chlorhexidine (Roeko) were tested and gutta-percha points served as control (Meta Dental Corp.). The following microorganisms were studied: Streptococcus mutans (Sm), Enterococcus faecalis (Ef), Staphylococcus aureus (Sta), Candida albicans (Ca), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) ATCC 25586, Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) ATCC 33277, and Prevotella intermedia (Pi) ATCC 25611. The experiments were organized in three stages: 1st stage: one point of each kind was placed on agar plates previously seeded with microorganisms. 2nd stage: Another group of points was immersed in broth for 24 hours and placed on the seeded agar. Samples were then incubated at 37 degrees in the conditions of oxygen and for the time required by each microorganism. The zones of bacterial inhibition around each point were measured. The pH values of the broths were recorded. 3rd stage: the immersion broths were inoculated with suspensions of microorganisms, incubated, seeded on plates by dissemination and incubated. CFU counts were performed. RESULTS: points containing chlorhexidine showed inhibition zones with every microorganism in the 1st stage and, in the 2nd stage, with most of the microorganisms studied, except for Fn and Pi. Calcium hydroxide containing points did not inhibit any of the microorganisms assessed. Broth pH values did not exhibit any changes. CFU counts of the broths in which chlorhexidine points had been immersed showed total inhibition for all the microorganisms. The differences between materials were statistically significant (p<0.05) (ANOVA). In the conditions of this study, chlorhexidine-containing points proved to be effective against most of the tested strains.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibilities of organisms isolated from patients with urinary  tract infections in 2002].
AB  - Using the agar dilution method, the antibacterial activity of 18 antibiotics inclusive of 4 carbapenems were investigated against 101 strains of urinary pathogens isolated from patients with urinary tract infections who visited the Department of Urology at Kagoshima University Hospital, between January and December 2002. 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 3 strains of Staphylococcus spp. (exclusive of S. aureus), 14 strains of Enterococcus faecalis, 3 strains of Enterococcus spp. (exclusive of E. faecalis), 41 strains of Escherichia coli, 21 strains of Enterobacteriaceae (exclusive of E. coli), 12 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 3 strains of glucose-nonfermentative Gram-negative rods (exclusive of P. aeruginosa) were examined. 1. Against clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria, vancomycin and teicoplanin were active. Additionally, arbekacin was active against S. aureus clinical isolates and ampicillin was active against E. faecalis clinical isolates. Carbapenems were active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains of Gram-positive bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus. 2. As for clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacteria, meropenem was most active against Enterobacteriaceae among 13 antibiotics tested. Against P. aeruginosa clinical isolates, MIC90 of meropenem was the lowest among 13 antibiotics tested. In addition, resistant rate of meropenem and biapenem against P. aeruginosa clinical isolates was lower than those of the other carbapenems tested. 3. As main urinary pathogens showed no remarkable increase in resistance to carbapenems, it can be stated that carbapenems retain their position as the drug of first choice for severe infection.
TI  - Antibacterial analysis in vitro of ethyl-cyanoacrylate against ocular pathogens.
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the antimicrobial properties of ethyl-cyanoacrylate (Superbonder, Loctite, Brazil) in vitro in different microorganisms related to corneal infections. METHODS: We analyzed the following microorganisms: (1) Staphylococcus aureus (multiresistant); (2) S. aureus (ATCC 25923); (3) coagulase-negative Staphylococcus; (4) Streptococcus pyogenes; (5) Streptococcus pneumoniae; (6) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (multiresistant); (7) P. aeruginosa (ATCC 27853); (8) Escherichia coli (ATCC25922); and (9) Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212). One drop of the glue was dropped directly into the nutrient broth. The plates were incubated at 35 +/- 2 degrees C and its growth examined after 24 hours. Bactericidal activity of the glue was verified by sampling inhibition zones when present. The samples were plated in blood agar an analyzed after 24 and 48 hours. RESULTS: The ethyl-cyanoacrylate inhibited the growth of every gram-positive microorganism tested and showed bactericidal effect over 70% for all of them. Among the gram-negative microorganisms, only the E. coli and the E. faecalis had its growth inhibited, and the bactericidal effect was 60% and 40%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The ethyl-cyanoacrylate has bacteriostatic and bactericidal action in vitro, mainly against gram-positive microorganisms.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of nocathiacin I analogues.
AB  - Stereoselective reduction of dehydroalanine double bond in nocathiacin I afforded the primary amide 2. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the amide 2 provided the carboxylic acid 3, which upon coupling with a variety of amines furnished amides 4-32. Some of these semi-synthetic derivatives have retained very good antibacterial activity and have improved aqueous solubility.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of saponins from Medicago sp.: structure-activity relationship.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of saponins from Medicago sativa, M. arborea and M. arabica against a selection of medically important yeasts, Gram-positive and -negative bacteria was investigated. Structure-activity growth inhibitory effects of related prosapogenins and sapogenins are also described. Increasing antibiotic activity was observed going from the saponin extracts to the sapogenin samples, suggesting that the sugar moiety is not important for the antimicrobial efficacy. Activity was especially high against Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) with M. arabica being the species showing a broader spectrum of action. Discrete antifungal activity was also observed, mainly against Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The observed antimicrobial properties of M. sativa and M. arborea were related to the content of medicagenic acid, while hederagenin seems to contribute to the bioactivity of M. arabica total sapogenins.
TI  - Antileishmanial and antibacterial activity of a new pyrazole derivative designated 4-[2-(1-(ethylamino)-2-methyl- propyl)phenyl]-3-(4-methyphenyl)-1-phenylpyrazole.
AB  - Here, we report for the first time the synthesis and the antileishmanial activity of a new pyrazole derivative, namely 4-[2-(1-(ethylamino)-2-methylpropyl)phenyl]-3-(4-methyphenyl)-1-phenylpyrazole). Micromolar concentrations of this compound were found to inhibit the in vitro multiplication of Leishmania tropica, Leishmania major, and Leishmania infantum, three species causing different forms of leishmaniasis. Furthermore, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for the compound are only slightly higher than those of amphotericin B, one of the most active antileishmanial agents used as a satisfactory substitute in cases not responding to pentostam. The IC50 values after 48 h for L. tropica, L. major, and L. infantum promastigote growth were 0.48 microg/mL, 0.63 microg/mL and 0.40 microg/mL, respectively for the compound, while they were 0.23 microg/mL, 0.29 microg/mL and 0.24 microg/mL, respectively for amphotericin B. We also tested this compound for its antibacterial activity against several bacteria. The strongest antibacterial activity was observed against Entrococcus feacalis and Staphylococcus aureus with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 60 microg/mL.
TI  - Determination of usnic acid in some Rhizoplaca species from Middle Anatolia and their antimicrobial activities.
AB  - Three species of lichens, Rhizoplaca chrysoleuca (Sm.) Zopf, Rhizoplaca melanopthalma (DC.) Leuckert & Poelt and Rhizoplaca peltata Ramonds Leuckert, were collected from middle Anatolia, Erciyes Mountain (Kayseri) in Turkey. Their usnic acid amounts were determined by HPLC in acetone extracts. In addition, antimicrobial activities of these extracts were determined against Escherichia coli (ATCC 35218), Enterococcus faecalis (RSKK 508), Proteus mirabilis (Pasteur Ens. 235), Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It was shown that, as the usnic acid amount increased, the antimicrobial activities increased too. The usnic acid contents of Rhizoplaca species varied between 0.19-4.0% dry weight.
TI  - Predominance of Gram-negative bacilli and increasing antimicrobial resistance in  nosocomial bloodstream infections at a university hospital in southern Taiwan, 1996-2003.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: While nosocomial infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality, the availability of timely and accurate epidemiological information on nosocomial pathogens is essential to the appropriate selection of empirical therapy. This study analyzed nosocomial bloodstream infections (NBSIs) surveillance data to determine trends in the distribution of pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibilities of these pathogens. METHODS: During the period from 1996 to 2003 at National Cheng Kung University Hospital, patients with NBSIs were enrolled in the study, and the ranking of pathogens and status of antimicrobial resistance were determined. RESULTS: From 1996 to 2003, there were 4,038 episodes of NBSIs. The overall incidence was 1.79 episodes per 1,000 inpatient-days. Aerobic Gram-negative bacilli, Gram-positive cocci, fungi, and anaerobes were responsible for 51%, 37%, 10%, and 1.6% of NBSIs, respectively. The 5 leading pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci (16% of NBSIs), Staphylococcus aureus (13%), Candida spp. (10%), Acinetobacter baumannii (8%), and Escherichia coli (8%). Oxacillin resistance was found in 90% of coagulase-negative staphylococci and 75% of S. aureus isolates. In contrast to Enterococcus faecalis, in which only 1% of isolates were resistant to ampicillin, 78% of Enterococcus faecium isolates were resistant to ampicillin. The emerging antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative pathogens included multidrug-resistant A. baumannii, cephalosporin- or fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli. Despite the annual increase in the use of fluconazole, Candida albicans (54%) remained the most common causative pathogen of nosocomial candidemia. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, Gram-negative bacilli predominated among pathogens causing NBSIs and an upsurge in the threat of antimicrobial resistance in our hospital occurred during the 8-year period. Surveillance of the characteristics of NBSIs and antimicrobial resistance patterns, together with appropriate antibiotic and infection control measures, should be reinforced.
TI  - Universal primers for detection of common bacterial pathogens causing prosthetic  joint infection.
AB  - The diagnosis of low grade prosthetic joint infection is difficult and time consuming. Nested-PCR for universal bacterial DNA segments detection of "orthopaedic" bacteria was tested in a laboratory setting. This method is based on amplification of the 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA coding sequences. 11 species of the most frequent bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens) involved in prosthetic joint infections were studied. All could be detected rapidly and sensitively by this method.
TI  - [Interdisciplinary management of complex chronic ulcers using vacuum assisted closure therapy and "buried chip skin grafts"].
AB  - HISTORY AND ADMISSION FINDINGS: We report the case of a 68-year-old female patient who was admitted to the hospital with deranged blood sugar levels in a septic condition. Due to complex chronic ulcerations of both feet she was intended for major amputation of both limbs. Clinical findings on admission were a diabetic foot syndrome with stage D IV ulcerations according to the Wagner and Armstrong classification, partially visible tendons and phlegmon of the lower leg. INVESTIGATIONS AND CLINICAL COURSE: Vascular diagnostic revealed arterial occlusive disease in the lower legs without chance of reconstruction. Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus were extracted in swabs from ulcers. After correction of metabolic status and antibiotic treatment radical debridement of all ulcers was carried out and vacuum assisted closure therapy (V.A.C.) was initiated. All wounds showed good granulation tissue after four cycles of V.A.C.-therapy. Interdisciplinary treatment with a plastic surgeon was initiated to accelerate epithelial closure. Using the "Buried Skin Chip" technique in combination with V.A.C.-therapy epithelialisation was completed within four weeks. The patient recovered well and was fully independent on discharge. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: A goal-oriented interdisciplinary setting can achieve preservation of extremities even in septic patients. The combination of buried skin chip grafts and V.A.C.-therapy may be a feasible and promising procedure to achieve accelerated wound closure in those patients.
TI  - Impact of Enterococcus faecalis on the bactericidal activities of arbekacin, daptomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a mixed-pathogen pharmacodynamic model.
AB  - We inoculated an in vitro pharmacodynamic model simultaneously with clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and an enterocin-producing enterococcus (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, ampicillin susceptible) at 7 log10 CFU/ml to examine enterocin effects and antimicrobial activity on staphylococci. The investigated antimicrobial regimens were 100 mg arbekacin every 12 h (q12h), 6 mg daptomycin per kg of body weight/day, 600 mg linezolid q12h, and 100 mg tigecycline q24h alone and in combination (daptomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline) with arbekacin. Simulations were performed in triplicate; bacterial quantification occurred over 48 h, and development of resistance was evaluated throughout. When we evaluated the impact of antimicrobial activity against S. aureus alone, daptomycin demonstrated bactericidal activity (>or=3 log10 CFU/ml kill), whereas arbekacin, linezolid, and tigecycline displayed bacteriostatic activities (<3 log10 CFU/ml kill). In the mixed-pathogen model, early and distinctive stunting of S. aureus growth was noted (1.5 log CFU/ml difference) in the presence of enterocin-producing E. faecalis compared to growth controls run individually (P=0.02). Most noteworthy was that in the presence of enterocin-producing E. faecalis, bactericidal activity was observed with arbekacin and tigecycline and with the addition of arbekacin to linezolid. Antagonism was noted for the combination of tigecycline and arbekacin against S. aureus in the presence of enterocin-producing E. faecalis. Our research demonstrates that the inhibitory effect of E. faecalis contributed significantly to its overall antimicrobial impact on S. aureus. This contribution was enhanced or improved compared to the activity of each antimicrobial alone. Further research is warranted to determine the impact of polymicrobial infections on antimicrobial activity.
TI  - In vitro characterization of the antibacterial spectrum of novel bacterial type II topoisomerase inhibitors of the aminobenzimidazole class.
AB  - Antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action are becoming increasingly important in the battle against bacterial resistance to all currently used classes of antibiotics. Bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV (topoIV) are the familiar targets of fluoroquinolone and coumarin antibiotics. Here we present the characterization of two members of a new class of synthetic bacterial topoII ATPase inhibitors: VRT-125853 and VRT-752586. These aminobenzimidazole compounds were potent inhibitors of both DNA gyrase and topoIV and had excellent antibacterial activities against a wide spectrum of problematic pathogens responsible for both nosocomial and community-acquired infections, including staphylococci, streptococci, enterococci, and mycobacteria. Consistent with the novelty of their structures and mechanisms of action, antibacterial potency was unaffected by commonly encountered resistance phenotypes, including fluoroquinolone resistance. In time-kill assays, VRT-125853 and VRT-752586 were bactericidal against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Haemophilus influenzae, causing 3-log reductions in viable cells within 24 h. Finally, similar to the fluoroquinolones, relatively low frequencies of spontaneous resistance to VRT-125853 and VRT-752586 were found, a property consistent with their in vitro dual-targeting activities.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of selected root-end filling materials.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of leachable components of selected root-end filling materials: amalgam, ProRoot MTA (mineral trioxide aggregate), Intermediate Restorative Material (IRM), Super Bond C&B, Geristore, Dyract, Clearfil APX composite with SE Bond, or Protect Bond. The direct contact test (DCT) with Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was used. The materials were tested immediately after application to the microtiter wells (fresh samples) and after setting for 3 days (set samples). Ten microliters of bacterial suspension was added to each well for direct contact with each material for 1 h at 37 degrees C. Growth of surviving bacteria was then measured in a microplate spectrophotometer hourly at 620 nm for 15 h. Twelve uncoated wells using identical inoculum size served as positive controls. The data obtained at the end of 15 h was subjected to one-way ANOVA and post hoc comparisons were done using Tamhane's T2 test. Fresh samples of all materials showed a 3-h delay in exponential growth of both E. faecalis and S. aureus, and a 5-h delay in growth of P. aeruginosa. Set samples of IRM and ProRoot MTA cements showed generally greater antibacterial activity than the other materials: both completely inhibited P. aeruginosa, and both delayed or limited growth of E. faecalis. The DCT, by being quantitative and virtually independent of solubility and diffusion, was found suitable to assay solid root-end filling materials. IRM and ProRoot MTA were generally more potent inhibitors of bacterial-growth than the other tested materials.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a novel peptide deformylase inhibitor, LBM415, tested against respiratory tract and cutaneous infection pathogens: a global surveillance report (2003-2004).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the spectrum of activity and potency of LBM415, the first of the peptide deformylase inhibitor (PDFI) class to be developed for treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections and uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections (uSSTI), against a large, contemporary international collection of targeted pathogens collected during 2003-2004. METHODS: A total of 21,636 isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution methods as part of a longitudinal international antimicrobial resistance surveillance study. Characteristics of the organism collection included resistance to oxacillin among 35.0% of Staphylococcus aureus and 76.0% of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS); resistance to penicillin (MIC > or = 2 mg/L) among 18.0% of Streptococcus pneumoniae; vancomycin resistance among 20.0% of Enterococcus spp. and ampicillin resistance among 22.0% of Haemophilus influenzae. RESULTS: LBM415 displayed potent activity against staphylococci, streptococci, Enterococcus faecium and Moraxella catarrhalis, with > or = 99.0% of strains being inhibited at < or = 4 mg/L; 97.0% of Enterococcus faecalis isolates and 92.0% of H. influenzae isolates were also inhibited at this concentration. Seventy-seven percent of Burkholderia cepacia and 82.0% of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were inhibited at < or = 8 mg/L. No differences in LBM415 activity against S. aureus, CoNS, S. pneumoniae, Enterococcus spp. and H. influenzae were detected for subsets susceptible or resistant to antimicrobials such as oxacillin, penicillin, ampicillin, macrolides, vancomycin and fluoroquinolones. While regional differences were apparent with some comparator agents, sensitivity to LBM415 did not vary significantly among strains from the various geographic areas sampled. One isolate of S. aureus displayed high-level resistance to LBM415 owing to multiple sequence changes in resistance phenotype genes (defB and fmt), despite the absence of the compound in clinical practice. This isolate remained susceptible to all other antimicrobials tested except for penicillin. CONCLUSIONS: With few differences detected among strains from various geographic regions, the first PDFI class agent to enter clinical development has consistently demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against commonly isolated pathogens associated with uncomplicated respiratory and cutaneous infections. These compounds represent a significant therapeutic advance owing to their novel mechanism of action and antibacterial spectrum, including activity against resistant organisms, should pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters support their continued development. Given the detection of a pre-existing PDFI-resistant isolate of S. aureus as demonstrated here, surveillance for resistance among the PDFI-targeted pathogens following introduction of this class of agent into clinical usage will be an important component of future studies.
TI  - Genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity in Enterococcus isolates from Batzos, a raw goat milk cheese.
AB  - This study investigated the genotypic and phenotypic diversity in 34 isolates of  enterococci obtained during ripening of Batzos cheese from raw goat milk and characterized phenotypically as Enterococcus durans. RAPD-PCR, plasmid profiling and PFGE were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. Species recognition by means of RAPD-PCR was in agreement with the phenotypic identification for 29 strains. One strain was characterized as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis by RAPD-PCR and four strains were grouped with the Enterococcus faecium reference strain. All strains were vancomycin sensitive, while 10 strains showed beta-haemolytic reaction on human blood and the majority of them (88.9%) showed decarboxylase activity on tyramine. All strains exhibited antagonistic activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes and the majority inhibited Enterococcus faecalis. Isolates displayed weak acidifying ability and low proteolytic activities when grown in milk for 24h. However, their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk for seven days was significant with preference for alphas-casein degradation.
TI  - Promotion of opsonization by antibodies and phagocytosis of Gram-positive bacteria by a bifunctional polyacrylamide.
AB  - This paper describes the application of a bifunctional polyacrylamide (pA-V-F) presenting both vancomycin and fluorescein groups, to modify the surfaces of multiple species of Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis) to control molecular recognition of these surfaces. The vancomycin groups allowed the specific recognition of a structural component of the bacterial cell wall: peptides terminated in D-Ala-D-Ala. The fluorescein groups allowed the imaging of binding of polymer to the surfaces of bacteria by fluorescence, and are representative, low molecular weight haptens; their recognition by anti-fluorescein antibodies provides proof-of-principle that bifunctional polymers can be used to introduce haptens onto the surface of the bacteria. Flow cytometry revealed that polymer-labeled S. aureus and S. pneumoniae were opsonized by anti-fluorescein antibodies approximately 20-fold more than were untreated bacteria; nearly all ( approximately 92%) polymer-labeled S. aureus, and a large (76%) fraction of polymer-labeled S. pneumoniae were opsonized. The bound antibodies then promoted phagocytosis of the bacteria by cultured J774 macrophage-like cells. Flow cytometry revealed that macrophages ingested S. aureus decorated with the polymer-antibody complexes approximately 2-fold more efficiently than S. aureus in control groups, in spite of the high background (caused by efficient antibody-independent ingestion of S. aureus by macrophages). This paper, thus, demonstrates the ability of a bifunctional polymer to carry out three distinct functions based on polyvalent molecular recognition: (i) recognition of the surface of Gram-positive bacteria, (ii) modification of this surface to generate specific binding sites recognized by an antibody, and (iii) promotion of phagocytosis of the opsonized bacteria.
TI  - [Wide esophageal wall rupture as iatrogenic complication of anterior cervical spine surgery].
AB  - The case of 19-year old men with iatrogenic esophageal wall perforation is presented. The patient underwent anterior cervical stabilization using plate and screw for fracture of the C4 and C5 vertebra followed by an abscess of prevertebral space with discharging pus and food from the wound. The general condition was poor. Symptoms included: pneumonia, pleuritis with effusion, septicemia with mediastinitis, fever up to 40 and quadriplegia on neurological examination. During surgical procedure the implant loose but was still fixed into the esophagus causing a large defect in the posterior wall of the hypopharynx and cervical part of esophagus was found. The patient undergone three step surgery with wide drainage of prevertebral abscess, removing of osteosynthetic plate removal and formation of pedicle flap with sterno-cleido-mastoideus muscule. The finnal fourth procedure with using of pediculed infrahyoid flap gave an excellent result. During 160 days hospitalization the pus culture showed growth of the 11 bacterials species (like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) and 2 species of fungus. He was treated 13 types of antybiotics. This special case we present because of live threatening complication (mediastinitis) and complicated clinical course as well as because of unique technique of the defect closure, i.e. the infrahyoid flap occurred to be successful.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2003). III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - The bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from 565 patients diagnosed as urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 14 institutions in Japan were collected between August 2003 and July 2004. The susceptibilities of these bacteria to various antimicrobial agents were examined. The bacteria were divided into 2 groups consisting of uncomplicated UTIs and complicated UTIs (with and without indwelling catheter) based on their isolation origins. The results were compared with those obtained between 1994 and 2002. The drug sensitivity of S. aureus in this year was similar to those in up to the previous years and S. aureus showed the best susceptibility to vancomycin. The drug sensitivity of E. faecalis in this year also was similar to those in up to the previous years. The drug sensitivity of E. coli in this year was generally good except penicillins and was similar to those in up to the previous years. Among cephems, cefozopran (CZOP) and cefpirome (CPR) showed the highest potency activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). An antibacterial activity of cefotiam (CTM) was stable for 10 years and was fine (MIC0: < or = 0.5 microg/mL). The sensitivity of E. coli to carbapenems and carumonam (CRMN) also was good like to CZOP. The sensitivity of the complicated UTIs group to quinolones, however, has decreased after 2000 and it was suggested that the resistance to the drug has developed. Kiebsiella spp. showed a decrease in the susceptibility to some of cephems. The drugs indicating a big decrease in the sensitivity were cefazolin, CTM, cefaclor, and cefpodoxime. Imipenem, carbapenems, also indicated a decrease in the sensitivity. The susceptibility of the strain to the other drugs was similar to that in up to the previous years. Among them, CZOP maintained good susceptibility (MIC90: > or = 0.125 microg/mL against uncomplicated UTIs, 0.25 microg/mL against complicated UTIs) like meropenem. The drug sensitivity of P. aeruginosa was generally low and was not much different from that in up to the previous years.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2003). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 565 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 14 institutions in Japan were collected between August 2003 and July 2004. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. Of them, 701 strains were estimated as prophlogistic bacteria and used for the investigation. The strains consisted of 258 Gram-positive bacterial strains (36.8%) and 443 Gram-negative bacterial strains (63.2%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 2 microg/mL. Against Streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin (ABPC), cefozopran (CZOP), imipenem (IPM), and clarithromycin (CAM) showed a strong activity and the MIC90 was 0.125 microg/mL or less. Against Enterococcus faecalis, VCM, ABPC, and IPM showed a strong antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially CZOP and cefpirome (CPR) showed the strongest activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli [MIC of ciprofloxacin (CPFX): > or =4 microg/mL] was detected at frequency of 15.7%, which was higher than that in the last year. Against Klebsiella pneumoniae, meropenem (MEPM) showed the strongest activity and next, the antibacterial activity of CRMN and CZOP was good. The antibacterial activity of the other cephems, however, significantly decreased, compared with that evaluated in last year. Against Serratia marcescens, MEPM had the strongest antibacterial activity. Against Proteus mirabilis, MEPM and CRMN showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/mL or less. Nest, cefmenoxime (CMX), ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), CPR, CZOP, and cefditoren (CDTR) showed a strong activity. The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs was ranged from 32 to < or = 256 microg/mL except IPM and amikacin (AMK) having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activity of CZOP was relatively good (MIC50: 2 microg/mL).
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel C12 vinyl ketolides.
AB  - A novel series of C12 vinyl erythromycin derivatives have been discovered which exhibit in vitro and in vivo potency against key respiratory pathogens. The C12 modification involves replacing the natural C12 methyl group in the erythromycin core with a vinyl group via chemical synthesis. From the C12 vinyl macrolide core, a series of C12 vinyl ketolides was prepared. Several compounds were found to be potent against macrolide-sensitive and -resistant bacteria. The C12 vinyl ketolides 6j and 6k showed a similar antimicrobial spectrum and comparable activity to the commercial ketolide telithromycin. However, the pharmacokinetic profiles of C12 vinyl ketolides 6j and 6k in rats differ from that of telithromycin by having higher lung-to-plasma ratios, larger volumes of distribution, and longer half-lives. These pharmacokinetic differences have a pharmacodynamic effect as both 6j and 6k exhibited better in vivo efficacy than telithromycin in rat lung infection models against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae.
TI  - Beta-nitrostyrene derivatives as potential antibacterial agents: a structure-property-activity relationship study.
AB  - A multidisciplinary project was developed, combining the synthesis of a series of beta-nitrostyrene derivatives and the determination of their physicochemical parameters (redox potentials, partition coefficients), to the evaluation of the corresponding antibacterial activity. A complete conformational analysis was also performed, in order to get relevant structural information. Subsequently, a structure-property-activity (SPAR) approach was applied, through linear regression analysis, aiming at obtaining a putative correlation between the physicochemical parameters of the compounds investigated and their antibacterial activity (both against standard strains and clinical isolates). The beta-nitrostyrene compounds displayed a lower activity towards all the tested bacteria relative to the beta-methyl-beta-nitrostyrene analogues. This was observed particularly for the 3-hydroxy-4-methoxy-beta-methyl-beta-nitrostyrene (IVb) against the Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium). The SPAR results revealed the existence of a clear correlation between the redox potentials and the antibacterial activity of the series of beta-nitrostyrene derivatives under study.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activities of chiral 1,3-oxazinan-2-one derivatives.
AB  - We report here the design, synthesis, and antibacterial activities of novel classes of compounds containing chiral 1,3-oxazinan-2-ones and oxazolidinones as the basic core structures. These compounds are tertiary amines containing the core structures and two aryl substituents. Several of these molecules exhibit potent antibacterial activities against the tested Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Bacillus subtilis. These compounds represent new structure scaffolds and can be further optimized to give new antibacterial agents with structures significantly different from those of existing classes of antibiotics.
TI  - Abietanes from Plectranthus grandidentatus and P. hereroensis against methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of 10 natural abietanes isolated from Plectranthus grandidentatus and P. hereroensis acetonic extract was evaluated against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). The results revealed that the most active diterpenes were coleon U (1), 7alpha-acetoxy-6beta-hydroxyroyleanone (2) and horminone (3). Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging 0.98-15.63 microg/ml were obtained for MRSA clinical strains, and MIC values of 15.63 and 31.25 microg/ml were obtained for VRE clinical strains. Some structure-activity relationships are emphasized.
TI  - Comparison of bactericidal activity of six lysozymes at atmospheric pressure and  under high hydrostatic pressure.
AB  - The antibacterial working range of six lysozymes was tested under ambient and high pressure, on a panel of five gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus lysodeikticus) and five gram-negative bacteria (Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium). The lysozymes included two that are commercially available (hen egg white lysozyme or HEWL, and mutanolysin from Streptomyces globisporus or M1L), and four that were chromatographically purified (bacteriophage lambda lysozyme or LaL, bacteriophage T4 lysozyme or T4L, goose egg white lysozyme or GEWL, and cauliflower lysozyme or CFL). T4L, LaL and GEWL were highly pure as evaluated by silver staining of SDS-PAGE gels and zymogram analysis while CFL was only partially pure. At ambient pressure each gram-positive test organism displayed a specific pattern of sensitivity to the six lysozymes, but none of the gram-negative bacteria was sensitive to any of the lysozymes. High pressure treatment (130-300 MPa, 25 degrees C, 15 min) sensitised several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria for one or more lysozymes. M. lysodeikticus and P. aeruginosa became sensitive to all lysozymes under high pressure, S. typhimurium remained completely insensitive to all lysozymes, and the other bacteria showed sensitisation to some of the lysozymes. The possible applications of the different lysozymes as biopreservatives, and the possible reasons for the observed differences in bactericidal specificity are discussed.
TI  - Study of the efficacy of Coated VICRYL Plus Antibacterial suture (coated Polyglactin 910 suture with Triclosan) in two animal models of general surgery.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy in vitro and in vivo of a new antibacterial  suture (PGAB) compared with a traditional braided suture (PG). Our primary goals were to study microbiological effectiveness and impact on wound healing of PGAB vs PG. Secondary goal was to analyze influence on inflammatory response. METHODS: In vitro study: clinical samples of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. hominis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus auricularis, Enterococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium spp. and Escherichia coli were studied. We also implanted a flat mesh in 10 minipigs, four incisions each (two PG and two PGAB) two contaminated with S. epidermidis and two not contaminated. Finally, we performed four colic anastomosis in each of 10 minipigs, two contaminated with E. coli and two not contaminated (two PG and two PGAB). We studied the inflammatory and wound healing processes in both models. RESULTS: We observed a bactericidal efficacy of PGAB against grampositive, and bacteriostatic effect against E. coli. Mesh study: recovered CFU were lower in the group PGAB vs PG. In the group PGAB, inflammatory mediators' concentrations were lower. In the group PGAB, concentrations of wound healing mediators were normal. Colic anastomosis: recovered CFU were lower in the group PGAB vs the group PG. In the group PGAB we observed a reduction of inflammatory mediators. In the group PGAB we observed normalized concentrations of wound healing mediators. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates microbiological efficacy of PGAB, that normalizes wound healing process, and an anti-inflammatory effect.
TI  - Microbiologic characterization of isolates from a dalbavancin clinical trial for  catheter-related bloodstream infections.
AB  - Dalbavancin, a new-generation semisynthetic lipoglycopeptide in phase 3 clinical  development, has been documented to be more active than vancomycin or teicoplanin against Gram-positive bacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains, by in vitro testing and in animal models. The human pharmacokinetics of dalbavancin predicts efficacy at weekly dosing intervals. In a phase 2 open-label clinical trial, dalbavancin exhibited superiority when compared with vancomycin against catheter-related bloodstream infection (CR-BSI). The majority of pathogens identified in this study as in clinical practice were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), necessitating rigorous characterization of duplicate isolates to rule out contaminants and to validate cases for study evaluations. At follow-up for the intent-to-treat population, overall pathogen eradication was 92.3% for dalbavancin and 75.9% for vancomycin. We describe the details of organisms isolated, their epidemiologic/genetic characterization, susceptibility patterns against glycopeptides, and the eradication rates by organism group. In conclusion, dalbavancin was active against all isolated pathogens associated with CR-BSI (CoNS, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis; all MIC results, < or = 0.25 microg/mL) and achieved significant (P < 0.05) clinical success when compared with vancomycin.
TI  - Bacterial sepsis and chemokines.
AB  - Bacterial sepsis causes a high mortality rate when it occurs in patients with compromised host defenses. Severely burned patients, typical immunocompromised hosts, are extremely susceptible to infections from various pathogens, and a local wound infection frequently escalates into sepsis. In these patients, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are familiar pathogens that cause opportunistic infections. Also, polymicrobial sepsis frequently occurs in these patients. In this review, therefore, the roles of chemokines in thermally injured patients infected with these 3 pathogens and polymicrobial sepsis will be discussed. These infections in thermally injured patients may be controlled immunologically, because immunocompetent hosts are resistant to infections with these pathogens. Classically activated macrophages (M1Mphi) are major effector cells for host innate immune responses against these infections. However, M1Mphi are not generated in thermally injured patients whose alternatively activated macrophages (M2Mphi) predominate. M2Mphi appear in patients early after severe burn injuries. M2Mphi inhibit M1Mphi generation through the secretion of CCL17 and IL-10. As a modulator of Mphi, two different subsets of neutrophils (PMN-I, PMN-II) are described. PMN-I direct the polarization of resident Mphi into M1Mphi through the production of CCL3. M2Mphi are induced from resident Mphi by CCL2 released from PMN-II. Therefore, as an inhibitor of CCL2, glycyrrhizin protects individuals infected with S. aureus. Sepsis stemming from P. aeruginosa wound infection is also influenced by CCL2 released from immature myeloid cells. A large number of immature myeloid cells appear in association with burn injuries. Host resistance to S. aureus, E. faecalis, P. aeruginosa or polymicrobial infections may be improved in thermally injured patients through the induction of M1Mphi, elimination of CCL2 and/or depletion of M2Mphi induced by CCL2.
TI  - Tigecycline: a novel glycylcycline antibiotic.
AB  - Tigecycline, the first-in-class glycylcycline, was developed to recapture the broad spectrum of activity of the tetracycline class and to treat patients with difficult-to-treat bacterial infections. Tigecycline's in vitro spectrum of activity encompasses aerobic, facultative and anaerobic Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including antimicrobial-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Clinical trials involving patients with complicated skin and skin-structure infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections, including patients infected with methicillin-resistant S. aureus, demonstrated that tigecycline was bacteriologically and clinically effective with mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal adverse events (i.e., nausea, vomiting and diarrhea) the most commonly reported. Tigecycline is a promising new broad-spectrum parenteral monotherapy for the treatment of patients with Gram-positive and -negative bacterial infections.
TI  - Detection and identification of intestinal pathogenic bacteria by hybridization to oligonucleotide microarrays.
AB  - AIM: To detect the common intestinal pathogenic bacteria quickly and accurately.  METHODS: A rapid (<3 h) experimental procedure was set up based upon the gene chip technology. Target genes were amplified and hybridized by oligonucleotide microarrays. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy strains of bacteria in pure culture belonging to 11 genera were successfully discriminated under comparatively same conditions, and a series of specific hybridization maps corresponding to each kind of bacteria were obtained. When this method was applied to 26 divided cultures, 25 (96.2%) were identified. CONCLUSION: Salmonella sp., Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus sp., Bacillus cereus, Vibrio cholerae, Enterococcus faecalis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni can be detected and identified by our microarrays. The accuracy, range, and discrimination power of this assay can be continually improved by adding further oligonucleotides to the arrays without any significant increase of complexity or cost.
TI  - 3,5-dioxopyrazolidines, novel inhibitors of UDP-N- acetylenolpyruvylglucosamine reductase (MurB) with activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - A series of 3,5-dioxopyrazolidines was identified as novel inhibitors of UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvylglucosamine reductase (MurB). Compounds 1 to 3, which are 1,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-3,5-dioxopyrazolidine-4-carboxamides, inhibited Escherichia coli MurB, Staphyloccocus aureus MurB, and E. coli MurA with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) in the range of 4.1 to 6.8 microM, 4.3 to 10.3 microM, and 6.8 to 29.4 microM, respectively. Compound 4, a C-4-unsubstituted 1,2-bis(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,5-dioxopyrazolidine, showed moderate inhibitory activity against E. coli MurB, S. aureus MurB, and E. coli MurC (IC50s, 24.5 to 35 microM). A fluorescence-binding assay indicated tight binding of compound 3 with E. coli MurB, giving a dissociation constant of 260 nM. Structural characterization of E. coli MurB was undertaken, and the crystal structure of a complex with compound 4 was obtained at 2.4 A resolution. The crystal structure indicated the binding of a compound at the active site of MurB and specific interactions with active-site residues and the bound flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor. Peptidoglycan biosynthesis studies using a strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis revealed reduced peptidoglycan biosynthesis upon incubation with 3,5-dioxopyrazolidines, with IC50s of 0.39 to 11.1 microM. Antibacterial activity was observed for compounds 1 to 3 (MICs, 0.25 to 16 microg/ml) and 4 (MICs, 4 to 8 microg/ml) against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Evaluation of in vitro interaction of daptomycin with gentamicin or beta-lactam antibiotics against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococci by FIC index and timed-kill curves.
AB  - The interactions of daptomycin with gentamicin and 5 beta-lactam agents were determined by checkerboard and timed-kill studies. Eighty isolates were tested by checkerboard: 20 each of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (VSEF) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Time kill curves were performed on 8 selected isolates: 2 each of MRSA, MSSA, VSEF and VRE. Checkerboard results showed highest frequency of synergistic effects against VSEF (35-75%) with daptomycin combined with ceftriaxone, cefepime or imipenem; a modest effect with most combinations against VRE and MRSA (5-20%); and indifference with daptomycin and most agents against MSSA (0-5%); except with daptomycin with oxacillin where 10-20% synergy was observed. Synergistic interaction was confirmed by time kill studies in seven of ten isolates where checkerboard suggested synergy. A bactericidal effect was exerted in 5/7 synergistic combinations. The in vitro data suggest that daptomycin combined with other antibiotics may be microbiologically beneficial and not antagonistic.
TI  - Erythromycin synergism with essential and trace elements.
AB  - In order to establish the role of various essential and trace element complexation on the antibacterial activity of various macrolide antibiotics, the synergistic or antagonistic behavior of erythromycin metal complexes have been studied and compared with the parent drug. Metal complexes of erythromycin with magnesium, calcium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc and cadmium have been investigated for their antibacterial activity and compared with erythromycin by observing the changes in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and by measuring the zone of inhibition of complexes against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms. Various microorganisms used were Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella dysentery, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus epidermidis. For MIC observation, serial dilution method was employed and zone sizes were determined by diffusion disk method. Our investigations reveal that formation of erythromycin complexes result in synergistic effect i.e., antimicrobial activity of complexes of erythromycin increases with respect to parent erythromycin drug and MIC of drug metal complexes decreased.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Arctium lappa constituents against microorganisms commonly found in endodontic infections.
AB  - This study evaluated in vitro the antimicrobial activity of rough extracts from leaves of Arctium lappa and their phases. The following microorganisms, commonly found in the oral cavity, specifically in endodontic infections, were used: Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans. The agar-diffusion method allowed detection of the hexanic phase as an inhibitor of microbial growth. Bioautographic assays identified antimicrobial substances in the extract. The results showed the existence, in the rough hexanic phase and in its fractions, of constituents that have retention factors (Rf) in three distinct zones, thereby suggesting the presence of active constituents with chemical structures of different polarities that exhibited specificity against the target microorganisms. It may be concluded that the Arctium lappa constituents exhibited a great microbial inhibition potential against the tested endodontic pathogens.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the susceptibility of endodontic pathogens to calcium hydroxide combined with different vehicles.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2] in combination with different vehicles against endodontic pathogens. For such purpose, a broth dilution test was performed. Pastes were prepared with Ca(OH)2 powder and the following vehicles: sterile water, glycerin, camphorated monochlorophenol (CMCP), CMCP + glycerin, polyethyleneglycol and CMCP + polyethyleneglycol. The time required for the pastes to produce negative cultures against the tested microorganisms was recorded and analyzed statistically using the Kruskal Wallis test at 5% significance level. Timing for pastes to eliminate the aerobic and facultative anaerobic microorganisms ranged from 6 to 24 h, while strict anaerobic microorganisms were inhibited within 30 s to 5 min. Microbial susceptibility, ranked from weakest to strongest, can be presented as follows: Enterococcus faecalis (the most resistant microorganism), Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis and Prevotella intermedia (the last two microorganisms required the same time to be eliminated). In conclusion, calcium hydroxide pastes needed more time to eliminate facultative than anaerobic microorganisms. These findings suggest that the antimicrobial property is related both to paste formulation and to microbial susceptibility.
TI  - Roxithromycin antagonism with essential and trace elements.
AB  - In order to ascertain the role of various essential and trace element complexation on the antibacterial activity of various macrolide antibiotics, the synergistic or antagonistic behavior of roxithromycin metal complexes have been studied and compared with the parent drug. Metal complexes of roxithromycin with magnesium, calcium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc and cadmium have been investigated for their antibacterial activity and compared with roxithromycin by observing the changes in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and by measuring the zone of inhibition of complexes against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms. Various microorganisms used were Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella dysentery, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus epidermidis. For MIC observation, serial dilution method was employed and zone sizes were determined by diffusion disk method. Our investigations divulge that formation of roxithromycin complexes results in antagonistic behavior against few microorganisms where in MIC is increased with respect to the parent drug, while against most of the microorganism, there was no effect on the MIC of the roxithromycin metal complexes with respect to parent roxithromycin.
TI  - Partial characterization of enterocin MR99 from a corn silage isolate of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - AIMS: To assess the inhibitory activity on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria of several species of enterococci recovered from a natural corn silage. METHODS AND RESULTS: The inhibitory activity of strains of Enterococcus faecalis (58), Enterococcus faecium (35), Enterococcus gallinarum (3) and Enterococcus casseliflavus (4) were studied employing indicator strains from various sources (clinical, food and ATCC). Enterococcus faecalis MR99, the only strain with inhibitory activity, inhibited other enterococci, Listeria spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium spp., Bacillus spp., Escherichia coli, Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri. The bacterium contained only one conjugative pheromone-responsive plasmid. The partially chromatography-purified MR99 enterocin (PPE) had a molecular weight of approx. 5000 Da and a pI of 6.2, was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and could be extracted in benzene and butanol. It appeared stable to adjustment of pH 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0 and was resistant to heat. Inactivation was at 15 min at 121 degrees C. Enterocin MR99 was bactericidal on strains of Listeria monocytogenes, Staph. aureus, and bovine mastitis agents, it was bacteriostatic on E. coli. Although enterocins MR99 and AS48 have inhibitory activity on Gram-negative bacilli, PCR studies demonstrated a lack of relationship between them. CONCLUSIONS: The active component had a protein nature, was resistant to heat and presented a wide inhibitory spectrum. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The biological properties of Ent. faecalis MR99 suggest that this strain merits further investigations so it can be applied in human and veterinary health programmes.
TI  - Bloodstream infections in organ transplant recipients receiving alemtuzumab: no evidence of occurrence of organisms typically associated with profound T cell depletion.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CD52, a cell surface antigen expressed on B and T lymphocytes, monocytes and NK cells. Its use results in a profound decrease in CD4 positive T lymphocytes. Alemtuzumab is used as induction immunosuppression and therapy for rejection in organ transplant recipients in some centers. We followed a cohort of 449 consecutive transplant recipients who received alemtuzumab to determine the occurrence of bloodstream infections, particularly those previously associated with decrease in CD4 positive T lymphocytes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen percent (69/449) patients had at least one episode of bloodstream infection. However, no patient had bacteremia with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, non-typhoidal Salmonella or Mycobacterium avium complex. Fungaemia was rare, occurring in 1.5% of patients. The most common organisms isolated from the blood were Staphylococcus aureus (21 episodes), coagulase negative Staphylococcus (14 episodes), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12 episodes), Enterococcus faecium (11 episodes), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 episodes), Enterococcus faecalis (9 episodes) and Escherichia coli (7 episodes). DISCUSSION: We conclude that although alemtuzumab use is associated with profound CD4 positive T lymphocyte depletion, alemtuzumab does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of bloodstream infection with pathogens typically seen in other disorders of CD4 cell depletion, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
TI  - Solid-phase synthesis of polyfunctionalized natural products: application to usnic acid, a bioactive lichen compound.
AB  
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of silver dressings: an in vitro comparison.
AB  - A range of silver-coated or -impregnated dressings are now commercially available for use but comparative data on their antimicrobial efficacies are limited. The antibacterial activities of five commercially available silver-coated/impregnated dressings were compared against nine common burn-wound pathogens, namely methicillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter baumannii and a multi-drug-efflux-positive Acinetobacter baumannii (BM4454), using a broth culture method. The rapidity and extent of killing of these pathogens under in vitro conditions were evaluated. All five silver-impregnated dressings investigated exerted bactericidal activity, particularly against Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacter species, Proteus species and E. coli. The spectrum and rapidity of action, however, ranged widely for different dressings. Acticoat and Contreet had a broad spectrum of bactericidal activities against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Contreet was characterized by a very rapid bactericidal action and achieved a reduction of > or =10,000 c.f.u. ml(-1) in the first 30 min for Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii. Other dressings demonstrated a narrower range of bactericidal activities. Understanding the characteristics of these dressings may enable them to be targeted more appropriately according to the specific requirements for use of a particular dressing, as in for prophylaxis in skin grafting or for an infected wound with MRSA.
TI  - Novel 4-N-substituted aryl pent-2-ene-1,4-dione derivatives of piperazinyloxazolidinones as antibacterials.
AB  - A few substituted piperazinylphenyloxazolidinone compounds 6-13 having substitution on the distant nitrogen atom of piperazine ring scaffold have been synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activity in Gram-positive bacteria. A few compounds showed superior in vitro antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes than linezolid and eperezolid.
TI  - Biological activities of Schefflera leucantha.
AB  - This study investigated various biological activities of the ethanolic extract of dried ground leaves of Schefflera leucantha Viguier (Araliaceae). The extract possessed very low cytotoxicity to brine-shrimp with the LC(50) of 4,111.15 microg/ml; the significant antioxidant activity on DPPH with the EC(50) of 71.90 microg/ml; the inhibitory activity on mushroom tyrosinase with the IC(50) of 10.53 mg/ml using the dopachrome microplate-assay. The extract of 5-20 mg/ml range in the agar dilution assay were active against various pathogenic microbial (11 species, 11 strains), with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 5 mg/ml against Clostridium spp.; MIC=10 mg/ml against enteropathogens as Bacteroides spp., Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Lactobacillus spp., Peptococcus spp. and Streptococcus mutans; MIC=10 mg/ml against a pneumonia causing bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae and a dermatopathogen as Propionibacterium acnes; MIC=20 mg/ml against dermatopathogens as Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Streptococcus spp. and Candida albicans ATCC 90028. TLC fingerprints of the specific extracts from the leaf powder exhibited zones of steroids-terpenes and flavonoids. HPLC fingerprint of the flavonoid extract was performed.
TI  - Activity of a new oral streptogramin, XRP2868, against gram-positive cocci harboring various mechanisms of resistance to streptogramins.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of XRP2868, a new oral streptogramin composed of a combination of RPR132552 (streptogramin A) and RPR202868 (streptogramin B), was evaluated against a collection of clinical gram-positive isolates with characterized phenotypes and genotypes of streptogramin resistance. The effects of genes for resistance to streptogramin A or B on the activity of XRP2868 and its components were also tested by cloning these genes individually or in various combinations in gram-positive recipient strains susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. The species tested included Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other species of streptococci. XRP2868 was generally fourfold more potent than quinupristin-dalfopristin against S. aureus, E. faecium, and streptococci and had activity against E. faecalis (MICs = 0.25 to 1 microg/ml). XRP2868 appeared to be affected by the same mechanisms of resistance as those to quinupristin-dalfopristin. Nevertheless, the strong activity of factor A of the oral streptogramin enabled the combination to be very potent against streptogramin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci, and E. faecium (MICs = 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml) and to retain low MICs against the strains harboring a mechanism of resistance to factor A or factor B of the streptogramin. However, the combination of mechanisms of resistance to factors A and B caused an increase in the MICs of XRP2868, which reached 1 to 4 mug/ml. As with the other streptogramins, there was a reduction in the bactericidal effect of XRPR2868 when the staphylococcal strains acquired a constitutively expressed erm gene.
TI  - Flavonoid analysis and antimicrobial activity of commercially available propolis  products.
AB  - Propolis ethanolic solutions are the most used propolis products on the market for the treatment of minor ulcers in the mouth, angina, thrush or skin infections. Since it is still an unofficial drug in pharmacy, we analyzed the contents of flavonoids in ten commercially available ethanolic solutions of propolis from the Croatian market using two complementary colorimetric methods. Antimicrobial activities, determined with the diffusion method, against six bacterial species (Bacillus subtilis NCTC 8236, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 12204, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 10536, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and one yeast-like fungus Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were compared. Results of flavonoids analysis suggested that the contents of flavones and flavonols in the products were uniform and ranged from 0.14 to 0.41%, but the content of flavanones varied greatly from 0.43 to 18.78%. Total flavonoid content, as the sum of two colorimetric methods, in propolis products was between 0.78 and 18.92%, and most products had the flavonoids content below 9%. All products with the total flavonoids content above 1% showed antimicrobial activity against the four Gram-positive bacterial species tested, and against P. aeruginosa and the yeast-like fungus C. albicans. Total flavonoids contents, expressed as the sum of two colorimetric methods, could be useful methods for estimating the flavonoid contents of propolis products. Our results indicate that the quality of commercially available propolis products requires verification.
TI  - A re-emerging class of antimicrobial agents: streptogramins (quinupristin/dalfopristin) in the management of multiresistant gram-positive nosocomial cocci in hospital setting.
AB  - Multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, are emerging pathogens in the setting of immunocompromised, hospitalized patients, especially when surgery or invasive procedures are of concern, and patients are admitted in intensive care units. The spectrum of antimicrobial compounds available for an effective treatment of these infection is significantly threatened by the emerging and spread of glycopeptide-resistant strains. Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a novel streptogramine association, which represents an effective response to most of these problems, due to its innovative mechanim of action, its maintained activity against multiresistant pathogens, and its possibility of synergistic activity with other compounds. Problems related to the epidemiology of multiresistant gram-positive infection, potential clinical indications of quinupristin/dalfopristin, and updated data on efficacy and tolerability of this compound and its derivatives, are outlined on the ground of a review of available literature evidences.
TI  - Isolation of Enterococcus faecalis from a case of nonpuerperal breast abscess.
AB  - Nonpuerperal breast abscess (NPBA) has different etiology as compared to the mastitis occurring in post partum women. The condition presents either as acute suppurative infection or chronic type. Organisms usually implicated are Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, and anaerobes. Mostly the infection is polymicrobial in nature. Herein, we report the isolation of Enterococcus faecalis from a case of acute suppurative NPBA.
TI  - Effect of triclosan on the development of bacterial biofilms by urinary tract pathogens on urinary catheters.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine (i) the effect of triclosan on the formation of catheter biofilms by urinary tract pathogens and (ii) the diffusion of triclosan through the retention balloons of urinary catheters. METHODS: Models of the catheterized bladder were infected with eight different urinary tract pathogens and the effect of triclosan on biofilm formation was assessed by determining the numbers of viable cells colonizing the catheters and by scanning electron microscopy. HPLC was used to determine the triclosan concentration in urine draining from models that had been fitted with triclosan-inflated silicone catheters. RESULTS: When catheters were inflated with triclosan (10 g/L) the formation of catheter biofilm by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis was prevented. The numbers of Enterococcus faecalis and Providencia stuartii cells colonizing catheters were also significantly reduced (P<0.05). Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, were able to produce extensive catheter biofilms in the presence of triclosan. Only P. mirabilis produced alkaline urine and encrusted the catheters. Concentrations of 0.02-0.16 mg/L of the biocide were detected in urine draining from the model over the 48 h experimental period. CONCLUSIONS: Triclosan diffused through silicone catheter balloons and produced urinary concentrations that prevented catheter encrustation by P. mirabilis and biofilm formation by several other common pathogens of the catheterized urinary tract. It had little effect on urease-producing P. aeruginosa, S. marcescens or M. morganii but these species did not produce alkaline urine or crystalline biofilms.
TI  - In vitro resistance to human platelet microbicidal protein among urethral staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates with its correlation with prostatitis.
AB  - The study was carried out to test the in vitro activity of human platelet microbicidal protein (hPMP) on most commonly isolated urethral pathogens and compare the same with clinical isolates from cases of chronic prostatitis (CP). Urethral isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n=19), coagulase negative staphylococci (n=40) and Enterococcus faecalis (n=16) from patients with or without CP were tested. The hPMP susceptibility of bacterial strains was determined by exposing bacterial cells to serial dilutions of hPMP. A significantly higher proportion of CP-strains of coagulase negative staphylococci (91.3% vs 5.88%) was resistant to hPMP than was that of non-CP strains (P S.aureus studied, 77.8% were considered resistant to the bactericidal action of hPMP. All nine CP-strains of E.faecalis were highly resistant to hPMP. Most non-CP urethral isolates of S.aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci and E.faecalis were susceptible to the bactericidal action of hPMP, while CP isolates of all species were significantly more resistant to hPMP. Data from the present study may have significant implications in understanding the pathogenesis of CP.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial activity of Cleome viscosa and Gmelina asiatica.
AB  - The ethanolic extracts of the leaves and flowers of Cleome viscosa and roots of Gmelina asiatica were tested for antimicrobial activity. The two plants exhibited a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, particularly significative against Escherichia coli , Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The leaf extract of C. viscosa showed moderate activity against pathogenic fungi.
TI  - Vancomycin resistance in gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The first vancomycin-resistant clinical isolates of Enterococcus species were reported in Europe in 1988. Similar strains were later detected in hospitals on the East Coast of the United States. Since then, vancomycin-resistant enterococci have spread with unexpected rapidity and are now encountered in hospitals in most countries. This article reviews the mode of action and the mechanism of bacterial resistance to glycopeptides, as exemplified by the VanA type, which is mediated by transposon Tn1546 and is widely spread in enterococci. The diversity, regulation, evolution, and recent dissemination of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus are then discussed.
TI  - Ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  - Although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., Escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, Enterococcus faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. Syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. To investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including E. faecalis, E. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. Streptococcus bovis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis showed increased adherence to ARH-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. Heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of S. bovis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, and S. aureus by HT-29 enterocytes (prominent syndecan-1 expression), but not Caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). Data from experiments with Chinese hamster ovary cells with altered glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. Thus, although E. faecalis, E. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical, and trauma patients.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid against key gram-positive organisms isolated in the united states: results of the LEADER 2004 surveillance program.
AB  - Since the approval of linezolid in 2000, sporadic reports of resistance have been given and a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms of resistance has been gained. However, since these developments, an updated status of the in vitro activity of linezolid against gram-positive organisms from the United States has not been reported. The LEADER 2004 surveillance initiative was undertaken to obtain current and representative data on the activity of linezolid against key species, including isolates with significant resistance phenotypes. Organisms were isolated during 2004 and included 2,872 Staphylococcus aureus, 496 coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS), 428 Enterococcus faecalis, 196 Enterococcus faecium, and 422 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. All S. aureus isolates (54.2% oxacillin resistant) were susceptible to linezolid (MIC90 = 2 microg/ml); MIC distributions were consistent, regardless of oxacillin or multidrug resistance status. For CNS, one nonsusceptible isolate was encountered (Staphylococcus epidermidis; MIC = 32 microg/ml), but overall, the MIC(90) (1 microg/ml) was lower than that obtained with S. aureus. For E. faecalis and E. faecium, 99.5% and 96.4% of isolates, respectively, were linezolid susceptible. Both species had an MIC90 of 2 microg/ml, and MIC distributions did not vary with the vancomycin susceptibility status of the populations analyzed. Linezolid nonsusceptibility was not encountered among the S. pneumoniae isolates. These findings indicate that linezolid nonsusceptibility has remained rare among staphylococci and uncommon and sporadic among enterococci. Nonetheless, careful and ongoing monitoring of the in vitro effectiveness of linezolid will be needed so that any changes to the current status may be detected as soon as possible.
TI  - Changing face of septicaemia and increasing drug resistance in blood isolates.
AB  - In a retrospective study conducted between January, 2000 and December 2000, 7157  adults and children were studied. Amongst these, 1071 patients had positive blood cultures. Of these, 575 (53.6%) cases were community acquired septicaemia and 486 (46.4%) cases had developed septicaemia of nosocomial origin. Gram negative aerobes accounted for 708 (66.1%) isolates. Amongst them, Klebsiella pneumoniae predominated (23%), followed by Escherichia coli (14%). Acinetobacter spp. emerged as the next common pathogen (9%), followed by Salmonella typhi (5.4%). Staphylococcus aureus (9%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (9%) were the most common gram positive isolates followed by Enterococcus faecalis (4.7%). Antibiotic susceptibility of all these isolates was performed by the modified Stokes' method. Both Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli showed alarmingly high resistance to all groups of antibiotics with 70-80% resistance to amoxicillin and cephalexin. Minimum resistance was observed against cefotaxime (23%) and ciprofloxacin (12%). Majority of Enterococcus faecalis were multidrug resistant. Streptococcus pneumoniae exhibited 26% resistance to penicillin. Thus, the study clearly highlights the rising level of drug resistance amongst the bacterial isolates from blood and hence the need to update and formulate newer drug policies.
TI  - Bacterial etiology of acute otitis media and clinical efficacy of amoxicillin-clavulanate versus azithromycin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common acute bacterial infection in childhood and also the most frequent reason for outpatient antibiotic therapy. Little recent information about susceptibility patterns of AOM bacterial pathogens in Turkish children has been reported. OBJECTIVE: To determine the bacterial etiology of acute otitis media in children and to compare the efficiency of 3 days course of azithromycin with a 10 days course of amoxicillin-clavulanate. METHODS: This prospective, single blind, randomised comparative study was carried out in 180 children with AOM. Paracentesis was performed for middle ear fluid culture before the first dose antibiotic therapy. Children with acute otitis media were randomised to receive either low dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (45/6.4 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for 10 days) or low dose azithromycin (10mg/kg/day for 3 days). Clinical response was assessed on days 2-4, 11-13, 26-28. RESULTS: Bacterial pathogens were isolated from 108 (60%) of 180 children. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common isolated pathogen (39.7%), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (20.7%), Moraxella catarrhalis (15.5%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.8%), Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (5.1%), Escherichia coli (3.4%) and Enterococcus faecalis (1.7%). This study demonstrated low resistance rates compared to studies of different countries. Although clinical response rates were better in patients treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate, this was not statistically significant [86.6% (78 of 90)] versus [95.2% (80 of 84)]. Success rates of amoxicillin-clavulanate were high for both S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Difference between success rates was not statistically significant (P=0.144 and 0.352). CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria were isolated in 60% of AOM cases. The clinical efficiency of amoxicillin-clavulanate was found to be equal compared to azithromycin in children with acute otitis media.
TI  - Correlation between the genetic diversity of nosocomial pathogens and their survival time in intensive care units.
AB  - Bacteria differ in their ability to survive in the hospital environment outside the human host. Species remaining viable and infectious have a higher chance of being transmitted, giving them a fitness advantage in hospitals. This differential fitness could be expected to alter the genetic population structure of bacterial populations in hospitals, and should be reflected by the relative abundance of several successful clones. The objective of this study was to test for a potential correlation between tenacity, i.e. environmental survival, and clonal abundance determined by the genetic diversity in different bacterial species from prospectively collected isolates of intensive care patients. A literature review was performed to identify mean environmental survival times for the most important pathogens in intensive care units (ICUs): Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, Acetinobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. To determine the genetic diversity of the natural population of these species in ICUs, a prospective 18-month study was conducted in five units with median nosocomial infection rates. All clinical isolates were collected, and highly discriminatory DNA fingerprinting techniques were used to identify specific clones. A diversity index for each species was calculated as the number of distinguishable genotypes in the population divided by size. The correlation between survival times and the diversity indices for the individual pathogens was investigated using non-parametric methods. Although 21 studies were identified in the literature, only two were relevant. They showed median survival times between 1.5 days (P. aeruginosa) and 60.0 days (Enterococcus faecium). During the prospective ICU study, 1264 pathogens were investigated and simple diversity indices between 49.1 (Enterococcus faecalis) and 89.8 (E. coli) were found. A correlation between survival times and the diversity indices for the individual pathogens was found (correlation coefficient 0.821, P=0.024). Environmental survival may be an important factor contributing to the ecological fitness of some nosocomial pathogens in ICUs. Infection control measures should consider this finding.
TI  - Detection and characterization of tet(M) in tetracycline-resistant Listeria strains from human and food-processing origins in Belgium and France.
AB  - In the present study, three Listeria monocytogenes strains and one Listeria innocua strain out of a collection of 241 Listeria isolates from human and food-processing sources were found to display resistance to tetracycline (TC) due to the presence of the tet(M) gene. Through sequence analysis, it was shown that tet(M) genes in two of the isolates belong to sequence homology group (SHG) II, a group comprising chromosomally encoded tet(M) genes previously found in Staphylococcus aureus and in lactobacilli. The tet(M) genes of the two other L. monocytogenes strains were associated with a member of the Tn916-Tn1545 family of conjugative transposons and were closely related to SHG III, which harbours enterococcal tet(M) genes associated with Tn916. One of these transposon-containing strains was able to transfer the tet(M) gene to Enterococcus faecalis recipient strain JH2-2. Collectively, these sequence and conjugation data indicate that the acquisition of tet(M) by Listeria strains may be triggered by successive transfers between other Gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of daptomycin tested against clinical strains of indicated species isolated in North American medical centers (2003).
AB  - Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, groups A and B beta-hemolytic streptococci, and vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis. We evaluated the daptomycin spectrum against these pathogens by testing 2759 clinical strains consecutively collected in more than 30 hospitals located across the United States and Canada. The isolates were susceptibility tested against daptomycin and many comparators by the reference broth microdilution method. Daptomycin was very active against indicated species with the highest MIC results being 1, 2, and 0.5 microg/mL for S. aureus, E. faecalis, and beta-hemolytic streptococci, respectively. All isolates tested were considered susceptible to daptomycin, according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and FDA breakpoints, and daptomycin was the most potent (lowest MIC90) among selected antimicrobials commonly used to treat Gram-positive infections. Resistance to oxacillin or vancomycin did not influence daptomycin activity against S. aureus or E. faecalis.
TI  - Control of Staphylococcus aureus in sausages by enterocin AS-48.
AB  - Results presented here are the first contribution on the anti-staphylococcal activity of bacteriocin AS-48 in a model meat sausage system. We have examined bacteriocin application, by inoculation with the enterocin AS-48 producer strain Enterococcus faecalis A-48-32 or by adding a semi-purified bacteriocin preparation. AS-48 inhibits proliferation of Staphylococcus aureus in sausages when added at concentrations of 30 or 40mug/g, achieving a significant reduction of 2 and 5.31 log units, respectively, in viable counts (CFU/g) of staphylococci with respect to the untreated control. The presence of bacteriocin also had a moderate negative effect on total lactic acid bacteria. AS-48(+) strain was developed well in the meat mixture, producing sufficient amounts of AS-48 (to a maximum of 76-88 arbitrary units/g) to control growth of staphylococci. The best result was achieved with a bacteriocinogenic strain inoculum of 10(7)CFU/g.
TI  - Pathogen occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of urinary tract infection cases during a 20-year period (1983-2002) at a single institution in Japan.
AB  - Urinary tract infections are one of the most common infectious diseases diagnosed in outpatients as well as in hospitalized patients. Recently, urinary tract infections have become more complicated and difficult to treat. Therefore, the present study analyzed the occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens isolated at Kobe University Hospital between 1983 and 2002. This study was performed with three patient groups: urology inpatients, urology outpatients, and inpatients of other departments. During the 20-year study period, we studied 15,925 urine isolates obtained from those patients who were diagnosed with urinary tract infection. Overall, Enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently isolated pathogen, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. The frequency of Staphylococcus aureus increased over time, corresponding to an increase in the occurrence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). In addition, the rate of isolation of Serratia marcescens also increased over time, especially among patients with urinary tract catheters. Our results demonstrate that the uropathogens isolated at a single institution have shown a trend of increasing resistance to various classes of antimicrobial agents. In addition, serious problems should be anticipated in the treatment of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa, fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli, and arbekacin-resistant MRSA.
TI  - Discovery of a biologically active thiostrepton fragment.
AB  - Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of several domains of the thiopeptide antibiotic thiostrepton led to the discovery of a biologically active fragment. The biological properties of this novel small organic molecule include antibiotic activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VREF) bacterial strains, as well as cytotoxic action against a number of cancer cell lines.
TI  - X-ray crystal structures of HMG-CoA synthase from Enterococcus faecalis and a complex with its second substrate/inhibitor acetoacetyl-CoA.
AB  - Biosynthesis of the isoprenoid precursor, isopentenyl diphosphate, is a critical  function in all independently living organisms. There are two major pathways for this synthesis, the non-mevalonate pathway found in most eubacteria and the mevalonate pathway found in animal cells and a number of pathogenic bacteria. An early step in this pathway is the condensation of acetyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA into HMG-CoA, catalyzed by the enzyme HMG-CoA synthase. To explore the possibility of a small molecule inhibitor of the enzyme functioning as a non-cell wall antibiotic, the structure of HMG-CoA synthase from Enterococcus faecalis (MVAS) was determined by selenomethionine MAD phasing to 2.4 A and the enzyme complexed with its second substrate, acetoacetyl-CoA, to 1.9 A. These structures show that HMG-CoA synthase from Enterococcus is a member of the family of thiolase fold enzymes and, while similar to the recently published HMG-CoA synthase structures from Staphylococcus aureus, exhibit significant differences in the structure of the C-terminal domain. The acetoacetyl-CoA binary structure demonstrates reduced coenzyme A and acetoacetate covalently bound to the active site cysteine through a thioester bond. This is consistent with the kinetics of the reaction that have shown acetoacetyl-CoA to be a potent inhibitor of the overall reaction, and provides a starting point in the search for a small molecule inhibitor.
TI  - Stability of enterocin AS-48 in fruit and vegetable juices.
AB  - Enterocin AS-48 is a candidate bacteriocin for food biopreservation. Before addressing application of AS-48 to vegetable-based foods, the interaction between AS-48 and vegetable food components and the stability of AS-48 were studied. Enterocin AS-48 had variable interactions with fruit and vegetable juices, with complete, partial, or negligible loss of activity. For some juices, loss of activity was ameliorated by increasing the bacteriocin concentration, diluting the juice, or applying a heat pretreatment. In juices obtained from cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce, green beans, celery, and avocado, AS-48 was very stable for the first 24 to 48 h of storage under refrigeration, and decay of activity was markedly influenced by storage temperature. In fresh-made fruit juices (orange, apple, grapefruit, pear, pineapple, and kiwi) and juice mixtures, AS-48 was very stable for at least 15 days at 4 degrees C, and bacteriocin activity was still detectable after 30 days of storage. Gradual and variable loss of activity occurred in juices stored at 15 and 28 degrees C; inactivation was faster at higher temperatures. In commercial fruit juices (orange, apple, peach, and pineapple) stored at 4 degrees C, the bacteriocin was completely stable for up to 120 days, and over 60% of initial activity was still present in juices stored at 15 degrees C for the same period. Commercial fruit juices stored at 28 degrees C for 120 days retained between 31.5% (apple) and 67.71% (peach) of their initial bacteriocin activity. Solutions of AS-48 in sterile distilled water were stable (120 days at 4 to 28 degrees C). Limited loss of activity was observed after mixing AS-48 with some food-grade dyes and thickening agents. Enterocin AS-48 added to lettuce juice incubated at 15 degrees C reduced viable counts of Listeria monocytogenes CECT 4032 and Bacillus cereus LWL1 to below detection limits and markedly reduced viable counts of Staphylococcus aureus CECT 976.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of 10-isobutyryloxy-8,9-epoxythymol isobutyrate.
AB  - 10-Isobutyryloxy-8,9-epoxythymol isobutyrate was found to be a major constituent  of Inula helenium and Inula royleana root cultures. The compound showed moderate antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherischia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans.
TI  - Pentadactylin: an antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of the South American bullfrog Leptodactylus pentadactylus.
AB  - Norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions were obtained from male specimens of the South American bullfrog, Leptodactylus pentadactylus and shown to contain two peptides that inhibited the growth of microorganisms. The primary structure of a previously undescribed peptide, termed pentadactylin, was established as Gly-Leu-Leu-Asp-Thr-Leu-Lys-Gly-Ala-Ala-Lys-Asn-Val-Val-Gly-Ser-Leu-Ala-Ser-Lys-V al-Met-Glu-Lys-Leu.NH2. The second peptide, which differs from pentadactylin by eight amino acid residues, is identical to fallaxin previously isolated from skin secretions of the Caribbean mountain chicken frog L. fallax. Pentadactylin inhibited the growth of reference strains of both Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus group B) but potencies were relatively low (MIC values in the range 25-200 microM). The peptide showed very low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (LD50>400 microM).
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of analgesic/ anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities of 3-substituted- 1,2,4-triazole-5-thiones.
AB  - In this study, the synthesis of a novel series of Mannich bases of 5-mercapto-3-aryl-1,2,4-triazoles is described. The structures attributed to compounds la-5e were elucidated using IR and 1H-NMR spectroscopic techniques besides elemental analysis. The formation of 1-aminomethyl-3-substituted-1,2,4-triazole-5-thiones - not the isomeric 3-substituted-4-aminomethyl-1,2,4-triazole-5-thiones was unambiguously confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis of 1c. The compounds were examined for their in vivo anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity in two different bioassays, namely carrageenan-induced hind paw edema and p-benzoquinone-induced abdominal constriction tests in mice, respectively. In addition, the ulcerogenic effects of the compounds were determined. Among the tested derivatives most promising results were obtained for the compounds bearing a nonsubstituted phenyl group at C-3 position of the triazole ring (1a-e). The compounds were also evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against a series of gram positive bacteria [Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212)], gram negative bacteria [Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853)] and yeast-like microorganisms [Candida albicans (ATCC 90028), C. krusei (ATCC 6258), C. parapsilosis (ATCC 22019)]. One series of the examined compounds (3a-e) exhibited better antibacterial activity especially against gram positive bacteria than against gram negative bacteria. Compounds 2c, 3b, and 3e were found to be more effective against C. parapsilosis compared with the other derivatives (MIC: 16 microg/mL).
TI  - Bloodstream infections in pediatric patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Blood stream infection (BSI) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. This study aims to describe the clinical, microbiological characteristics and outcome of BSI in pediatric patients. METHODS: We collected the clinical data from all pediatric patients with positive blood cultures. We identified all isolates from these patients from January 2004 to December 2004 at King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and determined antimicrobial susceptibilities by MicroScan Walk Away 96 (Dade Behring Inc., West Sacramento, CA95691, USA). RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty pediatric patients had BSI, of whom 147 (67%) were males and 71 (32.2%) were from intensive care units (ICUs). Two hundred and ten (95.4%) had single blood culture isolate. One hundred and seventy-three (78.6%) of the isolates were Gram positive bacteria and included the following: Staphylococcus epidermidis (55.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (9.5%) of which 14% were methicillin resistant, Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) (4.5%), 40% of which were resistant to penicillin and Enterococcus faecalis (4%). Gram negative bacteria were 44 (20%) and included Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K.pneumoniae) (3.6% each). Three isolates (1.3%) were Candida glabrata. None of the Gram positive isolates were vancomycin resistant. Three K.pneumoniae and one Pseudomonas spp. isolates were multiresistant. One hundred and ninety-four (88%) of BSI isolates were hospital acquired. Fever was the most common presentation of pediatric patients (26%) with positive blood culture with no apparent focus of infection. Respiratory tract infections 26 (12%) were the next most common. We seen sepsis in (7.7%) children between 8 days and 6 months of age. Bone and joint infections, cardiac, renal, gastrointestinal diseases, malignancy and surgical cases were other associated clinical diagnoses of BSI in pediatric patients. Patients with immuno- suppressive disorders with BSI had isolates such as Salmonella spp., S. pneumoniae and Pseudomonas spp. Overall mortality was 13 (6%) (p<0.005) and those patients had underlying serious medical conditions with associated risk factors such as prolonged hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, indwelling catheterization, mechanical ventilation and prior antimicrobial use. CONCLUSION: Bloodstream infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. Risk factors for hospital acquired infection include: prematurity, prolonged hospitalization, ICU admission, indwelling catheterization, mechanical ventilation and prior antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - The safety of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement in patients with existing ventriculoperitoneal shunts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because the insertion of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes (PEG) involves disruption of the gastrointestinal tract with potential peritoneal contamination, patients with indwelling ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts could be at increased risk of meningitis, a potentially devastating infection. The safety of PEG placement in the presence of a VP shunt is unclear. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed that included all adult patients with existing VP shunts requiring PEG placement at a single university medical center over an approximate 9-year period from July 1995 to March 2004. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients who underwent PEG placement 2-564 days after shunt placement were identified. Two patients (5%) subsequently developed meningitis. Cerebrospinal fluid cultures demonstrated Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. These infections occurred 2 and 15 months after PEG placement, respectively. At the time of PEG placement, 17 patients (44%) were receiving antibiotics for reasons other than operative prophylaxis, and 11 patients (28%) received prophylactic antibiotics. Both infected patients had received antibiotics at the time of PEG placement. CONCLUSIONS: These data constitute the largest series of patients with existing VP shunts undergoing PEG placement reported to date. When compared with the published 2%-5% infection rate for patients with VP shunts alone, our data do not suggest an increased risk of infection for patients after PEG placement. As the total number of adult patients requiring a PEG after VP shunt placement is low, multicenter studies should be carried out to better stratify this risk.
TI  - Pulvinones as bacterial cell wall biosynthesis inhibitors.
AB  - Pulvinones were synthesized (>180) in arrays and evaluated as inhibitors of early stage cell wall biosynthesis enzymes MurA-MurD. Several pulvinones inhibited Mur enzymes with IC(50)'s in the 1-10 microg/mL range and demonstrated antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphyloccus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Detection of a novel aph(2") allele (aph[2"]-Ie) conferring high-level gentamicin resistance and a spectinomycin resistance gene ant(9)-Ia (aad 9) in clinical isolates of enterococci.
AB  - Aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AMEs) are major factors that confer aminoglycoside resistance to enterococci. In an epidemiologic study on distribution of 12 AME genes in 534 recent clinical strains isolated from a Japanese hospital, two uncommon AME genes, ant(9)-Ia and a novel aph(2") allele, aph(2")-Ie, were detected. ant(9)-Ia had been reported only in Staphylococcus aureus and encodes spectinomycin adenylyltransferase ANT(9)-I, which confers resistance to spectinomycin. The ant(9)-Ia gene was detected in three strains, a single strain each of Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and E. avium. Nucleotide sequences of ant(9)-Ia from these three enterococcal species were identical to that reported for S. aureus and considered to be located on Tn 554. The new aph(2") allele, designated aph(2")-Ie, was identified in three E. faecium strains. The aph(2")-Ie allele was genetically close to aph(2")-Id reported in E. casseliflavus (93.7% amino acid sequence identity; 96.3% similarity), while distant from aph(2")-Ia, aph(2")-Ib, or aph(2")-Ic (26.3-29.5% amino acid sequence identity). Sequence divergence between APH(2")-Id and APH(2")-Ie was mostly located in amino-terminal half. In contrast, sequences corresponding to the three motifs required for aminoglycoside phosphotransferase were conserved except for a single amino acid. Three E. faecium strains having aph(2")-Ie showed high-level resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin, but not to kanamycin, dibekacin, and tobramycin, unlike enzyme specificity described for aph(2")-Id in E. casseliflavus. Such a difference in resistance phenotype was suggested to be related to amino acid sequence divergence between APH(2")-Id and APH(2")-Ie.
TI  - Cationic peptide of the male reproductive tract, HE2alpha, displays antimicrobial activity against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyse the in vitro antimicrobial effects of synthetic HE2alpha peptide against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. METHODS: The HE2alpha peptide was synthesized based on the C-terminal sequence of the HE2alpha protein. The bacterial strains tested included two antibiotic-susceptible strains of N. gonorrhoeae and four antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates, as well as S. aureus ATCC 29213 and E. faecalis ATCC 29212. Susceptibility determinations were carried out either in 0.7% casamino acids for N. gonorrhoeae isolates or in 10 mM phosphate buffer for S. aureus and E. faecalis strains. Antibacterial effects were measured in a dose- and time-dependent manner. After exposure to the peptide in solution, the number of viable cells was determined by counting colony forming units (cfu). RESULTS: The HE2alpha peptide exhibited time- and dose-dependent antibacterial effects on all N. gonorrhoeae isolates tested. S. aureus and E. faecalis strains were also susceptible to the peptide. All strains tested were susceptible to the peptide at high concentrations (50 or 100 mg/L) and some strains were susceptible to a peptide concentration of 25 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: The peptide HE2alpha, which is derived from the male urogenital tract, exhibits antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens in vitro. The peptide is active against both antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant N. gonorrhoeae isolates. Further investigation of the antimicrobial properties of the peptide is warranted.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of SM-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - SM-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. In agar dilution susceptibility testing, the MIC of SM-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains tested (MIC(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. SM-216601 was also very potent against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (MIC(90) = 8 microg/ml). SM-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, with MIC(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The therapeutic efficacy of SM-216601 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by S. aureus, E. faecium, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. Thus, SM-216601 is a promising candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.
TI  - [Bacteriological surveillance in a burn intensive care unit and the analysis of bacterial resistance to antibiotics].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the dynamic changes of the bacterial flora in our burn  intensive care unit (ICU) in the past 6 years, and to analyze resistance of bacteria to various antibiotics. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of bacterial culture and drug-sensitivity results from 209 patients in our burn intensive care unit during a period of 1998 to 2003 was carried out. RESULTS: Eight hundred and forty-five strains of bacteria were isolated from 209 specimens, among which 486 strains were gram negative (G(-)) (57.51%), and 339 were gram positive (G(+)) (40.12%). Among all the G(+) bacteria, Enterococcus faecalis accounted for 34.51%, Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 31.27%, and 72.64% of Staphylococcus aureus strains were MRSA. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was predominant among all G(-) bacteria, and it accounted for 66.26% of the latter. All the bacteria isolated showed multiple resistance to antibiotics. CONCLUSION: G(-) bacilli were still predominant in our burn intensive care unit. The isolated bacteria exhibited multiple resistance to antibiotics. The results imply that antibiotics should be administered rationally in the burn wards guided by the bacterial resistance test.
TI  - Disinfection of gutta-percha cones with chlorhexidine and sodium hypochlorite.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of chlorhexidine (CHX) or sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) in disinfecting gutta-percha cones, to verify contamination of gutta-percha cones in their boxes, and to identify microorganisms after intentional contamination by handling cones. STUDY DESIGN: Gutta-percha cones contaminated in vitro with several microorganisms were left in contact with tested disinfecting solutions for different times, sterility of storage boxes was evaluated by immersing cones in broth medium, and the microorganisms most frequently found in handling cones were identified using biochemical tests. RESULTS: CHX was not effective in eliminating Bacillus subtilis spores on gutta-percha cones after 72 h of contact with the disinfecting substance. 5.25% NaOCl eliminated spores from gutta-percha after 1 min of disinfection. The cones evaluated from their boxes did not show contamination in 94.5% of the cases. The microbial genus most frequently found after intentional contamination with gloves was Staphylococcus. CONCLUSION: 5.25% NaOCl is an effective agent for a rapid disinfection of gutta-percha cones.
TI  - Bacteriology of surgical wound infections in a tertiary care hospital in Turkey.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the spectrum of the pathogens cultured from surgical wound infections and assess their antimicrobial drug resistances. DESIGN: Laboratory-based retrospective study for the five year period. SETTING: A four hundred bed, tertiary-care university hospital in Turkey. RESULTS: Overall 621 pathogens were identified from January 1999 to January 2004. Of these isolates, 431 (69%) were gram-positive, 178 (29%) were gram-negative bacteria and also 12 (2%) were identified as Candida albicans. The most common organism was Staphylococcus aureus (50%), followed by Escherichia coli (8%), Streptococcus pyogenes (7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (6%), Enterococcus faecalis (4%), Enterobacter spp. (4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), Acinetobacter spp. (3%), Proteus spp. (3%), group B. B-haemolytic streptococci (2%), Candida albicans (2%), and Citrobacter spp. (1%). The rate of resistance to methicillin in staphylococci and multidrug resistance in S. aureus were 31% and 12%, respectively. There was no increase in resistance to methicillin by years. Piperacillin/tazobactam, sefoperazone/sulbactam, carbapenems, ofloxacin and amikacin were the most active agents against gram-negative isolates. The rates of extended spectrum beta-lactamase production in K. pneumoniae and E. coli strains were determined as 14%, and 6%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is emerging as a major pathogen in surgical wound infections. We concluded that antimicrobial treatment of surgical wound infections should include empiric coverage for MRSA. The surveillance of resistance in pathogens causing surgical wound infections is necessary to promote the appropriate therapeutic choices for these infections.
TI  - Intestinal protozoa and associated bacteria in captive houbara bustards (Chlamydotis undulata) in the United Arab Emirates.
AB  - A protozoal survey was carried out in 114 captive houbara bustards (Chlamydotis undulata) in the United Arab Emirates. Trichomonas gallinarum, Chilomastix gallinarum, Giardia spp. and Lophomonas spp. were detected from faecal samples of 49 (43%) captive houbara bustards. Culture and identification studies were carried out to assess associated bacteria. The bacteria isolated from birds negative to protozoa included Enterococcus spp., Aerococcus spp., Micrococci spp., Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp., while Enterococcus spp., Micrococci kristinae, Aerococcus spp., Staphylococcus sciuri, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and Alcaligenes faecalis were isolated from protozoa positive birds. Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., E. coli , Klebsiella spp., Aerococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. are considered part of the normal intestinal bacterial flora of captive bustards and they were also isolated from the food items used to feed the captive bustards. S. sciuri possibly originated from ingested mice; Alcaligenes faecalis and Micrococcus spp. are contaminants from soil or water.
TI  - Analysis of antibiotic susceptibility and resistance of leg ulcer bacterial flora in patients hospitalized at Dermatology Department, Poznan University Hospital.
AB  - Effective treatment of frequently infected, poorly healing wounds such as leg ulcers due to chronic venous insufficiency poses a major clinical problem. Antibiotic resistance in dermatology patients, especially those with non-healing leg ulcers, is a widespread phenomenon. Various antibiotics, mainly broad-spectrum agents, are frequently and sometimes inappropriately prescribed, which often leads to the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria strains. The aim of this study was to analyze antibiotic susceptibility and resistance of bacterial isolates cultured from leg ulcers. Wound swabs were obtained from patients admitted to Dermatology Department, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, during the 1998-2002 period. Bacteriologic diagnosis of 175 wound swabs was performed in compliance with compulsory laboratory methods. The analysis yielded 173 positive results, predominated by Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Bacterial isolates were evaluated for resistance to commonly used antibiotics, taking into consideration the presence of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains. Antibiotic resistance profiles were compared between the years 1998 and 2002, with detailed account of clinical characteristics and history of leg ulcers disease. The study pointed to an increasing tendency of antibiotic resistance in the study group of patients.
TI  - Bacterial flora of leg ulcers in patients admitted to Department of Dermatology,  Poznan University of Medical Sciences, during the 1998-2002 period.
AB  - Venous leg ulcers are an important cause of morbidity in a significant percentage of the world population. The percentage of leg ulceration, either active or healed, in the European population is about 1%-2%. The aim of this study was to analyze the rate of colonization and qualitative composition of the bacterial flora isolated from leg ulcers in patients admitted to Dermatology Department, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, during the 1998-2002 period, with special reference to the infection risk factors. Bacteriological diagnosis of 175 wound swabs was performed in compliance with compulsory laboratory methods. In 173 positive results, the predominant culture composition included Staphylococcus aureus (56.57%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (37.14%), Enterococcus faecalis (22.29%), Proteus mirabilis (13.71%) and Escherichia coli (12.57%). There was a significant increase in the incidence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli, along with a decrease in the incidence of Staphylococcus aureus isolation during the study period. The rate of yeast-like fungi strains, mainly Candida albicans, recorded in culture composition showed a systematic increase. Changes in the qualitative and quantitative composition of bacterial flora, presence of multiple isolates, and concomitant diseases that may influence the characteristics of leg ulcer disease were closely monitored.
TI  - Triketones active against antibiotic-resistant bacteria: synthesis, structure-activity relationships, and mode of action.
AB  - A series of acylated phloroglucinols and triketones was synthesized and tested for activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) and multi-drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB). A tetra-methylated triketone with a C12 side chain was the most active compound (MIC of around 1.0 microg/ml against MRSA) and was shown to stimulate oxygen consumption by resting cell suspensions, suggesting that the primary target was the cytoplasmic membrane.
TI  - Is the use o f Gunnera perpensa extracts in endometritis related to antibacterial activity?
AB  - Rhizome extracts of Gunnera perpensa are used in traditional remedies in South Africa to treat endometritis both in humans and animals. An investigation was undertaken to determine whether this plant possesses antibacterial activity, which may explain its efficacy. Gunnera perpensa rhizome extracts were prepared serially with solvents of increasing polarity and tested for antibacterial activity. Test bacteria included the Gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus and the Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A moderate to weak level of antibacterial activity in most of the extracts resulted, with the best minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 2.61 mg ml(-1) shown by the acetone extract against S. aureus. The extracts were also submitted to the brine shrimp assay to detect possible toxic or pharmacological effects. All the extracts were lethal to the brine shrimp larvae at a concentration of 5 mg ml(-1). The acetone extract was extremely toxic at 1 mg ml(-1), with some toxicity evident at 0.1 mg ml(-1). The remainder of the extracts generally displayed little activity at concentrations lower than 5 mg ml(-1). In summary, the results indicate that although the extracts demonstrated a level of pharmacological activity, the relatively weak antibacterial activity is unlikely to justify the use of G. perpensa rhizomes in the traditional treatment of endometritis. Rather, the slightly antibacterial nature of the rhizomes may contribute to an additive effect, along with their known uterotonic activity, to the overall efficacy of the preparation.
TI  - Tigecycline MIC testing by broth dilution requires use of fresh medium or addition of the biocatalytic oxygen-reducing reagent oxyrase to standardize the test method.
AB  - Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum glycylcycline antibiotic with activity against not only susceptible gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens but also strains that are resistant to many other antibiotics. In the process of determining quality control (QC) limits for the American Type Culture Collection reference strains for tigecycline, a number of inconsistencies in MICs were encountered which appeared to be related to the age of the Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB) medium used in the MIC testing. The objective of this study was to determine the cause of the discrepant MIC results between fresh and aged MHB. The MICs of tigecycline were determined in MHB that was either prepared fresh (<12 h old), prepared and stored at 4 degrees C, stored at room temperature, stored anaerobically, or supplemented with the biocatalytic oxygen-reducing reagent Oxyrase. When tested in fresh media, tigecycline was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against the CLSI-recommended QC strains compared to aged media (MICs of 0.03 to 0.25 and 0.12 to 0.5 mug/ml, respectively). Media aged under anaerobic conditions prior to testing or supplemented with Oxyrase resulted in MICs similar to those obtained in fresh medium (MICs of 0.03 to 0.12 and 0.03 to 0.25 mug/ml, respectively). Time-kill kinetics demonstrated a >3 log(10) difference in viable growth when tigecycline was tested in fresh or Oxyrase-supplemented MHB compared to aged MHB. High-pressure liquid chromatography analysis revealed the accumulation of an early peak (oxidative by-product of tigecycline) to be 3.5% in fresh media and 25.1% in aged media after 24 h and that addition of Oxyrase prevented the accumulation of this oxidized by-product. These results suggested that the activity of tigecycline was affected by the amount of dissolved oxygen in the media. The use of fresh MHB or supplementation with Oxyrase resulted in a more standardized test method for performing MIC tests with tigecycline.
TI  - A study on inhibitory effects of Sigla tree (Liquidambar orientalis Mill. var. orientalis) storax against several bacteria.
AB  - In this study, Sigla (Liquidambar orientalis Mill.) storax (styrax) was investigated for antibacterial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, B. brevis, B. cereus, B. megaterium, B. subtilis, Corynebacterium xerosis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Yersinia enterocolitica. The storax was dissolved in absolute ethanol and was tested at concentrations of 10.0%, 1.0%, 0.4%, 0.2% and 0.1%. Pure ethanol was used for the control. The antibacterial activity of the Sigla storax was determined by using the agar diffusion method. The growths of A. hydrophila, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. megaterium, E. coli, E. coli O157:H7, L. monocytogenes and Y. enterocolitica were not inhibited by any of the concentrations of Sigla storax. The results showed that Sigla storax has antibacterial activity against many bacteria at concentrations of 10.0% and against some bacteria at concentrations of 1.0%, 0.4% and 0.2%.
TI  - Rationale for using Peltophorum africanum (Fabaceae) extracts in veterinary medicine.
AB  - Peltophorum africanum (Fabaceae) is a deciduous tree widespread in southern Africa. The plant has many ethnomedical and ethnoveterinary uses. Root and bark decoctions are used to treat diarrhoea, dysentery, sore throat, wounds, back and joint pains, HIV-AIDS, venereal diseases and infertility. Pastoralists and rural farmers use the root and bark extracts to treat diarrhoea, dysentery, infertility, and to promote well-being and resistance to diseases in cattle. To evaluate these ethnobotanical leads, dried leaves, stem bark and root bark were extracted with ethanol, acetone, dichloromethane and hexane. Polyphenols in the extract were determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method with gallic acid as standard. Qualitative antioxidant activity was screened by spraying thin layer chromatograms (TLC) of the extracts with 0.2% 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH), and quantified with Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assay. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and total antibacterial activity (TAA) were determined by serial microplate dilution for Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis, with gentamicin as standard and tetrazolium violet as growth indicator. Acetone and ethanol extracted the largest quantity of material. Polyphenols concentration was 49.2% in acetone extract of the root and 3.8% in dichloromethane extract of the leaf. Antioxidant activity of at least 5 antioxidant compounds as measured by TEAC ranged from 1.34 (ethanol extract of the root) to 0.01 (hexane extract of the leaf). The total antibacterial activity (volume to which active compounds present in 1 g plant material can be diluted and still inhibit bacterial growth) was 1263 ml/g for ethanol extract of the root against S. aureus, and 800 ml/g for acetone extract of the root against P. aeruginosa. There was substantial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with MIC values of 0.08 mg/ml for S. aureus and 0.16 mg/ml for P. aeruginosa. There is therefore a rationale for the traditional use of root and bark of P. africanum in treating bacterial infection related diseases.
TI  - PD-140248 (Parke-Davis & Co).
AB  - PD-140248 is an isomerase inhibitor and topoisomerase II inhibitor under development by Parke-Davis and Co as a potential treatment for bacterial infection. Although no details of active development have been published in the scientific literature since 1996, in September 1999, the company confirmed that PD-140248 is still in active development [338530]. The compound is one of two new pyrrolidinyl naphthyridines (the other compound being PD-131628) with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, including activity against quinolone-resistant bacteria. PD-140248 demonstrates strong in vitro activity, particularly against Gram-positive bacteria, such as quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (S aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S epidermidis), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (S haemolyticus), methicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant S aureus, Streptococcus species, Streptococcus pneumoniae (S pneumoniae) and Enterococcus faecalis (E faecalis). An MIC90 value of 0.015 microg/ml was obtained against Haemophilus influenzae (H influenzae) and Moraxella catarrhalis [160129]. The (3R,1S) enantiomer, PD-140248, demonstrated a 1- to 10-fold enhanced activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms in vitro and in vivo compared to its stereoisomers, and has thus been targeted for further preclinical studies [133377].
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against 6792 Gram-negative and Gram-positive clinical isolates from the global Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST Program, 2004).
AB  - Tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antibiotic, has shown promising in vitro activity against many common pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains. To determine the activity of tigecycline against a broad range of pathogens from diverse populations and geographic areas, the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST Program) commenced in 2003. This study evaluated the activity of tigecycline and commonly used antimicrobials against 6792 clinical isolates from 40 study centers in 11 countries. Tigecycline was the most active agent tested against Gram-positive facultative species including multidrug-resistant strains. MIC90 results (microg/mL) for tigecycline against Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.12, 0.12, 0.25, and 0.25 microg/mL, respectively. Tigecycline was active against Enterobacteriaceae with an MIC90 of 1 microg/mL. Haemophilus influenzae was very susceptible to tigecycline with an MIC90 of only 0.25 microg/mL. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the least susceptible organism tested against tigecycline. Tigecycline appears to be a promising new glycylcycline agent for the treatment of many types of pathogens with varying resistance phenotypes.
TI  - Solid- and vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of six essential oils: susceptibility of selected foodborne bacterial and fungal strains.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of essential oils (EOs) of cinnamon (Cinnamon zeylanicum), clove (Syzygium aromaticum), basil (Ocimum basillicum), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), dill (Anethum graveolens), and ginger (Zingiber officinalis) was evaluated over a range of concentrations in two types of contact tests (solid and vapor diffusion). The EOs were tested against an array of four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes), four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella choleraesuis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three fungi (a yeast, Candida albicans, and two molds, Penicillium islandicum and Aspergillus flavus). The rationale for this work was to test the possibility of creating a protective atmosphere by using natural compounds that could extend the shelf life of packaged foodstuffs while minimizing organoleptic alterations. In the solid diffusion tests, cinnamon and clove gave the strongest (and very similar) inhibition, followed by basil and rosemary, with dill and ginger giving the weakest inhibition. The fungi were the most sensitive microorganisms, followed by the Gram-positive bacterial strains. The Gram-negative strain P. aeruginosa was the least inhibited. The composition of the atmosphere generated by the EOs, and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were determined using a disk volatilization method, in which no inhibition from rosemary or basil was observed. Cinnamon and clove, once again, gave similar results for every microorganism. As a general rule, MIC (fungi) << MIC (bacteria) with no clear differences between Gram-positive or -negative strains except for P. aeruginosa, which was not inhibited by any of the EOs in the vapor phase. The atmosphere generated from the EOs was analyzed by means of solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry. Differences among the volatiles in the EOs, which may be responsible for the differences in their antimicrobial performances, were found.
TI  - Characterization of a 3944 Da bacteriocin, produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST15, with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain ST15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as Enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 Da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Acinetobacter baumanii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus caprinus. Bacteriocin ST15 is inactivated by proteinase K, pronase, pepsin, protease and Triton X-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, Triton X-100, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea and EDTA. No change in activity was recorded after 2 h at pH values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100 degrees C for 90 min. Activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees C for 20 min. The mode of activity is bactericidal. The highest level of activity (51200 AU ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in MRS broth, pH 6.5. Bacteriocin ST15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for Enterococcus spp. by being active against Gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.
TI  - Active membrane transport and receptor proteins from bacteria.
AB  - A general strategy for the expression of bacterial membrane transport and receptor genes in Escherichia coli is described. Expression is amplified so that the encoded proteins comprise 5-35% of E. coli inner membrane protein. Depending upon their topology, proteins are produced with RGSH6 or a Strep tag at the C-terminus. These enable purification in mg quantities for crystallization and NMR studies. Examples of one nutrient uptake and one multidrug extrusion protein from Helicobacter pylori are described. This strategy is successful for membrane proteins from H. pylori, E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Microbacterium liquefaciens, Brucella abortus, Brucella melitensis, Campylobacter jejuni, Neisseria meningitides, Streptomyces coelicolor and Rhodobacter sphaeroides.
TI  - Garlic natural health products exhibit variable constituent levels and antimicrobial activity against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The composition of 19 garlic natural health products (NHPs) and fresh garlic extracts were determined, as was their antibacterial activity. The 19 NHPs and 5 fresh garlic extract standards were analysed for their principal active constituents. They were also extracted for 5, 10 or 15 min in water to fresh garlic equivalents of 200 mg/mL. The extract's minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) against three indicator microorganisms (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) were determined by the broth microdilution method. While 47% of the aqueous garlic NHP extracts exhibited activity against N. gonorrhoeae, only 16% of the aqueous extracts inhibited S. aureus or E. faecalis at all three timepoints. Generally, products with high antimicrobial activity contained higher levels of garlic constituents with comparable activity to fresh garlic extracts, while products with marginal antibacterial activity often contained lower concentrations of constituents than their product labels indicated. Different extraction times affected antibacterial activity only against N. gonorrhoeae and tended to be correlated with levels of allicin. Thus, many extracts showed discrepancies in both composition, allicin:alliin ratio and antimicrobial activity, raising concerns as to standards of preparation and quality control for these products.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of Fill Canal, Sealapex, Mineral Trioxide Aggregate, Portland cement and EndoRez.
AB  - AIM: To determine in vitro the antimicrobial activity of Fill Canal, Sealapex, Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA), Portland cement and EndoRez on various species of microorganisms. METHODOLOGY: The diffusion method on Muller-Hinton agar (MH) was employed. A base layer was made using MH agar and five wells were made by removing agar at equidistant points. Sealers were placed into the wells immediately after manipulation. The microorganisms Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were seeded by pour plate. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Aliquots of 10 mL of 0.05% triphenyltetrazolium chloride gel were added for optimization and the zones of inhibition were measured. RESULTS: Sealapex and Fill Canal demonstrated antimicrobial activity for all strains. For MTA and Portland cement, only E. coli was not inhibited. No antimicrobial activity was detected for EndoRez. CONCLUSIONS: In this laboratory study, Fill Canal, Sealapex, MTA and Portland cement presented antimicrobial activity whilst EndoRez did not.
TI  - Repeat infective endocarditis: differentiating relapse from reinfection.
AB  - Repeat infective endocarditis due to the same species can represent relapse of the initial infection or a new infection. We used time-based clinical criteria and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis-based molecular criteria to classify 13 cases of repeat infective endocarditis as either relapse or reinfection. The agreement between clinical and molecular criteria was imperfect (agreement in 10 [77%] of 13 cases).
TI  - Identification of essential genes in Streptococcus pneumoniae by allelic replacement mutagenesis.
AB  - To find potential targets of novel antimicrobial agents, we identified essential  genes of Streptococcus pneumoniae using comparative genomics and allelic replacement mutagenesis. We compared the genome of S. pneumoniae R6 with those of Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus, and selected 693 candidate target genes with > 40% amino acid sequence identity to the corresponding genes in at least two of the other species. The 693 genes were disrupted and 133 were found to be essential for growth. Of these, 32 encoded proteins of unknown function, and we were able to identify orthologues of 22 of these genes by genomic comparisons. The experimental method used in this study is easy to perform, rapid and efficient for identifying essential genes of bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Peptides selected for binding to a virulent strain of Haemophilus influenzae by phage display are bactericidal.
AB  - Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is an obligate parasite of the oropharynx of humans, in whom it commonly causes mucosal infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, and bronchitis. We used a subtractive phage display approach to affinity select for peptides binding to the cell surface of a novel invasive NTHi strain R2866 (also called Int1). Over half of the selected phage peptides tested were bactericidal toward R2866 in a dose-dependent manner. Five of the clones encoded the same peptide sequence (KQRTSIRATEGCLPS; clone hi3/17), while the remaining four clones encoded unique peptides. All of the bactericidal phage peptides but one were cationic and had similar physical-chemical properties. Clone hi3/17 possessed a similar level of activity toward a panel of clinical NTHi isolates and H. influenzae type b strains but lacked bactericidal activity toward gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative (Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enterica) bacteria. These data indicate that peptides binding to bacterial surface structures isolated by phage display may prove of value in developing new antibiotics.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of some cyclic organobismuth(III) compounds.
AB  - Bismuth compounds are known for their low levels of toxicity in mammals, and various types of bismuth salts have been used to treat medical disorders. As part of our program to probe this aspect of bismuth chemistry, cyclic organobismuth compounds 1 to 8 bearing a nitrogen or sulfur atom as an additional ring member have been synthesized, and their antimicrobial activities against five standard strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were assessed. The eight-membered-ring compounds, compounds 1 to 3, exhibited MICs of less than 0.5 microg/ml against Staphylococcus aureus and were more active than the six-membered ones, compounds 5 to 8 (MICs, 4.0 to 16 microg/ml). The gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterococcus faecalis) were more susceptible to both types of ring compounds than the gram-negative ones (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Treatment with polymyxin B nonapeptide increased the susceptibility of E. coli to cyclic organobismuth compounds, indicating the low permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria to the compounds. Compound 1 also had activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus, which had an MIC for 90% of the hospital stock strains of 1.25 microg/ml. The killing curves for S. aureus treated with compound 1 or 3 revealed a static effect at a low dose (2x the MIC). However, when S. aureus was treated with 10x the MIC of compound 1 or 3, there was an approximately 3-log reduction in the viable cell number after 48 h of treatment. Electron microscopic inspection demonstrated a considerable increase in the size of S. aureus and the proportion of cells undergoing cell division after treatment with compound 1 at 0.5x the MIC.
TI  - Nosocomial infections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci at a university hospital in Taiwan from 1991 to 2003: resistance trends, antibiotic usage and in vitro activities of newer antimicrobial agents.
AB  - A rapid increase of nosocomial methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection (from 39% in 1991 to 75% in 2003) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) (from 1.2% in 1996 to 6.1% in 2003) at a university hospital in Taiwan was found. The noticeable rise of MRSA and VRE was significantly correlated with the increased consumption of glycopeptides, beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems and fluoroquinolones (Pearson's correlation coefficient, P < 0.05). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 100 non-duplicate blood isolates of MRSA (in 2003) and of 25 non-duplicate isolates of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and 172 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (in 1996-2003) causing nosocomial infection recovered from various clinical specimens of patients treated at the hospital to nine antimicrobial agents were determined by the agar dilution method. All of these isolates were susceptible to linezolid and were inhibited by 0.5mg/L of tigecycline, and all MRSA isolates were inhibited by daptomycin 1mg/L, including two isolates of MRSA with heteroresistance to vancomycin. Daptomycin had two-fold better activity against vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (MIC90, 2 mg/L) than against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (MIC90, 4 mg/L). Decreased susceptibilities of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and MRSA to quinupristin/dalfopristin (non-susceptibility 25% and 8%, respectively) were found. Telithromycin had poor activity against the isolates tested (MIC90, 8 mg/L). Linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline may represent therapeutic options for infections caused by these resistant Gram-positive organisms.
TI  - [Microbiological external quality assurance program (MEQAP)--evaluation of results obtained in sanitary epidemiological laboratories in 2002].
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate reliability of identification and determination of sensitivity to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics of some Gram positive cocci strains in 34 sanitary-epidemiological stations. All laboratories engaged in this study received 3 strains: S. aureus (S. aureus SC+ CF+, resistant to methicillin., or S. aureus SC - CF+, sensitive to methicillin), coagulase-negative staphylococci (S. epidermidis or S. haemolyticus or S. saprophyticus) and Enterococcus sp. (E. faecalis HLAR-positive or E. faecalis HLAR-negative or E. faecium or E. gallinarum). All these strains previously were identified in Department of Bacteriology of National Institute of Hygiene. Of the 68 staphylococci strains tested, 66 isolates were correctly identified. Among the 34 enterococcal strains studied the greatest difficulty in identification was caused by E. gallinarum strain--(8 out of 13 strains were incorrectly recognised). The determination of the sensitivity of the control strains to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents, generally was performed correctly in accordance with to the NCCLS and national recommendations. Some incorrect results of the antibiograms were caused by an erroneous interpretation of the zones of inhibition.
TI  - Structure--antimicrobial activity of some natural isocoumarins and their analogues.
AB  - Three naturally occurring isocoumarins (paepalantine, paepalantine 9-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and paepalantine 9-O-beta-D-allopyranosyl(1 --> 6) glucopyranoside) and two semi-synthetic analogues, 9,10-acylated compound and 9-OH-10-methylated compound, structurally similar to paepalantine, were evaluated for antimicrobial activity using a spectrophotometric microdilution technique. The paepalantine was active against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and E. faecalis while the other four compounds proved ineffective against all microorganisms tested at concentrations of 500 microg/ml. Variations in phenolic substitution at OH-9 and/or OH-10 in the paepalantine molecule resulted in compounds without antimicrobial activity. A combination of structural features, two phenolic groups as cathecolic system, forms an oxygenated system arrangement that may reflect the potentially antimicrobial properties of paepalantine.
TI  - Bloodstream infection after umbilical cord blood transplantation using reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation for adult patients.
AB  - Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a significant problem after cord blood transplantation (CBT). However, little information has been reported on BSI after reduced-intensity CBT (RI-CBT). We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 102 patients. The median age of the patients was 55 years (range, 17-79 years). Preparative regimens comprised fludarabine 125 to 150 mg/m 2 , melphalan 80 to 140 mg/m 2 , or busulfan 8 mg/kg and total body irradiation 2 to 8 Gy. Prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease comprised cyclosporin or tacrolimus. BSI developed within 100 days of RI-CBT in 32 patients. The cumulative incidence of BSI was 25% at day 30 and 32% at day 100. The median onset was day 15 (range, 1-98 days). Causative organisms included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 12), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 11), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 6), Enterococcus faecium (n = 4), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 4), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 4), and others (n = 7). Of the 32 patients with BSI, 25 (84%) died within 100 days after RI-CBT. BSI was the direct cause of death in 8 patients (25%). Univariate analysis failed to identify any significant risk factors. BSI clearly represents a significant and fatal complication after RI-CBT. Further studies are warranted to determine clinical characteristics, identify patients at high risk of BSI, and establish therapeutic strategies.
TI  - Perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis in urology: a multi-center prospective study.
AB  - Since there are few published reports regarding the impact of urologic surgery on perioperative infections, an epidemiologic analysis was performed on data from 1,156 open or laparoscopic operations in urology collected by the 21 hospitals participating in this study between September 2002 and August 2003. Prophylactic antibiotics were administered intravenously according to our protocol designed on the basis of the invasiveness and contamination levels. The surgical site infection (SSI) rates following clean, clean-contaminated and contaminated surgery were 1.2%. 5.8% and 23.4%, respectively, while the remote infection (RI) rates were 3.5%. 7.1% and 35.9%, respectively. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was most frequently isolated from SSIs as well as RIs, whereas Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more frequently discovered in RIs than in SSIs. Several risk factors for SSI and/or RI, such as older age, high ASA score, obesity, diabetes, preoperative chemotherapy, long operation time and much blood loss, were identified by univariate analysis.
TI  - Risk factors for intramammary infections and relationship with somatic-cell counts in Italian dairy goats.
AB  - Routine examination of milk was performed on five herds of lactating goats in northern Italy as part of a milk quality-monitoring program in the year 2000. As part of the study, aseptic samples of foremilk were collected monthly from both half udders during the entire lactation for 305 goats, resulting in a total of 4571 samples. The samples were tested with cytological and bacteriological analyses to evaluate the relationship between mammary infections and somatic-cell count (SCC; Fossomatic (TM) method). Prevalence of intramammary infection (IMI) was 40.2% (n = 1837) of all udder-half samples examined. The most-prevalent mastitis agents were coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS), 80% (n = 1474 udder-half samples); within this group, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most-prevalent species (38%). Other prevalence were Staphylococcus aureus 6% (n = 112 udder-half samples) and environmental pathogens 14% of infected udder-half samples (n = 251) with a diverse mixture of species, none of which had a frequency of > 4%. Enterococcus faecalis was the most-frequently isolated among this group. Neither Salmonella spp. nor Listeria monocytogenes were detected. The risk (sample level) of infection differed across herds, parities, and stage of lactation according to results from logistic multiple regression. Infection was more common among goats in third and fourth parities and during the later stages of lactation. Of the 2734 samples from uninfected udder halves, the mean log2 SCC was 3.9 cell/ml; of the 1837 bacteriological positive samples, the mean log2 SCC was 5.6 cell/ml. According to results from a linear mixed model, concentrations of somatic cells tended to increase with increasing age and days in milk and with the presence of bacteria. Infection with S. aureus was associated with the highest SCS.
TI  - Benzimidazolyl quinolinyl mercaptotriazoles as potential antimicrobial and antiviral agents.
AB  - Condensation of ethylaceto acetate (EAA) with resorcinol in concentrated H2SO4 afforded 7-hydroxy-4-methyl coumarin (1), which on reaction with thiosemicarbazide in anhydrous pyridine yielded 7-hydroxy-4-methyl-quinolinyl [1,5-c]-mercaptotriazole (2). Reaction of 2 with formaldehyde solution and amino acid in ethanol yielded 7-hydroxy-4-methyl-8-(N-methyl-aminoacid)-quinolinyl [1,5-c]-2''-mercaptotriazole (3a-e). Interaction of 3 with o-phenylenediamine in pyridine yielded 7-hydroxy-4-methyl-8-(aminobenzimidazolyl)-quinolinyl [1,5-c]-2''-mercaptotriazole derivatives (4a-e). The latter compounds were evaluated for their antiviral and antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Identification and antibacterial activity of a new oleandomycin derivative from Streptomyces antibioticus.
AB  - During the study on the oleandomycin production, we purified a new oleandomycin derivative having a macrolactone of which biosynthesis does not follow the genetic architecture of the oleandomycin PKS. The molecular formula for the compound was suggested as C35H59NO11 on the basis of the analysis of NMR and HRMS data (m/z 670.4185, Delta-1.9mmu, calcd for C35H60NO11). 13C NMR assignments and analysis of COSY, HMBC and HMQC data suggested that the compound differs from oleandomycin by formation of the olefinic functionality resulting from the dehydration of a hydroxy group in oleandomycin. The new oleandomycin derivative has antibacterial activities similar to those of oleandomycin agaisnt Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of Phrygilanthus acutifolius.
AB  - Ethanol extract of flowers of Phrygilanthus acutifolius (Ruiz & Pav.) Eichler (Loranthaceae) inhibited the growth of both Gram (+) bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram (-) bacteria (Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). This extract was bactericidal against Staphylococcus aureus and bacteriostatic against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Morphological evidence suggests that the extract causes the swelling of the bacterial body of Staphylococcus aureus, the disintegration of the cell surface and the cell death. Bactericidal activity was optimal at pH 7.5 and was not affected by different ionic strengths. The presence of Mg2+ in the culture medium of Phrygilanthus acutifolius diminished the sensitivity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain against the extract. Test results would tend to corroborate the folk belief that the flowers of this plant are efficacious against respiratory infections and would justify its further investigation.
TI  - Antagonistic activity of a natural fungal population towards pathogenic bacteria. An in vitro study.
AB  - In the present work, we performed in vitro testing of 33 species of fungi of the  subdivision Deuteromycotina isolated from water and sediment of the Kolubara River for antagonistic action towards 11 species of pathogenic bacteria. Of gram-negative bacteria, the species most sensitive to metabolic fluid of the fungi were Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella enteritidis, and Shigella sonnei, while the most resistant were Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium. Of gram-positive bacteria, the most sensitive species was Staphylococcus aureus, while the most resistant was Enterococcus faecalis. Of the tested fungi, Penicillium canescens, P. simplicissimum, P. thomii, Aspergillus fumigatus, A. ochraceus, and Fusarium culmorum exerted inhibitory action on the greatest number of species of pathogenic bacteria, while Verticillium lateritium, V. tenerum, Phoma humicola, and Botrytis cinerea had an inhibiting effect on the least number of species.
TI  - Chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of four different Anatolian propolis samples.
AB  - Propolis means a gum that is gathered by bees from various plants. It is known for its biological properties, having antibacterial, antifungal and healing properties. The aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of four different Anatolian propolis samples on different groups of microorganisms including some oral pathogens and comparison between their chemical compositions. Ethanol extracts of propolis (EEP) were prepared from four different Anatolian propolis samples and examined whether EEP inhibit the growth of the test microorganisms or not. For the antimicrobial activity assays, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by using macrodilution method. The MIC values of the most effective propolis (TB) were 2 microg/ml for Streptococcus sobrinus and Enterococcus faecalis, 4 microg/ml for Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans and C. krusei, 8 microg/ml for Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter aerogenes, 16 microg/ml for Escherichia coli and C. tropicalis and 32 microg/ml for Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The chemical compositions of EEP's were determined by high-temperature high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The main compounds of four Anatolian propolis samples were flavonoids such as pinocembrin, pinostropin, isalpinin, pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine and chrysin. Although propolis samples were collected from different regions of Anatolia all showed significant antimicrobial activity against the Gram positive bacteria and yeasts. Propolis can prevent dental caries since it demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms such as Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and C. albicans, which involves in oral diseases.
TI  - Antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities of the lipophylic extracts of Pistacia vera.
AB  - In the present study, antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties of 15 lipohylic extracts obtained from different parts (leaf, branch, stem, kernel, shell skins, seeds) of Pistacia vera were screened against both standard and the isolated strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and C. parapsilosis by microdilution method. Both Herpes simplex (DNA) and Parainfluenza viruses (RNA) were used for the determination of antiviral activity of the P. vera extracts by using Vero cell line. Ampicilline, ofloxocine, ketoconazole, fluconazole, acyclovir and oseltamivir were used as the control agents. The extracts showed little antibacterial activity between the range of 128-256 microg/ml concentrations whereas they had noticeable antifungal activity at the same concentrations. Kernel and seed extracts showed significant antiviral activity compared to the rest of the extracts as well as the controls.
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin versus linezolid and vancomycin against gram-positive uropathogens and ampicillin against enterococci, causing complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The existing therapeutic options for complicated urinary tract infections (UTI) caused by gram-positive uropathogens are not always optimal. Therefore, newer antimicrobials have to be assessed. METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of daptomycin was tested versus linezolid, vancomycin, and ampicillin (enterococci on ly), against pathogens from three different collections: (1) Uropathogens from hospitalized urological patients with complicated and/or hospital-acquired UTIs of the Urologic Clinic, Hospital St. Elisabeth, Straubing. (2) Uropathogens from a multicenter study comprising 37 urological centers throughout Germany. (3) Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates of patients and staff within the Hospital St. Elisabeth, Straubing. Genotyping of the latter isolates was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of daptomycin, linezolid, vancomycin, and ampicillin (only tested against enterococci) were determined by an agar dilution method using a multipointer with an inoculum of 10(4) CFU per point. RESULTS: For all methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (n = 25), MRSA (n = 49), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 129), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 33), for Enterococcus faecalis (n = 289), and for Enterococcus faecium (n = 4) the MICs ranged up to 2 mg/l (daptomycin, linezolid), up to 4 mg/l (vancomycin), and up to 8 mg/l (ampicillin, enterococci only) indicating that all strains were susceptible to the antibiotics tested. CONCLUSIONS: According to the in vitro activity daptomycin may be considered a promising antibacterial agent for the treatment of complicated UTI caused by gram-positive uropathogens. Thus, daptomycin should be evaluated in a clinical study.
TI  - An antibacterial and antiviral peptide produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST4V isolated from soya beans.
AB  - Enterococcus mundtii ST4V, isolated from soya beans, produces a 3950Da antibacterial peptide active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. The peptide also inactivated the herpes simplex viruses HSV-1 (strain F) and HSV-2 (strain G), a polio virus (PV3, strain Sabin) and a measles virus (strain MV/BRAZIL/001/91, an attenuated strain of MV). MV, HSV-1 and HSV-2 were 95.5%-99.9% inactivated by peptide ST4V at 400 microg/ml. Monkey kidney Vero cells were not inactivated, even at four times the level peptide ST4V displayed antiviral activity, indicating that the effect was not due to cytotoxicity. Complete inactivation or significant reduction in antimicrobial activity was observed after treatment of peptide ST4V with Proteinase K, pronase, pepsin and trypsin. No change in antimicrobial activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, suggesting that peptide ST4V was not glycosylated. This is the first description of an antibacterial and antiviral peptide with such broad-spectrum of activity, produced by a lactic acid bacterium.
TI  - Antibacterial screening of anthocyanic and proanthocyanic fractions from cranberry juice.
AB  - The effect of anthocyanin- and proanthocyanidin-rich fractions isolated from cranberry juice was studied for their antibacterial activity against nine bacterial strains. Activity was assessed by the agar diffusion assay. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 was the only strain to exhibit some susceptibility to four out of 10 anthocyanin-rich fractions tested. A variable susceptibility of S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 10541, and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 to proanthocyanidin- rich fractions was also observed. Streptococcus mutans strains as well as Escherichia coli ATCC 10538 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were not susceptible to any of the cranberry juice samples or fractions at the tested concentrations. There was no clear correlation between Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacterial susceptibility to cranberry juice. In this work, the role of cranberry juice anthocyanic and proanthocyanic fractions upon bacterial viability is discussed.
TI  - Structural modifications and antimicrobial activity of N-cycloalkenyl-2-acylalkylidene-2,3-dihydro-1,3-benzothiazoles.
AB  - A series of N-cycloalkenyl-2-acylalkylidene-2,3-dihydro-1,3-benzothiazoles 5a-j,  N-cycloalkyl-2-acylalkylidene-2,3-dihydro-1,3-benzothiazoles 8a-e, and N-alkyl-2-acylalkylidene-2,3-dihydro-1,3-benzothiazoles 8f-h, were synthesized and tested for in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities against four gram-positive and five gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis 6633, Enterococcus faecalis 29212, Staphylococcus aureus 6538, Staphylococcus aureus 25923, Escherichia coli 25922, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus a1, A. calcoaceticus a2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27835, Klebsiella oxytoca 49131), four yeast-like fungi and one fungus (Candida tropicalis 750, C. albicans 14053, C. albicans 10231, Cryptococcus laurentii 18803, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Microdilution broth and agar dilution methods were used for antimicrobial tests. The findings obtained showed that some of the tested compounds 5 and 8 were effective against some of the bacterial strains used, whereas, only compounds 8b-g exhibited a moderate antifungal activity against the yeast strains evaluated.
TI  - Local delivery of vancomycin for the prophylaxis of prosthetic device-related infections.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the in vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetics of vancomycin delivered from glycerylmonostearate (GMS) implants in a prosthetic-device based biofilm infection model. METHODS: A biofilm infection model was developed in male Sprague-Dawley rats by implanting a vascular graft on the dorsal side of each rat and infecting it with 1.5 x 10(8) cfu/ml Staphylococcus epidermidis. The rats were divided into 3 groups of 6 rats each: 1) the control group that received no antibiotics, 2) the IM group that received multiple IM injections of vancomycin at a dose of 25 mg/kg every 6 h for a total of 12 doses, and 3) the implant group that received GMS implants designed to deliver vancomycin at a total dose of 300 mg/kg for a period of 4 days. The pharmacokinetics of vancomycin was determined from IM and implant groups by analyzing for vancomycin in blood using HPLC. In vivo efficacy was studied by evaluation of the wound site and the prosthetic device upon excision, for evidence of infection in the form of purulent discharge at the wound site and yellowish discoloration of the prosthetic device and inflammation as sign of biofilm formation. Microbiological evaluation on the wound site and the prosthetic device was performed by culturing the swabs at the wound site and the prosthetic device in sterile tryptic soy broth for 36-48 h at 37 degrees C. RESULTS: Vancomycin was successfully delivered in a sustained manner for 100 h from GMS implants and the resulting plasma profile showed that the concentrations, after an initial burst, plateaued at about of 4.77 +/- 1.43 mug/ml with less fluctuations than the IM group in which the plasma concentrations fluctuated between 2.73 +/- 0.94 mug/ml and 19.26 +/- 3.67 mug/ml. Upon excision of the wound site, all the animals in the control group developed infection in the form of purulent discharge and yellowish discoloration of the prosthetic device. However, none of the rats in the implant group showed evidence of infection clearly demonstrating the efficacy of the local delivery system in preventing infection. Systemically delivered vancomycin by IM injections failed to prevent infection in four out of six rats. Microbiological evaluation of the wound site and prosthetic device resulted in isolation of biofilm-producing organisms such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. These organisms were isolated in greater number of animals in the control group compared to the IM and implant groups. CONCLUSIONS: The GMS implants as a delivery system for vancomycin were successful in preventing infection in all the animals compared to the IM and control groups demonstrating the efficacy of a local delivery system in a prosthetic device related biofilm infection model.
TI  - Solid-phase synthesis and antibacterial evaluations of N-demethylvancomycin derivatives.
AB  - Twenty-five N-demethylvancomycin derivatives were synthesized on solid-support and their structures were determined by LC-MS/MS. Biological evaluation of these compounds indicated that bulky hydrophobic substituent on vancosamine of N-demethylvancomycin can increase antibacterial activity against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - Daptomycin: a new drug class for the treatment of Gram-positive infections.
AB  - Daptomycin is the first member of a new class of bactericidal antibiotics, the cyclic lipopeptides. In September 2003, daptomycin was approved for the treatment of Gram-positive infections associated with complicated skin and skin structure infections. A key feature of daptomycin is its rapid, concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against significant Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, glycopeptide-intermediate and -resistant S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium (VRE). Daptomycin also has a unique mechanism of action, no cross-resistance with any other class of antibiotic and a relatively prolonged concentration-dependent postantibiotic effect in vitro. In the United States, daptomycin has been approved for use at a dose of 4 mg/ kg once daily in the treatment of S. aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), three beta-hemolytic streptococci (S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis) and E. faecalis associated with complicated skin and skin structure infections. In addition, daptomycin is undergoing a phase III evaluation for the treatment of bacteremia and endocarditis due to S. aureus. With its once-daily dosing, favorable safety profile and low potential for resistance, daptomycin is a powerful new antibiotic therapy against Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Diversifying vancomycin via chemoenzymatic strategies.
AB  - [reaction: see text] The rapid diversification of glycopeptides via glycorandomization reveals that significantly diverse substitutions are tolerated and suggests there may be a synergistic benefit to the construction of mechanistically related natural product core scaffold fusions. This work also further highlights the utility of chemoenzymatic approaches to diversify complex natural product architectures.
TI  - Targeting protein homodimerization: a novel drug discovery system.
AB  - To identify a novel class of antibiotics, we have developed a high-throughput genetic system for targeting the homodimerization (HD system) of histidine kinase (HK), which is essential for a bacterial signal transduction system (two-component system, TCS). By using the HD system, we screened a chemical library and identified a compound, I-8-15 (1-dodecyl-2-isopropylimidazole), that specifically inhibited the dimerization of HK encoded by the YycG gene of Staphylococcus aureus and induced concomitant bacterial cell death. I-8-15 also showed antibacterial activity against MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) and VRE (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis) with MICs at 25 and 50 microg/ml, respectively.
TI  - Efficacy of current agents used in the treatment of Gram-positive infections and  the consequences of resistance.
AB  - The proportion of pathogens causing hospital-onset infections that are resistant  to antimicrobial agents continues to increase worldwide. Inadequate antimicrobial therapy is an important factor in the emergence of resistance and is associated with increased mortality. In the USA in 2000, the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance system reported that >50% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates collected from intensive care units were resistant to methicillin (MRSA). The emergence of community-acquired MRSA is a new concern. MRSA are associated with adverse clinical outcomes and increased hospital costs. The increasing prevalence of MRSA contributes to the use of glycopeptides; however, isolates with intermediate and full resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin are now being reported. Newer agents, such as the oxazolidinone linezolid, are effective in the treatment of serious Gram-positive infections; however, linezolid-resistant isolates of Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis and S. aureus have been reported. Therefore, there is an unmet clinical need for new agents with activity against Gram-positive pathogens. Daptomycin, a lipopeptide with a novel mode of action, was recently approved for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections in the USA. The two case studies presented herein detail experience with the use of daptomycin in the USA.
TI  - [Inhibition of hemolytic activity of Staphylococcus aureus 3-hemolysin by an exosubstance produced by some Enterococcus faecalis strains].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Accidentally, some Enterococcus faecalis strains were found to inhibit the hemolysis caused by Staphylococcus aureus beta-hemolysin. The study objectives were to define the conditions under which this phenomenon appears and to characterize the inhibitory agent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-one wild strains and five type strains of E. faecalis and nine wild E. faecium strains were tested for antihemolytic activity on blood agar with 5% sheep erythrocytes prepared using the following agar bases: Columbia Agar Base (BBL, 211124), Columbia Agar (Bio Merieux, 51026), Blood Agar Base (Bio-Rad, 64524), Blood Agar Base (Columbia) (Ferosa, 1-034), Columbia Blood Agar Base (HiMedia, M114), Blood Agar Base No. 4 (Imuna), Columbia Agar Base (Merck, 10455) and Columbia Agar Base (Oxoid, CM331). The exosubstance produced by E. faecalis strains was isolated by means of acetone precipitation and was exposed to elevated temperature and trypsin. RESULTS: Thirty-three (36%) out of 91 wild strains of E. faecalis produced the substance inhibiting hemolysis caused by Staphylococcus aureus beta-hemolysin. Two out of five E. faecalis type strains and none of E. faecium strains appeared to be producers of the same substance. Inhibition of the hemolysis was observed on all of the media tested, being the most pronounced with the use of Blood Agar Base No. 4 (Imuna) and Columbia Agar Base (BBL) at pH 7.0-7.5 when cultured at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. The exosubstance lost its inhibitory effect after exposure to 70 degrees C for 15 min and to 0.1% trypsin for 30 min. The inhibitory potential against staphylococcal hemolysis correlated with the ability of strains to produce protease. CONCLUSION: About one third of wild E. faecalis strains produce a protease-like substance that seems proteinaceous in nature and has an inhibitory effect on the hemolysis caused by Staphylococcus aureus beta-hemolysin.
TI  - [Antimicrobial action of Lentinus edodes juice on human microflora].
AB  - The action of the juice of Shiitake mushroom (L. edodes) on pathogenic and opportunistic microorganisms, detected in cases of considerable dysbiotic changes (Escherichia coli O-114, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans), as well as on some bacterial eubiotic producer strains (Escherichia coli M-17, Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp.). The juice of this mushroom at a concentration of 5% from the volume of the nutrient medium was found to produce a pronounced antimicrobial effect with respect to C. albicans, S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. coli O-114 and to stimulate the growth of E. coli M-17. Bifidobacteria and lactobacteria exhibited resistance to the action of L. edodes juice.
TI  - (1)H NMR spectroscopy in the diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced urinary  tract infection.
AB  - The utility of (1)H NMR spectroscopy is suggested and demonstrated for the diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in urinary tract infection (UTI). The specific property of P. aeruginosa of metabolizing nicotinic acid to 6-hydroxynicotinic acid (6-OHNA) is exploited. The quantity of 6-OHNA produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. Other common bacteria causing UTI such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter baumanii, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter frundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus gp B and Staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize nicotinic acid under similar conditions. The method provides a single-step documentation of P. aeruginosa qualitatively as well as quantitatively. The NMR method is demonstrated on urine samples from 30 patients with UTI caused by P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [The study of the pro-nucleating activity of bacteria identified in cholesterol gallstones in model bile systems].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship of bacteria identified in cholesterol gallstones and gallstone formation. METHODS: Observe the bacteria activity in model bile and the influence of bacteria on the cholesterol nucleation time (NT). RESULTS: (1) Model bile were suitable for the growth of E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium difficile and Clostridium. Propionibacterium acne grew weakly and the growth of Bacteroides fragilis was restrained in model bile. (2) Only pseudomonas aeruginosa and enTerococcus faecalis could ly shorten the cholesterol nucleation time. (3) With pseudomonas aeruginosa or enTerococcus faecalis added in model bile, the formation of cholesterol crystals presented a progressive course of evolution. CONCLUSIONS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, not propionibacterium acne, have pro-nucleating ability in model bile.
TI  - Survey of the susceptibility of urinary isolates to antibacterial agents in 2003.
AB  - In 2003, 826 uropathogenic strains were obtained from the urine of our patients.  We assessed their activities to antibacterial agents based on the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Standards (NCCLS). Methicillin-resistant strains accounted for about 70% of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The most common gram-positive species was Enterococcus faecalis (15.6%). Enterococcus faecium was the most resistant of the enterococcal species, and the rate of susceptibility to beta-lactams (BLs), fluoroquinolones (FQs), and tetracyclines (TCs) was 0%, 6%, and less than 18%, respectively. Escherichia coli accounted for over 50% of the gram-negative bacilli. The proportion of FQ-resistant or intermediate strains was over 20%, and four of these strains (1.1%) were suspected of producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). All the ESBL-producing strains (ESBLs) possess resistance to FQs. Over 95% of Klebsiella pneumoniae was susceptible to all agents. The distribution of antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa indicated a decrease in the number of multidrug-resistant strains and an increase in strains susceptible to all agents. Some differences existed in the resistance to antibacterial agents among Proteus species. No ESBL-producing or multidrug-resistant strain was isolated from Serratia marcescens. This survey suggests that serious clinical problems will result from the increasing number of enterococcal species with multidrug resistance in gram-positive cocci, and isolates of ESBL-producing or FQs-resistant strains in gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolated from pasteurized milk and characterization of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin resistance genes.
AB  - The presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in pasteurized milk was detected by plating 18 milk samples on selective media containing beta-lactams, macrolides, or a glycopeptide. Most samples contained gram-positive bacteria that grew on agar plates containing oxacillin, erythromycin, and/or spiramycin. The disk-diffusion method confirmed resistance to erythromycin and/or spiramycin in 86 and 65% of the coryneform bacteria and Micrococcaceae tested, respectively. PCR and sequence analysis revealed the presence of an ermC gene in 2 of the 25 Micrococcaceae strains investigated for their resistance to erythromycin and/or spiramycin. None of the 14 corynebacteria strains resistant to erythromycin and/or spiramycin harbored the erm(X) gene. No gene transfer could be demonstrated between the two erm(C) staphylococcal isolates and recipient strains of Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 or Staphylococcus aureus 80CR5.
TI  - Bacteria induce expression of apoptosis in human spermatozoa.
AB  - An increased number of sperm undergoing apoptosis has been observed during inflammatory processes in the male genital tract, which might be associated with elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. However, another factor to stimulate apoptosis could be the direct contact with bacteria or its products, even in the absence of ROS. The aim of this study was to investigate whether bacteria can directly initiate apoptosis in human spermatozoa. Human spermatozoa selected by density gradient centrifugation were incubated with polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMN) isolated from blood and/or E. faecalis, E. coli or S. aureus. As ROS inductor in PMN, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate was used. After incubating the cells for 60 min at 37 degrees C, ROS were determined by chemiluminescence and phosphatidyl serine (PS) externalization was analyzed by flow cytometry with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI). The increase in the percentage of spermatozoa Annexin V-FITC-positive/ PI-negative (early event of late apoptosis) was significant after the incubation with PMN plus PMA, PMN plus E. coli and E. coli alone. The percentage of spermatozoa Annexin V-FITC-positive/ PI-positive (apoptosis/necrosis) increased significantly in sperm incubated with E. coli and S. aureus (20.3% +/- 3 and 13.6% +/- 3.2 compared to sperm alone, 6% +/- 0.5). Sperm incubated with PMN-PMA activated showed only a relative increase in apoptosis/necrosis (8.4% +/- 1). Our results show that bacteria directly increase the PS externalisation in ejaculated human sperm. This way of inducing apoptosis does not require external ROS and may result from anyone of the molecular mechanisms that account for changes in motility, vitality and DNA integrity, that are characteristics of spermatozoa in male genital tract infection.
TI  - Pollution status of swimming pools in south-south zone of south-eastern Nigeria using microbiological and physicochemical indices.
AB  - Microbiological and physicochemical characteristics of swimming pools in South Eastern states of Nigeria (Akwa Ibom and Cross River) were investigated. The bacterial isolates included Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. Others were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus epidermidis, while fungal isolates were Penicillium sp, Rhizopus sp, Aspergillus versicolor Fusarium sp, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Mucor sp, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Absidia sp. The total viable count of microorganims in Ibeno (B) and Uyo (E) swimming pools were 6 x 10(6) cfu/ml and for Calabar (H) swimming pool, 3.3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. The total coliform counts were 10(6) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (G) swimming pools and 2 x 10(7) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (H) swimming pools while the fungal count ranged from 5 x 10(6) cfu/ml to 3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. Physical and chemical parameters known to be hazardous to health were also identified. The presence of high levels of coliform and fecal coliform bacteria (E. coli) revelaed that the swimming pools have not met the World Health Organization (WHO) standard for recreational waters. The swimming pools constitute a serious public health hazard.
TI  - Plant models for animal pathogenesis.
AB  - Several bacteria that are pathogenic to animals also infect plants. Mechanistic studies have proven that some human/animal pathogenic bacteria employ a similar subset of virulence determinants to elicit disease in animals, invertebrates and plants. Therefore, the results of plant infection studies are relevant to animal pathogenesis. This discovery has resulted in the development of convenient, cost-effective, and reliable plant infection models to study the molecular basis of infection by animal pathogens. Plant infection models provide a number of advantages in the study of animal pathogenesis. Using a plant model, mutations in animal pathogenic bacteria can easily be screened for putative virulence factors, a process which if done using existing animal infection models would be time-consuming and tedious. High-throughput screening of plants also provides the potential for unravelling the mechanisms by which plants resist animal pathogenic bacteria, and provides a means to discover novel therapeutic agents such as antibiotics and anti-infective compounds. In this review, we describe the developing technique of using plants as a model system to study Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus pathogenesis, and discuss ways to use this new technology against disease warfare and other types of bioterrorism.
TI  - Suaveolindole, a new mass-limited antibacterial indolosesquiterpene from Greenwayodendron suaveolens obtained via high-throughput natural products chemistry methods.
AB  - Utilizing high-throughput isolation, purification, and analysis methods applied to a natural products library, a new mass-limited antibacterial indolosesquiterpene, suaveolindole (1), was obtained from Greenwayodendron suaveolens. The miniaturization of the structure elucidation of 1 was performed primarily using the CapNMR probe. Compound 1 was found to possess significant in vitro antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 43223), Staphylococcus aureus (ATTC 6538P), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ATTC 33591), with MIC values of 4, 8, and 8 microg/mL, respectively.
TI  - High hydrostatic pressure inactivation of vegetative microorganisms, aerobic and  anaerobic spores in pork Marengo, a low acidic particulate food product.
AB  - To prolong the shelf-life of particulate food products, high pressure processing  is one of the emerging technologies to be studied as an alternative to classical pasteurization and sterilization by heat. Pork Marengo (a low acidic, partially prepared stew of pieces pork, carrots and peas) was inoculated with several strains of sporulating and vegetative microorganisms. The microbial spoilage of the product was evaluated after a high pressure treatment of 400 MPa during 30 min at, respectively, 20 and 50 degrees C. Several Clostridium spp. and Bacillus spp. survived the treatment, and the Gram-positive cocci Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus were revealed to be more pressure resistant than Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens and Escherichia coli. The high pressure treatment at 20 degrees C demonstrated that high pressure processing (HPP) of neutral-pH foods cannot rely on pressure alone as a pasteurization/sterilization process. Another physical agent like heat is needed. High pressure treatment at 50 degrees C demonstrated that heat transfer limitations in particulate food products still can trouble their successful pasteurization/sterilization.
TI  - Interlaboratory proficiency testing as a tool for improving performance in laboratories diagnosing bovine mastitis.
AB  - The National Veterinary and Food Research Institute (Finland) and the Veterinary  Laboratories Agency of the Quality Assurance Unit, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, United Kingdom (previously the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food) organized a proficiency testing program for laboratories analyzing veterinary mastitis samples. Three test samples with lyophilized strains of common aerobic bacteria were sent to the participating laboratories 7 times between 2000 and 2003. The participants returned 98% of the requested data. The overall performance of the laboratories varied from 63 to 93% in different testing rounds. All laboratories diagnosed Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli correctly at every round. Improvement in diagnosing individual bacteria was observed for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Enterococcus spp. and Klebsiella spp. The overall performance of the laboratories improved with increased participation. The educational role of the program was important. Laboratories working in the veterinary field should implement a documented quality system covering all functions of the laboratory, as well as a planned quality assurance system.
TI  - Surveillance of linezolid resistance in Germany, 2001-2002.
AB  - A surveillance study was performed throughout Germany from November 2001 to June  2002 to assess the prevalence of linezolid-resistant isolates among Gram-positive bacteria from routine susceptibility data and to compare the in-vitro activity of linezolid to that of other antibacterial agents. Each of 86 laboratories provided routine susceptibility data for 100 consecutive isolates. Most laboratories (c. 60%) used the disk diffusion test. Laboratories were also requested to send a representative sample of their isolates, as well as all isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid, to a reference laboratory for MIC determination. Susceptibility data for 8594 isolates were evaluated. Sites of infection were skin and soft tissue (29.9%), upper and lower respiratory tract (19.1%), foreign body or catheter (10.5%), or urinary tract (9.8%). Routine linezolid susceptibility data were reported for 6433 isolates. The prevalence of linezolid resistance, as reported to the clinician, was 0.4% in Staphylococcus aureus, 0.3% in Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2.9% in Enterococcus faecalis, 2.3% in Enterococcus faecium, 1.4% in Streptococcus pyogenes and 2.9% in Streptococcus agalactiae. Linezolid resistance was not detected in Streptococcus pneumoniae or in viridans group streptococci. Sixty-nine of 115 isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid were retested, but none was resistant to linezolid. Linezolid exhibited excellent in-vitro activity against representative isolates of the six most frequently encountered species (MIC90, 1-2 mg/L). The prevalence of resistance to linezolid was very low in Germany. Organisms reported as linezolid-resistant should be retested, either in the same laboratory with an alternative method or in a reference laboratory.
TI  - Antiviral and antimicrobial activities of new nitrobutane derivatives.
AB  - It is known that some addition products of beta-nitrostyrenes exhibit potent antimicrobial activity. In order to investigate the effects of structural modifications on the biological properties, some new Michael type addition products of beta-ethyl-beta-nitrostyrenes were synthesized. In this study, eight new 1-[(2-aminophenyl)thio]-1-phenyl-2-nitrobutane (2) derivatives were synthesized by addition of 2-aminothiophenol to the double bond of beta-ethyl-beta-nitrostyrenes (1). The chemical structures were proved by IR and 1H-NMR data and by elemental analysis. Antimicrobial activities of the synthesized compound were investigated against Escherichia coil, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans by the microdilution method. In addition, the newly synthesized compounds were studied for antiviral activities. All of them were found to be almost 100 fold more active than the standard compound aciclovir (CAS 59277-89-3).
TI  - Susceptibility of some oral microorganisms to chlorhexidine and paramonochlorophenol.
AB  - Since the use of antimicrobial agents is required in endodontic therapies, this study aimed at determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of chlorhexidine digluconate and paramonochlorophenol (PMC) against microorganisms commonly found in endodontic infections. Both agents were tested by agar dilution tests against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella denticola and Prevotella melaninogenica. The MIC of chlorhexidine ranged from 2.67 to 80.00 microg/ml, and the MIC of PMC from 46.67 to 213.33 microg/ml. The highest MIC value of PMC was detected for E. faecalis whereas E. coli was the most susceptible microorganism to this agent. The highest MIC values of chlorhexidine were observed for P. aeruginosa whereas E. coli and P. denticola were the most susceptible microorganisms to this agent. Since the MIC values observed are much lower than the concentrations currently used in the endodontic therapy, it is suggested that both agents are effective in reducing the microbiota in the root canal.
TI  - Molecular diversity of a putative virulence factor: purification and characterization of isoforms of an extracellular serine glutamyl endopeptidase of Enterococcus faecalis with different enzymatic activities.
AB  - A previously identified gene sprE of Enterococcus faecalis strain OG1 was shown to encode an extracellular serine protease that appears to belong to the glutamyl endopeptidase I staphylococcal group. A single form of SprE with a molecular mass of 25 kDa and a pH optimum between 7.0 and 7.5 was isolated from culture supernatant of wild-type E. faecalis strain OG1RF (TX4002); this form was apparently generated by cleavage of the Ser-1-Leu1 and Arg230-Leu231 peptide bonds of the secreted zymogen. In contrast, the culture supernatant of the gelatinase-null mutant, TX5264, with a nonpolar deletion of gelE which encodes the E. faecalis gelatinase, was found to contain several forms of SprE proteolytically processed on both the N and C termini; in addition to a full-length zymogen and a truncated zymogen, three mature forms of the SprE proteinase, Leu1-Ala237, Ser-1-Glu227, and Leu1-Glu227, were identified. As with the V8 proteinase of Staphylococcus aureus, the closest homologue of SprE, all of the active forms cleaved specifically Glu-Xaa peptide bonds but with substantially different efficiencies, while none was able to hydrolyze peptide bonds with Asp in the P1 position. The most active of all these enzyme forms against several substrates, including human fibrinogen and beta-chain insulin, was the Ser-1-Glu227 (-1S-SprE) isolated from TX5264; -1S-SprE, in contrast to other forms of SprE, was unstable at 37 degrees C, apparently due to autodegradation. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that sprE encodes a highly specific serine-type glutamyl endopeptidase, the maturation of which is dependent on the presence of gelatinase. In the absence of gelatinase activity, the aberrant processing of pro-SprE results in the appearance of a "superactive" form of the enzyme, -1S-SprE.
TI  - Detection of the van alphabet and identification of enterococci and staphylococci at the species level by multiplex PCR.
AB  - A multiplex PCR assay was developed for detection of the six types of glycopeptide resistance characterized in enterococci and for identification of Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis at the species level. Primers targeting the genes vanA, vanB, vanC, vanD, vanE, vanG, and ddl of E. faecium and E. faecalis and nuc of S. aureus and a chromosomal portion specific to S. epidermidis were designed to allow amplification of fragments with various sizes. This specific and sensitive technique allows detection of glycopeptide-resistant strains, in particular methicillin-resistant S. aureus, that may escape phenotype-based automated rapid methods.
TI  - MIC quality control guidelines for doxycycline when testing gram-positive control strains by the reference methods.
AB  - With emerging resistance to fluoroquinolones, there arises a need to establish quality control (QC) guidelines for doxycycline, an effective alternative for treating various community-acquired respiratory tract infections. This multicenter study was performed to establish QC guidelines for susceptibility testing those Gram-positive QC organisms against doxycycline. The proposed three or four log2 dilution MIC ranges included 100.0% of the doxycycline MIC values reported.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of antibiotic release from and bacteria growth inhibition by  antibiotic-loaded acrylic bone cement spacers.
AB  - The antibiotic release from and the bacteria growth inhibition by antibiotic-loaded acrylic bone cement hip spacers were studied. The cement used was Palacos R, and it was loaded with either one antibiotic powder (gentamicin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, or synercid) [monoantibiotic case] or two antibiotic powders (gentamicin + vancomycin or gentamicin + teicoplanin) [biantibiotic case] and then tested against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Antibiotic elution and bacteria growth were measured every 24 h simultaneously by fluorescence polarization immunoassay and photometrically, respectively. The gentamicin + vancomycin combination achieved the longest growth inhibition on S. epidermidis and MRSA (mean of 20 and 14 days, respectively). Gentamicin + teicoplanin-loaded spacers were capable of inhibiting growth on E. faecalis and S. aureus for the longest period (11 and 16 days, respectively). The highest concentrations of gentamicin and vancomycin could be assayed during the first 4 days. Teicoplanin concentrations could be detected only during the first 72 h, synercid was not detected at all, possibly because of the limitation of the detection technique used. A greater percentage of the gentamicin was released than of the vancomycin. The aminoglycosid-glycopeptid combination showed a synergistic effect on the release of gentamicin, but not on vancomycin or teicoplanin. Biantibiotic-impregnated hip spacers proved to be superior to monoantibiotic ones. Because of important differences between the conditions used for the present tests and the in vivo environment, any recommendation with regard to the use of monoantibiotic- and biantibiotic-loaded acrylic bone cement spacers must await the results of further investigations.
TI  - Single species biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates on gutta-percha points.
AB  - The participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. This study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Strep. intermedius, Strep. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Propionibacterium acnes, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. Each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. The bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha points for 7 d. The gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. E. faecalis, Strep. sanguis, Strep. intermedius, Strep. pyogenes and Staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. The E. faecalis and Strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of Strep. intermedius, Strep. pyogenes and Staph. aureus. No biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with F. nucleatum, Prop. acnes, Porph. gingivalis and Prev. intermedia. These findings suggest that Gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.
TI  - Successful treatment of chronic bone and joint infections with oral linezolid.
AB  - Linezolid is an attractive alternative for the treatment of chronic bone and joint infections because it is active against common pathogens including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci and because its oral formulation is convenient for long-term administration. To evaluate the ability of linezolid to produce long-term remission, we prospectively monitored 11 consecutive adult patients who received linezolid for osteomyelitis (n = 9) or prosthetic joint infection (n = 2). Linezolid 600 mg was administered orally twice daily for a mean of 10 weeks (range, 6 to 19 weeks). Pathogens were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 4), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (n = 1), and vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1). After a mean followup of 27 months (range, 17 to 41 months), all 11 patients had remission by clinical, laboratory, and radiographic criteria. During week 8 of linezolid treatment, one patient developed a gram-negative superinfection, which resolved with appropriate therapy. During week 6 of linezolid treatment, one patient developed mild thrombocytopenia and another patient developed mild anemia. Both episodes of myelosuppression were reversible within 10 days after completing the planned 6-week courses of linezolid. We recommend weekly complete blood counts to detect hematologic abnormalities. We conclude that oral linezolid seems to be a useful and convenient alternative for the treatment of bone and joint infections.
TI  - Potent antibacterial activity of halogenated compounds against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - Common Gram-positive clinical pathogens are showing an increasing trend for resistance to conventional antimicrobial agents. New drugs with potent antibacterial activities are urgently needed to remediate this problem. Halogenated compounds isolated from several species of the red algae genus Laurencia were examined for their antibacterial activity against 22 strains of human pathogenic bacteria, 7 strains of which were antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Four phenolic sesquiterpenes and a polybrominated indole showed wide spectra of antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium (VRE). In addition, laurinterol and allolaurinterol displayed potent bactericidal activity against three strains of MRSA at 3.13 microg mL(-1), and three strains of vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus, at 3.13 microg mL(-1) and 6.25 microg mL(-1), respectively.
TI  - Syntheses, in vitro antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of a series of 3-substituted succinimides.
AB  - We have synthesized a series of 3-substituted succinimides and their in vitro antibacterial activities have been tested towards Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria from the ATCC collection. Some of them possess significant antibacterial activity against Gram-positive organisms (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212) but all are poorly active or inactive against Gram-negative organisms (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853). The compounds with the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations (esters of 3-hydroxy succinimides) are also the most cytotoxic against green monkey Vero cell line (ATCC CCL-81) and could explain that perhaps apoptosis should be implicated in eukaryotic cell cytotoxicity of succinimides.
TI  - In vitro exposure of bacteria to antimicrobial impregnated-central venous catheters does not directly lead to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Use of central venous catheters (CVCs) impregnated with minocycline and rifampin reduces the density of bacterial growth on catheters and decreases the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections. Questions have been raised over the possibility that the use of these catheters will lead to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. In this study, we sought to determine if in vitro exposure of four test organisms to catheter segments impregnated with minocycline and rifampin would lead to the development of antibiotic resistance. METHODS: Catheter segments (1.0 cm) were placed on the surface of agar plates previously inoculated with bacterial suspensions, such that a subconfluent lawn of colony growth would be apparent after 24 h incubation at 35 degrees C in air. Test organisms included American Type Culture Collection strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Zones of inhibition of colony growth surrounding catheters were measured at 24-h intervals up to 7 days (two catheter segments per test). Colonies on agar surfaces located at varying distances from catheter segments were examined for minocycline and rifampin resistance following various periods of exposure (six catheter segments per test). In addition, selected colonies were subsequently exposed to minocycline and rifampin in broth and examined for selection of minocycline and rifampin resistance (> 28 colonies per selection test). RESULTS: Inhibitory zones of 14 to 47 mm were observed with S aureus, S epidermidis, E faecalis, and E coli. Growth of P aeruginosa was not inhibited by CVC segments. Testing of colonies of the first four organisms at various distances from CVC segments after varying periods of exposure revealed only a single instance of the emergence of resistance (eg, S aureus vs rifampin). Recovery of resistant clones was enhanced with minocycline and rifampin broth selection; however, a direct link between CVC exposure and the emergence of resistance was not established. CONCLUSIONS: Our in vitro data suggest that the exposure of Gram-positive cocci to either rifampin or minocycline can lead to the development of resistance. However, exposure of bacteria to these antibiotics in combination does not directly lead to resistance. Clinical investigations will be required to determine the true risk and implications of the development of resistance.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2002). III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - The bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from patients diagnosed as urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 13 institutions in Japan were supplied between August 2002 and July 2003. The susceptibilities of these bacteria to various antimicrobial agents were examined. The bacteria were divided into 2 groups consisting of uncomplicated UTIs and complicated UTIs (with and without indwelling catheter) based on their isolation origins. The results were compared with those obtained between 1993 and 2001. The drug sensitivity of S. aureus in this year was similar to those in up to the previous year and S. aureus showed the best susceptibility to vancomycin. The drug sensitivity of E. faecalis in this year also was similar to those in up to the previous year. The drug sensitivity of E. coli in this year was generally good except penicillins and was similar to those in up to the previous year. Among cephems, cefozopran (CZOP) and cefpirome (CPR) showed the highest potency (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). An antibacterial activity of cefotiam (CTM) was similar to it in 10 years ago and was fine (MIC90: < or = 1 microg/mL). The sensitivity of E. coli to carbapenems and carumonam (CRMN) also was good like to CZOP. However, the sensitivity of the complicated UTIs group to quinolones decreased after 2000 and was suggested to develop the resistance to the drug. The drug sensitivity of Klebsiella spp. in this year also was similar to those in up to the previous year. The bacteria showed good susceptibility (MIC: < or = 0.125 microg/mL) to cefmenoxime (CMX), CPR, cefixime (CFIX), flomoxef (FMOX), and CZOP among cephems. The drug sensitivity of P. aeruginosa was generally low. Most of the bacteria were little sensitive to cephems except CZOP and ceftazidime (CAZ). The sensitive bacteria to CZOP and ceftazidime (CAZ) were observed to be 26.8% (15/56 strains) and 39.3% (22/56 strains) in complicated UTIs group, respectively. The sensitivity profile of P. aeruginosa to the other tested drugs was not much different from that in up to the previous year. However, the sensitivity of the bacteria to carbapenems tended to decrease after 2000, and the low sensitive strains (MIC: > or = 256 microg/mL) were detected at 22.2% (2/9 strains) in the uncomplicated UTIs group and 3.6% (2/56 strains) in the complicated UTIs group.
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - Sufentanil modifies the antibacterial activity of bupivacaine and ropivacaine.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of our study was to investigate the effect on the growth of  Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) of bupivacaine at a final concentration of 0.77 mg.mL(-1), ropivacaine at 1.2 mg.mL(-1), and sufentanil at 0.38 and 0.5 microg.mL(-1) (alone or in combination with bupivacaine and ropivacaine). METHODS: The strains were diluted to approximately 3 x 10(4) cfu.mL(-1) in Mueller-Hinton broth. The anesthetics (0.5 mL) were incubated with the bacterial suspensions (0.5 mL) for 24 hr at 37 degrees C. RESULTS: Bupivacaine inhibited the growth of E. coli (59 +/- 0.8%; P < 0.05) and S. aureus (22 +/- 3.6%; P < 0.05). Ropivacaine also inhibited the growth of E. coli (41 +/- 1.2%; P < 0.05) and S. aureus (25.5 +/- 4.1%; P < 0.05). Both anesthetics were ineffective against E. faecalis. Sufentanil only inhibited S. aureus (13.8 +/- 3.1%; P < 0.05) at a concentration of 0.5 microg.mL(-1). Sufentanil modified the antibacterial activity of bupivacaine and ropivacaine. It increased the inhibitory effect of bupivacaine on E. faecalis and S. aureus by 10 +/- 2.1% (P < 0.05) and on E. coli by 7% (P < 0.05). Sufentanil did not increase the inhibitory effect of ropivacaine on the growth of S. aureus. On the other hand, sufentanil reduced the inhibitory effect of ropivacaine on E. coli by 11% (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Both bupivacaine and ropivacaine alone or combined with sufentanil inhibited the growth of E. coli and S. aureus. E. faecalis was partially sensitive to a bupivacaine + sufentanil mixture. Sufentanil had a partial synergistic effect on bupivacaine and a partial antagonistic effect on ropivacaine's antibacterial activity.
TI  - Cyclic dipeptides exhibit synergistic, broad spectrum antimicrobial effects and have anti-mutagenic properties.
AB  - Cyclic dipeptides are known to have antiviral, antibiotic and antitumour properties. The aim of this study was to determine the combined effects of cyclo(L-leucyl-L-prolyl) and cyclo(L-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl) on the growth of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and pathogenic yeasts, as well as determining their anti-mutagenic effects. This drug combination was especially effective against five VRE strains: Enterococcus faecium (K-99-38), E. faecalis (K-99-17), E. faecalis (K-99-258), E. faecium (K-01-312) and E. faecalis (K-01-511) with MIC values of 0.25-1 mg/l. It was also effective against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans with MIC values of 0.25-0.5 mg/l. In addition, the cyclic dipeptides exerted anti-mutagenic activity against Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains in a Salmonella mutation assay. The number of mutant colonies of S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 induced by exposure to AF-2 (0.2 microg/plate) decreased in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of the two cyclic dipeptides (correlation 0.72 and 0.78, respectively). Here, for the first time, we report synergistic effects of the cyclic dipeptides [cyclo(L-leu-L-pro) and cyclo(L-phe-L-pro)] in inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, as well as their anti-mutagenic effects in Salmonella strains.
TI  - [Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance: VIRA study 2004].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of the study was to know the current situation of the antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of the main multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the VIRA study carried out in 2001. METHODS: The 40 participating hospitals sent a total of 1,425 microorganisms isolated in February 2004, distributed as follows: penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (139), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (289), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (158), ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (89) and Enterococcus faecalis (2), ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae (85), ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli (346), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (187), and Acinetobacter baumannii (130). The hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. Sensitivity was determined by the broth microdilution method. RESULTS: The number of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci fell significantly (p < 0.0001) compared with the previous study (from 59.8% to 30.2%). Global methicillin-resistance in S. aureus was 31.2%, which represents a significant increase (p < 0.001) compared with the year 2001 (24.8%). 11.3% of the E. coli strains were extended-spectrum beta -lactamase-producers and came from 24 hospitals. One P. aeruginosa isolate gave a positive result in the E-test MBL assay, suggesting the presence of metallo-beta -lactamases. The strains of imipenem-resistant A. baumannii presented cross-resistance with several antibiotics. CONCLUSION: These results show how the multi-resistant bacteria included in the study represent a growing problem in our hospitals. This emphasizes the importance of resistance surveillance systems and the correct use of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Treatment of infected tibial nonunion with tobramycin-impregnated calcium sulfate: report of two cases.
AB  - The treatment of infected tibial nonunion usually includes a staged reconstruction protocol. We present 2 patients with tibial nonunion and plate loosening with oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection. The patients were treated using the removal of the plate, radical debridement, and implantation of gentamycin-impregnated cement beads during the first stage. During the second stage, plate fixation was performed and tobramycin-impregnated calcium sulfate (Osteoset T) was used as a bone graft substitute. Neither an autogenous bone graft nor an allograft was used. At 3 years of follow-up, each tibia showed good union, and there was no recurrence of infection. We consider tobramycin-impregnated calcium sulfate to be an alternative method of bone grafting to treat infected tibial nonunion.
TI  - Usnic acid, a natural antimicrobial agent able to inhibit bacterial biofilm formation on polymer surfaces.
AB  - In modern medicine, artificial devices are used for repair or replacement of damaged parts of the body, delivery of drugs, and monitoring the status of critically ill patients. However, artificial surfaces are often susceptible to colonization by bacteria and fungi. Once microorganisms have adhered to the surface, they can form biofilms, resulting in highly resistant local or systemic infections. At this time, the evidence suggests that (+)-usnic acid, a secondary lichen metabolite, possesses antimicrobial activity against a number of planktonic gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium. Since lichens are surface-attached communities that produce antibiotics, including usnic acid, to protect themselves from colonization by other bacteria, we hypothesized that the mode of action of usnic acid may be utilized in the control of medical biofilms. We loaded (+)-usnic acid into modified polyurethane and quantitatively assessed the capacity of (+)-usnic acid to control biofilm formation by either S. aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa under laminar flow conditions by using image analysis. (+)-Usnic acid-loaded polymers did not inhibit the initial attachment of S. aureus cells, but killing the attached cells resulted in the inhibition of biofilm. Interestingly, although P. aeruginosa biofilms did form on the surface of (+)-usnic acid-loaded polymer, the morphology of the biofilm was altered, possibly indicating that (+)-usnic acid interfered with signaling pathways.
TI  - Heterologous expression of the enterococcal vanA operon in methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Two methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, MI-VRSA  and PA-VRSA, and Enterococcus faecalis DMC83006B, considered to be the potential donor of glycopeptide resistance to MI-VRSA, were studied. MI-VRSA is highly resistant to both glycopeptides, whereas PA-VRSA displays low-level resistance to vancomycin and reduced susceptibility to teicoplanin. We have analyzed the expression of the vanA operon in the three clinical isolates. Determination of the relative amounts of late peptidoglycan precursors and quantification of the d,d-peptidase activities, in the absence or after induction by glycopeptides, revealed that the resistance genes were expressed at similarly high levels in the three strains. Glycopeptide resistance stability in the three strains was studied by replica plating. Resistance was lost at high frequency, ca. 50%, after overnight growth of PA-VRSA in the absence of antibiotics, whereas it was fully stable in MI-VRSA and E. faecalis DMC83006B. Induction of resistance by vancomycin was significantly delayed in PA-VRSA relative to MI-VRSA. Low-level glycopeptide resistance of S. aureus PA-VRSA is thus likely due to instability of the genetic element, plasmid or transposon, carrying the vanA operon associated with a longer lag phase before growth resumes after induction by vancomycin.
TI  - Inhibition of antibiotic efflux in bacteria by the novel multidrug resistance inhibitors biricodar (VX-710) and timcodar (VX-853).
AB  - Inhibitors of mammalian multidrug efflux, such as the plant alkaloid reserpine, are also active in potentiating antibiotic activity by inhibiting bacterial efflux. Based on this precedent, two novel mammalian multiple drug resistance inhibitors, biricodar (VX-710) and timcodar (VX-853), were evaluated for activity in a variety of bacteria. Both VX-710 and VX-853 potentiated the activity of ethidium bromide (EtBr), a model efflux substrate, against three clinically significant gram-positive pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Similar to reserpine, VX-710 and VX-853 directly blocked EtBr efflux in S. aureus. Furthermore, these compounds were effective in lowering the MICs of several clinically used antibiotics, including fluoroquinolones, suggesting that VX-710 and VX-853 are representatives of a new class of bacterial efflux inhibitors with the potential for use in combination therapy.
TI  - Novel Mannich ketones of oxazolidinones as antibacterial agents.
AB  - A few Mannich ketones of piperazinyl oxazolidinone derivatives have been synthesized and their antibacterial activity in various Gram-positive organisms such as Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were evaluated by MIC determination. Compound 12 showed comparable activity (MIC) to linezolid and superior to eperezolid.
TI  - Nocathiacin I analogues: synthesis, in vitro and in vivo biological activity of novel semi-synthetic thiazolyl peptide antibiotics.
AB  - Several nocathiacin I analogues (4-35) were synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activity. Most of these semi-synthetic analogues retained very good in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of 1.
TI  - Premature Salmonella Typhimurium growth inhibition in competition with other Gram-negative organisms is redox potential regulated via RpoS induction.
AB  - AIMS: To identify the role of oxidation-reduction (redox) potential in the premature growth inhibition and RpoS induction in Salmonella serotype Typhimurium in competitive growth experiments. METHODS AND RESULTS: Oxidation-reduction potential was measured throughout the growth of a minority population of Salm. Typhimurium in mixed cultures with other Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms. A lux-based reporter was also used to evaluate RpoS activity in Salm. Typhimurium in competitor studies. In a mixed culture, the multiplication of a minority population of Salm. Typhimurium was inhibited when competing Gram-negative organisms entered the stationary phase. This was not seen when the competing flora was Gram-positive. The change in redox potential during growth in mixed cultures was closely linked to the inhibition of Salm. Typhimurium growth by Gram-negative competitors. An artificially induced drop in redox potential earlier during growth in mixed cultures with Gram-negative organisms reduced the time to RpoS induction in Salm. Typhimurium and thus inhibited its multiplication prematurely. In contrast, RpoS induction and growth inhibition were prevented under high redox potential conditions. CONCLUSIONS: This work shows that the inhibitory activity of competitive organisms can be mediated through their effect on redox potential-regulated RpoS induction. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Redox potential is shown to be an important determinant of Salm. Typhimurium growth, an observation with practical implications both for its control and detection.
TI  - Synthesis and potent antimicrobial activity of some novel 4-(5, 6-dichloro-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-N-substituted benzamides.
AB  - A series of 4-(5, 6-dichloro-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-N-substituted benzamides were  synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial and antifungal activities against Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant S. epidermis (MRSE), Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. Certain compounds inhibit bacterial growth with low MIC values (microg/mL). Among them, compounds 10 and 11 exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity with MIC values of 3.12 microg/mL against S. aureus, MRSA and MRSE.
TI  - Review of 65 cases of infective endocarditis in Dunedin Public Hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Infective endocarditis remains a challenging disease to manage. The objective of this study was to evaluate the management of patients diagnosed with infective endocarditis presenting to a regional hospital. METHODS: During the years 1997 to 2002, 65 episodes of bacterial endocarditis in 62 patients (20 female, 42 male; age range from 7-89 yrs, median 68 yrs) classified as definite or possible according to the Duke criteria were reviewed retrospectively. The demographic data, predisposing factors, echocardiographic findings, culture results, complications and mortality were recorded and analysed. RESULTS: Forty-five episodes (69%) were definite endocarditis and 20 episodes (31%) were possible endocarditis. All cases had undergone transthoracic or transoesophageal echocardiograms with vegetations found in 59 (91%) episodes. There were 49 cases of native valve endocarditis, 21 (34%) of whom had either congenital or acquired valvular disease. Fifteen cases (23%) were prosthetic valve endocarditis. One case was automated implantable cardioverter defibrillator leads endocarditis. Preceding dental or surgical manipulation was observed in 7 cases (11%). Aortic valve (38/59, 64%) was the most common valve involved followed by mitral valve (21/59, 36%). Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 20 episodes (31%), Streptococcus viridans for 16 episodes (25%), Enterococcus faecalis for 5 episodes (8%), other organisms for 9 episodes (14%), and culture negative endocarditis (CNE) for 15 episodes (23%). The majority of the cases had single valve involvement (50/59, 85%); only 9 cases (15%) were double valve endocarditis. Ten cases (15%) needed urgent valve replacement. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 20% (13/65), and at 6 months was 31% (20/65). Higher 6-month mortality was seen in patients with Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis or CNE. CONCLUSIONS: Despite major advances in diagnostic technology, improvement in antimicrobial selection and monitoring, and progress in surgical techniques, the morbidity and mortality of bacterial endocarditis remain high.
TI  - Intensive-care-unit-acquired bloodstream infections in a regional critically ill  population.
AB  - Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a serious complication of critical illness but it  is uncertain whether acquisition of BSI in the intensive care unit (ICU) increases the risk of death. A study was conducted among all Calgary health region (population approximately 1 million) adults admitted to ICUs for 48 h or more during a three-year period to investigate the occurrence, microbiology and risk factors for developing an ICU-acquired BSI and to determine whether these infections independently predict mortality. One hundred and ninety-nine ICU-acquired BSI episodes occurred during 4933 ICU admissions for a cumulative incidence of 4% and an incidence density of 5.4 per 1000 ICU days. The most common isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (18%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (11%), and Enterococcus faecalis (8%); 12% of infections were due to antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Admission to the regional neurosurgery/trauma ICU [odds ratio (OR) 2.86; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.10-3.90] and increasing Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score (OR 1.05 per point, 95% CI 1.03-1.07) were associated with higher risk, whereas a surgical diagnosis (OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.52-0.93) was associated with lower risk of developing ICU-acquired BSI in logistic regression analysis. The crude in-hospital death rate was 45% for patients with ICU-acquired BSI compared with 21% for those without (P < 0.0001) Development of an ICU-acquired BSI was an independent risk factor for death (OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.3-2.5) and increases the risk of dying from critical illness.
TI  - Use of simulated blood cultures for antibiotic effect on time to detection of the two blood culture systems BacT/ALERT and BACTEC 9240.
AB  - To avoid the influence of pre-analytical steps, this study was performed using sterile blood spiked with defined loads of microorganisms as inoculum. Time-to-Detection (TTD) was evaluated for the most frequently encountered bacteria comparing two commercially available blood culture systems, BD BACTEC 9240 (Becton Dickinson) and BacT/ALERT (Organon Teknika). The effect of the most widely used antibiotics on TTD was evaluated on both systems. TTD was measured with antibiotics at their trough and at increasing concentrations. The results show that the BACTEC PLUS system recovers more pathogens with shorter time to detection than the BacT/ALERT FAN system when beta-lactam antibiotics (Ampicillin, Cefotaxime) are present at their respective trough concentration corresponding to parenteral therapy. The two systems seem to be equally efficient when Gentamicin, Ciprofloxacin and Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are used; in the case of Vancomycin, BACTEC seems more effective than BacT/ALERT.
TI  - Activity of daptomycin against multi-resistant Gram-positive bacteria including enterococci and Staphylococcus aureus resistant to linezolid.
AB  - The activity of daptomycin was assessed against 545 isolates of Gram-positive bacteria including enterococci, coagulase-positive and -negative staphylococci, beta-haemolytic streptococci, viridans streptococci and coryneforms. The panel of isolates was biased towards those with resistance to first-line antimicrobial agents and included linezolid-resistant enterococci and Staphylococcus aureus. MICs of daptomycin were < or =1mg/l for all the staphylococci, streptococci, and coryneforms, except for two isolates of Corynebacterium aquaticum, for which MICs were 8 mg/l. Daptomycin MICs were < or =2 and < or =4 mg/l for Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, respectively.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2002). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 491 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 13 institutions in Japan were supplied between August 2002 and July 2003. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. Of them, 578 strains were estimated as causative bacteria and used for the investigation. The number of them was 578 strains consisting of 177 gram-positive bacterial strains (30.6%) and 401 gram-negative bacterial strains (69.4%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed a strong activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 1 microg/mL. The susceptibility of Staphylococcus epidermidis to cephems including cefotiam (CTM) was relatively good. Against Enterococcus faecalis, ampicillin (ABPC), imipenem (IPM), and VCM showed the strongest antibacterial activity (MIC90: 2-4 microg/mL). In addition, the low sensitive strains (MIC: > or = 256 microg/mL) to clarithromycin (CAM) were detected at 48.3% but none to cefozopran (CZOP). The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially CZOP and cefpirome (CPR) showed the highest activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 13.5%, which was higher than that in the last year. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Citrobacter freundii was generally low but CZOP and CPR had a strong acitivity (MIC90: 0.25 and 0.5 microg/mL, respectively). The antibacterial activity of cephems to Klebsiella pneumoniae was good and especially cefmenoxime (CMX), cefixime (CFIX), flomoxef (FMOX), CPR, and CZOP showed stronger activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Against Serratia marcescens, meropenem (MEPM) had the highest antibacterial activity followed by CPR and CZOP. Against Proteus mirabilis, CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, MEPM, carumonam (CRMN), and levofloxacin (LVFX) showed the strongest activity (MC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Among other cephems, CZOP and CFIX were also strong (MIC90: 0.25 microg/mL). The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs were ranged from 64 to > or = 256 microg/mL except IPM and amikacin (AMK) having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activity of CZOP was relatively good (MIC50: 8 microg/mL).
TI  - Newer carbapenems for urinary tract infections.
AB  - Four carbapenems have been available clinically in Japan. These are imipenem/cilastatin (IMIP/CS) and panipenem/ betamipron (PANI/BP) of the older compounds and newer carbapenems such as biapem (BIAP) and meropenem (MERO). The latter compounds are relatively stable to dehydropeptidase-1 (DHP-1) and have been reported to have higher antimicrobial activities compared to the earlier carbapenems. The antimicrobial activity of these four carbapenems against fresh urinary isolates showed high activities against Enterobacteriacae such as Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Escherichia coli containing the class C-beta-lactamase- and extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains compared to piperacillin (PIPC) and ceftazidime (CTAZ). Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the carbapenems, with the exception of panipenem showed strong antimicrobial activities compared to PIPC and CTAZ. High activities were also seen against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, but methicillin-resistant strains were not affected. The first generation carbapenems showed better activity against E. faecalis than newer carbapenems. All four carbapenems were similar in clinical effectiveness in double blind trials for complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). However, PANI/BP is less effective in UTIs caused by P. aeruginosa than IMIP/CS. MERO showed better eradication rate of P. aeruginosa than IMIP/CS. Retrospective analysis of treated cases using carbapenems showed a rapid defervescence in the treatment of febrile complicated UTIs, which were mainly caused by mixed infection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, especially those involving P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis.
TI  - Gram-positive merA gene in gram-negative oral and urine bacteria.
AB  - Clinical mercury resistant (Hg(r)) Gram-negative bacteria carrying Gram-positive  mercury reductase (merA)-like genes were characterized using DNA-DNA hybridization, PCR and sequencing. A PCR assay was developed which discriminated between the merA genes related to Staphylococcus and those related to the Bacillus/Streptococcus merA genes by the difference in size of the PCR product. DNA sequence analysis correlated with the PCR assay. The merA genes from Acinetobacter junii, Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli were sequenced and shared 98-99% identical nucleotide (nt) and 99.6-100% amino acid identity with the Staphylococcus aureus MerA protein. A fourth merA gene, from Pantoeae agglomerans, was partially sequenced (60%) and had 99% identical nt and 100% amino acid identity with the Streptococcus oralis MerA protein. All the Hg(r) Gram-negative bacteria transferred their Gram-positive merA genes to a Gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis recipient with the resulting transconjugants expressing mercury resistance. These Gram-positive merA genes join Gram-positive tetracycline resistance and Gram-positive macrolide resistance genes in their association with mobile elements which are able to transfer and express in Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Novel tetrahydro-thieno pyridyl oxazolidinone: an antibacterial agent.
AB  - Synthesis of a number of 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-thieno[3,2-c]pyridine substituted oxazolidinones have been reported. They have been screened against a panel of Gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. A SAR has been developed. Compound 15 showed comparable activity (MIC) to linezolid and superior to eperezolid.
TI  - In vitro assessment of chlorhexidine gluconate-impregnated polyurethane foam antimicrobial dressing using zone of inhibition assays.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an antimicrobial dressing consisting of hydrophilic polyurethane foam with chlorhexidine gluconate for activity against several antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates as well as American Type Culture Collection reference strains using zone of inhibition assays. METHODS: Sterile foam samples with chlorhexidine gluconate and untreated controls were transferred onto inoculated agar plates. Plates were incubated at 35 degrees C to 37 degrees C for 24 hours and examined for zones of inhibition around the foam samples. RESULTS: Polyurethane foam with chlorhexidine gluconate showed antimicrobial activity in vitro against all of the challenge organisms including antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates. CONCLUSION: The data from this in vitro study support the hypothesis that polyurethane foam with chlorhexidine gluconate has an antimicrobial effect against antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus and Enterococcus species, as well as Candida species.
TI  - Conservative medical therapy of prosthetic joint infections: retrospective analysis of an 8-year experience.
AB  - Successful treatment of prosthetic joint infections often requires multiple surgical interventions and prolonged antimicrobial therapy. However, in certain situations, a surgical approach may not be in the best interest of the patient. A conservative approach was used to treat 34 patients with prosthetic joint infection between 1995 and 2003. Diagnosis of infection was based on clinical-microbiological evidence, confirmed by (99)Tc-labelled leukocyte scintigraphy, and involved 12 Staphylococcus aureus infections, nine Staphylococcus epidermidis infections, two Enterococcus faecalis infections, two mixed infections (S. aureus plus Pseudomonas aeruginosa; S. epidermidis plus E. faecalis), with the infecting pathogen being unidentified for nine patients. Most infections were treated initially with intravenous or intramuscular teicoplanin +/- ciprofloxacin or rifampicin, followed by oral ciprofloxacin or minocycline plus rifampicin. The mean duration of antimicrobial therapy was 41.2 weeks. Overall, only three patients did not respond to therapy, and infection was controlled in the remaining 31 patients. Among these, no relapse was observed in 17 patients during follow-up for 9-57 months; improvement with early (within 6 months of antibiotic discontinuation) or late relapse was observed in seven and three patients, respectively; two patients improved clinically, but continued to receive antibiotic therapy; and two patients whose condition improved initially were lost after a 6-month follow-up following discontinuation of antibiotics. No patient complained of side effects requiring discontinuation of antibiotic therapy. The study confirmed that suppression of infection, with salvage of the infected device in an acceptably functional state, can be achieved in selected cases.
TI  - Influence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome on host resistance against bacterial infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and host innate immunities against bacterial infections. DESIGN: Controlled animal study. SETTING: University research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Male BALB/c mice, 8-10 wks of age. INTERVENTIONS: Morbidity and mortality rates of severe SIRS mice were compared with those of mild SIRS mice after infection with Enterococcus faecalis or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or exposure to infectious complications induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). In addition, a function of effector cells related to antibacterial innate immunities for these infections was analyzed in these two groups. Furthermore, SCIDbgMN mice (SCIDbg mice depleted of antibacterial effector cells) were reconstituted with effector cells from mild or severe SIRS mice and exposed to various infections. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Severe SIRS mice were greatly susceptible to E. faecalis, MRSA, and CLP-induced sepsis. On the other hand, as compared with normal mice, mild SIRS mice were resistant to these infections. All of SCIDbgMN mice inoculated with peritoneal macrophages (PMphi) from severe SIRS mice died after infection with E. faecalis or MRSA, whereas all SCIDbgMN mice inoculated with PMphi from mild SIRS mice survived after the same infection. SCIDbgMN mice that were inoculated with PMphi from normal mice and exposed to E. faecalis, MRSA, or CLP survived at rates of 50%, 50%, or 60%, respectively. PMphi from mild SIRS mice exhibited typical properties for classically activated macrophages (CAMphi), whereas those from severe SIRS mice exhibited typical properties for alternatively activated macrophages (AAMphi). CONCLUSIONS: Mphi-associated host antibacterial innate immunities are greatly influenced by SIRS levels. CAMphi, effector cells for the antibacterial innate immunity against E. faecalis, MRSA, and CLP-induced sepsis, are induced in mild SIRS mice. AAMphi with no antibacterial capabilities are generated in mice with severe SIRS. Induction of CAMphi may protect severe SIRS patients against infections.
TI  - The cme gene of Clostridium difficile confers multidrug resistance in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance in C. difficile by efflux has been previously suggested. The genome of C. difficile 630 was screened for sequences encoding putative proteins homologous to NorA from Staphylococcus aureus. Four ORFs homologous to efflux genes were cloned into the pAT79 shuttle vector under the control of transcription and translation signals of Gram-positive bacteria and expressed in Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 and S. aureus RN4220. One of these sequences, designated cme conferred resistance to ethidium bromide, safranin O, and erythromycin in E. faecalis. The three other ORFs did not confer detectable resistance in both bacteria.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of five root canal sealers.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to analyze the antimicrobial properties of five  endodontic sealers: Endo Fill, Endomethasone, Endomethasone N, Sealer 26 and AH-Plus, against the following microorganisms: Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces naeslundii. The sealers were tested immediately, 24 h, 48 h and 7 days after manipulation.The direct contact method through the observation of the microbial growth in liquid medium and the agar diffusion test were used to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of the sealers. The results, in both methodologies used, showed that immediately after manipulation, Endo-Fill and Endomethasone demonstrated the highest antimicrobial activity, with no statistically significant difference between them. Sealer 26 demonstrated the lowest antimicrobial activity. At all other times after manipulation, there were no statistically significant differences among all the sealers tested. In conclusion, none of the sealers totally inhibited the growth of the microorganisms. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity of each sealer decreased with time and was dependent upon the microbial susceptibility to them.
TI  - Sensitivity of the BacT/ALERT FA-medium for detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in pre-incubated blood cultures and its temperature-dependence.
AB  - The BacT/ALERT FA-medium was evaluated to detect Pseudomonas aeruginosa in pre-incubated blood samples. As published previously its predecessor the BacT/ALERT FAN-medium failed to detect P. aeruginosa in delayed entry samples. It is now reported that FA-medium tolerates a longer pre-incubation period at 36 degrees C, i.e. 8 h, before detection of P. aeruginosa fails in experimentally inoculated blood cultures. In clinical blood samples the frequency of false-negative results concerning P. aeruginosa was reduced from 46.9 % (FAN-medium) to 9.1 % (FA-medium). If media inoculated with P. aeruginosa are pre-incubated at room temperature for 24 h, false-negative results are not observed. Various micro-organisms (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida glabrata) were recognized after pre-incubation at room temperature with similar sensitivity compared to pre-incubation at 36 degrees C. It is concluded that FA-medium detects P. aeruginosa in delayed entry samples with increased sensitivity and pre-incubation at room temperature is superior to pre-incubation at 36 degrees C.
TI  - Nosocomial bloodstream infections in US hospitals: analysis of 24,179 cases from  a prospective nationwide surveillance study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nosocomial bloodstream infections (BSIs) are important causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. METHODS: Data from a nationwide, concurrent surveillance study (Surveillance and Control of Pathogens of Epidemiological Importance [SCOPE]) were used to examine the secular trends in the epidemiology and microbiology of nosocomial BSIs. RESULTS: Our study detected 24,179 cases of nosocomial BSI in 49 US hospitals over a 7-year period from March 1995 through September 2002 (60 cases per 10,000 hospital admissions). Eighty-seven percent of BSIs were monomicrobial. Gram-positive organisms caused 65% of these BSIs, gram-negative organisms caused 25%, and fungi caused 9.5%. The crude mortality rate was 27%. The most-common organisms causing BSIs were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (31% of isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (20%), enterococci (9%), and Candida species (9%). The mean interval between admission and infection was 13 days for infection with Escherichia coli, 16 days for S. aureus, 22 days for Candida species and Klebsiella species, 23 days for enterococci, and 26 days for Acinetobacter species. CoNS, Pseudomonas species, Enterobacter species, Serratia species, and Acinetobacter species were more likely to cause infections in patients in intensive care units (P<.001). In neutropenic patients, infections with Candida species, enterococci, and viridans group streptococci were significantly more common. The proportion of S. aureus isolates with methicillin resistance increased from 22% in 1995 to 57% in 2001 (P<.001, trend analysis). Vancomycin resistance was seen in 2% of Enterococcus faecalis isolates and in 60% of Enterococcus faecium isolates. CONCLUSION: In this study, one of the largest multicenter studies performed to date, we found that the proportion of nosocomial BSIs due to antibiotic-resistant organisms is increasing in US hospitals.
TI  - Use of irradiation to control foodborne pathogens and extend the refrigerated market life of rabbit meat.
AB  - This study set out to evaluate the microbiological status of rabbit meat and the  possibility of using irradiation to control foodborne pathogenic bacteria and extend the refrigerated storage life of meat. Rabbit meat samples were gamma irradiated at doses of 0, 1.5 and 3 kGy. The samples were stored at refrigeration temperature, then the effects of irradiation and storage on their microbiological, chemical and sensory properties were studied. Irradiation at 1.5 kGy significantly reduced the counts of Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis and enterobacteriaceae but was not enough for complete elimination of Salmonella. However, 3 kGy dose reduced the counts of S. aureus, L. monocytogenes, E. faecalis and enterobacteriaceae by more than 3, 3, 1.4 and 4 log units, respectively, while Salmonella was not detected. On the other hand, irradiation at 1.5 and 3 kGy significantly reduced the counts of aerobic mesophilic bacteria, psychrophilic bacteria and molds and yeasts and prolonged the refrigerated shelf-life of samples to 12 and 21 days, respectively, compared to 6 days for non-irradiated controls. Irradiation of samples significantly increased their amounts of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) but had no significant effects on their total volatile nitrogen (TVN) contents, while storage significantly increased the TBARS and TVN for irradiated and non-irradiated samples. gamma irradiation showed no significant effects on the sensory properties of raw meat. Moreover, fried burgers prepared from irradiated rabbit meat showed high sensory acceptability similar to those prepared from non-irradiated meat.
TI  - Emerging resistance among bacterial pathogens in the intensive care unit--a European and North American Surveillance study (2000-2002).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Globally ICUs are encountering emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and for some pathogens there are few therapeutic options available. METHODS: Antibiotic in vitro susceptibility data of predominant ICU pathogens during 2000-2 were analyzed using data from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Databases in Europe (France, Germany and Italy), Canada, and the United States (US). RESULTS: Oxacillin resistance rates among Staphylococcus aureus isolates ranged from 19.7% to 59.4%. Penicillin resistance rates among Streptococcus pneumoniae varied from 2.0% in Germany to as high as 20.2% in the US; however, ceftriaxone resistance rates were comparably lower, ranging from 0% in Germany to 3.4% in Italy. Vancomycin resistance rates among Enterococcus faecalis were < or = 4.5%; however, among Enterococcus faecium vancomycin resistance rates were more frequent ranging from 0.8% in France to 76.3% in the United States. Putative rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production among Enterobacteriaceae were low, <6% among Escherichia coli in the five countries studied. Ceftriaxone resistance rates were generally lower than or similar to piperacillin-tazobactam for most of the Enterobacteriaceae species examined. Fluoroquinolone resistance rates were generally higher for E. coli (6.5% - 13.9%), Proteus mirabilis (0-34.7%), and Morganella morganii (1.6-20.7%) than other Enterobacteriaceae spp (1.5-21.3%). P. aeruginosa demonstrated marked variation in beta-lactam resistance rates among countries. Imipenem was the most active compound tested against Acinetobacter spp., based on resistance rates. CONCLUSION: There was a wide distribution in resistance patterns among the five countries. Compared with other countries, Italy showed the highest resistance rates to all the organisms with the exception of Enterococcus spp., which were highest in the US. This data highlights the differences in resistance encountered in intensive care units in Europe and North America and the need to determine current local resistance patterns by which to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy for intensive care infections.
TI  - Synthesis of mosaic peptidoglycan cross-bridges by hybrid peptidoglycan assembly  pathways in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The peptidoglycan cross-bridges of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis,  and Enterococcus faecium consist of the sequences Gly(5), l-Ala(2), and d-Asx, respectively. Expression of the fmhB, femA, and femB genes of S. aureus in E. faecalis led to the production of peptidoglycan precursors substituted by mosaic side chains that were efficiently used by the penicillin-binding proteins for cross-bridge formation. The Fem transferases were specific for incorporation of glycyl residues at defined positions of the side chains in the absence of any additional S. aureus factors such as tRNAs used for amino acid activation. The PBPs of E. faecalis displayed a broad substrate specificity because mosaic side chains containing from 1 to 5 residues and Gly instead of l-Ala at the N-terminal position were used for peptidoglycan cross-linking. Low affinity PBP2a of S. aureus conferred beta-lactam resistance in E. faecalis and E. faecium, thereby indicating that there was no barrier to heterospecific expression of resistance caused by variations in the structure of peptidoglycan precursors. Thus, conservation of the structure of the peptidoglycan cross-bridges in members of the same species reflects the high specificity of the enzymes for side chain synthesis, although this is not essential for the activity of the PBPs.
TI  - Domain-domain interactions in the aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance enzyme AAC(6')-APH(2'').
AB  - The most common determinant of aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance in Gram positive bacterial pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, is a modifying enzyme, AAC(6')-APH(2' '), capable of acetylating and phosphorylating a wide range of antibiotics. This enzyme is unique in that it is composed of two separable modification domains, and although a number of studies have been conducted on the acetyltransferase and phosphotransferase activities in isolation, little is known about the role and impact of domain interactions on antibiotic resistance. Kinetic analysis and in vivo assessment of a number of N- and C-terminal truncated proteins have demonstrated that the two domains operate independently and do not accentuate one another's resistance activity. However, the two domains are structurally integrated, and mutational analysis has demonstrated that a predicted connecting alpha-helix is especially critical for maintaining proper structure and function of both activities. AAC(6')-APH(2' ') detoxifies a staggering array of aminoglycosides, where one or both activities make important contributions depending on the antibiotic. Thus, to overcome antibiotic resistance associated with AAC(6')-APH(2' '), aminoglycosides resistant to modification and/or inhibitors against both activities must be employed. Domain-domain interactions in AAC(6')-APH(2' ') offer a unique target for inhibitor strategies, as we show that their disruption simultaneously inhibits both activities >90%.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of telavancin (TD-6424), a novel bactericidal agent, against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Telavancin (TD-6424) is a novel lipoglycopeptide that produces rapid and concentration-dependent killing of clinically relevant gram-positive organisms in vitro. The present studies evaluated the in vivo pharmacodynamics of telavancin in the mouse neutropenic thigh (MNT) and mouse subcutaneous infection (MSI) animal models. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies in the MNT model demonstrated that the 24-h area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)/MIC ratio was the best predictor of efficacy. Telavancin produced dose-dependent reduction of thigh titers of several organisms, including methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), penicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. The 50% effective dose (ED50) estimates for telavancin ranged from 0.5 to 6.6 mg/kg of body weight (administered intravenously), and titers were reduced by up to 3 log10 CFU/g from pretreatment values. Against MRSA ATCC 33591, telavancin was 4- and 30-fold more potent (on an ED50 basis) than vancomycin and linezolid, respectively. Against MSSA ATCC 13709, telavancin was 16- and 40-fold more potent than vancomycin and nafcillin, respectively. Telavancin, vancomycin, and linezolid were all efficacious and more potent against MRSA ATCC 33591 in the MSI model compared to the MNT model. This deviation in potency was, however, disproportionately greater for vancomycin and linezolid than for telavancin, suggesting that activity of telavancin is less affected by the immune status. The findings of these studies collectively suggest that once-daily dosing of telavancin may provide an effective approach for the treatment of clinically relevant infections with gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Detection and characterization of enterocins from Enterococcus sp.
AB  - Examination of 90 isolates of Enterococcus sp. revealed production of enterocin by two isolates of E. faecalis which was inhibitory to Listeria monocytogenes. Two isolates of E. gallinarum produced enterocin active against Staphylococcus aureus. None of the isolates antagonized Salmonella enteritidis. The enterocins of E. faecalis isolates were inactivated by alpha-chymotrypsin but not by trypsin and papain, while those of E. gallinarum were resistant to all the three enzymes. Enterocins produced by all 4 strains were resistant to heating at 60 degrees C for 30 min and 80 degrees C for 10 min, but sensitive to 121 degrees C for 15 min. At 100 degrees C for 10 min, two enterocins, one each of E. faecalis and E. gallinarum were inactivated, while the remaining two retained the bactericidal activity.
TI  - Influence of growth conditions on the production of a bacteriocin by Lactococcus  lactis subsp. lactis ST34BR, a strain isolated from barley beer.
AB  - Bacteriocin ST34BR, a small polypeptide of 2.9 kDa produced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ST34BR, inhibits the growth of Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. MRS broth, adjusted to pH 6.0 yielded 6,400 AU/ml, compared to 400 AU/ml recorded in BHI broth, M17 broth, 10% (w/v) soy milk, and 8% and 10% (w/v) molasses. At pH of 4.5 only 800 AU/ml was produced. Based on comparative studies in MRS broth, without organic nitrogen, supplemented with different combinations of tryptone, meat extract and yeast extract, tryptone was identified as the stimulating nitrogen compound. Growth in the presence of 20 g/l glucose, maltose, mannose or sucrose yielded bacteriocin levels of 6,400 AU/ml, whereas the same concentration of lactose and fructose yielded 3,200 AU/ml and 1,600 AU/ml, respectively. No difference in bacteriocin ST34BR activity was recorded in MRS broth supplemented with 2 g/l K2HPO4 and 2 g/l, 5 g/l, 10 g/l or 50 g/l KH2PO4. However, 20 g/l KH2PO4 increased bacteriocin ST34BR production to 12,800 AU/ml. Glycerol at 1g/l to 10 g/l in MRS broth reduced bacteriocin activity to 3,200 AU/ml, whilst 20 g/l and 50 g/l yielded only 1,600 AU/ml. The presence of cyanocobalamin, L-ascorbic acid, thiamine and DL-6,8-thioctic acid in MRS broth at 1.0 ppm, respectively, did not result in increased activity levels.
TI  - Evaluation of the prevalence and risk factors for colonization by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus among patients on dialysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) has been reported among long-term dialysis patients, although risk factors for VRE colonization are not well defined. This study aims to appraise the prevalence and risk factors for VRE colonization among patients on long-term dialysis therapy, as well as the mechanisms for dissemination of vancomycin resistance. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional survey of 320 patients on long-term dialysis therapy at 2 hospitals of the Federal University of Sao Paulo from June 2001 to March 2003. Fecal samples were collected from each patient once a week for 1 month. Samples with positive test results for VRE were submitted to molecular typing through automated ribotyping. RESULTS: VRE prevalence was 14.4%. There were significant associations between VRE and dialysis type (hemodialysis, P = 0.04), number of hospitalizations (P = 0.03), low hemoglobin level (P = 0.03), and leukocytosis (P = 0.05). Among samples with VRE (n = 56), 25% were Enterococcus faecium; 10.7%, Enterococcus casseliflavus; 57.1%, Enterococcus gallinarum; and 3.6%, Enterococcus faecalis. All samples isolated were sensitive to teicoplanin, except for E faecium samples, which were strongly resistant, although 9 of 14 patients with this isolate presented the same ribogroup (111-S-4). Typing of 6 samples from 8 dialysis patients with E gallinarum was performed, showing a predominant ribogroup (112-S-4). CONCLUSION: Hospital environment, hemodialysis, anemia, and leukocytosis appear to be associated with VRE colonization. These results suggest that dissemination of these bacteria among patients on long-term dialysis therapy may be taking place.
TI  - A family of putative MSCRAMMs from Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The recently published Enterococcus faecalis genome [Paulsen, I. T., Banerjei, L., Myers, G. S. & 29 other authors (2003). Science 299, 2071-2074)] was examined and 41 putative cell-wall-anchored proteins were identified. Seventeen of these proteins are predicted to contain tandemly repeated immunoglobulin-like folds characteristic of the structural organization of staphylococcal adhesins of the MSCRAMM (microbial surface component recognizing adhesive matrix molecules) type. Two of the nine proteins selected for further study appear to represent cell-wall-anchored enzymes. It is proposed that the remaining seven proteins constitute a family of structurally related proteins potentially interacting with proteins of the host. This family includes the previously identified collagen/laminin-binding MSCRAMM ACE [Rich, R. L., Kreikemeyer, B., Owens, R. T., LaBrenz, S., Narayana, S. V., Weinstock, G. M., Murray, B. E. & Hook, M. (1999). J Biol Chem 274, 26939-26945]. It is further demonstrated that genes encoding the seven putative MSCRAMMs are present in all E. faecalis strains tested and these proteins appear to be expressed during infection in humans, since sera from infected individuals contain antibodies reacting with recombinant versions of the enterococcal proteins.
TI  - Characterization of mesentericin ST99, a bacteriocin produced by Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum ST99 isolated from boza.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria isolated from Boza, a cereal-fermented beverage from Belogratchik, Bulgaria, were screened for the production of bacteriocins. With the first screening, 13 of the 52 isolates inhibited the growth of Listeria innocua and Lactobacillus plantarum. The cell-free supernatant of one of these strains, classified as Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum ST99, inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, several Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Clostridium spp., Carnobacterium spp., L. mesenteroides and Gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. Maximum antimicrobial activity, i.e. 6,400 arbitrary units (AU)/ml, was recorded in MRS broth after 24 h at 30 degrees C. Incubation in the presence of protease IV and pronase E resulted in loss of antimicrobial activity, confirming that growth inhibition was caused by a bacteriocin, designated here as mesentericin ST99. No loss in activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea, Triton X-100, N-laurylsarcosin, EDTA and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. Mesentericin ST99 remained active after 30 min at 121 degrees C and after 2 h of incubation at pH 2 to 12. Metabolically active cells of L. innocua treated with mesentericin ST99 did not undergo lysis. Mesentericin ST99 did not adhere to the cell surface of strain ST99. Precipitation with ammonium sulfate (70% saturation), followed by Sep-Pack C18 chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC on a C18 Nucleosil column yielded one antimicrobial peptide.
TI  - Evaluation of the Hyplex BloodScreen Multiplex PCR-Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  - We evaluated the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system (BAG, Lich, Germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive BACTEC 9240 blood culture bottles. The test involves amplification of the bacterial DNA by multiplex PCR and subsequent hybridization of the PCR product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an ELISA-based format. The available probes allow the separate detection of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal mecA gene. The Hyplex BloodScreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (S. aureus, 100%; S. epidermidis, 97.2%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). The specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (Escherichia coli, 92.5%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; Klebsiella spp., 100%; Enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; S. aureus, 100%, S. epidermidis, 97.7%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 99.6%; Streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). The result of the mecA gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus investigated. In conclusion, the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-ELISA system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the mecA gene of Staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.
TI  - Daptomycin in vitro susceptibility in European Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the activity of daptomycin, a novel  lipopeptide, against European Gram-positive isolates (n = 1539). The MIC(90)-values of daptomycin against Staphylococcus aureus isolates was 0.25 mg/L, against Enterococcus faecalis 4 mg/L, against Enterococcus faecium 8 mg/L, 0.25 mg/L against Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 0.25mg/L against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Daptomycin was equally potent against antibiotic-susceptible and resistant strains within a particular species. Based on a breakpoint of 1 mg/L for S. aureus and group A streptococci, all isolates tested were susceptible to daptomycin. Based on a breakpoint of 4 mg/L for vancomcyin-susceptible E. faecalis 99.7% of these isolates were susceptible to daptomycin.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential of immobilized Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ATCC 11454 against selected bacteria.
AB  - Immobilization of living cells of lactic acid bacteria could be an alternative or complementary method of immobilizing organic acids and bacteriocins and inhibit undesirable bacteria in foods. This study evaluated the inhibition potential of immobilized Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ATCC 11454 on selected bacteria by a modified method of the agar spot test. L. lactis was immobilized in calcium alginate (1 to 2%)-whey protein concentrate (0 and 1%) beads. The antimicrobial potential of immobilized L. lactis was evaluated in microbiological media against pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus aureus) or Pseudomonas putida, a natural meat contaminant, and against seven gram-positive bacteria used as indicator strains. Results obtained in this study indicated that immobilized L. lactis inhibited the growth of S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus sakei, Kocuria varians, and Pediococcus acidilactici. Only 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees C resulted in a clear inhibition zone around the beads that increased with time. With the addition of 10 mM of a chelating agent (EDTA) to the media, results showed growth inhibition of E. coli; however, P. putida and Salmonella Typhi were unaffected by this treatment. These results indicate that immobilized lactic acid bacteria strains can be successfully used to produce nisin and inhibit bacterial growth in semisolid synthetic media.
TI  - Results of a multicenter, randomized, open-label efficacy and safety study of two doses of tigecycline for complicated skin and skin-structure infections in hospitalized patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum glycylcycline antibiotic being investigated for the treatment of serious infections in hospitalized patients. Tigecycline has been shown to be efficacious against serious infections in animals, and preliminary studies in healthy adults have shown that tigecycline has an acceptable tolerability profile. OBJECTIVE: This study compared the clinical and microbiological efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties, and tolerability of 2 doses of tigecycline in hospitalized patients with a complicated skin and skin-structure infection (cSSSI). METHODS: This Phase II, randomized, open-label study was conducted between September 1999 and March 2001 at 14 investigative centers across the United States. Patients were randomized to receive tigecycline 25 or 50 mg IV q12h for 7 to 14 days. The primary efficacy end point was the clinically observed cure rate among clinically evaluable (CE) patients at the test-of-cure visit. Secondary end points were the clinical cure rate at the end of treatment and bacteriologic response in microbiologically evaluable (ME) patients. Also, in vitro tests of susceptibility to tigecycline were performed for selected pathogens known to cause skin infections, including methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium. Tolerability assessments also were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 160 patients received > or =1 dose of tigecycline; 109 patients were CE, and 91 were ME. The majority of patients (74%) were men, and the mean (SD) age was 49.0 (14.8) years. At the test-of-cure visit, the clinical cure rate in the 25-mg group was 67% (95% CI, 53.3%-79.3%) and in the 50-mg group was 74% (95% CI, 60.3%-85.0%). In the 25-mg group, 56% of the patients had eradication (95% CI, 40.0%-70.4%) of the pathogens compared with 69% (95% CI, 54.2%-82.3%) in the 50-mg group. Values for the minimum concentration of tigecycline that is inhibitory for 90% of all isolates ranged from 0.06 to 0.50 microg/mL for the selected pathogens. Both tigecycline doses were generally well tolerated. Nausea and vomiting were the most common adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, tigecycline appeared efficacious and showed a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and an acceptable safety profile in the treatment of hospitalized patients with cSSSI. In patients who received 50-mg doses of tigecycline q12h, the clinical cure rates and microbial eradication rates were 74% and 70%, respectively, and were 67% and 56% in patients who received 25-mg doses.
TI  - Infective endocarditis in patients with liver cirrhosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Infective endocarditis complicating liver cirrhosis is infrequently reported. This study evaluated the clinical features of infective endocarditis in Taiwanese patients with liver cirrhosis. METHODS: All cases of infective endocarditis occurring in patients with liver cirrhosis from December 1995 to December 2002 were included in this study. Data were collected by retrospective chart review. RESULTS: Twenty six patients (18 males, 8 females) with median age 6 years (range, 43 to 87) were included. The etiology of liver cirrhosis was hepatitis virus infection in 20 patients. There were 7 nosocomial infections. Bacterial pathogens were identified in 25 patients, with Staphylococcus aureus (n = 8), viridans streptococci (n = 4), Streptococcus sanguis (n = 2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2), and Enterococcus faecalis (n = 2) the most common isolates. The hospital mortality rate was 27%. Patients with in-hospital death were more likely to have a history of uremia, staphylococcal infection, nosocomial infection and less likely to have aortic valve infection. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of patients with infective endocarditis and liver cirrhosis was poor. Infection with Staphylococcus species was a dominant cause and methicillin resistance was common.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of a novel series of potent DNA gyrase inhibitors. Pyrazole derivatives.
AB  - We have previously found that a pyrazole derivative 1 possesses antibacterial activity and inhibitory activity against DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Here, we synthesized new pyrazole derivatives and found that 5-[(E)-2-(5-chloroindol-3-yl)vinyl]pyrazole 16 possesses potent antibacterial activity and selective inhibitory activity against bacterial topoisomerases. Many of the synthesized pyrazole derivatives were potent against clinically isolated quinolone- or coumarin-resistant Gram-positive strains and had minimal inhibitory concentration values against these strains equivalent to those against susceptible strains.
TI  - Relationship between antibacterial activity of chitosan and surface characteristics of cell wall.
AB  - AIM: Five representative waterborne pathogens were used to illustrate the relationship between chitosan's antibacterial activity and the surface characteristics of the bacterial cell wall. METHODS: Chitosan was prepared with averaged 75% or 95% deacetylated degree to examine its antibacterial activity against waterborne pathogens. Fresh microbial inoculants for the antibacterial assessment were prepared on nutrient agar at 37 degrees for 24 h. The evaluation items of antibacterial mechanism included hydrophilicity and negative charge analysis of cell surface, and adsorptive characteristics of chitosan to bacterial cell. All the experiments were applied in triplicate tests at least. RESULTS: Although cell wall hydrophilicity was similar among Gram-negative bacteria, the distribution of negative charge on their cell surfaces was quite different. More negatively charged cell surfaces had a greater interaction with chitosan, a phenomenon further confirmed by transmission electron micrography (TEM). CONCLUSION: Results showed the hydrophilicity in Gram-negative bacteria was much higher than in Gram-positive ones. The correlation coefficient 0.988 between the amount of absorbed chitosan and its inhibition efficiency indicated a close relationship.
TI  - Biochemical characterization of Bacillus subtilis type II isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase, and phylogenetic distribution of isoprenoid biosynthesis pathways.
AB  - An open reading frame (Acc. no. P50740) on the Bacillus subtilis chromosome extending from bp 184,997-186,043 with similarity to the idi-2 gene of Streptomyces sp. CL190 specifying type II isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase was expressed in a recombinant Escherichia coli strain. The recombinant protein with a subunit mass of 39 kDa was purified to apparent homogeneity by column chromatography. The protein was shown to catalyse the conversion of dimethylallyl diphosphate into isopentenyl diphosphate and vice versa at rates of 0.23 and 0.63 micromol.mg(-1).min(-1), respectively, as diagnosed by 1H spectroscopy. FMN and divalent cations are required for catalytic activity; the highest rates were found with Ca2+. NADPH is required under aerobic but not under anaerobic assay conditions. The enzyme is related to a widespread family of (S)-alpha-hydroxyacid oxidizing enzymes including flavocytochrome b2 and L-lactate dehydrogenase and was shown to catalyse the formation of [2,3-13C2]lactate from [2,3-13C2]pyruvate, albeit at a low rate of 1 nmol.mg(-1).min(-1). Putative genes specifying type II isopentenyl diphosphate isomerases were found in the genomes of Archaea and of certain eubacteria but not in the genomes of fungi, animals and plants. The analysis of the occurrence of idi-1 and idi-2 genes in conjunction with the mevalonate and nonmevalonate pathway in 283 completed and unfinished prokaryotic genomes revealed 10 different classes. Type II isomerase is essential in some important human pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis where it may represent a novel target for anti-infective therapy.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of O-substituted nocathiacin I derivatives.
AB  - The synthesis and antibacterial activity of a series of new nocathiacin I derivatives (1-12) containing polar water solubilizing groups is described. Most of these compounds exhibited potent antibacterial activity and have improved water solubility. In addition, compounds 5, 7-9 also exhibited potent in vivo activity.
TI  - [Streptococcus salivarius meningitis after spinal anesthesia].
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius is a usual commensal of skin, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, oral cavity and paranasal sinuses. Although it is usually considered to have low virulence, S. salivarius may cause life-threatening infections, particularly endocarditis. On the other hand, bacterial meningitis after spinal anesthesia is very rare, there being some reported cases caused by S. salivarius, S. mitis, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. We report a 57 year old man who developed meningitis symptoms within 10 h of an uncomplicated inguinal herniorrhaphy performed during spinal anesthesia. Cerebrospinal cultures grew S. salivarius sensitive to penicillin. The patient was successfully treated with penicillin G and left the hospital without sequelae. In the literature, bacterial meningitis due to S. salivarius is rarely reported. Of the 28 cases, 18 occurred after lumbar puncture for diagnostic or for spinal anesthesia, 5 occurred following a bacteriemia for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy or intestinal neoplasia, and the other 5 in patients who had dural defects. We discuss the possible etiological causes of the meningitis due to S. salivarius cases reports. The early recognition of this entity and the aseptic precautions likely to reduce the incidence of infectious complications after lumbar puncture are stressed.
TI  - Susceptibility to quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid in 839 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci from Norway.
AB  - A total of 839 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci from Norway including Staphylococcus aureus (n = 214), coagulase negative Staphylococcus spp. (n = 100), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 99), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 80), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 127), Streptococcus spp. viridans group (n = 70), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 75), and Enterococcus faecium (n = 74), were tested by E-test for susceptibility to a range of antimicrobials including the novel antibiotics quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid. Subgroups of oxacillin resistant S. aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus spp., penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus spp. were specifically included as they are the intended targets for these new drugs. All isolates were susceptible to linezolid (MIC5o and MIC9o 0.25-2.0 mg/l, MIC range 0.12-2 mg/l). Staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates were also susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin except for some intermediately susceptible viridans group isolates (MIC54, and MIC90 0.25-2 mg/l, MIC range 0.125-2 mg/l). Enterococcus faecium (MIC90 = 4.0 mg/l) and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC50 = 8.0 mg/l, MIC90 > or = 32 mg/l) were less susceptible to this substance. There was no linkage between reduced susceptibility to linezolid or quinupristin-dalfopristin and resistance to other classes of antimicrobials. The study demonstrated a high prevalence of in vitro susceptibility to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin, which is necessary for their use in the treatment of infections with resistant Gram-positive pathogens. The results were used to evaluate the appropriateness of breakpoints and to define a baseline for monitoring possible future emergence of resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid in Norway.
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin against isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci: first results from Turkey.
AB  
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of eucalyptus leaf extracts and flavonoids from Eucalyptus maculata.
AB  - AIMS: We investigated the antimicrobial activities of eucalyptus leaf extracts to find effective antibacterial agents. METHODS AND RESULTS: The antimicrobial activities of leaf extracts from 26 species of eucalyptus were measured. Extracts of Eucalyptus globulus, E. maculata and E. viminalis significantly inhibited the growth of six Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, Propionibacterium acnes), and of a fungus (Trichophyton mentagrophytes), but they did not show strong antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida). 2',6'-dihydroxy-3'-methyl-4'-methoxy-dihydrochalcone, eucalyptin and 8-desmethyl-eucalyptin, isolated from E. maculata extracts, exhibited potent antimicrobial activities against seven micro-organisms with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 1.0 to 31 mg l(-1). CONCLUSIONS: The eucalyptus extracts and three compounds from E. maculata were found to be effective against micro-organisms that cause food poisoning, acne and athlete's foot. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study shows potential uses of extracts from E. globulus, E. maculata and E. viminalis, and antimicrobial compounds isolated from E. maculata.
TI  - [Search of promising strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus for the development of new biopreparations].
AB  - For the first time the species composition of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in  clinically healthy young children has been studied. As revealed in this study, the dominating species of bifidobacteria are B. longum, B. adolescentis and B. infantis, while the dominating species of lactobacilli are Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. rhamnosus. In 83 isolated cultures of bifidobacteria and 34 isolated species of lactobacilli the activity of acid formation and the antagonistic activity with respect to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens have been tested. B. longum strain 58B, B. infantis strain 37B, L. rhamnosus strain 12L and L. acidophilus strain 27L, typical for children of this age group, having good antagonistic activity and pronounced acid-forming properties, have been selected. These strains hold good promise to be used as the basis for the development of a complex probiotic preparation for correcting intestinal microflora in young children.
TI  - Effect of combined physico-chemical preservatives on enterocin AS-48 activity against the enterotoxigenic Staphylococcus aureus CECT 976 strain.
AB  - AIMS: Control of the enterotoxigenic Staphylococcus aureus CECT 976 strain by enterocin AS-48 in laboratory cultures, and behaviour of the AS-48 activity in the presence of food preservatives. METHODS AND RESULTS: Enterocin AS-48 shows inhibitory activity on the majority of the Staphylococcus species tested. This enterocin has a bactericidal and bacteriolytic mode of action on S. aureus CECT 976, a strain selected for this study by its enterotoxigenic character (SEA production). The inhibitory effect of AS-48 was pH and temperature dependent, and enterocin activity was higher at pH 5. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of AS-48, decreased from 15 microg ml(-1) at 37 degrees C to 10 microg ml(-1) at 15 degrees C. Sublethally injured cells showed an increased sensitivity with a MBC of 5 microg ml(-1). In this way, the highest effectiveness of Ent AS-48 against S. aureus CECT 976 was obtained at 4 degrees C in combination with high concentrations of NaCl (6 and 7%). Interestingly, enterotoxin SEA production by strain CECT 976 was markedly inhibited by subinhibitory concentrations of Ent AS-48. These low concentrations also provoked a delay of bacterial growth. CONCLUSION: The results presented indicated that Ent AS-48 has a potential for application as a protective agent against S. aureus in foods. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In this study, we have established the conditions for an efficient inhibition of growth and enterotoxin production by S. aureus CECT 976 in culture media by a combination of environmental factors and Ent AS-48.
TI  - In vitro modeling of dental water line contamination and decontamination.
AB  - The contamination of dental unit water lines (DUWL) is an emerging concern in dentistry. The aim of this study was to use an in vitro DUWL to model microbial contamination and evaluate the decontamination efficacy of tetraacetylethylenediamine (TAED) solutions. A DUWL biofilm model used to simulate clinical conditions was used to generate a range of biofilms in DUWL. Three distinct biofilms were generated: (1) biofilm from water, (2) biofilm from a mix of water + contaminating human commensal bacteria, (3) biofilm from water with contaminating oral bacteria added after biofilm formed. The contaminating oral species used were Streptococcus oralis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. Decontamination by simple water flushing or flushing with TAED was evaluated (2, 5 and 10 min intervals). The DUWL tubes were split and samples were plated onto a range of media, incubated and bacteria enumerated. Water flushing did not reduce the number of microorganisms detected. Bacteria were not detected from any of the TAED sampling points for any of the biofilm types tested. Interestingly, if contamination was introduced to new DUWL along with the waterborne species a biofilm was formed containing only the waterborne species. If however, an existing biofilm was present before the introduction of "contaminating" bacteria then these could be detected in the biofilm. This implies that if the DUWL are new or satisfactorily cleaned on a regular basis then the associated cross-contamination aspects are reduced. In conclusion, TAED provides effective control for DUWL biofilms.
TI  - Traditional medicine in north Cote-d'Ivoire: screening of 50 medicinal plants for antibacterial activity.
AB  - Sixty-seven crude ethanol extracts from 50 plants (31 families), which are used in North Cote-d'Ivoire as traditional remedies for bacterial diseases, were screened for in vitro activity against Gram negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus subtilis) bacteria. Thirty-one extracts showed antibacterial activity only on Gram positive bacteria. Of these, 10 extracts from 10 plant species had a promising level of activity against bacteria including strains resistant to antibiotics such as aminosides, penicillin M, macrolides, lincosamide and streptrogramin B. The most active was Erythrina senegalensis DC (Fabaceae) followed by Bobgunnia madagascariensis (Desv.) J.H. Kirkbr. & Wiersema (Caesalpinaceae), Waltheria lanceolata R. Br. ex Mast. (Sterculiaceae), Uapaca togoensis Pax. (Euphorbiaceae), Ximenia americana L. (Olacaceae), Khaya senegalensis (Ders.) A. Juss. (Meliaceae), Lannea acida A. Rich. (Anacardiaceae), Cissus populnea Guill. & Perr. (Vitaceae), Keetia hispida (Benth.) Bridson (Rubiaceae) and Ficus thonningii (Miq.) A. Rich. (Moraceae). This is the first report of the antibacterial potency of these 10 plant species on a range of bacteria. The results provided evidence that some of the studied plants might indeed be potential sources of new antibacterial agents, also against some antibiotic-resistant strains.
TI  - Virulence potential of the staphylococcal adhesin CNA in experimental arthritis is determined by its affinity for collagen.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of bacterial arthritis, which  often results in severe joint damage. CNA, a collagen adhesin of S. aureus, was shown to be a virulence factor in several animal models. However, the precise molecular mechanism by which CNA contributes to virulence remains unclear. METHODS: We examined the role of the collagen-binding function of CNA in a mouse model of septic arthritis by comparing the virulence of isogenic strains of S. aureus expressing (1) wild-type CNA, (2) a truncated form of CNA (CNA35) with a higher affinity for collagen than the wild type, (3) CNA35 containing a single point mutation resulting in loss of collagen binding, (4) CNA lacking the collagen-binding domain, and (5) the collagen-binding domain of ACE (adhesin of collagen from Enterococcus faecalis). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results provide, for the first time, direct evidence that the virulence of CNA depends on its collagen-binding ability. Collagen binding facilitated early colonization of the joints of mice. Furthermore, the virulence potential of the adhesin is determined by the adhesin's affinity for its ligand, as well as its binding kinetics.
TI  - Vancomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Vancomycin resistance in enterococci, predominantly Enterococcus faecium, developed in the latter half of the 1980s, and the long anticipated development of vancomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus has now occurred. A number of vancomycin-intermediate strains have been described, and these strains have abnormal, thickened cell walls in the presence of vancomycin. Two mechanisms of resistance have been described in the strains: affinity trapping of vancomycin molecules by cell wall monomers and clogging of the outer layers of peptidoglycan by bound vancomycin molecules, and change in the structure or metabolism of teichoic acids. Of more serious concern has been the description in 2002 of two patients with vancomycin-resistant S aureus infections. In one instance, the patient had skin lesions coinfected with vancomycin resistant, vanA genotype, E faecalis, and the vanA resistance genes could have been transferred to the S aureus strain. Expression of resistance was high in one S aureus strain and low in the other, making detection more challenging in the latter instance. These developments are of great concern, and every effort should be made to prevent further development and spread of vancomycin resistance in staphylococci.
TI  - [Bact-Alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. First Argentine multicentre study].
AB  - Bact-Alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. First Argentine multicentre study. Between January and December 2001, we analyzed 80,141 blood cultures by the Bact-Alert system (14,960 FAN aerobics, 3,855 FAN anaerobic, 11,114 standards aerobics, 11,367 standards anaerobic, 12,054 pediatrics and 26,791 FAN pediatrics bottles) and 44.235 series from 27.615 patients at eight hospitals of Buenos Aires city, one of La Plata city and three of the Buenos Aires province. A total of 13,657 blood cultures yielded a positive result. Only 181 of them had been detected as positive between the 5th and 7th day of incubation and only 26 (0.19%) had clinical significance (Staphylococcus aureus 3; coagulase negative staphylococci 2; Enterococcus faecalis 1; Streptococcus pneumoniae 2; Campylobacter spp 1; Escherichia coli 1; Enterobacter cloacae 1; Enterobacteraerogenes 1; Citrobacter freundii 1; Klebsiella pneumoniae 1; Proteus mirabilis 1; Serratia marcescens 4; yeasts 7, including one strain of Cryptococcus neoformans). Of the total of contaminants, 38% were isolated by the anaerobic standard (65% were Propionibacterium spp and 29% coagulase negative staphylococci), 31.2% by the FAN aerobic (33.3% difphteroids and 28.9% Bacillus spp), 11.8% by the pediatric, 9% by FAN pediatric, 8.33% by aerobic standard and 1.4% by FAN anaerobic bottle. Our results show that the prolonged incubation of blood cultures for more than 5 days using the Bact-Alert system is unnecessary.
TI  - The effects of chlorhexidine gluconate (0.12%) on the antimicrobial properties of tooth-colored ProRoot mineral trioxide aggregate.
AB  - The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether the substitution of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for sterile water as a mixing agent would enhance the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored ProRoot mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) against Actinomyces odontolyticus (ATCC17982), Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC2586), Streptococcus sanguis (ATCC10556), Enterococcus faecalis (ER3/2S), Escherichia coli (SM10lambdapir), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC6538), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (UME), and Candida albicans (ATCC10261). Two wells of 5-mm diameter were made in triplicate agar plates inoculated with standardized suspensions of each microorganism. MTA (33 mg) mixed with chlorhexidine (12 microl) or sterile water (12 microl) was placed to fill each well. Plates were incubated at 37 degrees C as required for microbial growth. A blinded, independent observer measured zones of inhibition. All MTA samples inhibited microbial growth regardless of mixing agent. MTA/chlorhexidine showed significantly larger zones of inhibition (p < 0.0002, paired t test). In conclusion, substituting 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for water enhanced the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored ProRoot MTA.
TI  - Chemometric studies on the bactericidal activity of quinolones via an extended VolSurf approach.
AB  - An extended VolSurf approach, that additionally includes SHAPE descriptors, was applied to a dataset of 55 quinolones. Bactericidal activity was measured at Bayer AG, Germany, for Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis). Chemometric analysis was first approached via a classical VolSurf approach. The following descriptors were found most important: bactericidal activity particularly increases with high values of the best volume (BV11(OH2)) and the minimum energy (Emin1(OH2)) of the water probe, high values of the integy moment (ID(DRY)) of the lipophilic probe, and high values of the hydrophilic region (W(O)) of the hydrogen bond acceptor probe. Best volume (BV31(OH2)) of the water probe and best volume (BV12(DRY)) and lipophilic regions (D(DRY)) of the lipophilic probe as well as H-bonding capacity derived with the CO probe (HB(O)) are inversely related to activity. PLS analysis yields a five-component model with an r(2) of 0.83 and a q(2) of 0.43 after variable selection via fractional factorial design (FFD). Chemometric modeling could be improved by including newly derived SHAPE descriptors, which were merged with the VolSurf descriptors and subjected to PLS analysis. The global model of this extended VolSurf approach is optimal with two components and exhibits a significantly improved statistical quality; a marginally reduced r(2) (0.75 versus 0.83) is more than compensated by a highly improved predictivity with a q(2) of 0.63 versus 0.43. To prove model quality, external prediction of seven test set quinolones was performed. The precise prediction of all test set molecules nicely demonstrates the robustness and statistical significance of the obtained chemometric model using the extended VolSurf approach.
TI  - Glycopeptide resistance in Staphylococcus aureus: is it a real threat?
AB  - Following the discovery in 1992 that resistance to vancomycin could be transferred in vitro from a strain of Staphylococcus haemolyticus to Staphylococcus aureus, the threat that a similar event could happen in vivo has existed. In 1996, the threat became a reality in Japan followed by reports of low-level heteroresistant S. aureus from elsewhere in the world. However, the threat has not gone away; indeed it has become more intimidating within the past 2 years with the isolation of higher-level resistance to vancomycin transferred on a plasmid from Enterococcus faecalis. The mechanisms of resistance are different in each of the types of S. aureus with reduced susceptibility to the glycopeptides: in one hetero-vancomycin intermediate-susceptible S. aureus (hVISA) and vancomycin intermediate-susceptible S. aureus (VISA), cell wall biosynthesis is altered, hindering glycopeptide reaching its target, and in the other vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) the target is altered. This review attempts to place into context the threat posed to patients by the appearance of strains of S. aureus more resistant to one of the key therapeutic agents used in our hospitals. It will do so by raising a number of important questions followed by the presentation of experimental evidence that may or may not provide answers that heighten or lower the threat.
TI  - Omega-pyridiniumalkylethers of steroidal phenols: new compounds with potent antibacterial and antiproliferative activities.
AB  - Novel omega-pyridiniumalkylethers of two steroidal phenols were synthesized as compounds with potential antimicrobial activity. 3-Hydroxy-estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-17-one and 1-hydroxy-4-methyl-estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-17-one were reacted with omega,omega'-dibromoalkanes to omega-bromoalkoxy-estra-1,3,5(10)-trienes followed by reaction with pyridine to obtain the desired steroidal omega-pyridiniumalkoxy compounds as bromides. Their antimicrobial activity against strains of multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis and fast growing mycobacteria depends clearly on the length of the alkyl chain. A strong broadband activity has been found for the compounds with eight or 10 C-atoms; in some cases better than ciprofloxacin or cetylpyridinium salts. In addition, the antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity depends on the chain length, too. The differentiation between antibacterial and cytotoxic activity is better for the steroid hybrid molecules than the cetylpyridinium salts. These new compounds can serve as lead compounds for further optimization.
TI  - [Vancomycin resistant enterococci in the Netherlands].
AB  - Enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium) are relatively avirulent enteric bacteria that usually only cause infections in immunocompromised patients. Antimicrobial treatment, however, is hampered as enterococci are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics. For years, vancomycin was considered the last available antibiotic. Plasmid-mediated resistance against vancomycin among enterococci was first described in the nineteen-eighties and since then incidences of infection caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have increased dramatically, especially in the United States. In 2000, three outbreaks of VRE occurred in hospitals in the Netherlands and a set of infection-control measures was proposed to limit further transmission. These measures were based on the simultaneous isolation of VRE from multiple patients. All three outbreaks were controlled by these measures and no new outbreaks in Dutch hospitals have been reported since then. Epidemiological studies have shown that hospital outbreaks on three continents were caused by a subpopulation of E. faecium, which is characterized by the presence of a potential virulence gene (variant esp) and resistance to amoxicillin. This 'hospital strain' of E. faecium has probably been prevalent within hospital settings for some time, but only became clinically relevant when it had acquired vancomycin-resistance. Current advice is to implement the set of infection control measures formulated in 2000, only in those patients colonized by amoxicillin-resistant VRE. The potential dangers of VRE were recently underlined by the proven transmission of the vancomycin-resistance gene from VRE to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in two patients in the United States. It is in the interest of the patients that prevalence of VRE and MRSA in Dutch hospitals should be kept as low as possible.
TI  - Sensitization of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to jenseniin G by sublethal injury.
AB  - Jenseniin G, a bacteriocin produced by Propionibacterium thoenii P126, is active  against related propionibacteria and some lactic acid bacteria and is sporostatic to botulinal spores. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of sublethal stress on jenseniin G activity. Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, and Yersinia enterocolitica were subjected to temperature, acid, and osmotic stresses in the presence of jenseniin G. The bacteriocin reduced the viability of sublethally injured cultures, although the extent of reduction varied with strain and treatment. E. faecalis was the most sensitive to temperature stress; no reduction of viable counts occurred in the absence of jenseniin G, and a 1.5-log reduction occurred in the presence of jenseniin G. B. cereus, L. monocytogenes, and S. aureus were more sensitive to jenseniin G when exposed to heat stress than when exposed to cold stress, whereas E. coli, Salmonella Typhimurium, and S. flexneri were more sensitive to jenseniin G when exposed to cold stress than when exposed to heat stress. When comparing an acid stress test alone to a combination of acid stress and jenseniin G, E. faecalis and L. monocytogenes showed the greatest sensitivities with 4.87- and 2.82-log reductions, respectively, after 7 days. All cultures except for S. aureus were adversely affected by the combination of salt stress and jenseniin G. Salmonella Typhimurium showed the greatest sensitivity to salt stress with jenseniin G (a 1.54-log reduction at day 7) when compared to salt stress alone (a 0.55-log reduction at day 7). Jenseniin G, like bacteriocins produced by other gram-positive species, has broader activity against stressed organisms.
TI  - Prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from blood cultures of hospitalized patients in the United States in 2002.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infections are associated with significant patient morbidity and mortality. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns should guide the choice of empiric antimicrobial regimens for patients with bacteremia. METHODS: From January to December of 2002, 82,569 bacterial blood culture isolates were reported to The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA by 268 laboratories. Susceptibility to relevant antibiotic compounds was analyzed using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines. RESULTS: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (42.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (16.5%), Enterococcus faecalis (8.3%), Escherichia coli (7.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.6%), and Enterococcus faecium (3.5%) were the most frequently isolated bacteria from blood cultures, collectively accounting for >80% of isolates. In vitro susceptibility to expanded-spectrum beta-lactams such as ceftriaxone were high for oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (98.7%), oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus (99.8%), E. coli (97.3%), K. pneumoniae (93.3%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (97.2%). Susceptibilities to fluoroquinolones were variable for K. pneumoniae (90.3-91.4%), E. coli (86.0-86.7%), oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus (84.0-89.4%), oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (72.7-82.7%), E. faecalis (52.1%), and E. faecium (11.3%). Combinations of antimicrobials are often prescribed as empiric therapy for bacteremia. Susceptibilities of all blood culture isolates to one or both agents in combinations of ceftriaxone, ceftazdime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam or ciprofloxacin plus gentamicin were consistent (range, 74.8-76.3%) but lower than similar beta-lactam or ciprofloxacin combinations with vancomycin (range, 93.5-96.6%). CONCLUSION: Ongoing surveillance for antimicrobial susceptibility remains essential, and will enhance efforts to identify resistance and attempt to limit its spread.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of the pathogens of bacteraemia in the UK and Ireland 2001-2002: the BSAC Bacteraemia Resistance Surveillance Programme.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the current patterns of antimicrobial resistance in the major pathogens of bacteraemia in the UK and Ireland, to highlight any unexpected resistance patterns and to act as a reference baseline for future studies. METHODS: In 2001 and 2002, 5092 blood culture isolates were collected by 29 laboratories distributed across the UK and Ireland. A single central laboratory re-identified the isolates and measured MICs by the BSAC agar dilution method. RESULTS: Oxacillin resistance was found in 42% of Staphylococcus aureus and 76% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Streptococci were generally susceptible to beta-lactams, but tetracycline resistance was common (except in Streptococcus pneumoniae) and particularly common among group B isolates (82% resistant). Nine percent of S. pneumoniae had reduced susceptibility to penicillin (MICs 0.12-1 mg/L), but none required >/=2 mg/L for inhibition. High-level gentamicin resistance was seen in 43% of Enterococcus faecalis, often in combination with raised ciprofloxacin MICs (>/=32 mg/L), but these isolates remained susceptible to ampicillin and imipenem. Only linezolid and tigecycline showed in vitro potency against a large proportion of Enterococcus faecium. Vancomycin resistance was restricted to enterococci (20% of E. faecium, 3% of E. faecalis) and a single isolate of coagulase-negative staphylococci (0.2%, MIC of 8 mg/L). Escherichia coli isolates were commonly resistant to amoxicillin (56%) and tetracycline (88%) but remained susceptible to ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in 2% of E. coli (none in 2001, 3.2% in 2002), 5% of Klebsiella spp. and 8% of Enterobacter spp. Resistance rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam were between 4% and 7%. Among the newly licensed and developmental agents, there was no resistance to linezolid in Gram-positive organisms. Ertapenem had a wide spectrum, covering Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci. MICs of tigecycline were low for Gram-positive species and Enterobacteriaceae except Proteeae and Enterobacter spp. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial resistance among major bloodstream pathogens to those antimicrobials often selected for empirical therapy was relatively uncommon in 2001-2002, usually <10%. An important exception was oxacillin resistance in S. aureus.
TI  - Design, synthesis and structure-activity relationship studies of novel indazole analogues as DNA gyrase inhibitors with Gram-positive antibacterial activity.
AB  - In this study, we report the design, synthesis and structure-activity relationships of novel indazole derivatives as DNA gyrase inhibitors with Gram-positive antibacterial activity. Our results show that selected compounds from this series exhibit potent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria including multi-drug resistant strains that is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE).
TI  - Evaluation of the antimicrobial effect of Er:YAG laser irradiation versus 1% sodium hypochlorite irrigation for root canal disinfection.
AB  - This laboratory study evaluated Er:YAG laser antibacterial action in infected root canals. Forty-eight maxillary central incisors were used. After canal preparation, the teeth were autoclaved and divided into four groups: (1) non-treated teeth (control group); (2) teeth treated with NaOCl; (3) teeth irradiated with Er:YAG laser (7 Hz, 100 mJ, 80 pulses/canal, 11 sec) to the working length; (4) teeth irradiated similarly to, but 3 mm short, of the apex. The root canals from Groups 2, 3 and 4 were inoculated with 4 bacteria: Bacillus subtillus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus, together with Candida albicans, and maintained for 24 h at 37 degrees C. All suspensions were adjusted to tube 2 of the MacFarland scale. The intracanal material was then collected with sterile paper points, which were placed in the canals for 5 min and then immersed in 5 ml of BHI medium. This was then seeded onto agar and stained by Gram's method. The NaOCl solutions and the Er:YAG laser irradiation to working length were effective against all five micro-organisms; however, 70% of the specimens irradiated 3 mm short of the apex remained infected.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2002 and March 2003].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from April 2002 to March 2003 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 334 strains were isolated from 131 (75.3%) of 174 patients with surgical infections. One hundred and seventy-one strains were isolated from primary infections, and 163 strains were isolated from post-operative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, although the isolation rate of Staphylococcus aureus was the highest, followed by that of Enterococcus faecalis from primary infections, the isolation rate of E. faecalis was the highest from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, E. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citobacter freundii. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the last several years. We noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci nor P. aeruginosa producing metallo-beta-lactamase. But we noticed cefazolin-resistant E. coli probably producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase.
TI  - Commensal Gram-negative bacteria prime human dendritic cells for enhanced IL-23 and IL-27 expression and enhanced Th1 development.
AB  - Dendritic cells (DC) are the main orchestrators of specific immune responses. Depending on microbial information they encounter in peripheral tissues, they promote the development of Th1, Th2 or unpolarized Th cell responses. In this study we have investigated the immunomodulatory effect of non-pathogenic intestinal Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Bacteroides vulgatus,Veillonella parvula, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive (Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus plantarum and Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria on human monocyte-derived DC (moDC). None of the Gram-positive bacteria (GpB) primed for Th1 or Th2 development. In contrast, despite the low levels of IL-12 they induce, all Gram-negative bacteria (GnB) primed moDC for enhanced Th1 cell development, which was dependent on IL-12 and an additional unidentified cofactor. Strikingly, GnB-matured moDC expressed elevated levels of p19 and p28 mRNA, the critical subunits of IL-23 and IL-27, respectively, suggesting that the IL-12 family members may jointly be responsible for their Th1-driving capacity. Purified major cell wall components of either GnB or GpB did not yield Th cell profiles identical to those obtained with whole bacteria, and could not explain the induction of the IL-12 family members nor Th1 priming by GnB. Importantly, this study gives indications that the expression of the different IL-12 family members is dictated by different priming conditions of immature DC.
TI  - The antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito Aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of Gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  - Previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against Gram- Escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against Gram+ Micrococcus sp., is melanization. We examined the immune responses mounted by Aedes aegypti towards Gram- Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium, and Gram+ Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial Gram type and pathogenicity. These data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to the immune response against prokaryotes.
TI  - In vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetics of AC98-6446, a novel cyclic glycopeptide,  in experimental infection models.
AB  - AC98-6446 is a novel semisynthetic derivative of a natural product related to the mannopeptimycins produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus. Naturally occurring esterified mannopeptimycins exhibited excellent in vitro activity but only moderate in vivo efficacy against staphylococcal infection. The in vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetics of AC98-6446 were investigated in murine acute lethal, bacterial thigh and rat endocarditis infections. Pharmacokinetics were performed in mice, rats, monkeys, and dogs. Acute lethal infections were performed with several gram-positive isolates: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococci), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, and penicillin-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The 50% effective dose for all isolates tested ranged from 0.05 to 0.39 mg/kg of body weight after intravenous (i.v.) administration. Vancomycin was more than fivefold less efficacious against all of these same infections. Results of the thigh infection with S. aureus showed a static dose for AC98-6446 of 0.4 mg/kg by i.v. administration. Reduction of counts in the thigh of >2 log(10) CFU were achieved with doses of 1 mg/kg. i.v. administration of 3 mg/kg twice a day for 3 days resulted in a >3 log(10) reduction in bacterial counts of vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant E. faecalis in a rat endocarditis model. Pharmacokinetics of AC98-6446 showed an increase in exposure (area under the concentration-time curve) from mouse to dog species. The i.v. half-life (t(1/2)) increased threefold between rodents and the higher species dosed. Efficacy of AC98-6446 has been demonstrated in several models of infection with resistant gram-positive pathogens. This glycopeptide exhibited bactericidal activity in these models, resulting in efficacy at low doses with reduction in bacterial load.
TI  - Rugulotrosins A and B: Two new antibacterial metabolites from an Australian isolate of a Penicillium sp.
AB  - Two new antibacterial agents, rugulotrosin A (1) and B (2), were obtained from cultures of a Penicillium sp. isolated from soil samples acquired near Sussex Inlet, New South Wales, Australia. Rugulotrosin A (1) is a chiral symmetric dimer, and its relative stereostructure was determined by spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic analysis. Rugulotrosin B (2) is a chiral asymmetric dimer isomeric with 1. Its structure was determined by spectroscopic analysis with comparison to the co-metabolite 1 and previously reported fungal metabolites. Both rugulotrosins A and B displayed significant antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, while rugulotrosin A was also strongly active against Enterococcus faecalis and B. cereus.
TI  - [Prevalence of AA(6')-APH(2")Ia gene among high-level aminoglycoside resistant Enterococci and Staphylococci].
AB  - According to new reports the AAC (6')-APH (2")Ia gene is no longer the only gene  encoding resistance to gentamycin in Gram-positive cocci and therefore the current method for predicting synergism aminoglycosides with bacterial cell wall active agents in this bacteria may need revision. To further our knowledge of aminoglycoside resistance mechanism in Gram-positive cocci in Gdansk region we tested presence of AAC (6')-APH (2")Ia gene among 22 enterococcal (E. faecalis) and 41 staphylococcal (S. haemolyticus, S. aureus, S. epidermidis) gentamycin-resistant isolates. Presence of AAC (6')-APH (2")Ia gene varied from 50% (n = 6) in gentamycin-resistant S. epidermidis, 80% (n = 10) in gentamycin resistant S. haemolyticus 88% in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (n = 25). In Enterococcus faecalis this gene was noticed only in 59% (n = 22) of gentamycin-resistant isolates. These results suggest that spread of resistance gene among different species is limited and AAC (6')-APH (2")Ia mediated gentamycin-resistance mechanism is more common among MRSA and Staphylococcus haemolyticus.
TI  - [Composition of AME encoding gene in Gram positive Cocci--study on spread of aminoglycoside resistance].
AB  - Aminoglycoside modifying enzymes (AMEs) are major factors which confer aminoglycoside resistance on bacteria. Composition of six genes encoding AMEs (including lately described aph 2"-genes) was investigated by PCR for 16 clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, 16 clinical isolates of coagulase-positive (S. aureus) and 13 clinical isolates of coagulase negative staphylococci (S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis) collected in Gdansk region (Northern Poland) in the years 1998-2001. Diversity of AME encoding gene profiles (composition) was used to analyze spread of AME encoding gene among and within studied group of cocci. According to presence of particular genes we distinguish eleven different AME encoding gene profiles: seven profiles were unique for particular species while the most common was shared among S. aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci and enterococci. Regarding profile frequency statistical analysis (Fstat, AMOVA, cluster analysis UPGMA) shows: the difference between S. aureus and enterococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci, lack of difference between enterococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci, higher variability within than between studied species and presence of multispecies cluster. On the basis of the reports about ability of staphylococci to synthesis enterococcal pheromones, this finding lets assume that spread of aminoglycoside resistance gene among gram (+) cocci is limited only by the ability of stains to synthesis or induction of synthesis conjugation protein.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of three new quinolones and azithromycin against  aerobic pathogens causing respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In our study the in vitro susceptibility of common pathogens that cause respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections was tested against two newer fluorquinolones (moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin) as well as levofloxacin and azithromycin. METHODS: 50 isolates each of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae isolated from the respiratory tract and from wounds were tested for their susceptibility to moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and azithromycin. RESULTS: Moxifloxacin proved to be the most active substance against the tested gram-positive pathogens. Gatifloxacin was the most active against P. aeruginosa. Moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin proved to be comparably active against the clinical isolates of E. coli and H. influenzae. CONCLUSIONS: Moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin display excellent activity against respiratory pathogens as well as nosocomial pathogens causing abdominal wound infections. When treating infections caused by P. aeruginosa the earlier fluorquinolones such as ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin are the substances of choice.
TI  - The status of antimicrobial resistance in Taiwan among Gram-positive pathogens: the Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance (TSAR) programme, 2000.
AB  - In the Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance programme, isolates were collected from 21 hospitals over a 3-month period in 2000 (TSAR II) and rates of resistance in Gram-positive pathogens were determined. Resistance rates were high including oxacillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (60%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (80%), high-level gentamicin resistance (HLGR) in Enterococcus faecalis (60%) and penicillin non-susceptibility in Streptococcus pneumoniae (69%). Oxacillin resistance had increased from 1998 (TSAR I) and may be spreading into outpatient settings. In contrast, less than 2% enterococci were vancomycin-resistant. No linezolid resistance was found in either staphylococci or enterococci.
TI  - Oxidative stress involved in the antibacterial action of different antibiotics.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli sensitive to chloramphenicol incubated with this antibiotic suffered oxidative stress with increase of anion superoxide (O2-). This reactive species of oxygen was detected by chemiluminescence with lucigenin. S. aureus, E. coli, and Enterococcus faecalis sensitive to ciprofloxacin exhibited oxidative stress when they were incubated with this antibiotic while resistant strains did not show stimuli of O2-. Other bacteria investigated was Pseudomonas aeruginosa, strains sensitive to ceftazidime and piperacillin presented oxidative stress in presence of these antibiotics while resistant strains were not stressed. Higher antibiotic concentration was necessary to augment O2- in P. aeruginosa biofilm than in suspension, moreover old biofilms were resistant to oxidative stress caused by antibiotics. A ceftazidime-sensitive mutant of P. aeruginosa, coming from a resistant strain, exhibited higher production of O2- than wild type in presence of this antibiotic. There was relation between antibiotic susceptibility and production of oxidative stress.
TI  - Algorithm for the identification of bacterial pathogens in positive blood cultures by real-time LightCycler polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with sequence-specific probes.
AB  - We developed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for rapid detection of the most common and clinically relevant bacteria in positive blood culture bottles, including Staphylococcus spp., S. epidermidis, S. aureus, Enterococcus spp. (including differentiation of E. faecalis and E. faecium), Streptococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp., Bacteroides spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. A total of 507 positive blood cultures were investigated according to a specific PCR algorithm based on the microscopic result of the blood culture, and the PCR results were compared to the culture results. Apart from-cross reactions between E. coli and Chryseomonas luteola and Enterococcus faecium and E. durans, the PCR assay correctly identified all bacteria in the blood cultures and did not show any false-positive results. Regarding blood cultures positive with a single species of bacteria (n = 474), 98.3% of all bacteria were correctly detected by the PCR algorithm within a few hours. However, in mixed infections, the sensitivity was lower. The PCR algorithm is well suited for rapid identification of the most common bacteria in positive blood cultures.
TI  - Screening of antibacterial extracts from plants native to the Brazilian Amazon Rain Forest and Atlantic Forest.
AB  - More than 20% of the world's biodiversity is located in Brazilian forests and only a few plant extracts have been evaluated for potential antibacterial activity. In the present study, 705 organic and aqueous extracts of plants obtained from different Amazon Rain Forest and Atlantic Forest plants were screened for antibacterial activity at 100 microg/ml, using a microdilution broth assay against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. One extract, VO581, was active against S. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)=140 microg/ml and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC)=160 microg/ml, organic extract obtained from stems) and two extracts were active against E. faecalis, SM053 (MIC=80 microg/ml and MBC=90 microg/ml, organic extract obtained from aerial parts), and MY841 (MIC=30 microg/ml and MBC=50 microg/ml, organic extract obtained from stems). The most active fractions are being fractionated to identify their active substances. Higher concentrations of other extracts are currently being evaluated against the same microorganisms.
TI  - Control of microorganisms in vitro by endodontic irrigants.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and antimicrobial effectiveness by the direct exposure test of 4 endodontic irrigants [1% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), 2% chlorhexidine (CHX), 1% calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2; prepared with 1 g of Ca(OH)2 and 100 mL of sterile distilled water), a solution of Ca(OH)2 + detergent (HCT20)] for S. aureus, E. faecalis, P. aeruginosa, B. subtilis, C. albicans and a mixed culture. Microbial growth was analyzed by two methods: turbidity of the culture medium that was confirmed by Gram stain and subculture in a specific nutrient broth. In the dilution test, NaOCl solution showed MIC equal to 0.1% for S. aureus, E. faecalis, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans and equal to 1% for B. subtilis and the mixed culture. CHX (2%) presented MIC equal to 0.000002% for S. aureus, 0.02% for E. faecalis, B. subtilis, C. albicans and the mixed culture and 0.002% for P. aeruginosa. Ca(OH)2 solution (1%) showed MIC greater than 1% for all the microorganisms except P. aeruginosa for which it was equal to 1%. Calcium hydroxide solution + detergent showed MIC equal to 4.5 mL for S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, B. subtilis, C. albicans and the mixed culture and greater than 4.5 mL for E. faecalis. In the direct exposure test, NaOCl had better antimicrobial effectiveness for all microorganisms at all times. CHX (2%) was effective for S. aureus, E. faecalis and C. albicans at all times, and ineffective for P. aeruginosa, B. subtilis and the mixed culture. The other solutions showed the worst results.
TI  - Comparative study of the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, ABT-492.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, ABT-492, was determined. METHODS: MICs were compared with those of two beta-lactams, telithromycin, ciprofloxacin and four later generation fluoroquinolones. The effects of human serum and of inoculum concentration were also investigated. RESULTS: MIC data indicate that ABT-492 has potent activity against Gram-positive organisms with enhanced anti-staphylococcal activity compared with earlier fluoroquinolones, in addition to activity against beta-haemolytic streptococci, pneumococci including penicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecalis but not Enterococcus faecium. ABT-492 was the most active agent tested against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis, fluoroquinolone-susceptible Neisseria gonorrhoeae and anaerobes. Good activity was observed for ABT-492 amongst the Enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes tested, but ciprofloxacin showed superior activity for species of Proteus, Morganella and Providencia, as well as for Pseudomonas spp. In common with the other fluoroquinolones tested, organisms with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin had raised MIC(90)s to ABT-492. The one isolate of H. influenzae tested with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility had an ABT-492 MIC close to that of the population lacking a mechanism of quinolone resistance. ABT-492 was more active than ciprofloxacin against Chlamydia spp. An inoculum effect was observed with a number of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, E. faecium, Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli, in addition to moderately raised MICs in the presence of 70% serum protein. The clinical significance of these findings is yet to be determined. CONCLUSIONS: ABT-492 is a new fluoroquinolone with excellent activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, with many potential clinical uses.
TI  - Calcium-supplemented daptomycin Etest strips for susceptibility testing on Iso-Sensitest agar.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Iso-Sensitest agar (ISA), which is recommended by the BSAC for routine susceptibility testing of staphylococci and enterococci, contains insufficient calcium for testing daptomycin. Isotonic agar supplemented with 50 mg/L calcium has been advocated, but is not routinely available in many laboratories. We evaluated a daptomycin Etest that incorporates a constant level of calcium throughout the daptomycin gradient, designed to give an appropriate concentration around the strip during testing, as an alternative for susceptibility testing on ISA. METHODS: Ninety-one isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (45 methicillin-susceptible, 46 methicillin-resistant) and 90 enterococci (47 Enterococcus faecalis, 43 Enterococcus faecium) were tested. Daptomycin Etest MICs were determined on ISA, whereas agar dilution MICs were determined in parallel on Isotonic agar supplemented with calcium to 50 mg/L as a control. RESULTS: The agar dilution and Etest MIC ranges of daptomycin for S. aureus were 0.25-1 mg/L (mode 0.5 mg/L), and 0.125-2 mg/L (mode 0.25 mg/L), respectively. The corresponding MIC values for enterococci were 0.25-4 mg/L (mode, 1 mg/L) and 0.125-4 mg/L (mode, 2 mg/L). For staphylococci, 86% of the Etest MIC results were within one dilution of the agar dilution values, and for enterococci, 90% of the Etest MIC results met these criteria. When results from the two methods were not identical, there was a tendency for the Etest MIC values to be lower than the agar dilution values. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that calcium-supplemented daptomycin Etests on ISA are an accurate and convenient alternative to calcium-supplemented Isotonic agar.
TI  - Potent antibacterial activity of oligo-3-aminopyridine against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Oligo-3-aminopyridine (OAP) was tested for its antibacterial activity against two gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) and two gram negative (Escherchia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacterial strains. Antibacterial efficacy was measured by disk diffusion assay. Inhibition zones demonstrated that 50 microg OAP showed strong antibacterial activity against the gram-positive strains; the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were found to be 25 microg/ml and 50 microg/ml, respectively. The results indicate that OAP is a potent antibacterial agent against S. aureus and E. faecalis.
TI  - Potent and selective inhibitors of bacterial methionyl tRNA synthetase derived from an oxazolone-dipeptide scaffold.
AB  - The preparation and structure-activity relationships (SARs) of potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of bacterial methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) derived from an oxazolone-dipeptide scaffold are described. Examples combine Staphylococcus aureus MetRS (SaMetRS) potency with selectivity over human MetRS. As a result of the SAR expansion compound 14a was identified, as a potent SaMetRS inhibitor (IC(50)=18 nM) having moderate inhibition of MetRS derived from Enterococci faecalis (IC(50)=3.51 microM).
TI  - Antibacterial effects of Carica papaya fruit on common wound organisms.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate antibacterial activity of ripe and unripe Carica papaya on selected micro-organisms. Cultures of micro-organisms were routinely maintained in nutrient agar slants at 4 degrees C. Extracts of immature, mature and ripe Carica papaya fruit were obtained by separately grinding factions of the epicarp, endocarp and seeds and filtering them through gauze. Sensitivity tests were conducted by adding 0.06 ml of extract to agar wells (6 mm diameter) prepared from 20 ml agar seeded with 10(6) cells/ml suspension of one of the eight organisms per plate. The inoculated plates were allowed to equilibrate at 4 degrees C for 1 hour, incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hours, and zones of inhibition measured in millimetres. Anti-bacterial activity was expressed in terms of the radius of zone of inhibition. Seed extracts from the fruit showed inhibition in the following order: B cereus > E coli > S faecalis > S aureus > P vulgaris > S flexneri. No significant difference was found in bacterial sensitivity between immature, mature and ripe fruits. No inhibition zone was produced by epicarp and endocarp extracts. Carica papaya seeds contain anti-bacterial activity that inhibits growth of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Observed activity was independent of stage of fruit maturity. Carica papaya has antibacterial effects that could be useful in treating chronic skin ulcers to promote healing.
TI  - Urinary bactericidal activity, urinary excretion and plasma concentrations of gatifloxacin (400 mg) versus ciprofloxacin (500 mg) in healthy volunteers after a single oral dose.
AB  - In an open randomised double-crossover study 12 volunteers (six men, six women) received a single oral dose of gatifloxacin (400 mg) or ciprofloxacin (500 mg) to assess urinary bactericidal activity (in eight intervals up to 120 h) and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters (up to 36 h). Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion were determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection, and urinary bactericidal titers (UBT) by microdilution-method, using antibiotic-free urine of each volunteer. The mean maximum plasma concentration of gatifloxacin was 3.35 mg/l and that of ciprofloxacin 2.12 mg/l. The mean (median) cumulative renal excretion of the parent drug was for gatifloxacin 81 (83)% of the administered dose within 120 h and for ciprofloxacin 43 (45)%. The UBTs, i.e. the highest two-fold dilution (antibiotic-free urine as diluent) of urine still being bactericidal, were determined for an Escherichia coli ATCC reference strain and nine clinical uropathogens with the following MICs (mg/l) for gatifloxacin/ciprofloxacin (microdilution, MHB): E. coli ATCC 25922 (0.008/0.008); E. coli 523 (0.06/0.06); Klebsiella pneumoniae 1058 (0.03/0.016); Proteus mirabilis 524 (0.125/0.016); Pseudomonas aeruginosa 561 (1/0.125); Enterococcus faecalis strains 60 an 55 (0.5/1 and 8/32); Staphylococcus aureus strains 248 and 596 (both 0.03/0.125) and S. saprophyticus Ho94 (0.125/0.25). The median UBTs measured within the first 6h for gatifloxacin were between 1:16 and 1:>or=1024 for the Gram-negative strains including P. aeruginosa and between 1:8 and 1:>or=1024 for the five Gram-positive strains. The median UBTs for ciprofloxacin were between 1:64 and 1:>or=1024 for the Gram-negative strains (incl P. aeruginosa) and between 1:1.5 and 1:768 for the five Gram-positive strains. The UBTs up to 12 < 0.05 h showed no difference (P<0.05 ) for both E. coli strains, but ciprofloxacin was superior to gatifloxacin against Klebsiella, Proteus and Pseudomonas strains and gatifloxacin was superior to ciprofloxacin against all Gram-positive strains. For the UBTs at 12-24 h, gatifloxacin was generally superior to ciprofloxacin, but showed no difference in the Proteus and Pseudomonas strains. The areas under the UBT-time-curve (AUBT) up to 120 h showed statistically significant (P ) differences between both quinolones in favour of gatifloxacin against 8 of 10 strains tested, no difference for P. mirabilis and significantly higher activity of ciprofloxacin against P. aeruginosa. In conclusion, gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin had overall comparable initial urinary bactericidal activity with some differences for specific pathogens, some times in favour of gatifloxacin (Gram-positives) and some times of ciprofloxacin (usually Gram-negatives), suggesting that for empiric therapy a single oral dose of gatifloxacin (400mg) would be clinically equivalent to ciprofloxacin (500 mg) twice daily-in agreement with the results of a clinical study in complicated UTI performed previously [Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents (2004)].
TI  - [Nosocomial infections in a general surgical ward].
AB  - According to the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system we analysed the post-surgical nosocomial infections in a surgery ward of Perugia University. Between May 2000 and April 2001, 677 patients were enrolled mean age 51.5 years: 355 (52%) male, 462 (68%) ASA score 1, "clean" surgery in 355 cases (52%), cephazolin prophylaxis in 256 (38%); 11 (2%) patients deceased perioperatively. A total of 37 nosocomial infections, in 33 patients, were detected: 18 pneumonia (48.6%), 10 surgical site infections (27%) with 18 isolated: 12 gram-negative (E. coli 3, Acinetobacter baumannii 2, Providencia stuartii 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2, Achromobacter spp. 1, Citrobacter freundii 1, Morganella morgani 1) and 6 gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus meticillin resistant 3, Enterococcus faecalis 2, Streptococcus salivarius 1); 7 sepsis (19%) due to 7 gram-positive (S. aureus meticillin resistant 4, S. aureus meticillin susceptible 1, Staphylococcus coagulase negative 1, Clostridium spp 1), 2 urinary tract infections (5.4%). Patients without infections and with nosocomial infections spent in hospital 6.3 and 16.6 days respectively. We can image that in one year 53 surgical procedure were lost, with a lost gain of 79.500-291.500 euro/year.
TI  - Activity of linezolid against Gram-positive cocci isolated in French hospitals as determined by three in-vitro susceptibility testing methods.
AB  - In total, 844 strains of Gram-positive cocci were collected from six university hospitals in France between September 1999 and January 2000. MICs of linezolid were determined: (i) for all strains by agar dilution (method A); (ii) by broth microdilution (method B) for staphylococci and enterococci; (iii) by Etest (method E) for beta-haemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Susceptibility to other antibiotics was determined by the disk diffusion method. MIC50 and MIC90 values were identical (2 mg/L) for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (n = 179) by methods A and B. Linezolid was active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (n = 117), with an MIC90 of 2 mg/L (methods A and B), but with a lower MIC50 of 1 mg/L by method A. Of the 200 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 56.5% were methicillin-resistant and 43.5% were methicillin-susceptible. Linezolid had similar in-vitro activity by methods A and B (MIC50 and MIC90 values of 1-2 mg/L), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility. The MIC90 of linezolid for all enterococci (150 Enterococcus faecalis and 50 Enterococcus faecium) was 2 mg/L by both methods. MICs of linezolid for beta-haemolytic streptococci had a narrow range of 0.5-2 mg/L (method A) and 0.125-2 mg/L (method E). Pneumococci (n = 118), including 67 penicillin G-intermediate and -resistant strains, were all inhibited by linezolid 2 mg/L (MIC90 of 2 mg/L by methods A and E). No strain had an MIC of > 2 mg/L by agar dilution or Etest, or of > 4 mg/L by broth microdilution. Overall, the study confirmed the good in-vitro activity of linezolid and the very narrow range of MICs for Gram-positive cocci susceptible or resistant to other antibiotics, irrespective of the method used.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2001). III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - The bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from patients diagnosed as urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 institutions in Japan were supplied between September and December, 2001. Then, the susceptibilities of these bacteria to various antimicrobial agents were examined, and the results were compared with those obtained between 1992 and 2000. Comparison was made by classifying strains isolated from patients into those in uncomplicated UTIs and those in complicated UTIs (including with or without indwelling catheter). The drug sensitivity of S. aureus in this year was comparable to those in up to the previous year, and S. aureus showed the best susceptibility to vancomycin (VCM). E. faecalis showed good susceptibility to ampicillin and imipenem, and the MIC90s were 2 micrograms/mL. The susceptibility of E. faecalis to VCM was also good. E. coli showed good susceptibility to the drugs except penicillins. Among cephems, the susceptibility to cefozopran (CZOP) was better (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microgram/mL). Just as the last report, the decreases in susceptibility of E. coli to quinolones were also observed in the patients with complicated UTIs. The susceptibility of Klebsiella spp. to all the test drugs did not significantly change in 2001 and was generally good but not to penicillins. Among cephems, Klebsiella spp. showed good susceptibility to flomoxef, cefpirome, cefixime, and CZOP with < or = 0.125 microgram/mL of MIC90s either in uncomplicated or complicated UTIs. Although the drug sensitivity of P. aeruginosa was generally low, the detection of the strains that showed good susceptibility to quinolones and carbapenems (MIC: < or = 0.125-2 micrograms/mL) were relatively frequent.
TI  - [Nationwide sensitivity surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antibiotics against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--the first Ciproxan IV special investigation in 2001].
AB  - The parenteral injection of ciprofloxacin (CPFX), a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drug, was approved in September 2000 and a re-examination period of 6 years was set at that time. As a special investigation to apply for re-examination of this drug, it has been planned to conduct 3 nationwide surveillances during the re-examination period by collecting clinically isolated bacteria from patients with severe infections, to whom the drug was mainly indicated, and examining drug susceptibilities of the bacteria to various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including CPFX. This time, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including CPFX against 1,220 strains isolated from patients with severe infections by the micro-liquid dilution method and compared susceptibilities of various clinically isolated bacteria to CPFX with those to other antimicrobial drugs. Gram-positive bacteria were less susceptible to CPFX than to carbapenems except 2 bacterial species, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus avium but susceptibilities of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis to CPFX were comparable to those to cefozopran. Susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae to CPFX did not differ among ampicillin (ABPC)-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC of ABPC: < 0.25 microgram/ml), ABPC-intermediate S. pneumoniae (MIC of ABPC: 0.25-2 micrograms/ml) and ABPC-resistant S. pneumoniae (MIC of ABPC: > or = 4 micrograms/ml) MIC90 of CPFX: 1 microgram/ml) and a decrease in the antimicrobial activity seen among cephem and carbapenem antimicrobial drugs against penicillin-intermediate strains was not noted with CPFX. Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to CPFX similarly to carbapenems and the MIC90 values of CPFX were in the range from < or = 0.063 to 2 micrograms/ml against strains except Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Burkholderia cepacia. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was most susceptible to CPFX among the antibacterial drugs examined and the MIC90 was 2 micrograms/ml. CPFX also showed the lowest MIC90 value (0.5 microgram/ml) against beta-lactam-resistant P. aeruginosa among the drugs examined. When extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production and class B beta-lactamase production were examined in 439 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and 168 strains of glucose non-fermentative bacteria out of the Gram-negative bacteria collected this time, 3 strains (0.49%) producing ESBL and 7 strains (1.15%) producing class B beta-lactamase were found. The MIC range of CPFX to these 10 strains was between < or = 0.063 to 8 micrograms/ml and 5 strains among those showed susceptibilities (MIC of CPFX: 1 microgram/ml) based on the NCCLS breakpoint. CPFX also showed a satisfactory result concerning susceptibilities of major causal bacteria based on the report of the committee of Japan Society of Chemotherapy on the standard method for determination of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, the breakpoint of pneumonia. Furthermore, susceptibilities of various bacteria isolated clinically from patients with severe infections this time did not differ much from the result of the nationwide surveillance which we conducted in 1997. Thus, it was concluded that the antimicrobial activity of CPFX was maintained in the post-marketing surveillance for its parenteral preparation.
TI  - [Evaluating the effect of quaternary ammonium disinfectants on bacterial strains  of animal origin].
AB  - The authors evaluate two quaternary ammonium compounds, first and second generation, using three methods: minimum bactericide concentration, the suspension test of the German Society for Hygiene and Microbiology and the agar gel diffusion test. The compounds were tested against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis from sheep and pigs. The results show that quaternary ammonia compounds with dodecyl chains have greater efficacy than benzalconium chloride, and that quaternary ammonium compounds are more effective against gram-positive bacteria. No resistance linked to the strains used in the tests was detected. Finally, the authors demonstrate that all three techniques are valid for the evaluation of quaternary ammonium disinfectants.
TI  - In vitro activities of Daptomycin, Linezolid, and Quinupristin-Dalfopristin against a challenge panel of Staphylococci and Enterococci, including vancomycin-intermediate staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - We assessed the in vitro activities of daptomycin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin (QD) against a contemporary challenge panel of 88 staphylococcal and 90 enterococcal isolates. The staphylococci selected included vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and coagulasenegative staphylococci. Enterococcal isolates included vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) containing either vanA, vanB1, or vanD. The MICs of daptomycin, linezolid, and QD were determined using commercial broth microdilution panels. All three VISA isolates were susceptible to daptomycin, linezolid, and QD. QD was the most active agent against staphylococcal isolates (MIC50 < or = 0.5 microg/ml and MIC90 = 1 microg/ml), including those with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin. QD was also the most active agent against VREF (MIC90 < or = 0.5 microg/ml). No differences were seen for susceptibility of vanA, vanB1, and vanD VREF strains for daptomycin, linezolid, or QD. Daptomycin was the most effective against E. faecalis. On the basis of manufacturer-suggested interpretive criteria, 92% of isolates were susceptible (MIC90 = 4 microg/ml). All isolates tested were susceptible to at least one antimicrobial agent for which interpretive criteria have been defined. Population analysis of three S. aureus isolates for which the daptomycin MICs were 8 microg/ml showed a pattern of homogeneous resistance.
TI  - Harmonization of antimicrobial susceptibility testing among veterinary diagnostic laboratories in the five Nordic countries.
AB  - A total of 100 bacterial strains (25 Escherichia coli, 25 Salmonella enterica, 25 Staphylococcus aureus, and 25 Enterococcus strains) and four reference strains were tested for susceptibility toward 8-12 antimicrobial agents in 12 veterinary diagnostic laboratories in the five Nordic countries using routine methodology. In addition, the 25 Enterococcus strains were identified to species level. A total of 22,598 (97.2%) out of 23,259 test results were in accordance when the data were categorized as susceptible or resistant. When the reported results were categorized according to the National Committee of Clinical Laboratory Standards breakpoints, the percentage of concordant results increased to 98.4% and the performance between laboratories varied between 94.2 and 99.4% concordant results. For E. coli, S. aureus, and Salmonella, all laboratories except one had more than 97% concordant results, whereas for Enterococcus spp., two laboratories had less than 90% concordant results. Susceptibility testing of Salmonella to fluoroquinolones gave rise to almost 0.5% nonconcordant results and susceptibility testing of S. aureus to vancomycin resulted in that 1.8% of the strains were incorrectly reported as vancomycin resistant. Ten laboratories identified the Enterococcus spp. to species level. All five Enterococcus faecium and 10 Enterococcus faecalis selected from the strain collection at the Danish Veterinary Institute were correctly identified by all laboratories, whereas some problems were observed identifying other enterococcal species. This study showed a good performance and agreement in antimicrobial susceptibility testing at the 12 participating laboratories and that surveillance data covering susceptibility test results of E. coli, S. aureus, and Salmonella from animals in the Nordic countries are comparable. But it also showed that some aspects can be improved. In addition, the study showed that the different laboratories are capable of identifying E. faecalis and E. faecium.
TI  - High antibiotic susceptibility among bacterial pathogens in Swedish ICUs. Report  from a nation-wide surveillance program using TA90 as a novel index of susceptibility.
AB  - Local infection control measures, antibiotic consumption and patient demographics from 1999-2000 together with bacteriological analyses were investigated in 29 ICUs participating in the ICU-STRAMA programme. The median antibiotic consumption per ICU was 1147 (range 605-2143) daily doses per 1000 occupied bed d (DDD1000). Antibiotics to which > 90% of isolates of an organism were susceptible were defined as treatment alternatives (TA90). The mean number of TA90 was low (1-2 per organism) for Enterococcus faecium (vancomycin:VAN), coagulase negative staphylococci (VAN), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ceftazidime:CTZ, netilmicin: NET) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (CTZ, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole: TSU), but higher (3-7) for Acinetobacter spp. (imipenem:IMI, NET, TSU), Enterococcus faecalis (ampicillin:AMP, IMI, VAN), Serratia spp. (ciprofloxacin:CIP, IMI, NET), Enterobacter spp. (CIP, IMI, NET, TSU), E. coli (cefuroxime:CXM, cefotaxime/eftazidime:CTX/CTZ, CIP, IMI, NET, piperacillin-tazobactam:PTZ, TSU), Klebsiella spp. (CTX/CTZ CIP, IMI, NET, PTZ, TSU) and Staphylococcus aureus (clindamycin, fusidic acid, NET, oxacillin, rifampicin, VAN). Of S. aureus isolates 2% were MRSA. Facilities for alcohol hand disinfection at each bed were available in 96% of the ICUs. The numbers of TA90 available were apparently higher than in ICUs in southern Europe and the US, despite a relatively high antibiotic consumption. This may be due to a moderate ecological impact of the used agents and the infection control routines in Swedish ICUs.
TI  - New antibacterial agents derived from the DNA gyrase inhibitor cyclothialidine.
AB  - Cyclothialidine (1, Ro 09-1437) is a potent DNA gyrase inhibitor that was isolated from Streptomyces filipinensis NR0484 and is a member of a new family of natural products. It acts by competitively inhibiting the ATPase activity exerted by the B subunit of DNA gyrase but barely exhibits any growth inhibitory activity against intact bacterial cells, presumably due to insufficient permeation of the cytoplasmic membrane. To explore the antibacterial potential of 1, we developed a flexible synthetic route allowing for the systematic modification of its structure. From a first set of analogues, structure-activity relationships (SAR) were established for different substitution patterns, and the 14-hydroxylated, bicyclic core (X) of 1 seemed to be the structural prerequisite for DNA gyrase inhibitory activity. The variation of the lactone ring size, however, revealed that activity can be found among 11- to 16-membered lactones, and even seco-analogues were shown to maintain some enzyme inhibitory properties, thereby reducing the minimal structural requirements to a rather simple, hydroxylated benzyl sulfide (XI). On the basis of these "minimal structures" a modification program afforded a number of inhibitors that showed in vitro activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The best activities were displayed by 14-membered lactones, and representatives of this subclass exhibit excellent and broad in vitro antibacterial activity against Gram-positive pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis, and overcome resistance against clinically used drugs. By improving the pharmacokinetic properties of the most active compounds (94, 97), in particular by lowering their lipophilic properties, we were able to identify congeners of cyclothialidine (1) that showed efficacy in vivo.
TI  - Clinafloxacin for the treatment of bacterial endocarditis.
AB  - We report the results of a prospective, multicenter trial assessing intravenous and oral clinafloxacin treatment for infective endocarditis. Sixty-six patients constituted the final study population. Among the 53 patients with native valve infection, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus viridans were the most common pathogens. Twelve patients with native valve infection required surgery, at which time all valve tissue culture results were negative. The overall success rate for native valve infection was 87%. Single valves were involved in 11 of 13 patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE), and multiple valves were involved in 2 cases. Enterococcus faecalis was the most common pathogen, causing 4 of the PVE cases. The overall success rate for treatment of PVE was 69%. Patients with PVE who did not respond to treatment presented with complications that predict poor prognosis. Clinafloxacin may be effective for both native and PVE, but further studies are indicated.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of AC98-6446, a novel semisynthetic glycopeptide  derivative of the natural product mannopeptimycin alpha, and other antimicrobial agents against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - AC98-6446 is a novel semisynthetic cyclic glycopeptide antibiotic related to the  natural product mannopeptimycin alpha (AC98-1). In the present study the activity of AC98-6446 was evaluated against a variety of recent clinical gram-positive pathogens including multiply resistant strains. AC98-6446 demonstrated similar potent activities against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococci and glycopeptide-intermediate staphylococcal isolates (MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [MIC(90)s], 0.03 to 0.06 microg/ml). AC98-6446 also demonstrated good activities against both vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible strains of enterococci (MIC(90)s, 0.12 and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively) as well as against streptococcal strains (MIC(90)s, <or= 0.008 to 0.03 microg/ml). AC98-6446 demonstrated bactericidal activity in terms of the reduction in the viable counts (>3 log(10) CFU/ml) of staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates and a marked decrease in the viable counts of most enterococcal strains (from 0.2 to 2.5 log(10) CFU/ml). Unlike vancomycin, which demonstrates time-dependent killing, AC98-6446 demonstrated concentration-dependent killing. The potent activity, novel structure, and bactericidal activity demonstrated by AC98-6446 make it an attractive candidate for further development.
TI  - A series of spirocyclic analogues as potent inhibitors of bacterial phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetases.
AB  - We have identified a series of spirocyclic furan and pyrrolidine inhibitors of Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetases. The most potent analogue 1b showed IC50=5 nM (E. faecalis PheRS) and IC50=2 nM (S. aureus PheRS) with high selectivity over the human enzyme. The crystal X-ray structure of analogue 1b was determined.
TI  - DNA binding ligands targeting drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria. Part 1: Internal benzimidazole derivatives.
AB  - Novel DNA minor-groove binding ligands with a promising antibacterial profile are described. Apart from excellent in vitro potency against multiple Gram-positive bacterial strains such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), and penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP), a small subset of compounds was active against Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli).
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activities of new bis-benzimidazoles.
AB  - Twenty bis-benzimidazole derivatives were synthesised by the reaction of benzimidazole with appropriate alkyl halides. The compounds synthesised were identified by 1H, 13C-NMR, FT-IR and micro analysis. All compounds studied in this work were screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against standard strains; Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853). Ten of the compounds were found effective to inhibit the growth of gram-positive bacteria (E. faecalis and S. aureus) at MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) values between 50-400 microg/ ml. Two of the compounds showed MIC values of 200 microg/ml against gram-negative bacteria (E. coli and P. aeruginosa).
TI  - Molecular and clinical epidemiology of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: With the recent emergence of vancomycin-resistant (VR) Staphylococcus aureus, subsequent to the suggested transfer of the vanA resistance gene from Enterococcus faecalis, we sought to determine risk factors for acquisition of VR E. faecalis and to evaluate the molecular epidemiology of this less-prevalent and less-studied species of VR enterococcus. METHODS: We compared clinical isolates of VR E. faecalis from 71 patients, collected over 12 years in a large community teaching hospital, with isolates from 126 patients with vancomycin-susceptible E. faecalis. RESULTS: Risk factors for VR E. faecalis acquisition by multivariate analysis were nursing home residence (P = 0.0005), haemodialysis (P = 0.009), decubitus ulcers (P = 0.03) and receipt of parenteral vancomycin (P = 0.0002). Twenty-one percent of VR E. faecalis demonstrated vanA and 79% vanB resistance. The number of VanA isolates increased over time. Molecular analysis showed vanA or vanB in multiple PFGE groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest gene dissemination among some isolates and intra-hospital spread of other isolates. The risk factors identified clearly suggest that VR E. faecalis is a nosocomial pathogen and should be considered in infection control practices. Further surveillance of VR E. faecalis is warranted, due to the potential spread of vancomycin resistance among enterococci and staphylococci.
TI  - Role of class A penicillin-binding proteins in PBP5-mediated beta-lactam resistance in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Peptidoglycan polymerization complexes contain multimodular penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) of classes A and B that associate a conserved C-terminal transpeptidase module to an N-terminal glycosyltransferase or morphogenesis module, respectively. In Enterococcus faecalis, class B PBP5 mediates intrinsic resistance to the cephalosporin class of beta-lactam antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone. To identify the glycosyltransferase partner(s) of PBP5, combinations of deletions were introduced in all three class A PBP genes of E. faecalis JH2-2 (ponA, pbpF, and pbpZ). Among mutants with single or double deletions, only JH2-2 DeltaponA DeltapbpF was susceptible to ceftriaxone. Ceftriaxone resistance was restored by heterologous expression of pbpF from Enterococcus faecium but not by mgt encoding the monofunctional glycosyltransferase of Staphylococcus aureus. Thus, PBP5 partners essential for peptidoglycan polymerization in the presence of beta-lactams formed a subset of the class A PBPs of E. faecalis, and heterospecific complementation was observed with an ortholog from E. faecium. Site-directed mutagenesis of pbpF confirmed that the catalytic serine residue of the transpeptidase module was not required for resistance. None of the three class A PBP genes was essential for viability, although deletion of the three genes led to an increase in the generation time and to a decrease in peptidoglycan cross-linking. As the E. faecalis chromosome does not contain any additional glycosyltransferase-related genes, these observations indicate that glycan chain polymerization in the triple mutant is performed by a novel type of glycosyltransferase. The latter enzyme was not inhibited by moenomycin, since deletion of the three class A PBP genes led to high-level resistance to this glycosyltransferase inhibitor.
TI  - Worldwide assessment of dalbavancin activity and spectrum against over 6,000 clinical isolates.
AB  - Continuing emergence of new antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and the increased frequency of existing resistances, requires the development of alternative antimicrobial agents. Dalbavancin is an amide glycopeptide derivative with a markedly extended serum elimination half-life. Dalbavancin and selected comparators were tested against 6,339 recent clinical isolates (2002) from the Americas and Europe using reference susceptibility testing methods. The general characteristics of this Gram-positive organism collection were: oxacillin (OXA)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ORSA) at 39% of strains; vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) at 10%; and penicillin-nonsusceptible pneumococci at 28%. The overall distribution of dalbavancin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranged from < or = 0.015 to > 32 microg/ml, but > 99% of MIC results were at < or =1 microg/ml. S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci were extremely susceptible to dalbavancin (MIC90, 0.06 microg/ml) despite resistance patterns to other agents. Dalbavancin was the most potent compound (by weight) against vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium (MIC90, 0.06 and 0.12 microg/ml, respectively); however, VRE strains showed decreased dalbavancin susceptibility (MIC50, 4 or 8 microg/ml). All streptococcal isolates were inhibited at < or =0.25 microg/ml of dalbavancin. This reported dalbavancin activity indicates that the new glycopeptide has significant activity, superior to available agents in the class, and a potency that was uniform across geographically sampled organisms. Some VRE were inhibited by very low dalbavancin concentrations (< or = 1 microg/ml; Van B phenotypes). Further clinical development seems warranted for this once-weekly administered agent.
TI  - Daptomycin.
AB  - Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibacterial with rapid in vitro activity against Gram-positive cocci. It is approved for use in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs) caused by specified Gram-positive cocci. In vitro, daptomycin was active against Staphylococcus aureus (including meticillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, group C and G beta-haemolytic streptococci and vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis. Bactericidal activity in vitro was rapid and concentration dependent. In two randomised, investigator-blinded, multicentre trials in patients with cSSSIs, intravenous daptomycin 4 mg/kg once daily was as effective as standard therapy (intravenous semi-synthetic penicillin 4-12 g/day or vancomycin 1 g 12-hourly). Clinical success rates assessed 6-20 days after treatment end were 82.1% in daptomycin recipients and 82.9% in recipients of standard therapy (pooled data). In patients with cSSSIs, the adverse event profiles of daptomycin and vancomycin were similar. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels increased in 2.8% of daptomycin recipients and 1.8% of patients who received standard therapy; only one daptomycin recipient (0.2%) experienced increased CPK levels and muscle symptoms that were not associated with any comorbid factors.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  - The ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. These pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. These infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer generations of antibiotics. In this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis and endophthalmitis. The ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. Gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis. MIC90 values for the drugs against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/mL to 0.57 mg/mL and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. The MIC90 for gatifloxacin against Streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/mL compared with 0.73 mg/mL for moxifloxacin (P = .011). Among the gram-negative isolates, the mean MIC90 for gatifloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/mL compared with 2.60 mg/ mL for moxifloxacin (P = .023). MIC90 values for gatifloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. For the atypicals, the MIC90 values for gatifloxacin against Nocardia asteroides and Mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. Gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.
TI  - Effect of androgens and glucocorticoids on microbial growth and antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  - The effects of androgens, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), of an environmental anti-androgen, 2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethylene (DDE), and of glucocorticoids, hydrocortisone and dexamethasone, on growth kinetics and antibiotic susceptibility of E. faecalis, E. coli, P. aeurginosa, and S. aureus were measured. For P. aeurginosa, the presence of either DHT or DDE caused at least a fourfold shift in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefepime and tobramycin. DHT and DDE also affected the response of E. faecalis to meropenem and norfloxacin, resulting in a shift from sensitive to intermediate resistance (four-fold increase in MIC). Hydrocortisone (2 microM) induced an increase in the sensitivity of S. aureus to erythromycin, as compared to hormone-free control (from 0.5 to 0.06 microg/mL). The susceptibility pattern of E. coli was unaffected by the hormones tested. These changes in susceptibility to antibiotics were unrelated to alterations in growth kinetics. For all organisms tested, the alterations in MICs occurred only in the presence of hormone, indicative of changes in the phenotype of these stable quality control strains.
TI  - Cell density--dependent regulation: basic principles and effects on the virulence of Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - PRINCIPLES: Quorum sensing (QS) regulation appears to be a consequence of interbacterial communication by which bacteria of one or even different species learn about their current population density and react in a defined way to that information. QS-regulation is a three step process: in the first step specific signaling molecules are produced and secreted to the exterior space. In the second step, the molecules accumulate e.g. with growing population density. In the last step, a supra-threshold concentration of the molecules is extra- or intra-cellularly sensed by the bacteria and leads to a cascade of regulatory activities. While Gram-negative bacteria can employ five or more different chemical classes of signaling molecules, Gram-positive cocci predominantly use special oligopeptides for specific signaling. DESCRIPTIONS: Examples of QS-regulatory effects on virulence factor expression in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, and Enterococcus faecalis are given. In these bacteria, QS-regulation appears to be crucial for displaying tissue invasiveness and/or biofilm formation. APPLICATIONS: The high specificity of the initial signal sensing and the importance for expressing special virulence traits make this type of gene expression control a promising target for the development of novel therapeutics. The options for such therapies are critically discussed based on practical experiences with interference in S. aureus QS-regulation.
TI  - Low in vitro selection frequencies of enterococcal and staphylococcal mutants resistant to the oxazolidinone AZD2563.
AB  - Mutants with oxazolidinone MICs, 2- to 16-fold higher than those of parents, were selected from two of five clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis during exposure to AZD2563, but only at frequencies of ca. 10(-8). Resistance was not selected in Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus or coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). Mutants of one E. faecalis isolate had a G2576-->U 23S rRNA mutation; mutants derived from the second E. faecalis isolate lacked this mutation.
TI  - Assessment of the antibacterial activity of selected flavonoids and consideration of discrepancies between previous reports.
AB  - Activity of the flavonoids apigenin, baicalin and galangin against sensitive and  antibiotic resistant strains of Staphylococculs aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated. Using an agar dilution assay, galangin was shown to have a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 25 to 50 microg/mL against all six strains of S. aureus but negligible activity against the othe species. Apigenin displayed only marginal activity against S. aureus and no activity was detected from baicalin. In inhibition curve studies, galangin caused a 100,000-fold decrease in the viability of a growing population of S. aureus NCTC 6571 within the first two hours of treatment. Decreases in viability of S. aureus NCTC 11561 and NCIMB 9968 populations were also observed.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of chlorhexidine and sodium hypochlorite.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the antimicrobial activity of 0.2%, 1%, and 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX gel and CHX liquid), against endodontic pathogens and compare the results with the ones achieved by 0.5%, 1%, 2.5%, 4%, and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). A broth dilution test was performed, and the timing for irrigants to kill microbial cells was recorded and statistically analyzed. Both 2.0% gel and liquid formulations eliminated Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans in 15 seconds, whereas the gel formulation killed Enterococcus faecalis in 1 minute. All tested irrigants eliminated Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia in 15 seconds. The timing required for 1.0% and 2.0% CHX liquid to eliminate all microorganisms was the same required for 5.25% NaOCl. The antimicrobial action is related to type, concentration, and presentation form of the irrigants as well as the microbial susceptibility.
TI  - The role of the methylene blue and toluidine blue monomers and dimers in the photoinactivation of bacteria.
AB  - The interactions between the phenothiazine dyes, methylene blue (MB) and toluidine blue (TB), and bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were studied spectrophotometrically. This demonstrated that a metachromatic reaction took place between the dyes and bacteria. Furthermore, bacteria induced additional dimerization of MB and TB. The effective dimerization constants of MB and TB were evaluated in the presence of each bacterial strain at a concentration of 10(8) CFU/ml. The analysis of the effective dimerization constants for MB and TB in the presence of bacteria indicated that the ability to form dimers was greater for TB than for MB. Gram-negative bacteria induced the dye dimerization more intensely than gram-positive bacteria. There was a correlation between the ability of each dye to form dimers in the presence of bacteria and the relative photobactericidal efficacy of each dye against these bacteria. These results provide evidence confirming the essential role of the dye dimers in bacterial photodamage.
TI  - New triterpene glycosides from the stems of Anomospermum grandifolium.
AB  - Two new dammarane saponins identified as jujubogenin 3-O-alpha-l-arabinofuranosyl(1-->2)-[beta-d-glucopyranosyl(1-->6) beta-d-glucopyranosyl(1-->3)]-alpha-l-arabinopyranoside (2) and jujubogenin 3-O-alpha-l-arabinofuranosyl(1-->2)-[6-O-[3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl]-beta-d-gluc opyranosyl(1-->3)]-alpha-l-arabinopyranoside (3) and a new lupane saponin, 3beta-hydroxylup-20(29)-en-27,28-dioic acid 28-O-beta-d-glucopyranosyl(1-->2)-[beta-d-xylopyranosyl(1-->3)]-beta-d-xylopyrano syl(1-->2)-beta-d-glucopyranoside ester (5), along with the known jujubogenin 3-O-alpha-l-arabinofuranosyl(1-->2)-[beta-d-glucopyranosyl(1-->3)]-alpha-l-arabin opyranoside (1) and 3beta-hydroxylup-20(29)-ene-27,28-dioic acid (4), were isolated from the methanol extract of the stems of Anomospermum grandifolium. The structures of the new compounds were established by spectral analysis. Antimicrobial activity screening of compounds 1-3 revealed antifungal properties against C. albicans ATCC 3153 for compounds 2 and 3. The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the petroleum ether, chloroform, and methanol extracts of A. grandifolium stems were also evaluated.
TI  - Comparison of oxidative stress induced by ciprofloxacin and pyoverdin in bacteria and in leukocytes to evaluate toxicity.
AB  - Oxidative stress induced by ciprofloxacin and pyoverdin, a leukotoxic pigment, was studied by comparing their effect in bacteria and leukocytes. Chemiluminescence (CL) assays with lucigenin or luminol were adapted to measure the stimuli of superoxide anion (O2 -) and other reactive species of oxygen (ROS) in bacteria. Ciprofloxacin principally induced the production of O2 - in the three species studied: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. Lucigenin CL assay showed high oxidative stress in S. aureus due to its low superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, whereas E. coli exhibited important SOD activity, responsible for little production of O2 - in absence or presence of ciprofloxacin. Reduction of nitroblue of tetrazolium (NBT) was applied. This assay indicated that there was higher oxidative stress in S. aureus and E. faecalis than in E. coli. The comparison of oxidative stress generated in bacteria and leukocytes was used to check the selective toxicity of ciprofloxacin in comparison with pyoverdin. Ciprofloxacin did not generate significant stimuli of O2 - in neutrophils, while pyoverdin duplicated the production of O2 -. CL and NBT were useful to study the leukotoxicity of ciprofloxacin. Oxidative stress caused by the antibiotic and the leukotoxic pigment was similar in bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activities of DA-7867, a novel oxazolidinone, against recent clinical isolates of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - In vitro activities of DA-7867, a novel oxazolidinone, were compared to those of  linezolid and commonly used antimicrobials. DA-7867 had the lowest MIC for 90% of the aerobic gram-positive bacterial strains tested, </=0.25 micro g/ml, and it was more potent than linezolid.
TI  - In vitro activities of the novel cephalosporin LB 11058 against multidrug-resistant Staphylococci and Streptococci.
AB  - LB 11058 is a novel parenteral cephalosporin with a C-3 pyrimidinyl-substituted vinyl sulfide group and a C-7 2-amino-5-chloro-1,3-thiazole group. This study evaluated the in vitro activity and spectrum of LB 11058 against 1,245 recent clinical isolates, including a subset of gram-positive strains with specific resistant phenotypes. LB 11058 was very active against Streptococcus pneumoniae. The novel cephalosporin was 8- to 16-fold more potent than ceftriaxone, cefepime, or amoxicillin-clavulanate against both penicillin-intermediate and -resistant S. pneumoniae. LB 11058 was also very active against both beta-hemolytic streptococci (MIC at which 90% of isolates were inhibited [MIC(90)], </=0.008 micro g/ml) and viridans group streptococci (MIC(90), 0.03 to 0.5 micro g/ml), including penicillin-resistant strains. Among oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, LB 11058 MIC results varied from 0.06 to 0.25 micro g/ml (MIC(50), 0.12 micro g/ml), while among oxacillin-resistant strains LB 11058 MICs varied from 0.25 to 1 micro g/ml (MIC(50), 1 micro g/ml). Coagulase-negative staphylococci showed an LB 11058 susceptibility pattern similar to that of S. aureus, with all isolates being inhibited at </=1 micro g/ml. LB 11058 also showed reasonable in vitro activity against Enterococcus faecalis, including vancomycin-resistant strains (MIC(50), 1 micro g/ml), and Bacillus spp. (MIC(50), 0.25 micro g/ml); however, it was less active against Enterococcus faecium (MIC(50), >64 micro g/ml) and Corynebacterium spp. (MIC(50), 32 micro g/ml). Against gram-negative pathogens, LB 11058 showed activity against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC(90), 0.25 to 0.5 micro g/ml) and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC(90), 0.25 micro g/ml), with MICs not influenced by beta-lactamase production. In conclusion, LB 11058 demonstrated a broad antibacterial spectrum and was highly active against gram-positive bacteria, particularly against multidrug-resistant staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial susceptibility for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (2,363 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), Streptococcus milleri group and Peptostreptococcus spp. The antibacterial activity of CZOP either against MSSA or MSSE was preferable (MIC90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/mL) and comparable to those of other cephems. CZOP was also effective on MRSE (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) but not on MRSA. CZOP and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (CPR; MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) and higher than those of other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, like other drugs. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and CPR (MIC90: < or = 0.063 microgram/mL), and, against S. agalactiae, was also preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL). CZOP indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against PSSP, PISP, or PRSP (MIC90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. milleri group was also preferable, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 95.9% in MRSA, 93.5% in PRSP, 63.3% in PISP, 35.8% in S. haemolyticus, 27.9% in E. faecalis, and 13.3% MRSE. Those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (CFPM), but E. faecalis showed 91.2% for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. In correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of PRSP was not inhibited at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or CFPM while 69.2% at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or ceftazidime. In conclusion, the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. A decline in the sensitivities of S. saprophyticus, S. milleri group, PISP, and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2001). II. Background of patients].
AB  - Five-hundred thirty one bacterial strains isolated from 412 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 institutions in Japan were supplied between September and December 2001. Then, the clinical background of patients were investigated such as sex, age, and type of infections, infections and kind of bacteria, frequency of bacteria isolation by age and infections, bacteria and infections by timing of antibiotics administration, and bacteria and infections by surgical procedures. With regard to the relationship between age and sex of patients and type of infections, the number of cases aged lower than 50 years was few and complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter was the most frequent in male patients. In females, the number of patients aged lower than 20 years was few. Most of female patients aged lower than 80 years had uncomplicated UTIs. As for the relationship between type of infections and kind of bacteria, Escherichia coli decreased as the infections were more complicated, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis increased as the infections were more complicated. In relation of these results to age of patients, isolation frequency of E. coli gradually decreased with aging in patients aged 20 years and older with uncomplicated UTIs. The isolation frequencies of E. faecalis decreased with aging in the patients with complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter while P. aeruginosa decreased with aging in the patients with complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter. E. coli was isolated a few after administration of antibiotics, and P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis were frequently isolated after administration in the patients with all types of infections. As for type of causative organisms in UTIs and with or without surgical operation, E. coli was frequently isolated in the patients without surgery in the patients with uncomplicated UTIs and complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, while P. aeruginosa was frequently isolated in the patients who underwent surgery in the patients with uncomplicated UTIs and complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter. In uncomplicated UTIs, isolation frequencies of Klebsiella spp., P. aeruginosa, and E. faecalis were significant in the patients with surgery. In complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, Klebsiella spp. was frequently isolated in the patients with surgery. In complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter, S. aureus and Staphylococcus spp. were frequently isolated in the patients without surgery.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2001). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of September and December 2001. Then, the susceptibilities of them to a variety of antimicrobial agents were investigated. The number of them were 496 strains. The breakdown of these strains was Gram-positive bacteria as 29.6% and Gram-negative bacteria as 70.4%. Susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed a strong activity, and this drug also had a strong activity against MRSA in preventing growth of all strains at 1 microgram/mL. In addition, arbekacin (ABK) showed strong activity with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/mL against MRSA and prevented growth of all strains at 4 micrograms/mL. ABK also showed a strong activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis in preventing growth of all strains at 0.5 microgram/mL. Ampicillin (ABPC) and cefozopran (CZOP) showed a relatively strong activity against S. epidermidis (MIC90: 8 micrograms/mL). ABPC, imipenem (IPM), and VCM showed strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis. No increase of low-susceptible strains in E. faecalis was observed against these antimicrobial agents. Against Escherichia coli, carbapenems showed the highest activities: meropenem (MEPM) prevented growth of all strains at 0.25 microgram/mL; IPM prevented growth of all strains at 0.5 microgram/mL. CZOP and cefotiam (CTM) also showed strong activities against E. coli: MIC90 of CZOP was within 0.125 microgram/mL; MIC90 of CTM was within 0.5 microgram/mL. Quinolone-resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 9.3%, which was lower than that in the last year, and was higher level than those in up to 1999. MEPM showed the strongest activity against Citrobacter freundii in preventing growth of all strains at 0.125 microgram/mL. Almost all drugs showed strong activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, and MEPM prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/mL. Against Serratia marcescens, the MIC90 of gentamicin (GM) was the lowest value being 2 micrograms/mL, and those of IPM and carumonam were 8 and 16 micrograms/mL, respectively. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost all drugs were not so active. The MIC90 of GM was 8 micrograms/mL, those of IPM and amikacin were 16 micrograms/mL, and those of all other drugs were over than 32 micrograms/mL.
TI  - [Activities of antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 medical institutions during 2000 in Japan].
AB  - A survey was conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 Japanese medical institutions in 2000. A total of 25 antimicrobial agents were used, comprising 4 fluoroquinolones, 13 beta-lactams, minocycline, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, azithromycin, gentamicin, amikacin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and vancomycin. A high resistance rate of over 85% against fluoroquinolones was exhibited by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecium. Isolates showing resistance to fluoroquinolones among methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from UTI accounted for 30-60%. However, many of the common pathogens were still susceptible to fluoroquinolones, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Moraxella catarrhalis, the Enterobacteriaceae family, and Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant isolates). About 85% of P. aeruginosa isolated from RTI were susceptible to fluoroquinolones. In conclusion, this survey of sensitivity to antimicrobial agents clearly indicated trend for increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones among MRSA, Enterococci, and P. aeruginosa isolated from UTI, although fluoroquinolones are still effective against other organisms and P. aeruginosa from RTI as has been demonstrated in previous studies.
TI  - Novel semi-synthetic nocathiacin antibiotics: synthesis and antibacterial activity of bis- and mono-O-alkylated derivatives.
AB  - Several semi-synthetic bis- and mono-O-alkyl nocathiacin derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity. Mono-O-alkyl N-hydroxyindole analogues 3a-l were prepared by regioselective alkylation. Bis-O-alkyl nocathiacins 4a-f were obtained by treatment with base and excess electrophile. A one-pot protection-alkylation-deprotection strategy was developed for the preparation of mono-O-alkyl hydroxypyridine analogues 5a,b. Most of the bis- and mono-O-alkyl nocathiacins maintained good in vitro activity but showed reduced in vivo efficacy when compared with the natural product. The excellent in vivo activity and improved water solubility of phosphate analogues 3m and 4g suggest their use as potential pro-drugs.
TI  - Genetic analysis of a high-level vancomycin-resistant isolate of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Vancomycin is usually reserved for treatment of serious infections, including those caused by multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. A clinical isolate of S. aureus with high-level resistance to vancomycin (minimal inhibitory concentration = 1024 microg/ml) was isolated in June 2002. This isolate harbored a 57.9-kilobase multiresistance conjugative plasmid within which Tn1546 (vanA) was integrated. Additional elements on the plasmid encoded resistance to trimethoprim (dfrA), beta-lactams (blaZ), aminoglycosides (aacA-aphD), and disinfectants (qacC). Genetic analyses suggest that the long-anticipated transfer of vancomycin resistance to a methicillin-resistant S. aureus occurred in vivo by interspecies transfer of Tn1546 from a co-isolate of Enterococcus faecalis.

TI  - Antibacterial activity and mechanism of action of tick defensin against Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Defensins are a major group of antimicrobial peptides and are found widely in vertebrates, invertebrates and plants. Invertebrate defensins have been identified from insects, scorpions, mussels and ticks. In this study, chemically synthesized tick defensin was used to further investigate the activity spectrum and mode of action of natural tick defensin. Synthetic tick defensin showed antibacterial activity against many Gram-positive bacteria but not Gram-negative bacteria and low hemolytic activity, characteristic of invertebrate defensins. Furthermore, bactericidal activity against pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was observed. However, more than 30 min was necessary for tick defensin to completely kill bacteria. The interaction of tick defensin with the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane and its ability to disrupt the membrane potential was analyzed. Tick defensin was able to disrupt the membrane potential over a period of 30-60 min consistent with its relatively slow killing. Transmission electron microscopy of Micrococcus luteus treated with tick defensin showed lysis of the cytoplasmic membrane and leakage of cellular cytoplasmic contents. These findings suggest that the primary mechanism of action of tick defensin is bacterial cytoplasmic membrane lysis. In addition, incomplete cell division with multiple cross-wall formation was occasionally seen in tick defensin-treated bacteria showing pleiotropic secondary effects of tick defensin.
TI  - The influence of organic load on the antimicrobial activity of different concentrations of NaOCl and chlorhexidine in vitro.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate bacterial growth after contact with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl;  1 and 5%) and chlorhexidine (CHX; 0.12, 0.5 and 1%) in vitro with or without the addition of organic material (bovine serum albumin (BSA) 0.5%). METHODOLOGY: Bacterial samples (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)) of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum were kept in contact with each irrigating solution for varying intervals of time: immediately (t0), 5 min (t5), 15 min (t15) and 30 min (t30). Each test was repeated 10 times. In half of the specimens, 0.5% BSA was added as organic material in an attempt to simulate the organic tissue present in the root canal system. Bacterial growth under appropriate condition of incubation was evaluated and compared for each microorganism at all time intervals. RESULTS: A 0.12% CHX solution did not eliminate E. faecalis at any time interval. One percent CHX eliminated all strains, as did both NaOCl concentrations. BSA did not interfere substantially with the antimicrobial activity of any of the irrigating solutions. CONCLUSIONS: Under the condition of this study, a 0.12% CHX solution was ineffective at killing E. faecalis.
TI  - Structural genomics of highly conserved microbial genes of unknown function in search of new antibacterial targets.
AB  - With more than 100 antibacterial drugs at our disposal in the 1980's, the problem of bacterial infection was considered solved. Today, however, most hospital infections are insensitive to several classes of antibacterial drugs, and deadly strains of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to vancomycin--the last resort antibiotic--have recently begin to appear. Other life-threatening microbes, such as Enterococcus faecalis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis are already able to resist every available antibiotic. There is thus an urgent, and continuous need for new, preferably large-spectrum, antibacterial molecules, ideally targeting new biochemical pathways. Here we report on the progress of our structural genomics program aiming at the discovery of new antibacterial gene targets among evolutionary conserved genes of uncharacterized function. A series of bioinformatic and comparative genomics analyses were used to identify a set of 221 candidate genes common to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. These genes were split between two laboratories. They are now submitted to a systematic 3-D structure determination protocol including cloning, protein expression and purification, crystallization, X-ray diffraction, structure interpretation, and function prediction. We describe here our strategies for the 111 genes processed in our laboratory. Bioinformatics is used at most stages of the production process and out of 111 genes processed--and 17 months into the project--108 have been successfully cloned, 103 have exhibited detectable expression, 84 have led to the production of soluble protein, 46 have been purified, 12 have led to usable crystals, and 7 structures have been determined.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts of local cough mixtures on upper respiratory tract bacterial pathogens.
AB  - The punched-hole and the paper disc diffusion methods were used in screening for  the antimicrobial activity of six common ingredients used locally in cough mixtures, against the following bacteria: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus. Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp, Salmonella paratyphi, Shigella dysenteria, Shigella sonnei and Candida albicans. The results, evaluated as the diameter of zone of inhibition of microbial growth, showed that lime, garlic onion, onion and honey were active against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp and Shigella dysenteriae. Bitter-kola nut extract and palm kernel oil showed no antimicrobial activities against any of the tested organisms. None of the extracts inhibited the growth of Salmonella paratyphi and Shigella sonnei and the most susceptible organisms were Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp.
TI  - Plasmid content of a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis isolate from a patient also colonized by Staphylococcus aureus with a VanA phenotype.
AB  - Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis coisolated with vancomycin-resistant (VanA) Staphylococcus aureus was found to contain two plasmids, designated pAM830 (45 kb) and pAM831 (95 kb). pAM830, found to be conjugative and closely related to the Inc18 family of broad-host-range conjugative plasmids, encodes resistances to vancomycin (via a Tn1546-like element) and erythromycin; pAM831 encodes resistances to gentamicin, streptomycin, and erythromycin.
TI  - Concentrations in plasma, urinary excretion, and bactericidal activity of linezolid (600 milligrams) versus those of ciprofloxacin (500 milligrams) in healthy volunteers receiving a single oral dose.
AB  - In a randomized crossover study, 12 volunteers (6 males, 6 females) received a single oral dose of 600 mg of linezolid or 500 mg of ciprofloxacin to assess the concentrations in plasma (up to 24 h), urinary excretion (by high-pressure liquid chromatography), and bactericidal titers in urine (UBT) at intervals up to 120 h. The mean maximum concentration of linezolid in plasma was 13.1 mg/liter, and that of ciprofloxacin was 2.46 mg/liter. The median cumulative levels of renal excretion of the administered dose of the parent drug were 44% for linezolid (range, 28 to 47%; mean +/- standard deviation, 40% +/- 7.8%) and 43% for ciprofloxacin (range, 20 to 56%; mean +/- standard deviation, 40% +/- 9.3%). The UBTs, i.e., the highest twofold dilution (with antibiotic-free urine used as the diluent) of urine that was still bactericidal, were determined for a reference strain and five gram-positive clinical uropathogens for which the MICs of linezolid and ciprofloxacin were as follows: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 27278, 2 and 0.25 mg/liter, respectively; Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible), 1 and 16 mg/liter, respectively; Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin resistant), 2 and 64 mg/liter, respectively; Staphylococcus saprophyticus (methicillin susceptible), 1 and 0.25 mg/liter, respectively; Enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 1 mg/liter, respectively; and Enterococcus faecium, 2 and 1 mg/liter, respectively. The median UBTs of linezolid measured within the first 6 h were 1:96 for each of the two enterococcal strains and between 1:128 and 1:256 for the four staphylococcal strains. The median UBTs of ciprofloxacin were 1:64 for the two enterococcal strains; between 1:384 and 1:512 for the two ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains; and 1 (bactericidal activity of undiluted urine only) and 1:2 for the two resistant staphylococcal strains, respectively. The areas under the UBT-time curve (AUBT) for linezolid and ciprofloxacin showed no statistically significant (P<0.05) differences except for a better AUBT for linezolid for the two ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococcal strains. For linezolid there were no statistically significant differences in UBTs or AUBTs for ciprofloxacin-susceptible and -resistant strains. Thus, the bactericidal activities of linezolid and ciprofloxacin against susceptible strains in urine were comparable, whereas linezolid also exhibited the same good bactericidal activity against ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. Therefore, linezolid should be tested for use as empirical treatment for complicated urinary tract infections due to gram-positive uropathogens in an appropriate clinical trial.
TI  - Array synthesis of novel lipodepsipeptide.
AB  - Synthetic array technology was utilized to rapidly synthesize and analyze a diverse set of reductive alkylation analogues of daptomycin. Analysis of the array suggested the use of polar functionality such as sulfonamides or amide or polar spaces such as piperazine would beneficially affect activity.
TI  - Bactericidal activity and synergy studies of BAL9141, a novel pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephem, tested against streptococci, enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  - BAL9141 has been reported to have inhibitory activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), many enterococci, and streptococci with various resistant patterns. BAL9141 potency was assessed by time-kill curves alone or with subinhibitory concentrations of gentamicin (MIC/4). BAL9141 exhibited bactericidal activity alone against all the streptococci and staphylococci. Among ampicillin-susceptible enterococci, BAL9141 was bactericidal against some strains, but no BAL9141 inhibition was observed of ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The activity of BAL9141 with gentamicin was slightly enhanced (not synergy) or indifferent against staphylococci. BAL9141 demonstrated bactericidal action alone against Enterococcus faecalis and some E. faecium strains (-4.8 to -6.0 log10 CFU/mL), but static effects were also noted. Drug interactions with gentamicin showed early synergy (4-8 h) for all enterococci, and indifference or synergy at 24 h (no antagonism). BAL9141 (< or = 8 mg/L) showed promising bactericidal activity alone and synergy with gentamicin against some of the vancomycin-resistant enterococci tested.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of methyl ether derivatives of the vancomycin, teicoplanin, and ristocetin aglycon methyl esters.
AB  - A series of methyl ether derivatives of the vancomycin, teicoplanin, and ristocetin aglycon methyl esters was synthesized and their antimicrobial activity was established. These derivatives exhibit increased activity against VanB resistant strains of bacteria equipotent with that observed with sensitive bacteria.
TI  - Molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pRE25 of Enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  - Plasmid pRE25 from Enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to E. faecalis JH2-2, Lactococcus lactis Bu2, and Listeria innocua L19. Its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (Plasmid 46 (2001) 170). The gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pIP501 of Streptococcus agalactiae. Erythromycin resistance is due to a 23S ribosomal RNA methyl transferase, again as found in pIP501 (ermB). The aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon Tn5405 of Staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). Identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. aureus, Campylobacter coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. pRE25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pIP501. Of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsB, traC, trsF, trsJ, and trsL). The enterococcal part is joined into the pIP501 part by insertion elements IS1216V of E. faecium Tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of IS1062 (E. faecalis) and IS1485 (E. faecium). pRE25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.
TI  - The screening of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactic acid bacteria and their application to inactivating psychrotrophic food-borne pathogens.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were isolated from various food samples and evaluated for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Cells suspended in 0.5% (wt/vol) glucose plus 0.5% (wt/vol) lactate (pH 7.0) were incubated for 5 h at 37 degrees C under aeration. Among 193 strains, 27 strains accumulated 201-300 ppm H2O2, and 4 strains accumulated more than 301 ppm H2O2 in the cell suspensions. Among the 9 high-level H2O2-producing strains, 8 strains were identified as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. The cell-free filtrate from Lc. lactis subsp. lactis AI 62, which contained approximately 350 ppm H2O2, was evaluated for antimicrobial activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Listeria ivanovii, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Aeromonas hydrophila. After 1 h incubation at 30 degrees C in the cell-free filtrate, the initial viable cell counts of the target bacteria (5.53-6.00 log cfu/mL) were reduced by 0.12-5.00 log units, except in the case of enterococci. The sensitivity varied with the bacterial species and pH. The enterococci were resistant to the treatment. Our results show that H2O2 accumulated by lactic acid bacteria in a cell suspension is very effective in reducing the viable cell count of food-borne pathogens.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. A total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.
TI  - New benzylidenethiazolidinediones as antibacterial agents.
AB  - A novel benzylidenethiazolidinedione has been discovered with antimicrobial activity. Here, we present the results of a structure-activity study on this compound with respect to its antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Establishment of an arbitrary PCR for rapid identification of Tn917 insertion sites in Staphylococcus epidermidis: characterization of biofilm-negative and nonmucoid mutants.
AB  - Transposon mutagenesis with the Enterococcus faecalis transposon Tn917 is a genetic approach frequently used to identify genes related with specific phenotypes in gram-positive bacteria. We established an arbitrary PCR for the rapid and easy identification of Tn917 insertion sites in Staphylococcus epidermidis with six independent, well-characterized biofilm-negative Tn917 transposon mutants, which were clustered in the icaADBC gene locus or harbor Tn917 in the regulatory gene rsbU. For all six of these mutants, short chromosomal DNA fragments flanking both transposon ends could be amplified. All fragments were sufficient to correctly identify the Tn917 insertion sites in the published S. epidermidis genomes. By using this technique, the Tn917 insertion sites of three not-yet-characterized biofilm-negative or nonmucoid mutants were identified. In the biofilm-negative and nonmucoid mutant M12, Tn917 is inserted into a gene homologous to the regulatory gene purR of Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. The Tn917 insertions of the nonmucoid but biofilm-positive mutants M16 and M20 are located in genes homologous to components of the phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) of B. subtilis, S. aureus, and Staphylococcus carnosus, indicating an influence of the PTS on the mucoid phenotype in S. epidermidis.
TI  - Identification of species of Brucella using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
AB  - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a technique that has been used  over the years in chemical analysis for the identification of substances and is one that may be applied to the characterisation of microorganisms. The marked tendency of Brucella towards variation in the smooth rough phase, together with the laboriousness and risk involved in the methods used in their identification, make their classification difficult. We studied the type strains of the different species and biovars of Brucella and 11 isolates of human origin of Brucella melitensis, six corresponding to biovar 1, one to biovar 2 and five to biovar 3. The results of linear discriminant analysis performed using the data provide an above 95% likelihood of correct classification, over half of which are in fact above 99% for the vast majority of Brucella strains. Only one case of B. melitensis biovar 1 has been incorrectly classified. The rest of the microorganisms studied (Staphylococcus aureus, Strteptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) have been classified correctly in all cases to a likelihood of over 80%. In the graphic representation of the analysis, a grouping of these can be seen in clusters, which include the different species. One of these comprises B. melitensis, another Brucella abortus, and another wider one is made up of Brucella suis. The Brucella canis, Brucella ovis and Brucella neotomae strains appear separate from the previously described groups.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of short hydrophobic and basic-rich peptides.
AB  - OBJECTIVE-To design short and potent analogs of bovine lactoferricin by use of the concepts of lipophilic bulk and cationic charge. SAMPLE POPULATION-5 synthetic peptides of bovine lactoferricin. PROCEDURE: Antibacterial peptides were constructed by synthesizing several decapeptides rich in arginine and tryptophan. Basic residues of bovine lactoferricin (bLf 20-29; residues 20 to 29) were modified by substitution with arginine or lysine and nonbasic residues were modified by substitution with tryptophan, phenylalanine, or isoleucine. Synthetic peptides of bovine lactoferrin (LFB) were designated as LFB-RW (RRWWWRWRRW), LFB-KW (KKWWWKWKKW), LFB-RWa (RRWWRRWRRW), LFB-RF (RRFFFRFRRF), and LFB-RI (RRIIIRWRRI), where R, K, W, F, and I stand for arginine, lysine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, and isoleucine, respectively. Peptides were evaluated by determining their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. RESULTS: LFB-RW, LFB-KW, and LFB-RWa possessed equivalent potency as bLf 20-29 against E coli. LFB-RW and LFB-RWa had a 2-fold increase in growth-inhibitory and bactericidal activity against S aureus, compared with bLf 20-29. LFB-RI had the lowest MIC value against E coli among the peptides but lost bactericidal activity. LFB-RW and LFB-KW had stronger bactericidal activities against S aureus or E faecalis, respectively, as well as E coli than the other synthetic peptides. LFB-RF also had antibacterial activity, but this was 2-fold less than that of LFB-RW, as determined by MIC and MBC values. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In construction of potent antibacterial peptides, inclusion of arginine, lysine, tryptophan, or isoleucine residues enhances effectiveness against certain bacteria, as measured by MIC or MBC values.
TI  - Role of quinupristin/dalfopristin in the treatment of Gram-positive nosocomial infections in haematological or oncological patients.
AB  - Gram-positive pathogens, primarily Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, viridans group streptococci, and enterococci, are now the predominant causes of infection in neutropenic haematology/oncology patients, but are often resistant to multiple antibiotics. Glycopeptides have been the only alternative antibiotic treatments for multidrug-resistant Gram-positive infections to date. However, glycopeptides are not always effective or well tolerated, and can produce nephrotoxic or ototoxic effects. Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a recently introduced streptogramin antibiotic that is active in vitro against most of the major Gram-positive pathogens causing infection in neutropenic patients. Recent studies of the in vitro susceptibility of clinical isolates of Gram-positive pathogens to quinupristin/dalfopristin are summarized. Pre-clinical and clinical studies of the efficacy and safety of quinupristin/dalfopristin in the treatment of Gram-positive infections are reviewed. Quinupristin/dalfopristin is active in vitro against the vast majority of recent isolates of relevant Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, viridans group streptococci, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, but excluding Enterococcus faecalis. Pre-clinical and clinical data indicate the efficacy of quinupristin/dalfopristin in infections caused by these organisms, including bacteraemia and catheter-related infections. Quinupristin/dalfopristin is not associated with nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity. Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a potential alternative to glycopeptides in haematology or oncology patients with multidrug-resistant Gram-positive infections, especially those who are unresponsive to, or intolerant of, glycopeptides.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of different concentrations of NaOCl and chlorhexidine using a contact test.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyze the in vitro antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite (1% and 5%) and chlorhexidine (0.12%, 0.5% and 1%). Bacterial samples (ATCC) of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum were submitted to a contact test. Solutions were evaluated at different time intervals: immediately, 5 min, 15 min, and 30 min after contact and repeated 10 times. The results of the contact test showed that 0.12% chlorhexidine did not eliminate E. faecalis at any time interval, while 0.5% and 1% chlorhexidine and 1% and 5% sodium hypochlorite did. These results permit us to conclude that to obtain better antimicrobial activity, chlorhexidine in a concentration greater than 0.12% should be used.
TI  - Soft antimicrobial agents: synthesis and activity of labile environmentally friendly long chain quaternary ammonium compounds.
AB  - A series of soft quaternary ammonium antimicrobial agents, which are analogues to currently used quaternary ammonium preservatives such as cetyl pyridinium chloride and benzalkonium chloride, were synthesized. These soft analogues consist of long alkyl chain connected to a polar headgroup via chemically labile spacer group. They are characterized by facile nonenzymatic and enzymatic degradation to form their original nontoxic building blocks. However, their chemical stability has to be adequate in order for them to have antimicrobial effects. Stability studies and antibacterial and antiviral activity measurements revealed relationship between activity, lipophilicity, and stability. Their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was as low as 1 microg/mL, and their viral reduction was in some cases greater than 6.7 log. The structure-activity studies demonstrate that the bioactive compounds (i.e., MIC for Gram-positive bacteria of <10 microg/mL) have an alkyl chain length between 12 and 18 carbon atoms, with a polar headgroup preferably of a small quaternary ammonium group, and their acquired inactivation half-life must be greater than 3 h at 60 degrees C.
TI  - The antimicrobial efficacy of 'MGP' gutta-percha in vitro.
AB  - AIM: To determine whether 'MGP' gutta-percha (Westport, CT, USA), a commercially  available gutta-percha containing iodoform, inhibits the growth of potential endodontic pathogens. METHODOLOGY: Inocula of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus sanguis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces odontolyticus were spread onto the surface of agar plates. 'MGP' gutta-percha cones presoaked in sterile water were transferred to the inoculated agar and incubated at 37 degrees C aerobically or anaerobically as required for optimal growth. Identical studies were performed using iodoform-free gutta-percha and sterile paper disks saturated with 10% povidone-iodine. Following incubation, zones of inhibition around the 'MGP' gutta-percha, iodoform-free gutta-percha and disks were evaluated. RESULTS: Povidone-iodine inhibited all the strains. Iodoform-free gutta-percha inhibited S. sanguis and A. odontolyticus. 'MGP' gutta-percha inhibited S. aureus, S. sanguis, A. odontolyticus and F. nucleatum. Neither iodoform-free gutta-percha nor 'MGP' gutta-percha inhibited growth of E. faecalis, E. coli or P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to iodoform-free gutta-percha, iodoform-containing 'MGP' gutta-percha had an inhibitory effect in vitro on S. aureus and F. nucleatum, but not on E. faecalis, E. coli or P. aeruginosa.
TI  - DNA binding ligands targeting drug-resistant bacteria: structure, activity, and pharmacology.
AB  - We describe the lead optimization and structure-activity relationship of DNA minor-groove binding ligands, a novel class of antibacterial molecules. These compounds have been shown to target A/T-rich sites within the bacterial genome and, as a result, inhibit DNA replication and RNA transcription. The optimization was focused on N-terminal aromatic heterocycles and C-terminal amines and resulted in compounds with improved in vivo tolerability and excellent in vitro antibacterial potency (MIC >/= 0.031 microg/mL) against a broad range of Gram-positive pathogens, including drug-resistant strains such as methicillin-resistant Stapylococcus aureus (MRSA), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). In a first proof-of-concept study, a selected compound (35) showed in vivo efficacy in a mouse peritonitis model against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection with an ED(50) value of 30 mg/kg.
TI  - A comparison of the bacteria found on the hands of 'homemakers' and neonatal intensive care unit nurses.
AB  - This prevalence study was conducted to compare the counts, types and antimicrobial resistance profiles of bacterial flora on the hands of individuals in the community to that of nurses at a nearby university teaching hospital, with an intense hand hygiene regimen. Hand cultures were obtained from 204 individuals during a home visit and 119 nurses in two neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). The mean total log counts of organisms were 5.73 and 5.24 for the homemakers [defined as the person (usually the mother) who is the primary person responsible for arranging childcare, cooking, cleaning etc] and nurse hands, respectively (P<0.0001). Significantly more homemakers had Acinetobacter lwoffii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens/putida, and Staphylococcus aureus on their hands compared with the nurses (all P<0.05). However, significantly more nurses had Enterococcus faecalis, S. epidermidis, and S. warneri on their hands (P<0.05). Of note, the hands of nurses harboured significantly more S. epidermidis strains resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and oxacillin and S. warneri resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, and oxacillin (P<0.05). Surprisingly, significantly more trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant S. epidermidis and ciprofloxacin-resistant S. warneri was recovered from the hands of homemakers (P<0.05). This study demonstrates differences in prevalence, bacterial composition and antimicrobial resistance of hand flora of hospital personnel compared with homemakers. Moreover, the hands of homemakers may serve as community reservoirs for antimicrobial resistant strains of clinical importance.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic profile of daptomycin against Enterococcus species and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a murine thigh infection model.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the pharmacodynamic profile of daptomycin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococci species based on bacterial density in an immunocompromised mouse thigh infection model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of daptomycin was determined against two MRSA, one vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, and one vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis using the immunocompromised murine thigh model. Efficacy was assessed by the change in log10 cfu in thighs after 24 h of drug treatment. RESULTS: Daptomycin produced a maximal kill of 4.5-5 log10 cfu against the MRSA and 1.5-2 log10 for the Enterococcus species. AUC/MIC was the most predictive of the PD parameters. Utilizing MICs determined in serum or broth in the calculation of the PD parameters had minimal effect on this correlation. AUCfree/MICbroth required for static effects with MRSA and Enterococcus species were 12-36 and 5-13, whereas 99% of maximal kill was achieved at ratios of 171-442 and 38-157, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These data reveal the potent in vivo bactericidal activity of daptomycin against MRSA and Enterococcus species using clinically achievable drug exposures (dose 4-6 mg/kg per day) currently under investigation in man.
TI  - Nosocomial bloodstream infections in pediatric patients in United States hospitals: epidemiology, clinical features and susceptibilities.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We identified the predominant pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibilities of nosocomial bloodstream isolates in pediatric patients in the US Prospective surveillance for nosocomial bloodstream infections at 49 hospitals during a 6-year period [Surveillance and Control of Pathogens of Epidemiologic Importance (SCOPE)] detected 22 609 bloodstream infections, of which 3432 occurred in patients < or =16 years of age. RESULTS: Gram-positive organisms accounted for 65% of cases, Gram-negative organisms accounted for 24% of cases and 11% were caused by fungi. The overall crude mortality was 14% (475 of 3432) but notably higher for infections caused by Candida spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 20 and 29%, respectively. The most common organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (43%), enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida spp. (each, 9%). The mean interval between admission and infection averaged 21 days for coagulase-negative staphylococci, 25 days for S. aureus and Candida spp., 32 days for Klebsiella spp. and 34 days for Enterococcus spp. The proportion of methicillin-resistant S. aureus increased from 10% in 1995 to 29% in 2001. Vancomycin-resistance was seen in 1% of Enterococcus faecalis and in 11% of Enterococcus faecium isolates. CONCLUSION: Nosocomial BSI occurred predominantly in very young and/or critically ill children. Gram-positive pathogens predominated across all ages, and increasing antimicrobial resistance was observed in pediatric patients.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of different chemical agents for the decontamination of gutta-percha cones.
AB  - This study evaluated the effectiveness of three disinfectants used in Dentistry for decontamination of gutta-percha cones. Sixty gutta-percha cones were contaminated with standardized pure cultures of five species of microorganisms (Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Candida albicans ATCC CBS-ICB/USP 562, Bacillus subtilis spores ATCC 6633 and Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175). The cones were treated with 10% polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine aqueous solution (PVP-I; Groups 1 and 2), 5.25% aqueous sodium hypochlorite (Groups 3 and 4) and paraformaldehyde tablets (Group 5). All chemical agents were efficient for the cold sterilization of gutta-percha cones in short time periods.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in Burkina Faso.
AB  - Burkina Faso is one of the Subsaharan African nations. No national services for monitoring of antibiotic resistance are available, so the number of reports of resistance patterns among hospital pathogens are inconsistent. In order to evaluate antibiotic resistance, a total of 1998 valuable microrganisms were analysed during 2000 at the Medical Centre St. Camille of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso's capital. They were isolated as follows: 1012 from urine-culture, 503 from tonsil swabs, 398 from pus, 53 from sputum and 32 from blood-cultures. Escherichia coli was the most isolated microrganism from urine (44%); Enterococcus faecalis from tonsil swabs (96.4%), Staphylococcus aureus from pus (17%) and K. pneumoniae (70%) from sputum. In general, resistance to the old antibiotics, such as aminopenicillins and cotrimoxazole was shown. The most active antibiotic was norfloxacin, a rarely used antibiotic in this country. In conclusion, our study shows that it is necessary to create antibiotic-resistance surveillance centers in the developing countries to adopt an accurate therapy to avoid exporting of antibiotic resistance to the developed countries linked to increased emigration.
TI  - In vitro conjugal transfer of tetracycline resistance from Lactobacillus isolates to other Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The ability of 14 Lactobacillus strains, isolated from fermented dry sausages, to transfer tetracycline resistance encoded by tet(M) through conjugation was examined using filter mating experiments. Seven out of 14 tetracycline-resistant Lactobacillus isolates were able to transfer in vitro this resistance to Enterococcus faecalis at frequencies ranging from 10(-4) to 10(-6) transconjugants per recipient. Two of these strains could also transfer their resistance to Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, whereas no conjugal transfer to a Staphylococcus aureus recipient was found. These data suggest that meat lactobacilli might be reservoir organisms for acquired resistance genes that can be spread to other lactic acid bacteria. In order to assess the risk of this potential hazard, the magnitude of transfer along the food chain merits further research.
TI  - Diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on Helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  - Among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (AA) is one of the most important. AA has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on Helicobacter pylori. However, there are limited studies on the possible role of AA and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (PA) on the growth and survival of H. pylori. In the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that AA in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mM) inhibited H. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. In contrast, under aerobic conditions AA in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mM) significantly increased the survival of H. pylori presumably eliminating the toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. The hydrophobic derivative of AA, PA (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mM). This effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Clostridium sporogenes and Campylobacter jejuni. Among these bacterial strains, PA showed a similar inhibitory effect on B. cereus and B. subtilis as observed with H. pylori. The results suggest that PA may be considered an important AA derivative in eradication of H. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.
TI  - Evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of urinary catheters impregnated with antiseptics in an in vitro urinary tract model.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-term efficacy of urinary Foley catheters (latex  and silicone) impregnated with (1) chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine (CXS) and (2) chlorhexidine, silver sulfadiazine, and triclosan (CXST) in inhibiting extra-luminal bacterial adherence and to compare their efficacy with that of silver hydrogel latex (SH) and nitrofurazone-treated silicone (NF) catheters. DESIGN: The antimicrobial spectrum of these catheters was evaluated using a zone of inhibition assay. A novel in vitro urinary tract model was developed to study the potential in vivo efficacy of antimicrobial catheters in preventing extraluminal bacterial colonization. The "meatus" was inoculated daily with Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aerginosa, and Candida albicans. The "bladder" portion of the model was cultured daily to determine bacterial growth. RESULTS: Both CXS and CXST catheters had a broader antimicrobial spectrum than SH and NF catheters. In the in vitro model, CXST latex and silicone catheters exhibited significantly better efficacy (3 to 25days) against uropathogens, compared with CXS (1 to 14 days) and control (0 to 5 days) catheters (P = .01). CXST latex catheters exhibited significantly longer protection against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, compared with SH catheters (P = .01). CXST silicone catheters resisted colonization with Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis for a significantly longer period (23 to 24 days) than did NF catheters (9 to 11 days) (P = .01). CONCLUSION: Catheters impregnated with synergistic combinations of chlorhexidine, silver sulfadiazine, and triclosan exhibited broad-spectrum, long-term resistance against microbial colonization on their outer surfaces.
TI  - Effect of linezolid on the phagocytic functions of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  - The effect of linezolid on the phagocytic and bactericidal functions of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) against gram-positive cocci was evaluated. Preincubation (30 min; 37 degrees C) of PMN with different concentrations of linezolid (2, 10 and 20 mg/l) did not significantly affect the phagocytosis of either Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible and resistant) or Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin susceptible and resistant). Overnight exposure of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis to 1/4 minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of linezolid slightly increased phagocytosis by PMN. Preincubation of the other three strains with 1/4 MIC of linezolid did not affect phagocytosis by these cells. Preincubation of PMN (30 min; 37 degrees C) using different extracellular concentrations of linezolid (2, 10 and 20 mg/l) did not affect their production of either superoxide or hydrogen peroxide radicals. In conclusion, linezolid did not affect the phagocytic and bactericidal functions of human PMN.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activities of daptomycin against Staphylococcus aureus and  Enterococcus faecalis are not mediated by inhibition of lipoteichoic acid biosynthesis.
AB  - Previous studies have suggested that lipoteichoic acid biosynthesis inhibition is the mechanism of action of daptomycin. In this investigation, daptomycin inhibited all macromolecular synthesis in Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus hirae without kinetic or dose specificity for lipoteichoic acid. Daptomycin remained bactericidal in the absence of ongoing lipoteichoic acid synthesis. Inhibition of lipoteichoic acid synthesis is apparently not the mechanism of action of daptomycin in these pathogens.
TI  - In vitro activities of novel oxapenems, alone and in combination with ceftazidime, against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.
AB  - Four novel oxapenem compounds (i.e., AM-112, AM-113, AM-114, and AM-115) were investigated for their beta-lactamase inhibitory activity against a panel of isolated class A, C, and D enzymes, which included expanded-spectrum beta-lactamase enzymes (ESBLs). The oxapenems were potent beta-lactamase inhibitors. Activity varied within the group, with AM-113 and AM-114 proving to be the most active compounds. The 50% inhibitory concentrations for these agents were up to 100,000-fold lower than that of clavulanic acid against class C and D enzymes. As a group, the oxapenems were more potent than clavulanic acid against enzymes from all classes. The ability of these compounds to protect ceftazidime from hydrolysis by beta-lactamase-producing strains was evaluated by MIC tests that combined ceftazidime and each oxapenem in a 1:1 or 2:1 ratio. The oxapenems markedly reduced the MICs for ceftazidime against class C hyperproducing strains and strains producing TEM- and SHV-derived ESBLs. There was little difference between the activity of 1:1 and 2:1 combinations of ceftazidime and oxapenem. The oxapenems failed to enhance the activity of ceftazidime against derepressed AmpC-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains.
TI  - Lavage of contaminated surfaces: an in vitro evaluation of the effectiveness of different systems.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lavage is an effective, additive therapeutic procedure with a broad application in surgery. In addition to irrigation with the conventional syringe, the pulsed jet lavage system is used. The effectiveness of bacterial reduction depends on, among other things, the irrigation pressure. Complications of high-irrigation pressure in bone and joint surgery are intramedullary seeding of bacteria, visible damage of the bone, or delayed healing of the fracture by lavage of the fracture zone. The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effectiveness of mechanical irrigation on several surfaces using different systems of irrigation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four different test surfaces (nonbiological surfaces: sterilized bone cement and titanium osteosynthesis plates; biological surfaces: gamma-irradiated bovine muscle and cancellous bone) were contaminated with a defined suspension of different bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The samples were irrigated with three different systems (conventional 50-ml plastic syringe, manual pump irrigator, jet lavage) in a standardized, randomized experimental setup. After irrigation of the sample the amount of residual bacteria (colony-forming units) was determined. RESULTS: An effective bacterial reduction was achieved with the use of irrigation regardless of the system that was used and surface that was cleaned. On average P. aeruginosa was reduced around log 1.907, E. faecalis around log 1.666 and S. aureus around log 1.506. On biological surfaces, a reduction around log 0.801 for muscle and around log 1.738 for bone samples was achieved independent of the system that was used for irrigation. For the titanium surface a reduction of log 1.652 compared with log 2.580 for the bone cement surface was demonstrated. Statistical analysis showed that mechanical lavage resulted in a significant reduction of all tested bacterial species on the surfaces. The best bacterial reduction was achieved with the manual pump irrigator (P = 0.06). The results demonstrate that the manual pump irrigator achieved significantly better bacterial reduction (P = 0.039) on "biological surfaces" (bone and muscle) compared with nonbiological surfaces (titanium and cement). CONCLUSION: The results show that irrigation is an effective technique for bacterial reduction on contaminated surfaces. A remarkable finding was the limited bacterial reduction of Staphylococcus aureus from gamma-sterilized muscle. The use of a continuous manual pump irrigator showed a greater reduction of bacteria contamination compared with the other means of irrigation investigated. In conclusion, the manual continuous irrigation system proved to be practical, economical and effective in reducing the bacterial load on various surfaces.
TI  - Small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  - Taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. Importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. Here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni. Large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two S. aureus libraries, highly representative. Consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. The use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and interference of tobramycin and chloramphenicol on bacterial adhesion to intraocular lenses.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of tobramycin and chloramphenicol were evaluated by  determining minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, group A, group B and group G streptococci, Klebsiella spp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and ciprofloxacin-resistant and -susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as by evaluating interference on adhesion of slime producer strains of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa to intraocular lens from tobramycin and chloramphenicol pharmaceutical products by scanning electron microscopy. Chloramphenicol was more active against Gram-positive bacteria than was tobramycin, which instead showed higher activity against ciprofloxacin-susceptible P. aeruginosa. Treatment of lenses with the antimicrobial products eradicated the bacterial biofilm, which was already notably reduced after 5 min. This activity was more pronounced for chloramphenicol against S. aureus and for tobramycin against P. aeruginosa. Bacterial adhesion was also significantly reduced when lenses colonized by P. aeruginosa were treated with chloramphenicol, even if they were resistant to this drug. In conclusion, the tested drugs showed marked antibacterial activity, particularly by interfering with bacterial biofilms. The data obtained in this study suggest a specific use of chloramphenicol in topical prophylaxis aimed at avoiding bacterial contaminations. However, further specific in vivo studies are needed to confirm these data.
TI  - A comparison of the antimicrobial resistance patterns of gram-positive cocci isolated from community-private and university-affiliated hospitals from Puerto Rico.
AB  - The antimicrobial resistance patterns of 2,462 selected Gram-positive cocci obtained from three Community-Private Hospitals (CPH) and three University-Affiliated Hospitals (UAH) were evaluated utilizing the institutions' antimicrobial susceptibility reports for the year 2000. The objectives of this study were: 1) to evaluate the in vitro resistance to selected standard antibiotics of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates, and 2) to compare the antimicrobial resistance patterns between community-private (CPH) and university-affiliated hospitals (UAH). Staphylococcus aureus was the most common Gram-positive isolated organism in CPH (63.3%) followed by E. faecalis (31.0%). In UAH, the most prevalent cocci were E. faecalis (51.7%) followed by S. aureus (43.9%). Enterococcus faecium represented 2.3% and 4.4% of CPH and UAH isolates, respectively. Streptococcus pneumoniae represented 3.4% of the total Gram-positive isolates from CPH, no S. pneumoniae was reported in UAH. The antimicrobial susceptibility results showed that for Staphylococcus aureus there was a statistically significant higher resistance to methicillin and thrimethoprim sulfamethoxazole in UAH, while resistance to erythromycin was significantly higher in CPH. There was no difference in the resistance of S. aureus to other antimicrobial agents between hospitals groups. A statistically significant resistant to vancomycin was found between enterococcal isolates from UAH (43%) and CPH (12.7%). High-level aminoglycoside resistance (HLAR) was observed among UAH enterococcal isolates with E. faecium showing a higher resistance than E. faecalis, no data for HLAR in CPH could be obtained. For pneumococci 46% of CPH isolates were resistant to penicillin. In summary, there are important differences in the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance between the Gram-positive bacteria isolated from community and teaching hospitals.
TI  - Crayfish broth for bacterial culture.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To formulate a new growth medium for bacteriological studies. METHODS: Sun dried white shrimps, Nematopalaemon hastatus, were ground into fine powder and infused in distilled water at 7+/-1 degrees C for 24 h. The pH of the infusion was adjusted to 7.2 with NaOH (0.1 m) and HCl (0.1 m) and evaporated to dryness. Crayfish broth (CB) was produced by reconstituting the concentrate in distilled water and sodium chloride was added at 0.9% w/v. Crayfish infusion agar (CIA) and crayfish starch agar (CSA) were prepared with CB as nutrient base. The crayfish broth and agar were evaluated alongside with nutrient broth and agar (Oxoid) for ability to support growth of pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Crayfish broth was tested for suitability for sugar fermentation and indole test and results compared with those obtained with peptone water. Its suitability as a sensitivity test medium was evaluated using ampicillin (10 microg) and gentamicin (10 microg) discs and results compared with those obtained using Mueller-Hinton agar (Oxoid). RESULTS: Crayfish broth comprises crayfish infusion concentrate 3.5 g and sodium chloride 9.0 g dissolved in one litre of distilled water. The crayfish broth, CSA supported the growth of the test pathogens with cultural characteristics similar to those seen on nutrient agar. The pH of the spent crayfish broth was near neutral (pH 6.9). The broth was as important as peptone water for sugar fermentation test but was not suitable for indole test. The results of antibiotic susceptibility test on CIA were comparable with those obtained on Mueller-Hinton agar with difference in zone diameters of not more than 1 mm. CONCLUSION: Crayfish broth possesses enormous potential as a new growth medium for bacterial studies.
TI  - Susceptibility of Gram-positive bacteria from ICU patients in UK hospitals to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Microbiologists in 25 sentinel laboratories were each asked to refer up to 100 clinically-significant Gram-positive bacteria isolated from consecutive intensive care unit (ICU) patients. A total of 1595 isolates were collected from patients in 23 hospitals; these included Staphylococcus aureus (47.6%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (30.6%), enterococci (14.3%), pneumococci (2.8%) and other streptococci (3.5%). A few coryneforms, other bacilli and a Nocardia sp. were also collected. Rates of oxacillin resistance among S. aureus and CNS isolates were 59.3 and 78.5%, respectively. Vancomycin-resistant S. aureus were not detected, although two isolates (0.3%) were resistant to teicoplanin [minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) 8 mg/L]. In contrast, 13.7% of CNS were teicoplanin resistant (MICs 8-32 mg/L) and 1.2% were resistant to vancomycin. Among the enterococci, 72.5% were Enterococcus faecalis and 24.5% were Enterococcus faecium, the remainder including isolates of Enterococcus casseliflavus or Enterococcus gallinarum. Eighteen percent of E. faecium isolates were vancomycin-resistant, compared with only 3% of E. faecalis isolates. Rates of high-level gentamicin resistance in E. faecalis and E. faecium were 40 and 25%, respectively. Nine percent of pneumococci and streptococci were resistant to penicillin, with 7 and 11%, respectively, resistant to erythromycin. None of the isolates showed resistance to linezolid, with the MICs for the entire study population falling in the range of 0.5-4 mg/L.
TI  - A prospective study of infections in lung cancer patients admitted to the hospital.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the type of infections occurring in hospitalized patients with lung cancer. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Department of internal medicine in a cancer hospital. PATIENTS: All patients with lung cancer who were hospitalized for any cause and who acquired infections at the time of admission or during the hospital stay between January 1997 and February 2001. INTERVENTIONS: None. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-five patients with lung cancer had 435 episodes of fever and/or microbiologically or otherwise documented infection. Two hundred eighteen patients (79.3%) presented with non-small cell lung carcinoma, while 49 patients (17.8%) had small cell lung cancer. The majority of the infections occurred in the tracheobronchial tree (56%). There were 38 episodes of bacteremia or fungemia, and the primary site of infection was identified in 18 cases (47%). Microbiologically documented infections accounted for 61% of the infectious episodes, and included a total of 312 microorganisms. The most frequent pathogens were Gram-negative bacteria (64%), followed by Gram-positive bacteria (25%) and fungi (8%). The predominant Gram-negative bacteria were Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Enterococcus faecalis essentially represented the Gram-positive bacteria. No multiresistant bacteria were observed. Bacteria were susceptible to most of the antibiotics classically administered for their treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The predominant site of infection in patients with lung cancer is the tracheobronchial tree, with S pneumoniae, S aureus, H influenzae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and M catarrhalis as the principal pathogens.
TI  - Bacterial translocation after cirrhotic liver resection: a clinical investigation of 181 patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cirrhotic patients are usually associated with a high susceptibility  to infection. Although bacterial translocation from gut mucosa to mesenteric lymph node (MLN) and systemic circulation is a well-known phenomenon after hepatectomy, its role in cirrhotic patients remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MLN was harvested for bacterial culture before and after liver resection in 181 cirrhotic patients. The characteristics and postoperative courses of patients with positive and negative bacterial culture for MLN after hepatectomy were compared. Postoperative systemic antibiotics were administered if infectious complications occurred. RESULTS: No bacteria were cultured in MLN before hepatectomy. Bacterial translocation (BT) to MLN after hepatectomy occurred in 36 patients (BT group). After multivariate analysis, intraoperative blood transfusion was the only independent factor that influenced bacterial translocation rates after cirrhotic liver resection. BT group patients also had higher infectious and overall complication rates, with a longer postoperative hospital stay. Among the cultured bacteriae from infected sites in BT group patients with infectious complications, only 2 patients (12.5%) had totally different bacterial species to those cultured from MLNs. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial translocation more often occurred after liver resection in cirrhotic patients who received intraoperative blood transfusion. Such patients had higher postoperative infectious and overall complication rates. Thus, avoidance of intraoperative blood transfusion is mandatory for cirrhotic liver resection.
TI  - Optimization of computer software settings improves accuracy of pulsed-field gel  electrophoresis macrorestriction fragment pattern analysis.
AB  - Computer-assisted analysis of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) libraries can facilitate comparisons of fragment patterns present on multiple gels. We evaluated the ability of the Advanced Analysis (version 4.01) and Database (version 1.12) modules of the Phoretix gel analysis software package (Nonlinear USA, Inc., Durham, N.C.) to accurately match DNA fragment patterns. Two gels containing 38 lanes of SmaI-digested Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF DNA were analyzed to assess the impact of (i) varying the lane position of the standards, (ii) using gel plugs made at different times, and (iii) normalizing the fragment patterns by using molecular weight (MW) algorithms versus retardation factor (R(f)) algorithms. Two sets of PFGE libraries (one containing SmaI restriction patterns from 62 Enterococcus faecium isolates and the other containing SmaI restriction patterns of 89 Staphylococcus aureus isolates) were analyzed to assess the impact of varying the matching tolerance algorithm (designated as the vector box setting [VBS]) in the Phoretix software. Varying the lane position of standards on a gel and using gel plugs made on different days resulted in different VBSs, although it was not possible to judge whether those differences were statistically significant. Normalization of E. faecalis OG1RF fragment patterns by R(f) and MW methodology yielded no statistically significant differences in variability between the same fragment on different lanes. Suboptimal VBSs decreased the specificity with which related isolates were grouped together in dendrograms. The optimal VBS for analysis of PFGE fragment patterns from E. faecalis isolates differed from that for S. aureus isolates and sometimes was not that recommended by the manufacturer. Thus, computer-assisted analysis of PFGE patterns seemed to compensate for the intra- and intergel variation evaluated in the present study, and optimizing the software for the species to be tested was a critical preliminary step before further PFGE library analysis.

AB  
TI  - In vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against bacteria from hospitalised patients in the British Isles.
AB  - Piperacillin/tazobactam is used for empirical therapy of severe and complex infections. We assessed its activity, 9 years after launch, against consecutive, clinically significant isolates from in-patients in UK and Ireland. Standardised disc susceptibility tests were performed on 5031 isolates at 28 hospitals. For quality assurance purposes, 5% of these isolates were collected centrally for MIC tests, as were those with exceptional resistances. Compared with a similar pre-launch survey in 1991, there were major increases in the proportions of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-haemolytic streptococci and Enterococcus faecium isolates collected, balanced by decreases in Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and coagulase-negative staphylococci. These changes in species prevalence mostly favoured organisms with inherent resistance(s) or-in the case of S. aureus-reflected the massive increase of MRSA, up from 0.7% of all isolates in 1991 to 14.8% in 2001. Based on the disc tests, piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity against 87% of Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 95% of P. aeruginosa, 99% of streptococci and 96% of Enterococcus faecalis. Resistance nevertheless had increased since 1991 in E. coli from 4 to 10%, Klebsiella spp. (5 to 21%) and in AmpC-inducible Enterobacteriaceae (17 to 23%), though not in P. mirabilis or P. aeruginosa. MIC tests confirmed most of the piperacillin/tazobactam resistance found by disc tests in Enterobacter spp., but indicated susceptibility for about half of the E. coli isolates recorded as resistant in disc tests. This situation might be remedied by reducing the zone breakpoint, but this would increase the "false susceptible" rate unacceptably. Thus, if disc tests suggest that an isolate is marginally resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam and the drug is sought as therapy, it is recommended that MIC be determined with, e.g., an Etest.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2001 and March 2002].
AB  - Isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from April 2001 to March 2002 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, four hundred and twenty strains were isolated from 175 (79.2%) of 221 patients with surgical infections. One hundred and eighty-six strains were isolated from primary infections, and 234 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, although the isolation rate of Staphylococcus aureus was the highest, followed by that of Enterococcus faecalis from primary infections, the isolation rate of E. faecalis was the highest from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by Enterobacter spp., E. coli and Klebsiella spp. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the last several years. We noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - [Surveillance on gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients with hospital acquired infections or community acquired infections].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the drug-resistance rates of gram-positive cocci isolated from patients with hospital acquired infection (HAI) or community acquired infection (CAI) in 34 study wards of 13 hospitals located at different areas in China. METHODS: According to the previous protocol, from July 1(st) 2000 to June 30(th) 2001, a total of 2401 pathogenic strains were isolated from 13 hospitals. Among them, 805 strains of gram-positive cocci were collected for in vitro susceptibility test using international standard plate dilution method. According to the criteria of guidelines of NCCLS (2001), MIC(50) and MIC(90) were detected to represent the antibacterial activity of antimicrobial agents and R%, I%, and S%, were calculated to show the resistant, intermediate and susceptible rates of the bacteria to the compounds tested. RESULTS: The detectable rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) were 37.4% (89/238) and 33.8% (51/151) respectively. Among a total of 238 strains of S. aureus, 139 were isolated from patients with CAI and 37 were from HAI patients, the rate of MRSA from HAI patients (89.2%, 33/37) was significantly higher than that of MRSA from CAI patients (30.2%, 42/139) (P < 0.01). The total resistant rate of penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) was 26.7% (8/30), including a R% of 3.3% (1/30) and an I% of 23.3% (7/30). 331 strains of Enterococcus were isolated, including 178 strains from the study wards and 153 strains from other wards. The ratio of number of strains of E. faecalis to E. faecium was 6.8:1 (286/42). The rate of ampicillin resistant E. faecium (AREF) was 73.8% (31/42), significantly higher than the rate of ampicillin resistant E. faecalis (16.4%, 47/286). Neither strains of S. aureus nor strains of coagulase negative Staphylococcus were found resistant to vancomycin. No strains of Enterococcus were found resistant to vancomycin, the intermediate rates of E. faecalis and E. faecium to vancomycin were 3.5% (10/286) and 9.5% (4/42) respectively. All strains of Enterococcus were found 100% susceptible to teicoplanin. CONCLUSION: The resistance patterns of Gram-positive cocci including MRSA, PRSP, and AREF are similar to the results of the 1998 - 1999 surveillance. No strain of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, including VRSA and VISA or vancomycin resistant enterococcus, VRE is found in this study.
TI  - Long-lived C. elegans daf-2 mutants are resistant to bacterial pathogens.
AB  
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in animals.
AB  - There is currently no systematic surveillance or monitoring of antibiotic resistance in Australian animals. Registration of antibiotics for use in animals is tightly controlled and has been very conservative. Fluoroquinolones have not been registered for use in food producing animals and other products have been removed from the market because of human health concerns. In the late 1970s, the Animal Health Committee coordinated a survey of resistance in Salmonella and Escherichia coli isolates from cattle, pigs and poultry and in bovine Staphylococcus aureus. Some additional information is available from published case reports. In samples collected prior to the withdrawal of avoparcin from the market, no vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium or Enterococcus faecalis were detected in samples collected from pigs, whereas some vanA enterococci, including E. faecium and E. faecalis, were found in chickens. No vanB enterococci were detected in either species. Virginiamycin resistance was common in both pig and poultry isolates. Multiple resistance was common in E. coli and salmonellae isolates. No fluoroquinolone resistance was found in salmonellae, E. coli or Campylobacter. Beta-lactamase production is common in isolates from bovine mastitis, but no methicillin resistance has been detected. However, methicillin resistance has been reported in canine isolates of Staphylococcus intermedius and extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing E. coli has been found in dogs.
TI  - Multiplex PCR for simultaneous detection of enterococcal genes vanA and vanB and  staphylococcal genes mecA, ileS-2 and femB.
AB  - The experimental transfer of the vanA gene cluster from Enterococcus faecalis to  Staphylococcus aureus has raised fears about the occurrence of such genetic transfer in clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Recently, infections by a S. aureus strain carrying the enterococcal vancomycin resistance vanA gene cluster were reported. The possible emergence and dissemination of these strains is a serious health threat and makes optimization of prevention strategies and fast detection methods absolutely necessary. In the present study, we developed a PCR protocol for simultaneous detection of enterococcal vanA and vanB genes, the staphylococcal methicillin and mupirocin resistance markers mecA and ileS-2, and identification of S. aureus. As no vancomycin-resistant S. aureus isolates were available for our study, we used mixtures of enterococcal and staphylococcal colonies that harbored the different resistance markers to show that these genes could be detected simultaneously. This protocol could be used to facilitate the detection and identification of predictable S. aureus or methicillin-resistant strains carrying vanA or vanB.
TI  - Decontamination of seeds for seed sprout production by high hydrostatic pressure.
AB  - Garden cress, sesame, radish, and mustard seeds immersed in water were treated with high pressure (250, 300, 350, and 400 MPa) for 15 min at 20 degrees C. After treatment, percentages of seeds germinating on water agar were recorded for up to 11 days. Of the seeds tested, radish seeds were found to be the most pressure sensitive, with seeds treated at 250 MPa reaching 100% germination 9 days later than untreated control seeds did. Garden cress seeds, on the other hand, were the most pressure resistant, with seeds treated at 250 MPa reaching 100% germination 1 day later than untreated control seeds did. Garden cress sprouts from seeds treated at 250 and 300 MPa also took about 1 day longer to reach average sprout length than sprouts from untreated control seeds did, indicating that sprout growth was not retarded once germination had occurred. Garden cress seeds were inoculated with suspensions of seven different bacteria (10(7) CFU/ml) and processed with high pressure. Treatment at 300 MPa (15 min, 20 degrees C) resulted in 6-log reductions of Salmonella Typhimurium, Escherichia coli MG1655, and Listeria innocua, > 4-log reductions of Shigella flexneri and pressure-resistant E. coli LMM1010, and a 2-log reduction of Staphylococcus aureus. Enterococcus faecalis was virtually not inactivated. For suspensions of the gram-positive bacteria, similar levels of inactivation in water in the absence of garden cress seeds were found, but the inactivation of E. coil LMM1010 and S. flexneri in water in the absence of garden cress seeds was significantly less extensive. These data suggest that garden cress seeds contain a component that acts synergistically with high hydrostatic pressure against gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - The World Health Organization's External Quality Assurance System Proficiency Testing Program has improved the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility testing and reporting among participating laboratories using NCCLS methods.
AB  - A total of 150 laboratories in 33 countries that followed the NCCLS testing procedures participated in the World Health Organization's External Quality Assurance System for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EQAS-AST) from January 1998 through March 2001. Laboratories tested seven bacterial isolates for antimicrobial resistance and reported the results to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Ga. The results were compared to the results generated at the CDC with the NCCLS broth microdilution and disk diffusion reference methods. Although there were few testing errors with Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis, drugs that are not appropriate for therapy of Salmonella infections were tested and reported by 136 (91%) of 150 laboratories. In addition, 29 (20%) of 150 laboratories used the Staphylococcus aureus breakpoints to report oxacillin results for Staphylococcus saprophyticus. For a vanB-containing Enterococcus faecalis strain, 124 (83%) of 150 laboratories correctly reported vancomycin results that were +/-1 doubling dilution from the reference MIC or +/-3 mm from the reference disk diffusion result. Of the laboratories that tested Streptococcus agalactiae by disk diffusion, 17% reported nonsusceptible results for penicillin in error. While 110 laboratories (73%) tested the S. pneumoniae challenge isolate against a fluoroquinolone, 83% tested it against ciprofloxacin, for which there are no NCCLS interpretive criteria. Ten of 12 laboratories testing levofloxacin and 4 of 4 laboratories testing ofloxacin by an MIC method correctly reported resistant results for the isolate. Feedback letters sent to participating laboratories highlighted areas of susceptibility testing in individual laboratories that needed improvement. The positive impact of the feedback letters and the overall effectiveness of the EQAS program were documented in repeat testing challenges with pneumococci and staphylococci. The 31 and 19% increases in the numbers of laboratories using appropriate testing methods for pneumococci and staphylococci, respectively, in 2000 versus 1998 indicate that laboratory performance is improving.
TI  - Development of a thermally regulated broad-spectrum promoter system for use in pathogenic gram-positive species.
AB  - Selectively regulating gene expression is an essential molecular tool that is lacking for many pathogenic gram-positive bacteria. In this report, we describe the evaluation of a series of promoters regulated by the bacteriophage P1 temperature-sensitive C1 repressor in Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Using the lacZ gene to monitor gene expression, we examined the strength, basal expression, and induced expression of synthetic promoters carrying C1 operator sites. The promoters exhibited extremely low basal expression and, under inducing conditions, gave high levels of expression (100- to 1,000-fold induction). We demonstrate that the promoter system could be modulated by temperature and showed rapid induction and that the mechanism of regulation occurred at the level of transcription. Controlled expression with the same constructs was also demonstrated in the gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. However, low basal expression and the ability to achieve derepression were dependent on both the number of mismatches in the C1 operator sites and the promoter driving c1 expression. Since the promoters were designed to contain conserved promoter elements from gram-positive species and were constructed in a broad-host-range plasmid, this system will provide a new opportunity for controlled gene expression in a variety of gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of tetrodecamycin partial structures.
AB  - An efficient synthetic approach to the core structure 5 of the novel polyketide antibiotic tetrodecamycin (1) was developed. This approach features the acid-catalyzed cyclization of a tert-butyldimethylsilyl protected methyl alpha-(gamma-hydroxyacyl) tetronate, leading to the novel tricyclic ring skeleton exhibited by 5, and an efficient strategy for the parallel introduction of the cis-diol and exo-methylene function. In addition to 5, diastereomer 26, analogue 6 and several derivatives (16, 27-29) were prepared and evaluated for their antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) and Enterococcus faecalis and for their cytotoxic activities against human leukemia cell lines (HL-60, Jurkat T-cells). While compound 5 did not inhibit the growth of the Gram-positive pathogens (MICs >128 microg mL(-1)), analogue 6 and 2-naphthoyl derivative 27 showed promising antibacterial activities with MICs of 4-16 microg mL(-1). Remarkably, the antibacterial activity of these compounds was paralleled by cytotoxicity (IC(50) 10-23 microM). The reactive exo-methylene moiety was shown to be crucial, but not sufficient by its own, for both the antibacterial and the cytotoxic activities.
TI  - Screening of anti-bacterial activity of medicinal plants from Belize (Central America).
AB  - Twenty-one extracts from seven herbal drugs, Aristolochia trilobata (Aristolochiaceae) leaves and bark, Bursera simaruba (Burseraceae) bark, Guazuma ulmifolia (Sterculiaceae) bark, Hamelia patens (Rubiaceae) leaves and Syngonium podophyllum (Araceae) leaves and bark, used in traditional medicine of Belize (Central America) as deep and superficial wound healers, were evaluated for their anti-bacterial properties. Activity was tested against standard strains of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212. Almost all the extracts were able to inhibit the growth of one or more of the bacterial strains, except that of Enterococcus faecalis. For the first time an anti-microbial activity is reported for Aristolochia trilobata as well as for Syngonium podophyllum. The hexane extracts of Aristolochia trilobata leaves and bark were the most active extracts against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC=0.31 and 0.625mg/ml, respectively).
TI  - Multivalent drug design. Synthesis and in vitro analysis of an array of vancomycin dimers.
AB  - The design, synthesis, and in vitro microbiological analysis of an array of forty covalently linked vancomycin dimers are reported. This work was undertaken to systematically probe the impact of linkage orientation and linker length on biological activity against susceptible and drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens. To prepare the array, monomeric vancomycin synthons were linked through four distinct positions of the glycopeptide (C-terminus (C), N-terminus (N), vancosamine residue (V), and resorcinol ring (R)) in 10 unique pairwise combinations. Amphiphilic, peptide-based linkers of four different lengths (11, 19, 27, and 43 total atoms) were employed. Both linkage orientation and linker length were found to affect in vitro antibacterial potency. The V-V series displayed the greatest potency against vancomycin-susceptible organisms and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) of VanB phenotype, while the C-C, C-V, and V-R series displayed the most promising broad-spectrum activity that included VRE of VanA phenotype. Dimers bearing the shortest linkers were in all cases preferred for activity against VRE. The effects of linkage orientation and linker length on in vitro potency were not uniform; for example, (1) no single compound displayed activity that was superior against all test organisms to that of vancomycin or the other dimers, (2) linker length effects varied with test organism, and (3) whereas one-half of the dimers were more potent than vancomycin against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), only one dimer was more potent against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and glycopeptide-intermediate susceptible S. aureus (GISA). In interpreting the results, we have considered the potential roles of multivalency and of other phenomena.
TI  - Antimicrobial proficiency testing of National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance  System hospital laboratories.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) System personnel report trends in antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. To validate select antimicrobial susceptibility testing results and to identify test methods that tend to produce errors, we conducted proficiency testing among NNIS System hospital laboratories. SETTING: NNIS System hospital laboratories in the United States. METHODS: Each laboratory received five organisms (ie, an imipenem-resistant Serratia marcescens, an oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, a vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus epidermidis, and an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESbetaL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae). Testing results were compared with reference testing results from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RESULTS: Of 138 laboratories testing imipenem against the Serratia marcescens strain, 110 (80%) correctly reported minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) or zone sizes in the resistant range. All 193 participating laboratories correctly reported the Staphylococcus aureus strain as oxacillin resistant Of the 193 laboratories, 169 (88%) reported correct MICs or zone sizes for the vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. One hundred sixty-two (84%) of 193 laboratories demonstrated the ability to detect a vancomycin-intermediate strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis, however, disk diffusion performed poorly when testing both staphylococci and enterococci with vancomycin. Although laboratory personnel correctly reported nonsusceptible extended-spectrum cephalosporins and aztreonam results for K. pneumoniae, only 98 (51%) of 193 correctly reported this organism as an ESbetaL producer. CONCLUSION: Overall, NNIS System hospital laboratory personnel detected most emerging resistance patterns. Disk diffusion continues to be unreliable for vancomycin testing of staphylococci and must be used cautiously for enterococci. Further education on the processing of ESbetaL-producing organisms is warranted.
TI  - Synthesis, antibacterial and antifungal activities of electron-rich olefins derived benzimidazole compounds.
AB  - New benzimidazole derivatives were synthesised by electron-rich olefines (7, 8 and 9) with appropriate reagents. The compounds synthesised were identified by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, FT-IR spectroscopic techniques and elemental analysis. All compounds studied in this work were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard strains: Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and the yeasts Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis. Eleven of the compounds inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria (E. faecalis and S. aureus) at MIC values between 50 and 400 microg/ml. None of the compounds exhibit antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli and P. Aeruginosa) at the concentrations studied (6.25-800 microg/ml). Nine of the tested compounds showed an antifungal activity with a range of the MICs between 50 and 400 microg/ml.
TI  - In vitro activities of linezolid combined with other antimicrobial agents against Staphylococci, Enterococci, Pneumococci, and selected gram-negative organisms.
AB  - The activities of linezolid, an oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against  gram-positive organisms, alone and in combination with 35 antimicrobial agents were tested in vitro against methicillin-sensitive (n = 1 to 2 strains) and methicillin-resistant (n = 8 to 10) Staphylococcus aureus strains; vancomycin-sensitive (n = 6) and vancomycin-resistant (n = 6 to 8) Enterococcus faecalis strains; vancomycin-sensitive (n = 5) and vancomycin-resistant (n = 6) Enterococcus faecium strains; penicillin-sensitive (n = 2 to 5), penicillin-intermediate (n = 5 to 6), and penicillin-resistant (n = 5 to 6) Streptococcus pneumoniae strains; Escherichia coli (n = 6); and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 6). The fractional inhibitory concentration indices of linezolid in combination with other antimicrobial agents for the organisms tested were generated on checkerboard broth microdilution plates prepared by a semiautomated method. Of 1,380 organism-drug combinations, 1,369 (99.2%) combinations of linezolid with 28 antimicrobial drugs were indifferent, 9 combinations (0.65%) of linezolid with 6 drugs (amoxicillin, erythromycin, imipenem, sparfloxacin, teicoplanin, and tetracycline) were synergistic, and 2 combinations (0.15%) of linezolid with 2 drugs (ofloxacin and sparfloxacin) were antagonistic. Overall, the in vitro data demonstrated that linezolid combined with other antimicrobial agents primarily produces an indifferent response, with infrequent occurrences of synergism and antagonism.
TI  - Comparative studies on the activity of basil--an essential oil from Ocimum basilicum L.--against multidrug resistant clinical isolates of the genera Staphylococcus, Enterococcus and Pseudomonas by using different test methods.
AB  - The essential oil basil is obtained from the aerial parts of Ocimum basilicum L.  After gas chromatographic separation, the following components were identified: linalol (54.95%), methylchavikol (11.98%), methylcinnamat (7.24%) and linolen (0.14%). The activity of basil against multidrug resistant clinical isolates from the genera Staphylococcus, Enterococcus and Pseudomonas has been studied. For this purpose, standard and modified broth macrodilution methods were used and time kill kinetic of basil was studied. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were reported between 0.0030% and 0.0007% (v/v). These concentrations were compared with the inhibitory concentrations (ICs) and the logs of the bacterial counts reduction both obtained by basil diluted in 1% Tween (Tw) 80, saline test solution (STS) and spiritus vini (Sv) 95 degrees instead in a broth. The data, obtained after application of different methods of investigation and validated with membrane filtration, showed a strong inhibitory effect of basil on the test bacteria. The chosen bacteria are widespread and pose serious therapeutic difficulties because of their high level of resistance. For this reason, the results obtained were considered encouraging.
TI  - Comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent North American clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the US and Canada between 1997 and 1999. Based upon Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many Gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. Against Enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general, displayed weak activity with only Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of Gram-negative non-Enterobacteriaceae including Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.
TI  - [Analysis of bacteriological tests of children with decreased serum immunoglobulin IgA levels].
AB  - Results of 142 children with decreased serum immunoglobulin IgA compared with the reference values for age, and 73 reached normal age levels for serum immunoglobulin (control group), up 6 months to 14 years of age with various clinical symptoms, admitted to hospital between 1999-2000, were analysed. The patients were divided into three groups: group I--children with decreased serum immunoglobulin IgA levels (86 patients), group II--children with hypogammaglobulinaemia IgA and IgG compared with the reference values for age (56 patients), group III--children reaching normal levels of serum immunoglobulin for age (73 patients)--control group. Staphylococcus aureus was found most frequently among pathogenic strains in groups I and II in comparison to the control group. In urine, Enterococcus faecalis strains were observed more often in the first and in the second group than in the control group. All patients in our three groups showed high per cent of Candida albicans in biological material from the pharynx and faeces. We associated this with treatment of recurrent infections in children, using many antibiotics. In conclusion, our results have demonstrated that low serum IgA and IgG concentrations in children are favourable for colonisation with pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - Indole naphthyridinones as inhibitors of bacterial enoyl-ACP reductases FabI and  FabK.
AB  - Bacterial enoyl-ACP reductase (FabI) is responsible for catalyzing the final step of bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis and is an attractive target for the development of novel antibacterial agents. Previously we reported the development of FabI inhibitor 4 with narrow spectrum antimicrobial activity and in vivo efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus via intraperitoneal (ip) administration. Through iterative medicinal chemistry aided by X-ray crystal structure analysis, a new series of inhibitors has been developed with greatly increased potency against FabI-containing organisms. Several of these new inhibitors have potent antibacterial activity against multidrug resistant strains of S. aureus, and compound 30 demonstrates exceptional oral (po) in vivo efficacy in a S. aureus infection model in rats. While optimizing FabI inhibitory activity, compounds 29 and 30 were identified as having low micromolar FabK inhibitory activity, thereby increasing the antimicrobial spectrum of these compounds to include the FabK-containing pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. The results described herein support the hypothesis that bacterial enoyl-ACP reductases are valid targets for antibacterial agents.
TI  - Comparison of waterless hand antisepsis agents at short application times: raising the flag of concern.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although alcohol-based hand rinses and gels have recommended application times of 30 to 60 seconds, healthcare workers usually take much less time for hand hygiene. We compared the efficacies of four alcohol-based hand rubs produced in Europe (hand rinses A, B, and C and one gel formulation) with the efficacy of the European Norm 1500 (EN 1500) reference waterless hand antisepsis agent (60% 2-propanol) at short application times. DESIGN: Comparative crossover study. SETTING: Infection Control Program laboratory of a large tertiary-care teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Twelve healthy volunteers. INTERVENTION: Measurement of residual bacterial counts and log reduction factors following inoculation of fingertips with Staphylococcus aurens American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 6538, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442, and a clinical isolate of Enterococcus faecalis. RESULTS: All hand rinses satisfied EN 1500 standards following a single application for 15 and 30 seconds, but reduction factors for the gel formulation were significantly lower for all tested organisms (all P < .025). CONCLUSIONS: Under stringent conditions similar to clinical practice, all three hand rinses proved to be more efficacious than the marketed alcohol-based gel in reducing bacterial counts on hands. Further studies are necessary to determine the in vivo efficacy of alcohol-based gels and whether they are as efficacious as alcohol-based rinses in reducing the transmission of nosocomial infections.
TI  - Conformational restriction of methionyl tRNA synthetase inhibitors leading to analogues with potent inhibition and excellent gram-positive antibacterial activity.
AB  - Conformationally restricted analogues of the central linker unit of bacterial methionyl tRNA synthetase (MRS) inhibitors have been prepared. The (1S,2R)-cyclopentylmethyl moiety was identified as the preferred cyclic linker, with significant diastereo- and enantioselectivity of activity. Combination of this linker with an optimal substituted aryl right-hand side has resulted in a compound with exceptionally good antibacterial activity against staphylococci and enterococci, including antibiotic resistant strains.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of 2% sodium hypochlorite and 2% chlorhexidine tested by different methods.
AB  - The objective of this study was to analyze the antimicrobial effect of 2% sodium  hypochlorite (NaOCl) and 2% chlorhexidine (CHX) by agar diffusion test and by direct exposure test. Five microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aernginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, and one mixture of these were used. These strains were inoculated in brain heart infusion (BHI) and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. For the agar diffusion test (ADT), 18 Petri plates with 20 ml of BHI agar were inoculated with 0.1 ml of the microbial suspensions, using sterile swabs that were spread on the medium, obtaining growth injunction. Fifty-four paper disks (9 mm in diameter) were immersed in the experimental solutions for 1 min. Subsequently, three papers disks containing one of the substances were placed on the BHI agar surface in each agar plate. The plates were maintained for 1 h at room temperature, and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h. The diameter of microbial inhibition was measured around the papers disks containing the substances. For the direct exposure test, 162#50 sterile absorbent paper points were immersed in the experimental suspensions for 5 min, and were then placed on Petri plates and covered with one of the irrigant solutions, or with sterile distilled water (control group). After intervals of 5, 1 0 and 30 min, the paper points were removed from contact with the solutions and individually immersed in 7 ml of Letheen Broth, followed by incubation at 37 degrees C for 48 h. Microbial growth was evaluated by turbidity of the culture medium. A 0.1 ml inoculum obtained from the Letheen Broth was transferred to 7 ml of BHI, and incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h. Bacterial growth was again evaluated by turbidity of the culture medium. Gram stain of BHI cultures was used for verification of contamination and growth was determined by macroscopic and microscopic examination. The best performance of antimicrobial effectiveness of NaOCI was observed in the direct exposure test, and of CHX was observed in the agar diffusion test. The magnitude of antimicrobial effect was influenced by the experimental methods, biological indicators and exposure time.
TI  - The significance of sunlight for the elimination of indicator bacteria in small-scale bathing ponds in central Europe.
AB  - In order to determine the impact of sunlight on the reduction rate of indicator bacteria, bathing waters of different turbidity were artificially contaminated with indicator bacteria and exposed to sunlight. The reduction rates determined for the indicator bacteria showed a significant correlation with radiation intensity and, thus, also the time of day as well as the turbidity of the water. Under conditions of strong radiation intensity and low water turbidity (< 5 FTU), indicator bacteria were eliminated within 1-2 h of contamination with an initial concentration of 10(5) CFU/mL. Moreover, differences between different indicator bacteria were found. Enterococcus faecalis proved to be significantly more resistant to sunlight than the other indicator bacteria tested (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus). The results of the present study, namely the complete elimination of indicator bacteria within a few hours, showed that sunlight, given an appropriate intensity and good water transparency, was the most important factor in the reduction of hygienically-relevant microorganisms in surface waters and, thus, also in small-scale bathing ponds.
TI  - Meconium enhances the growth of perinatal bacterial pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the effects of meconium on growth of bacterial pathogens, which are common causes of intra-amniotic infection and neonatal sepsis. METHODS: Meconium collected from 9 healthy neonates was suspended as a 20% solution using sterile saline. In experiment 1, separate test tubes of meconium solution and sterile saline (the control) were individually inoculated with 10(6) colony-forming units of a single species of the following test pathogens: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Group B Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Listeria monocytogenes. After incubation at 37 degree C for 24 hours, 1 L each of the bacterial-meconium and bacterial-saline solutions was inoculated onto 5% sheep blood agar. After 24 hours of incubation, the number of developing colonies was counted. In experiment 2, equal volumes of meconium and saline solutions were inoculated with 10(5) colony-forming units of either E. coli or Group B Streptococcus. At intervals of 6, 9, and 24 hours post-incubation, 1 L each of the bacterial-meconium and bacterial-saline solutions was inoculated onto 5% sheep blood agar plates, and colonies were counted after overnight incubation. RESULTS: In the first experiment, 24 hours of incubation resulted in bacterial amplification in the meconium solution from an initial inoculum of 10(6) colony-forming units/mL to 10(9) colony-forming units/mL. In contrast, the same inoculation of saline solution (control) showed no increase in colony counts over the same time interval. For E. coli and Group B Streptococcus in experiment 2, growth enhancement in meconium was seen as early as 6 hours, as colony counts of a test species increased from 105 colony-forming units/mL to 10(9)-10(10) colony-forming units/mL. CONCLUSION: Enhanced growth of perinatal pathogens in meconium was constantly observed, and can occur as early as 6 hours after bacterial interaction of meconium.
TI  - [In vitro transfer of the aac(6')-aph(2") gene that confers aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance from Staphylococcus aureus to Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus avium].
AB  - In nine strains of Enterococcus, frequency of resistance gene transfer from MRSA  caring gene acc(6')-aph(2") was investigated. Transfer was inducted in broth at 44 degrees C for 24 h. Presence of acc(6')-aph(2") gene was confirmed by PCR method. Frequency of gene transfer was the highest for strains Enterococcus faecalis isolated from humans (0.13), significant lower for Enterococcus avium (0.007) and the lowest for strains of Enterococcus faecalis isolated from animals (0.004).
TI  - Clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecium exhibit strain-specific collagen binding mediated by Acm, a new member of the MSCRAMM family.
AB  - A collagen-binding adhesin of Enterococcus faecium, Acm, was identified. Acm shows 62% similarity to the Staphylococcus aureus collagen adhesin Cna over the entire protein and is more similar to Cna (60% and 75% similarity with Cna A and B domains respectively) than to the Enterococcus faecalis collagen-binding adhesin, Ace, which shares homology with Acm only in the A domain. Despite the detection of acm in 32 out of 32 E. faecium isolates, only 11 of these (all clinical isolates, including four vancomycin-resistant endocarditis isolates and seven other isolates) exhibited binding to collagen type I (CI). Although acm from three CI-binding vancomycin-resistant E. faecium clinical isolates showed 100% identity, analysis of acm genes and their promoter regions from six non-CI-binding strains identified deletions or mutations that introduced stop codons and/or IS elements within the gene or the promoter region in five out of six strains, suggesting that the presence of an intact functional acm gene is necessary for binding of E. faecium strains to CI. Recombinant Acm A domain showed specific and concentration-dependent binding to collagen, and this protein competed with E. faecium binding to immobilized CI. Consistent with the adherence phenotype and sequence data, probing with Acm-specific IgGs purified from anti-recombinant Acm A polyclonal rabbit serum confirmed the surface expression of Acm in three out of three collagen-binding clinical isolates of E. faecium tested, but in none of the strains with a non-functional pseudo acm gene. Introduction of a functional acm gene into two non-CI-binding natural acm mutant strains conferred a CI-binding phenotype, further confirming that native Acm is sufficient for the binding of E. faecium to CI. These results demonstrate that acm, which encodes a potential virulence factor, is functional only in certain infection-derived clinical isolates of E. faecium, and suggest that Acm is the primary adhesin responsible for the ability of E. faecium to bind collagen.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of prulifloxacin, a new oral fluoroquinolone].
AB  - We compared antibacterial activity of NM394, which is the active metabolite of a  prodrug of new fluoroquinolone prulifloxacin (PUFX), against clinical isolates of bacteria with those of ciprofloxacin (CPFX), levofloxacin (LVFX), gatifloxacin (GFLX), tosufloxacin (TFLX) and fleroxacin (FLRX). 1. NM394 showed a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. 2. MIC80 of NM394 for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis were 0.5 microgram/ml, 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. MIC80 of NM394 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae was lower than 0.06 microgram/ml. MIC80 of NM394 for Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0.25 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. Short-time bactericidal activity of NM394 against P. aeruginosa was stronger than those of CPFX, GFLX, LVFX and TFLX. 4. Short-time bactericidal activity of NM394 at Cmax concentration against 12 strains of P. aeruginosa was stronger than those of CPFX, LVFX, GFLX and TFLX.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2000 and March 2001].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibilities during the period from April 2000 to March 2001 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 234 for one year. A total of 388 strains (136 strains from primary infections and 252 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 165 cases (70.5% of total cases). In primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by that of Staphylococcus aureus from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella spp. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. There was no vancomycin-resistant S. aureus nor Enterococcus spp. Among anaerobic bacteria, there were many resistant strains against penicillins and cephems with MICs higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and the same trend was observed among other Bacteroides spp. and Prevotella spp.
TI  - The genes coding for enterocin EJ97 production by Enterococcus faecalis EJ97 are  located on a conjugative plasmid.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis EJ97 produces a cationic bacteriocin (enterocin EJ97) of low molecular mass (5,327.7 Da). The complete amino acid sequence of enterocin EJ97 was elucidated after automated microsequencing of oligopeptides generated by endoproteinase GluC digestion and cyanogen bromide treatment. Transfer of the 60-kb conjugative plasmid pEJ97 from the bacteriocinogenic strain E. faecalis EJ97 to E. faecalis OG1X conferred bacteriocin production and resistance on the recipient. The genetic determinants of enterocin EJ97 were located in an 11.3-kb EcoRI-BglII DNA fragment of pEJ97. This region was cloned and sequenced. It contains the ej97A structural gene plus three open reading frames (ORFs) (ej97B, ej97C, and ej97D) and three putative ORFs transcribed in the opposite direction (orfA, orfB, and orfC). The gene ej97A translated as a 44-amino-acid residue mature protein lacking a leader peptide with no homology to other bacteriocins described so far. The product of ej97B (Ej97B) shows strong homology in its C-terminal domain to the superfamily of bacterial ATP-binding cassette transporters. The products of ej97C (Ej97C) and ej97D (Ej97D) could be proteins with 71 and 64 residues, respectively, of unknown functions and with no significant similarity to known proteins. There are two additional ORFs (ORF1 and ORF6) flanking the ej97 module, which have been identified as a transposon-like structure (tnp). ORF1 shows similarities to transposase of the Lactococcus lactis element ISS1 and is up to 50% identical to IS1216. This is flanked by two 18-bp inverted repeats (IRs) that are almost identical to those of ISS1 and IS1216. ORF6 (resEJ97) shows strong homology to the resolvase of plasmid pAM373 and up to 40 to 50% homology with the recombinase of several multiresistant plasmids and transposons from Staphylococcus aureus and E. faecalis. These data suggest that EJ97 could represent a new class of bacteriocins with a novel secretion mechanism and that the whole structure could be a composite transposon. Furthermore, two additional gene clusters were found: one cluster is probably related to the region responsible for the replication of plasmid pEJ97, and the second cluster is related to the sex pheromone response. These regions showed a high homology to the corresponding regions of the conjugative plasmids pAM373, pPD1, and pAD1 of E. faecalis, suggesting that they have a common origin.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase productivity of recent clinical  isolates during the period between December 1999 and February 2000].
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility testings of 24 antimicrobial agents against 605 clinical strains belonging to 10 species were carried out according to the micro-broth dilution method of NCCLS M7-A4. The productivity of beta-lactamase was also determined against them isolated at 8 medical facilities in Nagano prefecture, Japan during the period between December 1999 and February 2000. When applied the nitrocefin method, beta-lactamase productivity was demonstrated to be positive for 89.2% of 74 S. aureus, 4.3% of 94 H. influenzae, and 100% of 69 M. (B.) catarrhalis isolates. On the other hand, when used the acidometry method, penicillinase/cephalosporinase were found to be positive for 21.2%/9.6% of 52 E. coli, 29.0%/3.2% of 31 K. pneumoniae, 53.2%/100% of 47 E. cloacae, 0%/11.1% of 99 S. marcescens, and 25.9%/55.6% of 54 P. aeruginosa isolates, respectively. Among the beta-lactamase-producers including P. aeruginosa isolates, only 2 E. coli isolates were found to be ESBL-producers. Besides, 9.6% (9/94) of H. influenzae isolates were proved to be BLNAR strains.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and prevalence of beta-lactamase producing clinical isolates in southern Kyushu. The results of collaborative study from 1999 to 2000].
AB  - The positivity of beta-lactamase and antimicrobial susceptibility were determined in a total of 1,358 clinical isolates at 15 hospitals and clinics in four prefectures in southern Kyushu (Okinawa, Miyazaki, Kagoshima and Kumamoto) during the period from December 1999 to February 2000. The isolates collected comprised of 176 strains of S. aureus, 203 of H. influenzae, 102 of M. catarrhalis, 206 of E. coli, 153 of K. pneumoniae, 99 of E. cloacae, 95 of S. marcescens, 201 of P. aeruginosa, 79 of E. faecalis, and 44 of E. faecium. The frequency of CPDX resistance among E. coli in particular varied geographically, and was found to be higher in Kumamoto and Kagoshima. The strains of K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae resistant to common antimicrobial agents were particularly found in Kagoshima, and one strain of IPM-resistant E. cloacae was isolated in Miyazaki. Also, the geographical difference in the frequency of LVFX resistance among the isolates of E. cloacae was noted, the results indicating the higher prevalence in Okinawa and Kagoshima. Resistant isolates of P. aeruginosa were less common in Kagoshima, and four isolates of P. aeruginosa from Miyazaki were found to be resistant to CAZ and IPM. None of the isolates of S. aureus and Enterococcus spp. was resistant to VCM or TEIC at all. The isolates of E. faecalis resistant at high-level GM (500 micrograms/ml) and SM (1,000 micrograms/ml) were found in 27.8% and 22.8%, and those of E. faecium were 6.8% and 38.6%, respectively. Overall, the ratio of MRSA among S. aureus was 67.6%, and three isolates were resistant to ABK with no less than 8 micrograms/ml of MIC. The frequency of BLNAR (beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin resistant) among H. influenzae isolated in Okinawa was markedly higher (isolation ratio, 37.9%) when compared with other prefectures, and the isolates of BLPACR (beta-lactamase-positive, AMPC/CVA resistant) were found only in Okinawa with a ratio of 41.6%. A total of 18 strains of ESBL defined by the NCCLS criteria (M100-S11) were isolated, eight strains of K. pneumoniae and 10 strains of E. coli. Of 18 isolates of ESBL, 13 were from Kagoshima and the remaining five were from Kumamoto.
TI  - [Beta-lactamase activity and susceptibilities to antibiotics among some species of bacteria isolated from medical institution between December 1999 and February 2000].
AB  - We studied the beta-lactamase activity and susceptibilities to antibiotics in 604 strains among 10 species of bacteria isolated from 10 medical institutions in Tottori and Shimane Prefectures between December 1999 and February 2000. beta-Lactamase activity was measured by the nitrocefin test and penicillinase/cephalosporinase activities were measured by acidometry. beta-Lactamase activity was detected in 72.1% of S. aureus, 18.8% of H. influenzae, and 96.3% of M. catarrhalis. Penicillinase/cephalosporinase activities were detected in 17.8%/22.2% of E. coli, 9.7%/0.0% of K. pneumoniae, 18.6%/95.3% of E. cloacae, 12.7%/79.4% of S. marcescens, and 7.1%/31.8% of P. aeruginosa. Three of 72 strains (4.2%) of K. pneumoniae and 5 of 90 strains (5.6%) of E. coli were assessed as ESBL-producing bacteria using the NCCLS proposed screening method based on routine susceptibility testing results. BLNAR were detected in 13 of 69 strains (18.8%) of H. influenzae.
TI  - [Identification and classification of beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of bacteria].
AB  - Emergence of bacterial resistance has rendered ineffective a number of previously valuable antibiotic treatments and now threatens the effectiveness of others. beta-Lactam resistance is no longer predominantly a hospital-treated problem; it has now become an important issue in community medicine. More than 100-beta-lactamases have been identified and classified according to their structure, substrate specificity, and whether they are chromosomal or plasmid-mediated. beta-Lactamase production is rare among Gram-positive pathogens, important exceptions being Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. By contrast, many Gram-negative pathogens are beta-lactamase-positive; inducible and/or hyper-productive strains are particularly challenging in the clinical setting. Surveillance programs have shown that, in general, beta-lactam resistance is on the increase, and that the plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase have developed rapidly over past decade such as ESBLs and carbapenemases.
TI  - [beta-lactamase-producing activity and antimicrobial susceptibility of major pathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples. Japan beta-lactamase Research Group].
AB  - beta-Lactamase production and susceptibility to an assortment of antimicrobial agents were examined in 9,483 strains of organisms isolated from clinical materials obtained from inpatients and outpatients at 104 institutions throughout Japan from December 1999 to February 2000. The organisms were Staphylococcus aureus, 1,369 strains, including 847 methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strains; Enterococcus faecalis, 735 strains; Enterococcus faecium, 302 strains; Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, 730 strains; Haemophilus influenzae, 1,142 strains; Escherichia coli, 1,276 strains; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1,058 strains; Enterobacter cloacae, 772 strains; Serratia marcescens, 847 strains; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1,252 strains. The 23 antimicrobial agents used were ampicillin, sulbactam/ampicillin, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin, oxacillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotiam, cefmetazole, cefoperazone, sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpodoxime, imipenem, gentamicin, arbekacin, clarithromycin, minocycline, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and levofloxacin. Antimicrobial agents appropriate for each organism were used. Among S. aureus strains, 61.9% were MRSA, and 62.3% were positive for beta-lactamase. Among the MRSA strains, none was resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin, and only 3% were resistant to arbekacin. There was no vancomycin resistance in the Enterococcus strains. Only 0.1% of E. faecalis strains were ampicillin-resistant. Among the M. catarrhalis strains, 97.5% produced beta-lactamase, while among the H. influenzae strains, 8.5% produced beta-lactamase and 14.5% were beta-lactamase-negative and ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR). Among the Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa strains, there were 20 (E. coli; 7/1,276, K. pneumoniae; 13/1,058) that produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), and 11 that produced class B beta-lactamases. Multiple drug resistance was advanced in every species, and organisms resistant to 7 or more common antimicrobial agents were isolated. The best combination of antimicrobial agent and beta-lactamase inhibitor was sulbactam/cefoperazone. Sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefepime, and imipenem still have excellent antimicrobial activity. Rates of resistance to each antimicrobial agent differed more among institutions than among geographical regions.
TI  - Overview of resistant gram-positive pathogens in the surgical patient.
AB  - Staphylococci and enterococci are the most common pathogens in surgical-site and  bloodstream infections. The emergence of drug resistance among these gram-positive bacteria thus poses a substantial threat to patients with surgical infections. Resistance to methicillin/oxacillin is frequently observed in Staphylococcus aureus isolates and is often accompanied by multidrug resistance. Vancomycin is usually the treatment of choice for infections caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), so the recent appearance of S. aureus isolated with intermediate sensitivity to vancomycin is cause for concern. Vancomycin resistance has already appeared in most species of enterococci. Infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are associated with increased mortality compared to infections caused by vancomycin-sensitive isolates. Measures for preventing vancomycin resistance include reducing the use of vancomycin and other agents that appear to be associated with VRE, including third-generation cephalosporins and anti-anaerobic drugs. Third-generation cephalosporins have also been implicated in the increased prevalence of MRSA infections. Prudent use of existing antibiotics is an essential strategy for combating the rising tide of drug-resistant gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Vaginal bacterial flora activates rat peritoneal mast cells.
AB  - Sixteen strains of physiological and pathological vaginal bacteria were tested for their ability to secrete histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. We noticed that Mycoplasma hominis-induced histamine release was very high (up to 53.6%). The stimulation of rat mast cells with Staphylococccus cohnii, Staphylococcus coagulase(-) (two strains), Ureaplasma urealyticum, Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides capillosus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae resulted in lower but significant histamine secretion (11.2%-17.5%). Other bacteria strains (Staphylococcus epidermidids, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Actinomyces naeslundii (two strains) and Lactobacillus fermentum (two strains) caused very low (4.2% - 8.8%) histamine release.
TI  - Determination of disk diffusion and MIC quality control parameters for AZD2563, a novel long-acting oxazolidinone.
AB  - AZD2563 is a new, long-acting oxazolidinone that possesses potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive organisms. This report summarizes the results of broth microdilution MIC and disk diffusion quality control (QC) investigations for AZD2563. All tests or methods (M2-A7 and M7-A5) and QC study designs (M23-A2) were those published by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. QC strains tested against AZD2563 included: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619. In the eight-center QC trial, 320 and 480 results were generated for MIC and disk diffusion tests, respectively. The selected 7-mm ranges for the two disk diffusion QC organisms contained > or = 98.5% of reported results. Proposed 3 or 4 log(2) dilution MIC ranges contained all reported participant results. AZD2563 disk diffusion zone diameters were generally 2-3 mm smaller than the corresponding linezolid zone diameters. In conclusion, QC ranges for AZD2563 MIC and disk diffusion methods were established and appear acceptable in preparation for the clinical trials use.
TI  - Prospective study using standardized methodology for antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive cocci isolated from the Puerto Rico Medical Center.
AB  - The Gram-positive cocci (GPC), Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, have become important causes of community and nosocomial-acquired infections. The prevalence of multiple resistant isolates to standard antimicrobial drugs has significantly increased over the past decades. Few prospective studies have been performed in Puerto Rico (PR) concerning the GPC antimicrobial susceptibilities pattern. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro susceptibility of GPC clinical isolates from PR to selected standard antibiotics and to the new antimicrobial agents, linezolid (LZ), quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D) and gemifloxacin (GM). The in vitro susceptibility utilizing disk diffusion and Etest methods to selected antibiotics was determined for a total of 429 isolates obtained during a period of 5 months from the Puerto Rico Medical Center Bacteriology Laboratory. The distribution of GPC collected was as follows: 213 S. aureus isolates, 162 E. faecalis, 16 E. faecium and 38 S. pneumoniae. The results of the susceptibility test demonstrated: 1) that in S. aureus, 100% of the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin (VAN), LZ and Q/D; 93% to GM; and 61% to methicillin/oxacillin; 2) in S. pneumoniae, 100% were susceptible to LN and GM; 87% to Q/D; and 53% to penicillin; 3) in E. faecalis, 99% were susceptible to ampicillin; 93% to LZ; 79% to GM; 78.6% to VAN; and 0% to Q/D. Sixty eight and 66% of the E. faecalis isolates were susceptible to gentamicin and streptomycin respectively; and 4) in E. faecium, 100% were susceptible to LZ; 94% to Q/D; 69% to GM; 37.5% to VAN and 20% to ampicillin. In E. faecium isolates, 50% and 31% were susceptible to gentamicin and streptomycin, respectively. Of the vancomycin resistant enterococci, 88.9% and 21% of E. faecium and faecalis showed VanA phenotypic resistance, respectively. These results show that there is a significant degree of antimicrobial resistance in GPC, including 38% methicillin resistance in S. aureus, a near 50% penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, and a significant resistance of enterococcal species to VAN. The new agents, LZ, Q/D and GM, proved to be effective against both, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae. For E. faecium, both, LZ and Q/D were active, while for E. faecalis, only LZ showed consistent activity.
TI  - Multicentre evaluation of the in vitro activity of linezolid in the Western Pacific.
AB  - Multiresistance to antimicrobial agents is common in staphylococci and pneumococci isolates in the Western Pacific region. The activity of linezolid, a new oxazolidinone, was evaluated against a spectrum of Gram-positive species collected in the region. Eighteen laboratories from six countries in the Western Pacific examined the linezolid susceptibility of 2143 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and Enterococcus spp. using broth microdilution or disc diffusion methodology. For Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 351) and other streptococci (n = 83), Etest (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) strips were used. Results were compared with other common and important antimicrobials. Linezolid-resistant strains were not detected among streptococci or staphylococci, including a significant proportion of S. aureus strains that were multiresistant. Almost all enterococci, including 14 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, were linezolid susceptible. A small proportion of enterococci (0.8%) were intermediate to linezolid, and one strain of Enterococcus faecalis had a zone diameter of 20 mm (resistant). The linezolid MIC ranges (MIC(90)) of those strains tested by broth microdilution or Etest were: 1-4 mg/L (2 mg/L) for S. aureus, 0.5-4 mg/L (2 mg/L) for CoNS, 0.5-4 mg/L (2 mg/L) for Enterococcus spp., 0.12-2 mg/L (1 mg/L) for S. pneumoniae and 0.25-2 mg/L (1 mg/L) for Streptococcus spp. There was no difference in linezolid susceptibility between countries or between multiresistant and susceptible strains of each species monitored.
TI  - MC21-A, a bactericidal antibiotic produced by a new marine bacterium, Pseudoalteromonas phenolica sp. nov. O-BC30(T), against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - We previously reported a new marine bacterium, Pseudoalteromonas phenolica sp. nov. O-BC30(T), which produced a bactericidal antibiotic against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In the present study, we purified an anti-MRSA substance (MC21-A) from the methanol extract of the cells of P. phenolica O-BC30(T) and analyzed its chemical structure. MC21-A was determined to be 3,3',5,5'-tetrabromo-2,2'-biphenyldiol by spectrometric analyses. Its anti-MRSA activity against 10 clinical isolates of MRSA was comparable to that of vancomycin (MC21-A MICs, 1 to 2 micro g/ml; vancomycin MICs, <0.25 to 2 micro g/ml). This substance was also high active against Enterococcus serolicida, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus faecalis but was less active against Streptococcus spp. A time-kill study also demonstrated that MC21-A was bactericidal and that its killing rate was much higher than that of vancomycin. The postantibiotic effect (PAE) of MC21-A against a clinical MRSA isolate, strain E 31243, was also comparable to that of vancomycin (MC21-A PAEs, 1.46 to 1.65 h; vancomycin PAEs, 0.84 to 1.43 h). However, a lysis experiment demonstrated that this substance failed to lyse MRSA cells. This substance also did not lyse human erythrocytes. A SYTOX Green staining experiment implied that this substance permeabilized the cell membrane of MRSA as its mode of action. When its activities against a hypersensitive Escherichia coli mutant (KO 1489) and wild-type strains were tested, MC21-A exhibited higher levels of activity against the former. Furthermore, MC21-A was not cytotoxic to human normal fibroblast, rat pheochromocytoma, and Vero cells at concentrations up to 50 micro g/ml. These results suggest that MC21-A might be useful as a lead compound in the development of new types of anti-MRSA substances with modes of action different from those of vancomycin and teicoplanin.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities on antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2000). III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - The bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 institutions in Japan were supplied between August 2000 and July 2001. Then, the susceptibilities of these bacteria to various antimicrobial agents were examined, and the results were compared with those obtained between 1992 and 1999. Comparison was made by classifying strains isolated from patients into those in uncomplicated UTIs and those in complicated UTIs (including with or without indwelling catheter). E. faecalis showed good susceptibility to ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM), and the MIC90s were 2 micrograms/ml. Also, E. faecalis showed good susceptibility to vancomycin (VCM). However, the MIC90, which was 2 micrograms/ml between 1992 and 1999, rose to 4 micrograms/ml in patients with complicated UTIs because the strains inhibited at 4 micrograms/ml increased more than before. The low susceptibility of S. aureus to arbekacin (ABK) in complicated UTIs, as shown in 1998 and 1999, recovered in 2000, and no strains inhibited at > or = 4 micrograms/ml were detected. E. coli showed good susceptibility to CTM (MIC90: 0.25-0.5 microgram/ml) and CZOP (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microgram/ml) and was not resistant to those. E. coli also showed good susceptibility to the other drugs except to penicillins. Decreases in susceptibility of E. coli to quinolones, ciprofloxacin (CPFX), and sparfloxacin (SPFX) were observed in the patients with complicated UTIs. The susceptibility of Klebsiella spp. to all drugs did not significantly change in 2000 and was generally good except to penicillins. Although the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to carbapenems was notable, the MIC90 went up from 4 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in complicated UTIs compared with those observed in the previous year.
TI  - Evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  - The newly developed Rapid Lumi Eiken/IS60 (RL/IS60) system automatically determines MICs by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. The present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. Sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with MICs determined by the reference microdilution method. When the MICs of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (QC) strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the RL/IS60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the QC limits proposed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The system was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, P. aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the RL/IS60 system and the reference microdilution method. Our results suggest that the RL/IS60 system provides rapid and reliable MICs of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as QC strains.
TI  - [Dynamics of antibiotic resistance of purulent septic pathogens at an emergency facility].
AB  - The predominant pathogens at the emergency medicine hospital were analysed and its resistance to antibiotics was investigated in dynamics. The susceptibility of the pathogens was analysed by the method of dynamic equalibration. Statistically significant reduction of resistant bacteria isolation was demonstrated for 2 species of 7--that is S. aureus and E. faecalis regarding 4 antibiotics. The ratio of staphylococci resistant to cefazolin, ceftazidime, doxycyclin reduced, the ratio of enterococci resistant to chloramphenicol and doxycyclin also diminished. No correlation was demonstrated between the pathogen isolation frequency and ratio of resistant strains.
TI  - Current implications of drug resistance in spinal cord injury.
AB  - A 54-yr-old man with C6 quadriplegia and a neurogenic bowel and bladder was evaluated for clearance of a urinary tract infection after treatment for organisms susceptible to the antibiotics used, and an organism resistant to all antibiotics on the panel grew on the initial follow-up urine culture. Multidrug-resistant organisms present increasing challenges and risks in the management of the neurogenic bladder in patients with spinal cord injury. In an effort to control and reduce the impact and risk associated with these organisms, management methods of the neurogenic bladder and infection control policies should be adjusted according to guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and related research; such policies could include surveillance for multidrug-resistant organisms and isolation of patients who test positive for these organisms.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of naphthazarins from Arnebia euchroma.
AB  - Bioassay-directed fractionation of extract of Arnebia euchroma led to the isolation of alkannin (1), shikonin (2), and their derivatives (3-8) as the active principles against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). The stereochemistry of alpha-methylbutyryl alkannin (8) is revealed for the first time, and the antimicrobial activity of 8 was compared with its corresponding diastereomer (9). The derivatives 3-9 showed stronger anti-MRSA activity [minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranged from 1.56 to 3.13 microg/mL] than alkannin or shikonin (MIC = 6.25 microg/mL). Anti-MRSA activity of derivatives was bactericidal with minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC)/MIC < or = 2. In a time-kill assay, the bactericidal activity against MRSA was achieved as rapidly as 2 h. The derivatives 3-9 were also active against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (F935) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (CKU-17) with MICs similar to those with MRSA. Aromatic ester derivatives were also synthesized for antimicrobial activity comparison. None of these compounds were active against Gram-negative bacteria tested. Their cytotoxicity was also evaluated on selected cancer cell lines, and they expressed their activity in the range 0.6-5.4 microg/mL (CD(50)). Our results indicate that the ester derivatives of alkannin are potential candidates of anti-MRSA and anti-VRE agents with antitumor activity.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of RWJ-54428, a new cephalosporin with activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - RWJ-54428 (MC-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with activity against resistant gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The in vivo efficacy of RWJ-54428 was evaluated against gram-positive bacteria in four mouse models of infection. RWJ-54428 was effective in vivo against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. aureus in a mouse model of sepsis, with 50% effective doses being similar to those of vancomycin. In a single-dose neutropenic mouse thigh model of infection, RWJ-54428 at 30 mg/kg of body weight showed activity similar to that of vancomycin at 30 mg/kg against a strain of methicillin-resistant S. aureus. RWJ-54428 also showed a prolonged in vivo postantibiotic effect in this model. In a mouse model of pneumonia due to a penicillin-susceptible strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, RWJ-54428 displayed efficacy and potency superior to those of penicillin G and cefotaxime. In a mouse model of pyelonephritis due to Enterococcus faecalis, RWJ-54428 had bactericidal effects similar to those of vancomycin and ampicillin, but at two- to threefold lower total daily doses. These studies show that RWJ-54428 is active in experimental mouse models of infection against gram-positive organisms, including strains resistant to earlier cephalosporins and penicillin G.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Pseudognaphalium moritzianum.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of ethanol, acetone and aqueous extracts of the aerial parts of Pseudognaphalium moritzianum was evaluated. Ethanol and acetone extracts showed activity against Staphlococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The aqueous extract was active against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Human beta-defensin-2 induction in Helicobacter pylori-infected gastric mucosal tissues: antimicrobial effect of overexpression.
AB  - The objective of this study was to understand more of the innate immune response  to Helicobacter pylori by determining the expression of human beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2) in various gastric mucosal tissues and MKN45 gastric cancer cells with or without H. pylori. Semi-quantitative TaqMan RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were carried out. The antimicrobial effects of a transfected hBD-2 gene against H. pylori were also evaluated. The results showed that hBD-2 was expressed in inflamed gastric mucosal tissues with H. pylori infection, but not in the absence of H. pylori infection. Expression was also detected in gastric cancers in patients with H. pylori infection. Expression was induced in the MKN45 gastric cancer cell line by H. pylori in a manner dependent on the abundance of bacteria. hBD-2-transfected 3T3J2-1 cells secreted hBD-2 protein into the culture medium and this protein inhibited growth of H. pylori completely. The results suggest that hBD-2 may be involved in the pathophysiology of H. pylori-induced gastritis.
TI  - The lactoperoxidase system increases efficacy of high-pressure inactivation of foodborne bacteria.
AB  - The inactivation of eight different bacteria comprising Escherichia coli LMM1010  and MG1655, respectively a pressure-resistant strain and the corresponding wild-type, Salmonella Typhimurium, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua and Lactobacillus plantarum, by high hydrostatic pressure in skim milk supplemented with the lactoperoxidase-hydrogen peroxide-thiocyanate (LP) system at naturally occurring concentration was studied. In the absence of pressure treatment, the LP system had either no effect, i.e. on S. Typhimurium and E. coli LMM1010, a growth inhibiting effect, i.e. on E. coli MG1655, L. innocua, S. aureus, L. plantarum and E. faecalis, or a bactericidal effect, i.e. on P. fluorescens. The presence of the LP system affected inactivation by high pressure in a cell density-dependent manner. At low cell concentration (10(6) cfu/ml), the LP system strongly increased high-pressure inactivation as measured immediately after pressure treatment of all bacteria except the pressure-resistant E. coli. At high cell density (10(9) cfu/ml), only inactivation of L. innocua, E. faecalis and L. plantarum were enhanced. For both E. coli strains, the fate of the bacteria during 24 h following pressure treatment was also studied. It was found that in the presence of the LP system, considerable further inactivation occurred in the first hours after pressure treatment. The potential of the LP system to improve the bactericidal efficiency of high-pressure treatment for food preservation is discussed.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against recent clinical isolates of bacteria in Korea.
AB  - Gemifloxacin is an enhanced-affinity fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. In Korea, resistant bacteria are relatively more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. In this study, we studied the in vitro activities of gemifloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and other commonly used antimicrobial agents against 1,689 bacterial strains isolated at four Korean university hospitals during 1999-2000. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using the agar dilution method of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Gemifloxacin had the lowest MICs for the respiratory pathogens: 90% of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by 0.06, 0.03, and 0.03 mg/L, respectively. Gemifloxacin was more active than the other fluoroquinolones against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis. The MIC90s of gemifloxacin for Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris, and non-typhoidal Salmonella spp. were 0.25, 1.0, and 0.12 mg/L, respectively, while those for other Gram-negative bacilli were 4-64 mg/L. In conclusion, gemifloxacin was the most active among the comparative agents against Gram-positive species, including respiratory pathogens isolated in Korea.
TI  - Development of broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) bacterial identification in diagnosis of infective endocarditis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS OF THE STUDY: The study aim was to identify the value of broad-range bacterial PCR in infective endocarditis (IE) of bacterial etiology, and to determine its specificity and sensitivity. METHODS: Thirty blood samples were taken for analysis from patients with IE (diagnosed according to Duke criteria) and acquired valvular heart disease. Two control groups of patients with (n = 10) or without (n = 15) urinary tract infection were defined. DNA was isolated, and three different primer pairs for the region of the gene coding for 16S rRNA were tested, to determine the most specific pair. Amplification products were analyzed with gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and located under UV light. RESULTS: Positive blood cultures were found in 25 patients with IE. A typical echocardiography picture with bacterial vegetations was found in all patients with sterile blood cultures, and in 20 patients with positive blood cultures. The highest specificity was found for forward/reverse (F/R) primers, as the relevant amplified PCR product was present in all blood samples with IE, and in four of 10 patients with urinary tract infection. CONCLUSION: Broad-range PCR in bacterial endocarditis is a rapid, sensitive and inexpensive technique for the detection of bacteria, but is far more prone to contamination than species-specific PCR. However, under controlled conditions, broad-range PCR may be valuable for the identification of non-specific infection, permitting a more rapid clinical diagnosis of endocarditis.
TI  - Evaluation of dedicated stethoscopes as a potential source of nosocomial pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the ear tips of dedicated stethoscopes (DS) that  are used on patients prescribed contact precautions for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, or multiple antibiotic-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii become contaminated with these micro-organisms. DESIGN: Culture of DS ear tips. SETTING: A 524-bed tertiary care university hospital. METHODS: DS ear tips were inoculated directly onto bacteriologic media and incubated for 48 to 72 hours. Growth of more than 10 colonies from the 2 ear tips collectively was indicative of contamination. RESULTS: Ear tips of 78 DS from 69 patients were cultured. Ear tips from 17% (13/78) of the DS were contaminated with potentially pathogenic bacteria: 2 with S aureus (1 MRSA), 1 with E faecalis, 7 with Acinetobacter species, 2 with Pseudomonas species, 1 with Escherichia coli, and 1 with Moraxella. None of the stethoscope ear tips was contaminated with the same pathogen for which the patient was prescribed contact precautions (95% CI, 0-3.8%). CONCLUSION: Although the ear tips of DS from patients who were prescribed contact precautions for MRSA, vancomycin-resistant E faecium, or multiple antibiotic-resistant A baumannii were not contaminated with the indicated nosocomial pathogen, 94% of the evaluable ear tips were contaminated, including with MRSA (1.3%) and Acinetobacter (11%). Regular disinfection of ear tips of DS between users should be considered.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BAL9141, a novel parenteral cephalosporin active against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  - Community-acquired and nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens continue to increase in prevalence and have become a serious problem in many parts of the world. BAL9141 is a member of the class of parenteral pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephalosporins, and has a broad spectrum of activity. In the current study, BAL9141 was tested against a large number (n = 2263) of recent isolates from various international surveillance programmes including 1097 Gram-positive strains. Susceptibility to (S) and activity of (mg/L) to BAL9141, based on proposed breakpoints (MIC50/MIC90/% S) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.5/0.5/100%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (1/2/100%), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (0.12/0.25/100%), methicillin-resistant CoNS (MR-CoNS) (1/2/100%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (< or = 0.015/0.25/100%), viridans group streptococci (0.03/0.5/99%), beta-haemolytic streptococci (< or = 0.015/< or = 0.015/100%), Enterococcus faecalis (0.5/16/90%), Enterococcus faecium (>32/>32/22%), Haemophilus influenzae (0.06/0.06/100%), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.06/0.5/100%), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (0.03/0.06/100%) and Neisseria meningitidis (< or = 0.002/0.004/100%). BAL9141 susceptibility at < pr = 4 mg/L (100% S) surpassed that of ceftriaxone (CRO; 1% S) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q-D; 92% S) against MRSA and MR-CoNS (CRO 0.9% S; Q-D 94% S). All S. pneumoniae were inhibited by BAL9141 at < or = 1 mg/L compared with CRO (90% S) and levofloxacin (LVX; 98% S). Susceptibility rates for viridans group streptococci to BAL9141 (>98%) were also higher than to CRO (86%) and LVX (96%). BAL9141 demonstrated excellent activity against most species of wild-type enteric bacilli, with > or = 95% of isolates being susceptible; however, only modest activity was observed for BAL9141 against non-fermentative Gram-negative species and ESBL-producing Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae. BAL9141 demonstrated excellent activity against many tested pathogens displaying various resistance phenotypes, and should be particularly valuable in the treatment of MRSA as well as for drug-resistant streptococci, while maintaining a spectrum resembling a 'third-generation' cephalosporin against other clinically important species.
TI  - Enterococcal plasmid transfer: sex pheromones, transfer origins, relaxases, and the Staphylococcus aureus issue.
AB  - Certain conjugative plasmids in Enterococcus faecalis encode a mating response to peptide sex pheromones encoded on the chromosome of potential recipient (plasmid-free) strains. The pheromone precursors correspond to the precursors of surface lipoproteins with the mature peptides coming from the last 7-8 residues of the related signal sequences. Processing that gives rise to the pAD1-related peptide involves a chromosome-encoded metalloprotease (Eep) that is believed to operate within the cytoplasmic membrane. Mutations in the determinants for cAD1 and cAM373, cad and camE, respectively, do not affect cell viability; and when the related plasmid is present, the pheromone response is normal. A cAM373-like activity is produce by Staphylococcus aureus, but the corresponding lipoprotein determinant (camS) is unrelated to the enterococcal determinant (camE). pAD1 has two origins of transfer, oriT1 and oriT2 and encodes a relaxase (TraX), which has been shown to specifically nick in oriT2. pAM373 has a site, oriT, that is similar to oriT2 of pAD1. Both sites (oriT2 of pAD1 and oriT of pAM373) have a series of short direct repeats (5-6 bp with 5-6 bp-spacings) adjacent to a long inverted repeat (140 bp). The direct repeats differ significantly and confer specificity to the two systems. pAD1 and pAM373 are both able to mobilize the nonconjugative plasmid pAMalpha1, which encodes two relaxases that are involved in transfer. Relevant information concerning the possible movement of vancomycin resistance from E. faecalis to S. aureus in a clinical environment is discussed.
TI  - Sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  - AIMS: To test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin B was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees C with five inocula of 14 bacteria. Two yeasts (Candida spp) and one Aspergillus were also tested. Contaminated media were then inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a Bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. Changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened daily by visual inspection. The sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. RESULTS: Organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria irrespective of the starting inoculums: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Haemophilus influenzae. For micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal only (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida kruzei, Aspergillus fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. Mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (SD 13.8, range 2-52). In cases of detection by the blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.
TI  - Total synthesis and biological evaluation of (5Z,9Z)-5,9-hexadecadienoic acid, an inhibitor of human topoisomerase I.
AB  - The naturally occurring (5Z,9Z)-5,9-hexadecadienoic acid was synthesized stereochemically pure in six steps starting with commercially available 1,5-hexadiyne. The title compound was antimicrobial against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 80 microM) and Streptococcus faecalis (MIC 200 microM), but inactive against Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In addition, the (5Z,9Z)-5,9-hexadecadienoic acid completely inhibits human topoisomerase I at a concentration of 800 microM, while 5,9-hexadecadiynoic acid and hexadecanoic acid do not inhibit topoisomerase I (>1000 microM). This comparison reveals that the cis double bond geometry in the title compound is required for topoisomerase I inhibition. Moreover, these results suggest that the antimicrobial activity of (5Z,9Z)-5,9-hexadecadienoic acid against either S. aureus or S. faecalis could be a result, at least in part, of the inhibitory activity of the acid against topoisomerases.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of novel oligosaccharides related to Ziracin.
AB  - Five novel oligosaccharide antibiotics, Sch 58769 (1), Sch 58771 (2), Sch 58773 (3), Sch 58775 (4), and Sch 58777 (5), were isolated from the fermentation broth of Micromonospora carbonacea var africana. Their structures were determined by spectroscopic methods, including MS and (1)H and (13)C NMR experiments. A comparison of the obtained data with that for Ziracin (Sch 27899) revealed that these oligosaccharides belong to the same everninomicin family of compounds. Ziracin demonstrates potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria both in vitro and in vivo including multiply resistant strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci faecalis.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity evaluation of some new adamantane derivatives.
AB  - In this study, some new Schiff bases were synthesized as antimicrobial agents using benzaldehyde derivatives and 1- or 2-aminoadamantane. The structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by IR, 1H-NMR and elementary analysis. Antimicrobial activities of the synthesized compounds were tested against some bacteria and yeast-like fungi. The antimicrobial activity of the compounds was investigated by broth microdilution method using two Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212) and two Gram negative (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) bacteria and yeast-like fungi (Candida albicans ATCC 90028, Candida krusei ATCC 6258, Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019). The antifungal activity of 1-((2-chloro-3,4-dimethoxybenzylidene) amino(adamantane (compound 3) against C. krusei and C. parapsilosis (minimal inhibitory concentration 32 micrograms/ml) was higher than that of the other tested compounds.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Australian plant extracts against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).
AB  - Ethanolic extracts of five traditional Australian medicinal plants, previously shown to display antibacterial activity against laboratory strains of the Gram positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, were investigated for their abilities to inhibit clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Using plate-hole diffusion assays, the following results were obtained: (a) extract from the leaves of Eremophila alternifolia (Myoporaceae) showed activity against MRSA; (b) extract from the leaves of Acacia kempeana (Mimosaceae) showed incomplete inhibition of VRE; (c) extracts from the leaves of Amyema quandong (Loranthaceae) and Eremophila duttonii (Myoporaceae) were active against both types of bacteria; (d) extract from the stem base of Lepidosperma viscidum (Cyperaceae) was active against MRSA and exhibited incomplete inhibition of VRE. All active extracts were evaluated using time-kill assays. Most of the extracts showed bactericidal effects and reduced the number of viable cells by 4-6 logs within four hours, while the extracts from Acacia kempeana leaves and Lepidosperma viscidum stem base exhibited bacteriostatic activity against VRE. The extract from the leaves of Eremophila duttonii was the most active and reduced the number of viable cells of MRSA and VRE to undetectable levels within 1 hour.
TI  - [Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance: VIRA Study].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Resistance to antimicrobial drugs has increased in recent years. The aim of this multicenter study was to determine the current situation in Spain regarding the resistance patterns of the most common infectious agents to antimicrobial drugs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total 1,475 strains isolated in 38 hospitals in October 2001 were studied. These included 294 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 149 clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), 96 Enterococcus faecium, 1 ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, 204 penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100 ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, 361 ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli, 160 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 110 Acinetobacter baumannii. Sensitivity to various antibiotics was studied by a broth microdilution method. Additionally, an epidemiologic survey was conducted in the participating hospitals to determine the incidence of these multi-drug resistant microorganisms. RESULTS: Overall incidence of ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli and MRSA strains was 24% in both cases. The pneumococci were resistant to several antibiotics. Telithromycin showed excellent activity against all the pneumococci, including those resistant to macrolides. Most MRSA isolates were resistant to quinolones and macrolides. All the staphylococci were susceptible to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Only 50% of A. baumannii strains were susceptible to imipenem. CONCLUSION: The results of this study evidence increasing multi-drug resistance among various microorganisms, such as MRSA, CNS, ampicillin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, and underline the need for surveillance programs to gain information on this significant therapeutic problem.
TI  - Inhibition by yeast killer toxin-like antibodies of oral Streptococci adhesion to tooth surfaces in an ex vivo model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monoclonal (KTmAb) and recombinant (KTscFv) anti-idiotypic antibodies, representing the internal image of a yeast killer toxin, proved to be microbicidal in vitro against important eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathogens such as Candida albicans, Pneumocystis carinii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant strains. KTmAb and KTscFv exerted a strong therapeutic effect in well-established animal models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Streptococcus mutans is the most important etiologic agent of dental caries that might result from the metabolic end products of dental plaque. Effective strategies to reduce the disease potential of dental plaque have considered the possibility of using antibiotics or antibodies against oral streptococci in general and S. mutans in particular. In this study, the activity of KTmAb and KTscFv against S. mutans and the inhibition and reduction by KTmAb of dental colonization by S. mutans and other oral streptococci in an ex vivo model of human teeth were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: KTscFv and KTmAb were used in a conventional colony forming unit (CFU) assay against a serotype C strain of S. mutans, and other oral streptococci (S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. salivarius). An ex vivo model of human teeth submerged in saliva was used to establish KTmAb potential of inhibiting or reducing the adhesion to dental surfaces by S. mutans and other oral streptococci. RESULTS: KTmAb and KTscFv kill in vitro S. mutans and other oral streptococci. KTmAb inhibit colonization of dental surfaces by S. mutans and oral streptococci in the ex vivo model. CONCLUSIONS: Killer antibodies with antibiotic activity or their engineered derivatives may have a potential in the prevention of dental caries in vivo.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of unilateral amyloid arthropathy in broiler breeders associated with Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Although symmetrical polyarticular amyloidosis has been described extensively in  brown layers, spontaneous unilateral amyloid arthropathy has not been described previously in chickens. Birds from nine flocks of broiler parent stock (PS) had unilateral lameness associated with severe swelling of the left hock joint and the caudal aspect of the metatarsus. Gross pathology was restricted to the left hock joint and the left digital flexor tendons in almost all cases, suggesting an association with administration of Marek's disease vaccine. Amyloid deposits were found in 83% (25/30) of affected joints by histological examination of Congo red stained sections. Systemic amyloidosis, involving mainly the liver and spleen, was found in 59% (10/17) of birds. Enterococcus faecalis was isolated from joints in 77% (23/30) of cases and Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the joint in one case (1/30). Thirty-five E. faecalis isolates from joints, tendons and blood samples from birds in five affected PS flocks were compared using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to separate genomic fragments after digestion with SmaI. All but one isolate had identical or closely related restriction endonuclease digestion (RED) patterns that were very similar to a known arthropathic and amyloidogenic E. faecalis isolate. A further 30 E. faecalis isolates from seven grandparent stock (GPS) flocks and two isolates from two unaffected PS flocks of the same genetic background were analysed by PFGE. Among these isolates, 11 originating from four GPS flocks had RED patterns identical to or closely related to the reference amyloid-inducing strain. Moreover, one E. faecalis isolate from amyloidotic joints of brown layers housed in California, USA was included in the analysis and appeared to be identical to the reference strain. This study showed that the E. faecalis isolates involved in these outbreaks of unilateral amyloid arthropathy in broiler breeders belonged to the same clone as that responsible for outbreaks in brown layers.
TI  - A retrospective investigation of advanced periodontal disease as a risk factor for septicemia in hematopoietic stem cell and bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Septicemia is a cause of death in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. Extraction of teeth with advanced periodontitis has been advocated before HSCT to prevent septicemia in myeloablated hosts. The primary aim of the present study was to determine impact of chronic periodontitis, as measured by radiographic alveolar bone loss, on septicemia and transplant mortality. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective design was used to study 77 subjects who received pretransplant dental evaluation, panoramic radiography, and full myeloablative allogeneic HSCT to treat hematologic malignancies. Radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss was measured with a Schei ruler on all teeth. Microorganisms isolated from positive blood cultures within the first 100 days after transplant were categorized as of likely origin from periodontal, oral, or any body sites. Spearman correlation and logistic regression analysis assessed associations between positive blood cultures, mean subject whole-mouth percent radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss, and 100-day survival. RESULTS: Radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss per study subject averaged 13% +/- 7%, with 18.2% exhibiting bone loss of 20% or greater. During the initial 100 days after transplant, 63.6% subjects yielded septicemia-associated positive blood cultures, with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli as the most common isolates recovered. No statistically significant associations were found between mean subject radiographic alveolar bone loss and septicemia of likely periodontal or oral origin. CONCLUSION: In this preliminary study, no relationship was found between radiographic periodontal status and septicemia or mortality within the initial 100 days after transplant. A larger-sized, prospective study is warranted to further delineate the risk of septicemia from periodontal and other oral diseases in immunocompromised patients.
TI  - Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus--Pennsylvania, 2002.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most common causes of hospital- and community-acquired infections. Since the recognition of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in 1988, the emergence of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] > or = 32 microg/mL) has been anticipated. The transfer of the genetic element containing the vanA vancomycin resistance gene from Enterococcus faecalis to S. aureus was demonstrated in the laboratory in 1992; the first clinical infection with VRSA was reported in July 2002. This report describes the second documented clinical isolate of VRSA from a patient.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of clinically relevant blood culture isolates from nine surgical intensive care units, 1996-2000.
AB  - In order to elucidate trends in the incidence and susceptibility profiles of causative agents of bacteremia/fungemia in nine surgical intensive care units, a total of 744 isolates obtained during a 5-year period (1996-2000) were studied. The isolates included 698 bacteria and 46 fungi obtained from 523 positive blood cultures, representing 317 episodes of bacteremia/fungemia. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 2.3 episodes per 1000 surgical ICU admissions in 1996, 1.6 in 1997, 0.3 in 1998, 0.6 in 1999, and 1.7 in 2000. One Enterococcus faecalis (VanA) isolate resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin was recovered in 1996. Ciprofloxacin resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased from 36% in 1996 to 20% in 2000, and resistance to third-generation cephalosporins decreased from 40% in 1996 to 9% in 2000. In light of differences between these results and those found elsewhere, these findings might prove useful for making infection control policy decisions in intensive care units.
TI  - Structure-activity studies of 14-helical antimicrobial beta-peptides: probing the relationship between conformational stability and antimicrobial potency.
AB  - Antimicrobial alpha-helical alpha-peptides are part of the host-defense mechanism of multicellular organisms and could find therapeutic use against bacteria that are resistant to conventional antibiotics. Recent work from Hamuro et al. has shown that oligomers of beta-amino acids ("beta-peptides") that can adopt an amphiphilic helix defined by 14-membered ring hydrogen bonds ("14-helix") are active against Escherichia coli [Hamuro, Y.; Schneider, J. P.; DeGrado, W. F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999, 121, 12200-12201]. We have created two series of cationic 9- and 10-residue amphiphilic beta-peptides to probe the effect of 14-helix stability on antimicrobial and hemolytic activity. 14-Helix stability within these series is modulated by varying the proportions of rigid trans-2-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (ACHC) residues and flexible acyclic residues. We have previously shown that a high proportion of ACHC residues in short beta-peptides encourages 14-helical structure in aqueous solution [Appella, D. H.; Barchi, J. J.; Durell, S. R.; Gellman, S. H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999, 121, 2309-2310]. Circular dichroism of the beta-peptides described here reveals a broad range of 14-helix population in aqueous buffer, but this variation in helical propensity does not lead to significant changes in antibiotic activity against a set of four bacteria. Several of the 9-mers display antibiotic activity comparable to that of a synthetic magainin derivative. Among these 9-mers, hemolytic activity increases slightly with increasing 14-helical propensity, but all of the 9-mers are less hemolytic than the magainin derivative. Previous studies with conventional peptides (alpha-amino acid residues) have provided conflicting evidence on the relationship between helical propensity and antimicrobial activity. This uncertainty has arisen because alpha-helix stability can be varied to only a limited extent among linear alpha-peptides without modifying parameters important for antimicrobial activity (e.g., net charge or hydrophobicity); a much greater range of helical stability is accessible with beta-peptides. For example, it is very rare for a linear alpha-peptide to display significant alpha-helix formation in aqueous solution and manifest antibacterial activity, while the linear beta-peptides described here range from fully unfolded to very highly folded in aqueous solution. This study shows that beta-peptides can be unique tools for analyzing relationships between conformational stability and biological activity.
TI  - [Survey on drug resistance to ciprofloxacin in common pathogenic bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To obtain primary knowledge of drug resistance to ciprofloxacin in the common pathogenic bacteria in this hospital thereby to bring the situation under control. METHODS: A total of 3 800 strains of pathogenic bacteria were isolated from in-patients from 1997 to 2000, and drug resistance of these strains to ciprofloxacin was examined. RESULTS: During the past 4 years, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were found to be highly resistant to ciprofloxacin with the rates still on the rise from 50%, 25.6% and 40.3% in 1997 to 62.2%, 53.4% and 63.6% respectively in 2000. Over 40% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter were resistant to ciprofloxacin and the percentages for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter reached 31.1% to 34.0% in 2000. Among the 189 strains of the pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients with sustained infection in our hospital in 2000, over 70% of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were identified as having resistance to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSION: The percentages of common pathogenic bacteria that are resistant to ciprofloxacin have been considerably high and tend to increase further. Ciprofloxacin abuse needs to be given appropriate attention.
TI  - The ICESt1 element of Streptococcus thermophilus belongs to a large family of integrative and conjugative elements that exchange modules and change their specificity of integration.
AB  - The 34,734-bp element ICESt1 from Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ368 is site-specifically integrated into the 3(') end of the gene fda. ICESt1 encodes integrative functions and putative transfer functions. Six proteins of the putative conjugative system of ICESt1 are related to those encoded by the conjugative transposon Tn916 from Enterococcus faecalis. A comparison of these proteins with those encoded by the complete or partial genome sequences of various low G+C bacteria including Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium difficile, E. faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus mutans revealed the presence of numerous putative site-specific integrative conjugative elements and/or conjugative transposons within these genomes. Sequence comparisons revealed that these elements possess a modular structure and that exchanges of unrelated or distantly related modules and genes have occurred between these elements, and also plasmids and prophages. These exchanges have probably led to modifications in the site specificity of integration of these elements. Therefore, a distinction between low specificity integrative conjugative elements (i.e., conjugative transposons) and site-specific integrative conjugative elements does not appear to be relevant. We propose to call all the conjugative elements that excise by site-specific recombination and integrate by recombination between a specific site of a circular intermediate and another site, "Integrative and Conjugative Elements" (ICEs), irrespective of the integration specificity.
TI  - Patterns of isolation of common gram positive bacterial pathogens and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents in Jimma Hospital.
AB  - Gram positive bacteria are frequently emerging as antibiotic resistant pathogens, causing serious infections than ever before in the ill and debilitated patients. The pattern of isolation and the antimicrobial susceptibilities of common Gram positive cocci including Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (CoNS), Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus species and Streptococcus pneumoniae was investigated between January 1997 and June 2000 in Jimma Hospital. Of the 500 specimens collected from children and adults, 116 (23.2%) consisted of one or more of the above organisms. The following strains: Staphylococcus aureus, 47 (40.5%), CoNS, 36 (31.0%), Streptococcus pneumoniae, 26 (22.4%) Streptococcus pyogenes, 5 (4.3%) and Streptococcus faecalis, 2(1.7%) were isolated from different specimens including pus, sputum, urine, stool, blood and oro/nasopharyngeal swabs of patients. The in vitro activities of 14 different antibiotics including penicillin G, ampicillin, cloxacillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, kanamycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin, methicillin, vancomycin and clindamycin was determined against the clinical bacterial isolates. The antimicrobial activities were evaluated by agar diffusion technique using Mueller-Hinton agar according to NCCLS recommendations. The majority of the pathogens, 59(50.9%) were recovered from upper respiratory tract infections and 17 (14.6%) from the lower respiratory tract. The resistance patterns of S. aureus, CoNS, S. pneumoniae and enterococci to penicillin was 91.5%, 94.4%, 7.7% and 100% respectively. Penicillin, ampicillin and cloxacillin showed low effects (< 60%) on both S. aureus and CoNS. Multi-drug resistance was observed in all the gram-positive isolates, especially higher in staphylococcus species. All isolates of S. aureus (100%) were susceptible to vancomycin, clindamycin and gentamicin. In order to reduce morbidity and mortality due to antibiotic resistance susceptibility testing should be performed for the proper management of bacterial infections. This entails the need for national surveillance to monitor antibiotic resistance in bacteria by susceptibility testing using reliable methods.
TI  - [Interpretative reading of the antibiogram in gram-positive cocci].
AB  - Resistance to methicillin in Staphylococcus is related to expression of the gene  mecA, and implies resistance to all beta-lactams. Breakpoints for interpretation of this mechanism differ in S. aureus and in coagulase-negative species. In relation to macrolides-lincosamides-streptograminsB, the most frequent mechanism among resistant strains is expression of methylases (erm genes). Topoisomerase changes caused by point mutations and expression of the efflux pump NorA determine resistance to quinolones, but there are great differences on the activity of different compounds, which makes interpretative reading difficult. Strains of S. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides (GISA strains) have been recently described. In Spain, there is a high percentage of S. pneumoniae strains intermediate or resistant to penicillin, and a low percentage of strains intermediate or resistant to third generation cephalosporins, because of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. The most frequent phenotype of resistance to macrolides in this species is caused by methylase production. Resistance to quinolones is still uncommon, and is related to the mechanisms previously indicated for Staphylococcus, but clinical interpretation of the antibiograma for this organism is even more complex. No strains of S. pyogenes resistant to penicillin have yet been described. In Spain the most common phenotype of resistance to macrolides in S. pyogenes is determined by efflux pumps (mef genes), affecting 14- and 15-membered macrolides. E. faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, in contrast to E. faecium. Enterococci show intrinsic resistance to aminoglycosides, but still remain susceptible to the combination of these antimicrobials and cell-wall active agents. Strains expressing different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes became resistant to the combination. Glycopeptide-resistant strains of enterococci are uncommon in our country, but several genotypes, of which vanA is the most relevant from a clinical point of view, have been described in other regions.
TI  - Discovery of a novel and potent class of FabI-directed antibacterial agents.
AB  - Bacterial enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase (FabI) catalyzes the final step in each elongation cycle of bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis and is an attractive target for the development of new antibacterial agents. High-throughput screening of the Staphylococcus aureus FabI enzyme identified a novel, weak inhibitor with no detectable antibacterial activity against S. aureus. Iterative medicinal chemistry and X-ray crystal structure-based design led to the identification of compound 4 [(E)-N-methyl-N-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-ylmethyl)-3-(7-oxo-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1,8-na phthyridin-3-yl)acrylamide], which is 350-fold more potent than the original lead compound obtained by high-throughput screening in the FabI inhibition assay. Compound 4 has exquisite antistaphylococci activity, achieving MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited more than 500 times lower than those of nine currently available antibiotics against a panel of multidrug-resistant strains of S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Furthermore, compound 4 exhibits excellent in vivo efficacy in an S. aureus infection model in rats. Biochemical and genetic approaches have confirmed that the mode of antibacterial action of compound 4 and related compounds is via inhibition of FabI. Compound 4 also exhibits weak FabK inhibitory activity, which may explain its antibacterial activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis, which depend on FabK and both FabK and FabI, respectively, for their enoyl-ACP reductase function. These results show that compound 4 is representative of a new, totally synthetic series of antibacterial agents that has the potential to provide novel alternatives for the treatment of S. aureus infections that are resistant to our present armory of antibiotics.
TI  - Chemical constituents and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Lantana  xenica.
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition of Lantana xenica essential oil and its antimicrobial activity. The oil from the aerial parts of Lantana xenica Mold. (Verbenacea) was obtained by steam distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The major constituent of the oil was (E)-caryophyllene (35.2 %), with minor amounts of gamma-cadinene (13.3 %), alpha-pinene (9.3 %), ocimene (9.2 %) and germacrene D (6.6 %). The antimicrobial assays showed that the essential oil of L. xenica inhibited the growth of Bacillus cereus and Proteus mirabilis and both bacteria were inhibited by (E)-caryophyllene, the major component of the oil. Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus showed a lower inhibition. The bacteria Micrococcus luteus, Klebsiella sp., Escherichia coli and the yeast Candida albicans were insensitive to both the oil and (E)-caryophyllene.
TI  - Low prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in clinical samples from hospitalized patients of the Canary Islands, Spain.
AB  - Over the last decade vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have emerged as nosocomial pathogens. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of VRE in clinical samples from hospitalized patients in the Canary Islands. From April to November 2000, 437 enterococci were isolated from patients hospitalized at the four main health care centers in those islands. Identification to the species level was performed with the GPS-TA (Vitek 1) or the Wider I system. A PCR assay was used to determine the genotype of glycopeptide resistance ( vanA, vanB, vanC1, and vanC2/C3 genes). Only three (0.7%) VRE were detected: one vanA Enterococcus faecalis, and two vanC1 Enterococcus gallinarum. To our knowledge, this is the first VRE study carried out in the Canary Islands hospitals, and the results showed a low prevalence of VRE.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinoids such as retinoic acid (RA), retinol (ROL) and retinaldehyde (RAL) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. Most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. Little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. AIM: To analyse the potential anti-infective activities of topical ROL, RAL and RA. METHODS: Microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of ROL, RAL and RA were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus flavus, Propionibacterium acnes, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus hominis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus group B, Enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and Pseudomonas/Klebsiella. In two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% RAL or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% RAL or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. Paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. RESULTS: Of the three retinoids tested, only RAL showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like S. aeureus, Micrococcus spp. or P. acnes. No activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. These results on reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. MIC(50) and MIC(90) values for RAL were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant S. aureus. The two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with RAL had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. In the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2) for P. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. No resistant bacteria were found after 2 weeks of topical use. Preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of RAL is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. CONCLUSION: We have shown that RAL differs from parent natural retinoids such as ROL and RA in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. This activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.
TI  - Novel antibiotics for the treatment of gram-positive bacterial infections.
AB  - The natural dipeptide antibiotic TAN 1057 A,B displays excellent antibacterial activity against staphylococci including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. However, the in vitro activity against additional Gram-positive strains, in particular pneumococci and Enterococcus faecalis, proved to be considerably lower. We report the synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of new derivatives of this natural product that displayed increased antibacterial potency against staphylococci and were also active against pneumococci. In particular, the analogues bearing modified beta-homoarginine side chains with methylated guanidine moieties were shown to be significantly more potent than the natural product TAN 1057 A,B.
TI  - Evaluation of the antimicrobial potential of medicinal plants from the Ivory Coast.
AB  - A total of 148 crude ethanol extracts from 115 plant species were tested in vitro against Gram-negative strains (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Moreover, they were submitted to antifungal assays against Candida albicans and Cladosporium cucumerinum, a human and a plant pathogenic microorganism, respectively, known to be good indicators of antifungal activity. No activity was detected against the Gram-negative bacteria, while 14.8% and 10.8% of the extracts showed Gram-positive bactericidal or bacteriostatic effects on S. aureus and E. faecalis, respectively. An antifungal activity was observed with 15 extracts (10.1%). Two species were particularly active against the fungi: Dioscorea minutiflora and Erythrina vogelii. The young tubers of D. minutiflora contain metabolites with a specific effect on fungi and were not active against the bacteria. On the other hand, E. vogelii was highly effective against the Gram-positive bacteria and the fungi.
TI  - [Conjugative transfer of glycopeptide and macrolide resistant genes among Enterococci and from Enterococcus faecalis to Staphylococcus aureus].
AB  - The resistance determinants were transferred from clinical strains of enterococci to Staphylococcus aureus strains. As recipients methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible strains were used and the filter-mating procedure was performed. The transconjugants resistant to erythromycin were obtained in the case of all recipients, in one case the vanA determinant conferring the resistance to vancomycin was transferred together with erythromycin resistance. However the resistance was very unstable and the level was not as high as in the case of Enterococcus faecalis donor strain. The vanA determinant was easily transferred between enterococcal strains by the conjugation and a transfer occurred of vanA alone or together with erythromycin resistance.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of DW286, a new fluoronaphthyridone antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activities of DW286, a novel fluoronaphthyridone with potent antibacterial activity, were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, gemifloxacin, sparfloxacin, and trovafloxacin. Against gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis, the in vitro activity of DW286 was stronger than that of any other reference antibiotic. Against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of DW286 was similar to those of trovafloxacin and gemifloxacin but was weaker than that of ciprofloxacin. In a mouse systemic infection caused by three S. aureus strains, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus and quinolone-resistant S. aureus (QRSA), DW286 demonstrated the most potent activity, as found in vitro. Specially, DW286 is >or=8-fold more active against QRSA than the other fluoroquinolones. And the 50% protective doses for DW286 were correspondent with the in vitro activities.
TI  - Microbiology of acute otitis externa.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To isolate and characterize bacteria and fungi from acute otitis externa (AOE) and to obtain susceptibility profiles on each bacterial isolate. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective core series. METHODS: Specimens were collected from the external canals of subjects with clinically diagnosed acute otitis externa. Species-level identification for each bacterial isolate recovered was obtained by combining phenotypic and genotypic data. End point mean inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing was performed using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) recommended methods. RESULTS: In Alcon-sponsored clinical studies conducted in 1998 to 2000, microbiology specimens were collected from 2039 subjects (2240 diseased ears) by 101 investigators throughout the United States. A total of 2838 bacteria, 32 yeast, and 17 molds were recovered from 2048 ears clinically diagnosed as acute otitis externa. Of the 202 bacterial species recovered, the species most frequently isolated was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (38%). The next 10 species most frequently isolated were: Staphylococcus epidermidis, 9.1%; Staphylococcus aureus, 7.8%; Microbacterium otitidis, 6.6%; Microbacterium alconae, 2.9%; Staphylococcus caprae, 2.6%; Staphylococcus auricularis, 2.0%; Enterococcus faecalis, 1.9%; Enterobacter cloacae, 1.6%; Staphylococcus capitis subsp. Ureolyticus,1.4%; and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, 1.3%. Susceptibility profiles of S. epidermidis isolates revealed the greatest frequency of high-level resistance to selected antibiotics (>/=8 microg/mL): 23%, neomycin-resistant; 11%, oxacillin-resistant; and 12%, ofloxacin-resistant. Susceptibility profiles of S. aureus isolates revealed a lower frequency of high-level resistance: 6.3%, neomycin-resistant; 2.7%, oxacillin-resistant; and 4.5%, ofloxacin-resistant. P. aeruginosa with high-level resistance to quinolones (>/=128 mcg/mL for ofloxacin) was recovered from only 1 subject. Likewise, resistance of P. aeruginosa to aminoglycosides was rare. Twenty isolates had neomycin MICs >/=64 mcg/mL and 10 isolates had gentamicin MICs >/=16 mcg/mL. The coryneform isolates identified as Microbacterium otitidis had an intrinsic lack of susceptibility to quinolones (ofloxacin MICs >/=16 mcg/mL) and aminoglycosides (tobramycin MICs >/=32 mcg/mL and gentamicin MICs >/=8 mcg/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial infections of the external ear canal are most often caused by P. aeruginosa. However, there are a great number of other gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species that are recovered from patients with acute otitis externa. Because of this diverse etiology, the best topical therapeutic choice for topical therapy is for the most potent, broad-spectrum (especially anti-P. aeruginosa) antibiotic available.
TI  - Bacterial inactivation by high-pressure homogenisation and high hydrostatic pressure.
AB  - The resistance of five gram-positive bacteria, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Listeria innocua and Leuconostoc dextranicum, and six gram-negative bacteria, Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas fluorescens and two strains of Escherichia coli, to high-pressure homogenisation (100-300 MPa) and to high hydrostatic pressure (200-400 MPa) was compared in this study. Within the group of gram-positive bacteria and within the group of gram-negative bacteria, large differences were observed in resistance to high hydrostatic pressure, but not to high-pressure homogenisation. All gram-positive bacteria were more resistant than any of the gram-negative bacteria to high-pressure homogenisation, while in relative to high hydrostatic pressure resistance both groups overlapped. Within the group of gram-negative bacteria, there also existed another order in resistance to high-pressure homogenisation than to high hydrostatic pressure. Further it appears that the mutant E. coli LMM1010, which is resistant to high hydrostatic pressure is not more resistant to high-pressure homogenisation than its parental strain MG1655. The preceding observations indicate a different response of the test bacteria to high-pressure homogenisation compared to high hydrostatic pressure treatment, which suggests that the underlying inactivation mechanisms for both techniques are different. Further, no sublethal injury could be observed upon high-pressure homogenisation of Y. enterocolitica and S. aureus cell population by using low pH (5.5 7), NaCl (0 6%) or SDS (0-100 mg/l) as selective components in the plating medium. Finally, it was observed that successive rounds of high-pressure homogenisation have an additive effect on viability reduction of Y. enterocolitica and S. aureus.
TI  - Bacterial survival on radiographic cassettes.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to report the life span of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus on 3 types of radiographic imaging receptors currently used in diagnostic imaging departments in the United States. Kodak 400 speed, Dupont 400 speed and Fuji computed radiography cassettes were inoculated with the 3 bacteria, then placed in an incubation cabinet and cultured for a period of 2 weeks. All 3 cassettes revealed confluent growth with no noticeable reduction in bacterial numbers for the entire test period. This study verifies that common potentially pathogenic bacteria can survive for prolonged periods on radiographic imaging cassettes. Therefore, effective cleaning regimens are of fundamental importance in controlling and preventing potential nosocomial transmission in the diagnostic imaging department.
TI  - 'Superbug' hurdles key drug barrier.
AB  
TI  - Influence of mucin on the activity of the antiseptic Lavasept against Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lavasept, containing the polymeric biguanide polyhexanide, may be effective against Staphylococcus aureus colonizing the nasal mucosa. To obtain basic data on its suitability for that purpose, its antimicrobial activity was examined in the presence of mucin. METHODS: A disk diffusion test was applied using Mueller-Hinton agar, and disks soaked with a therapeutic and a 10-fold higher concentration of Lavasept. Commercially available mucin preparations from porcine stomach were added to the test system. Reference strains and 20 clinically isolates of S. aureus, and reference strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans were tested. RESULTS: Supplementation of the test medium with 1% mucin completely abolished the activity of disks loaded with the therapeutically used concentration of the antiseptic. The neutralizing effect of mucin occurred with all test strains. CONCLUSIONS: The inactivation of Lavasept by mucin may hamper a reliable clearance of nasal S. aureus carriage.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem against isolates from complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem was measured using 4725 strains isolated from  patients with complicated urinary tract infections (CUTIs) between 1988 and 2000. Imipenem was inactive against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium and some non-fermenting Gram-negative rods. Resistant strains (MIC>16 mg/l) were observed in Staphylococcus haemolyticus (22%), Enterococcus faecalis (4%), Enterococcus avium (8%), Serratia marcescens (5%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%). Although the prevalence of imipenem-resistant strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa was sporadically high in some years, no steady increase was seen over the period. Resistant strains were rare in other major uropathogenic species. These results suggest that imipenem is still one of the most reliable antimicrobial drugs.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of 9-substituted tetracycline derivatives.
AB  - The synthesis of 9-substituted tetracycline derivatives has been accomplished by  the reaction of C9 diazonium tetrafluoroborate tetracycline salts with organotin reagents under modified Stille coupling conditions. Several of these unreported derivatives show promising in vitro biological activity against tetracycline resistant and antibiotic resistant bacteria.
TI  - Transfer origins in the conjugative Enterococcus faecalis plasmids pAD1 and pAM373: identification of the pAD1 nic site, a specific relaxase and a possible TraG-like protein.
AB  - The Enterococcus faecalis conjugative plasmids pAD1 and pAM373 encode a mating response to the peptide sex pheromones cAD1 and cAM373 respectively. Sequence determination of both plasmids has recently been completed with strong similarity evident over many of the structural genes related to conjugation. pAD1 has two origins of transfer, with oriT1 being located within the repA determinant, whereas the more efficiently utilized oriT2 is located between orf53 and orf57, two genes found in the present study to be essential for conjugation. We have found a similarly located oriT to be present in pAM373. oriT2 corresponds to about 285 bp based on its ability to facilitate mobilization by pAD1 when ligated to the shuttle vector pAM401; however, it was not mobilized by pAM373. In contrast, a similarly ligated fragment containing the oriT of pAM373 did not facilitate mobilization by pAD1 but was efficiently mobilized by pAM373. The oriT sites of the two plasmids each contained a homologous large inverted repeat (spanning about 140 bp) adjacent to a series of non-homologous short (6 bp) direct repeats. A hybrid construction containing the inverted repeat of pAM373 and direct repeats of pAD1 was mobilized efficiently by pAD1 but not by pAM373, indicating a significantly greater degree of specificity is associated with the direct repeats. Mutational (deletion) analyses of the pAD1 oriT2 inverted repeat structure suggested its importance in facilitating transfer or perhaps ligation of the ends of the newly transferred DNA strand. Analyses showed that Orf57 (to be called TraX) is the relaxase, which was found to induce a specific nick in the large inverted repeat inside oriT; the protein also facilitated site-specific recombination between two oriT2 sites. Orf53 (to be called TraW) exhibits certain structural similarities to TraG-like proteins, although there is little overall homology.
TI  - In vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin and cefepime, alone and in combination with various antimicrobials, against multidrug-resistant staphylococci and enterococci in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model.
AB  - Use of combinations of antimicrobials that together achieve synergistic activities against targeted microorganisms is one potential strategy for overcoming bacterial resistance. As the incidence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant staphylococci and enterococci increases, the importance of devising additional synergistic drug combinations for these bacteria is magnified. We evaluated a number of antimicrobial combinations, with a focus on quinupristin-dalfopristin (Q-D), cefepime, and linezolid, using a previously described in vitro pharmacodynamic model. The combination of Q-D with either linezolid or vancomycin, as well as the combination of cefepime-vancomycin, resulted in enhanced killing (> or =2-log(10) increase in killing versus the most-active single agent) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 494. An improved effect (<2 log(10) kill increase in kill) against MRSA 494 was noted for cefepime plus either Q-D or linezolid, as well as linezolid-vancomycin. Similar relationships were observed for a methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolate (isolate 1199). Against methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis R444, enhanced killing was achieved with the combination of cefepime-linezolid, while improvement was noted for vancomycin with either cefepime or linezolid. The combination of cefepime and vancomycin also achieved enhanced killing against a glycopeptide-intermediate-susceptible S. aureus isolate (isolate 992). The combination of linezolid and doxycycline achieved an enhanced effect against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VREFc) and E. faecium. Q-D plus ampicillin or linezolid resulted in similar enhancement of activity against the VREFc isolate. The results of this study suggest a number of novel antimicrobial combinations that may be useful against staphylococci and enterococci. Combination regimens including cefepime, Q-D, and/or linezolid warrant further investigation for the treatment of refractive infections due to multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Prevalence of and resistance to anti-microbial drugs in selected microbial species isolated from bulk milk samples.
AB  - The prevalence of strains of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative (CN) staphylococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium and Bacillus cereus, was investigated in 111 bulk milk samples. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 38 samples, CN staphylococci from 63 samples, E. coli from 49 samples, E. faecalis or E. faecium from 107 samples, and L. monocytogenes from two samples. Bacillus cereus was not found in any of the samples and three samples were free of any of the selected species. Sensitivity to the anti-microbial drugs amikacin, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, cephalothin (CLT), cephotaxime, clindamycin, chloramphenicol (CMP), co-trimoxazole, erythromycin (ERY), gentamicin, neomycin, norfloxacin, oxacillin, penicillin, streptomycin (STR), tetracycline (TTC) and vancomycin was tested using the standard dilution technique. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) characteristics (MIC50, MIC90, MIC range) were determined for each microbial species. Resistance against one or more anti-microbial drugs was found in 93% of S. aureus, 40% of CN staphylococci, 73% of E. coli, 88% of E.faecalis, 55% of E.faecium, and one L. monocytogenes strain. Most of the strains, particularly enterococci, were resistant to STR, TTC, and ERY (MIC50 4 microg/ml). A high percentage of staphylococci were resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. High resistance to CLT was found in 11 strains of E. coli (MIC 256 microg/ml) and strains resistant to CMP (MIC90 16 microg/ml) were detected. The highest numbers of resistance phenotypes were found in E. coil (16) and CN staphylococci (12). Eighteen identical resistance phenotypes were demonstrated in indicator bacteria (E. coli, E. faecalis, E. faecium) and pathogens (S. aureus, CN staphylococci) isolated from the same bulk milk sample. The obtained resistance data were matched against the herd owners' information on therapeutic use of the drugs. This confrontation could not explain the findings of strains resistant to ERY or CMP. Our findings are evidence of selection of resistant strains among not only pathogenic agents, but also among indicator bacteria which can become significant carriers of transmissible resistance genes.
TI  - Remarkable substituent effects on antimicrobial activities of 1,3-diorganylimidazolidinium salts.
AB  - In vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of a series of 25 diazolidinium  salts, 1,3-diorganylimidazolidinium (1), together with 1,3-dialkylpyrimidinium (2), were evaluated against standard strains: Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Enterobacter cloacae (ATCC 13047), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and Candida albicans (ATCC 10239). Selective and effective antibacterial activity against one gram-negative (P. aeruginosa) and two gram-positive (E. faecalis and S. aureus) bacteria were found in salts 1a, 1i and 1j, in contrast to modest to poor activity observed in the rest of the salts. The enhanced antibacterial activity is clearly linked to the introduction of two bulky mesityl or mesitylbenzyl substituents on the nitrogen atoms of the imidazoline skeleton, while the side chain of the backbone of the molecule has no influence.
TI  - In vitro activity of a novel oxazolidinone, AZD2563, against randomly selected and multiresistant Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The in vitro activity of AZD2563, a novel oxazolidinone, was assessed against 595 Gram-positive cocci, comprising recent surveillance isolates and a collection of resistant (including multiresistant), epidemiologically diverse isolates. The MICs of AZD2563 for staphylococci, pneumococci and enterococci had narrow ranges, 0.25-2 mg/L, with modal MICs of 1 mg/L for staphylococci and pneumococci, and 1-2 mg/L for enterococci. AZD2563 was equally active against the surveillance isolates and those that had been selected for their multiresistance to other agents. The MICs of AZD2563 were either the same as those of linezolid or two-fold lower.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance as an indicator of bacterial chlorhexidine susceptibility.
AB  - The antibiotic and chlorhexidine (CHX) susceptibility of 70 distinct clinical isolates: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus (not MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (10 of each) were tested using minimal bactericidal (MBC) and/or minimal inhibitory (MIC) concentrations. Non-fermentative bacteria tolerated CHX at high concentrations; Gram-positive cocci, especially S. pyogenes, were the most susceptible. We found a good correlation between CHX and antibiotic susceptibility in both MIC and MBC among Gram-negative bacteria, and mainly in MBC among Gram-positive bacteria. Resistance to ciprofloxacin, imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin and aztreonam appeared to indicate increased CHX resistance among Gram-negative bacteria. This finding gives clinicians the ability to predict CHX susceptibility according to routine antibiotic resistance testing.
TI  - Comparative activity of linezolid against staphylococci and enterococci isolated  in Italy.
AB  - The activity of linezolid, a new oxazolidinone, was tested against 862 Gram-positive cocci isolated in Italy and compared with the activities of 12 antibiotics. Overall, MIC90s for linezolid (2-4 mg/L) indicated an in vitro activity comparable to that of vancomycin in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (4 mg/L), S. epidermidis (2 mg/L) and methicillin-susceptible strains. Enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to linezolid (MIC90 2-4 mg/L), glycopeptides and beta-lactams. In E. faecium, only glycopeptides (MIC90 2 mg/L) and linezolid (MIC90 2 mg/L) were active. Linezolid was the only drug active against two strains of Enterococcus showing a VanA phenotype. Owing to its antibacterial profile, linezolid represents a promising drug for the treatment of Gram-positive infections.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. Fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 127), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 123), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), Enterococcus faecium (n = 50), Enterococcus avium (n = 50), and Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. micros, P. prevotii; n = 125). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, CFPM, FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. The decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual MIC range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activities of N-substituted imides.
AB  - In the field of our research programs concerning novel antimicrobial agents, a series of N-substituted imides was synthesized. These compounds were obtained by cyclization of amido-acids in acetic anhydride/sodium acetate or hexamethyldisilazane/zinc bromide for the hydroxy-aromatic derivatives. The hydroxy-alkyl maleimides were directly prepared by condensation of the corresponding amino-alcohol with maleic anhydride in boiling toluene. Most of N-substituted maleimides showed an interesting antimicrobial activity towards bacteria from the ATCC collection (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) but the MIC values for P. aeruginosa were always high (128 microg/ml). The imides with alkyl substituents showed higher activities than aromatic analogues with MIC values in the range of 8-32 microg/ml. Comparatively, succinimides were practically inactive.
TI  - A multicenter evaluation of linezolid antimicrobial activity in North America.
AB  - Overall, 141 centers in North America enrolled in this international surveillance study designed to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity and spectrum of linezolid, a new oxazolidinone. Each participant tested the susceptibility of clinical isolates of staphylococcal species (n = 85) against 12 drugs, and enterococcal species (n = 40) against 6 drugs using reference broth microdilution trays; and of streptococcal species (n = 25) against 6 drugs using Etests (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden). Quality control testing was conducted using recommended strains, and verification of resistance to linezolid and select other agents was performed by a regional monitor. Of the 20,161 isolates collected from sites across the United States (US; n = 132) and Canada (n = 9), 18,307 were included in this analysis. Oxacillin resistance occurred in 38.7 and 70.6% of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcal (CoNS) isolates, respectively. Vancomycin resistance was reported in 65.9 and 2.6% of Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis, respectively. Penicillin resistance occurred in 37.2% of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 17.5% constituting high-level resistance (MIC, > or =2 microg/ml). The MIC(90) for linezolid was 1 microg/ml for streptococci, 2 microg/ml for enterococci and CoNS isolates, and 4 microg/ml for S. aureus. Using the US FDA-recommended susceptible breakpoints for linezolid, there were no confirmed reports of linezolid resistance (i.e., MIC > or =8 microg/ml). The occurrence of linezolid MICs was unimodal and generally varied between, 1-4 microg/ml for staphylococci (94% of recorded results), 1-2 microg/ml for enterococci (93%), and 0.5-1 microg/ml for streptococci (85%). Susceptibility to linezolid was not influenced by susceptibility to other antiicrobials such as vancomycin, beta-lactams or macrolides. Only linezolid was universally active against essentially all tested Gram-positive specimens. The unimodal susceptibility pattern is indicative of excellent and near complete activity against key Gram-positive pathogens including multiply resistant strains, but surveillance for emerging resistances (rare) and the performance of routine susceptibility tests to guide patient therapy seems prudent.
TI  - An Enterococcus faecalis ABC homologue (Lsa) is required for the resistance of this species to clindamycin and quinupristin-dalfopristin.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis isolates are resistant to clindamycin (CLI) and quinupristin-dalfopristin (Q-D), and this is thought to be a species characteristic. Disruption of a gene (abc-23, now designated lsa, for "lincosamide and streptogramin A resistance") of E. faecalis was associated with a > or =40-fold decrease in MICs of Q-D (to 0.75 microg/ml), CLI (to 0.12 to 0.5 microg/ml), and dalfopristin (DAL) (to 4 to 8 microg/ml) for the wild-type E. faecalis parental strain (Q-D MIC, 32 microg/ml; CLI MIC, 32 to 48 microg/ml; DAL MIC, 512 microg/ml). Complementation of the disruption mutant with lsa on a shuttle plasmid resulted in restoration of the MICs of CLI, Q-D, and DAL to wild-type levels. Under high-stringency conditions, lsa was found in 180 of 180 isolates of E. faecalis but in none of 189 other enterococci. Among 19 erm(B)-lacking Enterococcus faecium strains, 9 (47%) were highly susceptible to CLI (MIC, 0.06 to 0.25 microg/ml) and had DAL MICs of 4 to 16 microg/ml; for the remaining erm(B)-lacking E. faecium strains, the CLI and DAL MICs were 4 to > 256 and 2 to > 128 microg/ml, respectively. In contrast, none of 32 erm(B)-lacking E. faecalis strains were susceptible (CLI MIC range, 16 to 32 microg/ml; DAL MIC range, > or =32 microg/ml). When lsa was introduced into an E. faecium strain initially susceptible to CLI, the MICs of CLI and DAL increased > or =60-fold and that of Q-D increased 6-fold (to 3 to 6 microg/ml). Introduction of lsa into two DAL-resistant (MICs, > 128 microg/ml), Q-D-susceptible (MICs, 0.5 and 1.5 microg/ml) E. faecium strains (CLI MICs, 12 and >256 microg/ml) resulted in an increase in the Q-D MICs from 3- to 10-fold (to 8 and >32 microg/ml), respectively. Although efflux was not studied, the similarity (41 to 64%) of the predicted Lsa protein to ABC proteins such as Vga(A), Vga(B), and Msr(A) of Staphylococcus aureus and YjcA of Lactococcus lactis and the presence of Walker A and B ATP-binding motifs suggest that this resistance may be related to efflux of these antibiotics. In conclusion, lsa appears to be an intrinsic gene of E. faecalis that explains the characteristic resistance of this species to CLI and Q-D.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic analysis of Ace: a collagen-binding MSCRAMM from Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Ace is a collagen-binding bacterial cell surface adhesin from Enterococcus faecalis. The collagen-binding domain of Ace (termed Ace40) and its truncated form Ace19 have been crystallized by the vapor-diffusion hanging-drop method. Ace19 was crystallized in two different crystal forms. A complete 1.65 A data set has been collected on the orthorhombic crystal form with unit cell parameters a=38.43 b=48.91 and c=83.73 A. Ace40 was crystallized in the trigonal space group P3(1)21 or P3(2)21 with unit cell parameters a=b=80.24, c=105.91 A; alpha=beta=90 and gamma=120 degrees. A full set of X-ray diffraction data was collected to 2.5 A. Three heavy atom derivative data sets have been successfully obtained for Ace19 crystals and structural analysis is in progress.
TI  - In vitro activity of a new cephalosporin, RWJ-54428, against streptococci, enterococci and staphylococci, including glycopeptide-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The need for new antimicrobial agents with activity against Gram-positive organisms has become increasingly important because of emerging resistance. We compared the activity of a new b-lactam antimicrobial agent, RWJ-54428 (MC-02 479), with representatives of other classes of antimicrobial agents against 76 Staphylococcus aureus (including four glycopeptide- intermediate strains), 50 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 20 Enterococcus faecalis, 20 Enterococcus faecium, 10 Enterococcus gallinarum/Enterococcus casseliflavus, 54 Streptococcus pneumoniae and 22 viridans streptococcal isolates. The MIC(90) of RWJ-54,428 was < or = 2 mg/L for all groups of bacteria tested except E. faecium. The activity against four strains of glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus was similar to that for other methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (range 0.5-2.0 mg/L).
TI  - Polymerase chain reaction as a sensitive and rapid method for specific detection  of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in clinical samples.
AB  - The fast diagnosis of Mycoplasma primary atypical pneumonia is impaired by the lack of routinely available culture methods for isolation of Mycoplasma pneumoniae from clinical specimens. Likewise, serological methods commonly used for diagnosis are insensitive and non-specific. In this study, we have established and applied the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to detect M. pneumoniae DNA in clinical samples originating from the respiratory tract. The PCR results were compared with those from culture and serology tests. To standardize the detection of M. pneumoniae by PCR, we first used DNA from culture grown organisms and clinical samples seeded with M. pneumoniae. PCR amplification was performed with M. pneumoniae-specific primers to amplify 144, 153 and 631 bp DNA fragments by using primer pairs MP5-1/MP5-2, P1-178/P1-331 and P1-178/P1-809, respectively. The amplification of the 631 bp DNA fragment was found to be most sensitive for the detection of M. pneumoniae. Using the most sensitive PCR, a total of 47 respiratory specimens from patients suspected of community acquired pneumonia were tested. While none of the specimens were positive for M. pneumoniae in culture, 6 specimens gave positive results by PCR. In 4 out of the 5 PCR positive samples tested serologically, the results were supported by elevated levels of anti-mycoplasma IgG/IgM/IgA. Thus, these results suggest that PCR is the most sensitive method to detect M. pneumoniae in clinical specimens.
TI  - Identification and characterization of genes encoding sex pheromone cAM373 activity in Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The sex pheromone cAM373 of Enterococcus faecalis and the related staph-cAM373 of Staphylococcus aureus were found to correspond to heptapeptides located within the C-termini of the signal sequences of putative prelipoproteins. The deduced mature forms of the lipoproteins share no detectable homology and presumably serve unrelated functions in the cells. The chromosomally encoded genetic determinants for production of the pheromones have been identified and designated camE (encoding cAM373) and camS (encoding staph-cAM373). Truncated and full-length clones of camE were generated in Escherichia coli, in which cAM373 activity was expressed. In E. faecalis, insertional inactivation in the middle of camE had no detectable phenotypic effects on the pheromone system. Establishment of an in frame translation stop codon within the signal sequence resulted in reduction of cAM373 activity to 3% of normal levels. The camS determinant has homologues in Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis and Listeria monocytogenes; however, corresponding heptapeptides present within those sequences do not resemble staph-cAM373 closely. The particular significance of staph-cAM373 as a potential intergeneric inducer of transfer-proficient genetic elements is discussed.
TI  - Antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  - In this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (HSP) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. Due to the clinical use of HSP and FFP for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. With the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that HSP contains marked IgG antibody reactivity against antigens of Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterobacter sakazakii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Candida albicans. Although no IgM antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in HSP, moderate IgA reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated specific IgA and IgG responses against the endoproteinase Glu-C and the superantigens enterotoxin A and B of S. aureus, the IgA-protease of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic E. coli. By using 3 different HSP batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. This antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of FFP.
TI  - Evaluation of the VITEK 2 system for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - A study was conducted to evaluate the new VITEK 2 system (bioMerieux) for identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of gram-positive cocci. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n = 100), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (n = 100), Enterococcus spp. (n = 89), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 29), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 66) were examined with the ID-GPC identification card and with the AST-P515 (for staphylococci), AST-P516 (for enterococci and S. agalactiae) and AST-P506 (for pneumococci) susceptibility cards. The identification comparison methods were the API Staph for staphylococci and the API 20 Strep for streptococci and enterococci; for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the agar dilution method according to the procedure of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) was used. The VITEK 2 system correctly identified to the species level (only one choice or after simple supplementary tests) 99% of S. aureus, 96.5% of S. agalactiae, 96.9% of S. pneumoniae, 92.7% of Enterococcus faecalis, 91.3% of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and 88% of Staphylococcus epidermidis but was least able to identify Enterococcus faecium (71.4% correct). More than 90% of gram-positive cocci were identified within 3 h. According to the NCCLS breakpoints, antimicrobial susceptibility testing with the VITEK 2 system gave 96% correct category agreement, 0.82% very major errors, 0.17% major errors, and 2.7% minor errors. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed category agreement from 94 to 100% for S. aureus, from 90 to 100% for CNS, from 91 to 100% for enterococci, from 96 to 100% for S. agalactiae, and from 91 to 100% for S. pneumoniae. Microorganism-antibiotic combinations that gave very major errors were CNS-erythromycin, CNS-oxacillin, enterococci-teicoplanin, and enterococci-high-concentration gentamicin. Major errors were observed for CNS-oxacillin and S. agalactiae-tetracycline combinations. In conclusion the results of this study indicate that the VITEK 2 system represents an accurate and acceptable means for performing identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests with medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial sensitivity for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (1,913 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 178), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE; n = 98), methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE; n = 164), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), Enterococcus faecium (n = 91), Enterococcus avium (n = 72), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP; n = 100), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP; n = 29), Streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). CZOP possessed comparable antibacterial activities against MSSA and MSSE to other cephems, and was also effective on MRSE but not on MRSA. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. CZOP, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (CPR) and higher than other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, just like other drugs. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (CTM), cefepime (CFPM) and CPR, and that against S. agalactiae was also preferable. CZOP and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against S. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, CTM and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 96.5% in MRSA, 93.1% in PRSP, 60.0% in PISP, 40.3% in S. haemolyticus, 22.3% in E. faecalis, and 15.9% in MRSE. Those resistance ratios were similar to those for CFPM, but E. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. In conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria was observed. The sensitivities of PISP and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested to be decreasing.
TI  - NB2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  - Enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ECTA) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-Lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. We present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ECTA compounds, NB2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. Unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of NB2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. Evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) NB2001 is a substrate for TEM-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/K(m)) of greater than 77,000 M-1 s-1. (ii) Triclosan is detected in NB2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli but not in E. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) NB2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing E. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. NB2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. NB2001 is also active against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae. The results indicate that NB2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent and demonstrate the potential of ECTA in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.
TI  - Proficiency of Italian clinical laboratories in detecting reduced glycopeptide susceptibility in Enterococcus and Staphylococcus spp. using routine laboratory methodologies.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the ability of 59 clinical microbiology laboratories distributed throughout Italy to correctly identify and detect reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides in staphylococci and VanA-, VanB- or VanC-mediated glycopeptide resistance in enterococci. METHODS: Eight test strains comprising three staphylococci (S. aureus ATCC 29212 and two vancomycin-intermediate S. haemolyticus [11105301, 10030683Y]) and five enterococci (E. faecalis ATCC 29212, E. faecalis ATCC 51299 VanB, E. faecium AIB40 VanA, E. faecalis V583 VanB and E. gallinarum AIB39 VanC1) were distributed to 59 Italian clinical microbiology laboratories. Each isolate was blind-coded, and laboratories were instructed to identify the strains and test isolates for susceptibility to teicoplanin and vancomycin using their standard methods. Results were assessed against consensus test results obtained by a reference laboratory. In addition, to complement data interpretation, laboratories were asked to provide retrospective routine test results from their respective hospitals. RESULTS: All 59 laboratories participating in the study completed the susceptibility testing and provided data for analysis. A total of 53 laboratories provided retrospective routine data. Overall, laboratories were able to identify isolates to the genus level successfully. E. gallinarum and S. haemolyticus posed problems for species identification, with only 40.6 and 71.2%, respectively, of results reported correctly; most incorrect results were reported as 'other species'. For enterococcal test strains, VanA phenotypes were detected correctly by 96.6% of laboratories; VanB by 30.5% (E. faecalis ATCC 51299) and 88.1% (E. faecalis V583); and VanC1 by 67.8%. For staphylococcal test strains, 28.8% (S. haemolyticus 11105301) and 23.7% (S. haemolyticus 10030683Y) of the laboratories were able to detect reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. Errors in detecting vancomycin resistance in VanB and VanC1 enterococci were made with all methods, most noticeably by disk diffusion users. For staphylococci, most errors in reporting vancomycin-intermediate resistance occurred with disk diffusion and Vitek (software version 5.04) users. Overall, considerably fewer errors occurred with the detection of teicoplanin resistance, especially for staphylococci. For 1999, routine results show that 41/1749 (2.4%) of E. faecium, 220/11 180 (2.0%) of E. faecalis, 29/24 927 (0.12%) of S. aureus and 54/22 102 (0.24%) of coagulase-negative staphylococci were reported as resistant to vancomycin. CONCLUSION: Italian laboratories are able to identify staphylococci and enterococci adequately, although all methodologies used have problems in identifying E. gallinarum and coagulase-negative staphylococci to the species level. While VanA phenotypes were efficiently detected, problems were experienced in detecting VanB and VanC phenotypes. The majority of laboratories were unable to detect reduced vancomycin susceptibility in staphylococci adequately, especially with disk diffusion and older Vitek systems. Teicoplanin appeared useful as a marker for detecting vancomycin resistance, particularly with disk diffusion. Should enterococcal VanB or staphylococcal glycopeptide-intermediate phenotypes become prevalent in Italy, it is likely that they would be under-detected. New systems under development, such as Vitek2, should improve this situation.
TI  - Livestock issues. Overpowering manure.
AB  
TI  - Investigating the bacterial barrier properties of four contemporary wound dressings.
AB  - The ability of four wound dressings (CombiDERM, Allevyn Hydrocellular, Tegaderm and Tielle) to resist penetration of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated in vitro using a dedicated test apparatus. With the exception of Tielle, each dressing prevented bacterial transmission over an 11-day challenge period. When both the wound contact surface and the external surface of Tielle were directly challenged with a bacterial suspension, penetration of the dressing was observed within three to five days. The breakdown of its outer membrane could explain the inability of Tielle to maintain a barrier to the passage of the test bacteria used in this wound model. On the basis of these data, CombiDERM, Allevyn Hydrocellular and Tegaderm dressings may facilitate infection control by acting as a physical barrier to the transmission of potentially pathogenic and antibiotic-resistant wound bacteria. However, further research is urgently required to determine whether or not the same results are observed in clinical practice.
TI  - Antispasmodic and antimicrobial diterpenic acids from Viguiera hypargyrea roots.
AB  - Two spasmolytic diterpene acids, ent-beyer-15-en-19-oic acid and ent-kaur-16-en-19-oic acid, have been isolated from the roots of Viguiera hypargyrea by bioassay-guided fractionation. Beyerenoic acid was also active against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus feacalis and Candida albicans.
TI  - Bactericidal efficacy of sterilizing protocol for reused cardiac electrophysiology catheters.
AB  
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial spectrum and activity of BMS284756 (T-3811; a desfluoroquinolone) tested against an international collection of staphylococci and enterococci, including in vitro test development and intermethod comparisons.
AB  - The study was initiated to determine the in vitro activity and MIC/disk test comparisons of BMS284756, a new des-fluoro(6)-quinolone, against isolates of staphylococci and enterococci from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, 2000. Isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution and standardized disk diffusion methods. Against 3,789 strains of gram-positive cocci from the SENTRY Program (2000), the BMS284756 MIC90 and percentage susceptible at < or = 2 and < or = 4 microg/ml were: Staphylococcus aureus (4 microg/ml; 89.3 and 97.1%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 4 microg/ml; 86.1 and 96.0%) and enterococci (> 4 microg/ml; 62.0 and 76.2%). Also tested were selected staphylococci (300 strains) and enterococci (102 strains) by two standardized methods. The activity of BMS284756 was highly correlated with oxacillin resistance among staphylococci. Oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci were all inhibited by BMS284756 at < or = 0.5 microg/ml, whereas oxacillin-resistant strains required inhibitory concentrations of > or = 1 microg/ml. Excellent correlation was observed between the MIC and 5-microg disk zone diameter for staphylococci and enterococci (r=0.91 to 0.93). Among vancomycin-susceptible enterococci, 67% of Enterococcus faecalis, 25% of E. faecium, and 76% of other Enterococcus spp. isolates were inhibited by BMS284756 at < or = 2 microg/ml. All vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE; 11 E. faecalis and 15 E. faecium) were inhibited by > or = 2 microg/ml of BMS284756. Among the non-VRE, non-faecium enterococcal isolates (n=64), 62% were inhibited by < or = 0.5 microg/ml. BMS284756 showed excellent activity against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci and moderate activity against enterococci other than VRE and E. faecium. Acceptable correlations were observed between MIC and disk test results for both tested genus groups.
TI  - The antimicrobial effects of seven different types of Asian chewing sticks.
AB  - There are various plants, which are used as chewing sticks in different parts of  the world. Several studies have been reported on the antimicrobial effects of chewing sticks on oral bacteria. The aim of this study was to compare the antimicrobial effect of aqueous extract of seven different types of chewing sticks found in Pakistan and other Asian countries. The ditch plate method was used to test the antimicrobial activity of seven Asian chewing sticks. It was found that at there was antimicrobial effect on Streptococcus fecalis at 50% concentration of Kikar (Acacia arabica) from Pakistan and Arak (Salvadora persica) from Saudi Arabia. The inhibition zones up to 2 mm were found in those two chewing stick extracts. It is recommended that the chewing sticks will be a great help in developing countries with financial constraints and limited oral health care facilities for their populations.
TI  - Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing of urinary tract isolates and samples  by flow cytometry.
AB  - A multiparametric flow cytometry antimicrobial susceptibility test was developed  and its performance was evaluated on clinical urine isolates and samples in comparison with standard methods. Alterations in cytoplasmic membrane integrity were monitored by propidium iodide, and the anionic probe bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol (DiBAC4(3)) was used to measure changes in membrane potential. Microbial size and cellular content were analysed by light scattering. Twelve antibiotics were tested on 6 ATCC control strains, 22 urine isolates and 19 clinical urine samples, variously containing Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus and S. epidermidis. Agreement between the flow cytometry results, broth microdilution and disk diffusion tests was 93.9% (n = 328 tests). Of the 20 discrepancies observed, 18 were for species other than E. coli. Perfect correlation was obtained with five antibiotics, whereas norfloxacin, nitrofurantoin and tetracycline were responsible for 13(65%) of the 20 discrepancies.
TI  - [Photoinactivation of microorganisms in the presence of photosensitizers].
AB  - Two photosensitizing preparation for the photodynamic therapy of oncological diseases have been obtained. As revealed in this study, under experimental conditions their action suppresses the growth of Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus, which may be of great importance for the treatment of infections. And in contrast to antibiotic therapy, their use may not affect the development of normal intestinal microflora. The study has shown that their derivatives with the residues of carbonic (or muramic) acids more intensively penetrate microorganisms through their cell walls. This makes in possible to expand the spectrum of action of the preparations. The proposed method permits the rapid analysis of the photochemical activity of preparation for photodynamic therapy in the process of their development.
TI  - Grepafloxacin: pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration.
AB  - Pharmacokinetic and tissue penetration studies of grepafloxacin, a new broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone, show that it has useful properties for the treatment of respiratory tract infections. Grepafloxacin has a volume of distribution that is larger than those of many of the other fluoroquinolones and is concentrated in alveolar macrophages, bronchial mucosa and epithelial lining fluid to a greater extent than are certain other fluoroquinolones. Grepafloxacin concentrations achieved in plasma after a 400-mg oral dose are well in excess of those required to inhibit the respiratory pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Streptococcus pneumoniae is also covered for most of the dosing interval, but at normal dose levels grepafloxacin might not inhibit Enterococcus faecalis. The maximum plasma concentrations and area under the concentration---time curve achieved with grepafloxacin suggest that it will be effective for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. The pharmacokinetics of fluoroquinolones are among their most useful properties. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate whether the differences between grepafloxacin and the other fluoroquinolones are of therapeutic significance.
TI  - The bactericidal activity of gatifloxacin in plasma and urine.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the bactericidal activity of gatifloxacin in serum and  urine against relevant pathogens. METHODS: Serum and urine samples obtained in a single rising dose pharmacokinetic study were investigated for bactericidal activity. The doses employed were placebo, and 200, 400, 600 and 800 mg of gatifloxacin. RESULTS: The titers obtained reflected the dose and susceptibility of the pathogen. In serum a titer of greater-than-or-equal1:8 was observed for Escherichia coli for >24 h after 400 mg; for Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumanii the titer was greater-than-or-equal1:8 for between 12--24 h after 600 mg; for Serratia marcescens it was greater-than-or-equal1:8 for >12 h following 800 mg; and for Streptococcus pneumoniae it was greater-than-or-equal1:8 for 8 h following 800 mg. In urine, the titers were greater, and for Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis the titer was >1:8 for 12--24 h after 200 mg and for 24--36 h after a 400-mg dose. Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated a titer of >1:8 for 18--24 h following 600 mg. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that gatifloxacin should be efficacious for a wide range of systemic and urinary tract infections.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic properties of HMR 3004, a novel ketolide, on respiratory pathogens, enterococci and Bacteroides fragilis demonstrated by studies of time kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The pharmacodynamic properties of the novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide) antibiotic, HMR 3004, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect. METHODS: The time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides fragilis. The postantibiotic effects of HMR 3004 were also investigated on these organisms at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x MIC. RESULTS: The time kill-kinetic data demonstrated that HMR 3004 is inoculum dependent and predominantly bacteriostatic being only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. HMR 3004 exhibited a significant postantibiotic effect with all strains studied, ranging from 1.9--6.2 h at 10 x MIC. CONCLUSIONS: The bacteriostatic activity and significant postantibiotic effect demonstrated by HMR 3004 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.
TI  - In vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against selected bacterial pathogens isolated in Italy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin, against 732 clinical strains recently isolated in Italy. METHODS: Susceptibility tests were performed according to NCCLS-guided MIC methodology. Pathogens included in the evaluation included 108 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 124 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates, 158 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 30 Streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 30 b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates, 18 Streptococcus sanguis isolates, 80 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 69 Enterococcal isolates, 40 Haemophilus influenzae isolates, 30 Moraxella catarrhalis isolates and, finally, 30 Gram-positive and 25 Gram-negative anaerobes. RESULTS: Quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibited Staphylococcus aureus and other Staphylococcus spp., irrespective of their oxacillin or erythromycin resistance phenotypes. Similarly, streptococci were fully inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin. Enterococcus faecalis was not included in the spectrum of this streptogramin, while isolates of Enterococcus faecium were inhibited by the new compound. Respiratory pathogens such as H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin as well as all Gram-negative anaerobes tested. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a putative role for quinupristin/dalfopristin in the empirical treatment of severe nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by pathogens often displaying resistance to multiple antibiotics. This drug may provide an alternative to glycopeptide compounds.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of DQ-113, a potent quinolone, against clinical isolates.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of DQ-113, formerly D61-1113, was compared with those  of antibacterial agents currently available. MICs at which 90% of the isolates tested are inhibited (MIC90s) of DQ-113 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.03, 0.008, 0.03, and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively. Moreover, DQ-113 showed the most potent activity against ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, with a MIC90 of 0.25microg/ml. DQ-113 inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains, and Streptococcus pyogenes at 0.06 microg/ml, and DQ-113 was more active than the other quinolones tested against Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium with MIC90s of 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively. Against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, DQ-113 showed the highest activity among the reference compounds, with a MIC range from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml. DQ-113 also showed a potent activity against Haemophilus influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains (MIC90, 0.015 microg/ml), and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.03 microg/ml). The activity of DQ-113 was roughly comparable to that of levofloxacin against all species of ENTEROBACTERIACEAE: The MICs of DQ-113 against ofloxacin-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa ranged from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml, which were four times higher than those of ciprofloxacin. From these results, DQ-113 showed the most potent activity against gram-positive pathogens among antibacterial agents tested.
TI  - The migration of Proteus mirabilis and other urinary tract pathogens over Foley catheters.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the ability of organisms that infect the catheterized urinary tract to migrate over the surfaces of Foley catheters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a simple laboratory model, organisms were challenged to migrate across sections of hydrogel-coated latex, hydrogel/silver-coated latex, silicone-coated latex and all-silicone catheters. The sections (1 cm long) were placed as bridges in channels between blocks of agar and the test organisms inoculated onto the agar adjacent to one side of each bridge. The plates were incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h and examined for growth of the test organisms on the agar on the other side of the bridges. A collection of swarming, swimming and nonmotile species were tested in the model. The relative mobilities of the test organisms were expressed as migration indices, calculated as the percentage of tests in which bacterial migration was observed over each type of catheter bridge. RESULTS: The swarmer cells of Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris migrated successfully (migration indices of 73-100) over all four types of catheter. The migration index of Serratia marcescens swarmers was reduced to 33 over the silver-coated catheters, but these cells crossed over the other catheter surfaces with ease (indices of 100). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most mobile of the swimming, non-swarming organisms with indices of 70-22, but this group was less capable of migration than the swarmers. Indices were 0-33 for nonmotile organisms. The mean migration indices for the nine species for each type of catheter were 57 (hydrogel-coated latex), 49 (silver/hydrogel-coated latex), 41 (silicone-coated latex) and 35 (all-silicone). The swarmer cells of P. mirabilis moved through populations of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, and then migrated over sections of hydrogel-coated latex catheters with little or no reduction in migration index. They were also capable of transporting the nonmotile cells of K. pneumoniae and S. aureus over the catheters. The migration index of P. mirabilis swarmers was substantially reduced in the presence of Ps. aeruginosa and S. marcescens. CONCLUSIONS: Hydrogel coatings facilitate the migration of urinary tract pathogens over catheter surfaces. With the exception of S. marcescens, the incorporation of silver into the hydrogel did not inhibit migration. Swarmer cells were particularly effective at moving over catheters and P. mirabilis swarmers were also capable of transporting other species. This suggests that inhibitors of swarming could be useful in controlling catheter-associated infection and the complications resulting from the spread of bacterial biofilm over catheters.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo activity of antimicrobial-coated prosthetic heart valve sewing cuffs.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) is a relatively uncommon but very serious condition. As bacterial colonization of the prosthetic heart valve sewing cuff can be a prelude to the clinical occurrence of PVE, antimicrobial coating of the sewing cuff may be beneficial. The study aims were to examine the antimicrobial activity in vitro and anti-infective efficacy in vivo of prosthetic heart valve sewing cuffs coated with minocycline and rifampin. METHODS: Zones of inhibition by antimicrobial-coated sewing cuffs were assessed in vitro against Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. The ability of subcutaneously implanted devices coated with minocycline and rifampin to resist colonization and infection by P. aeruginosa was also examined in a rabbit model. RESULTS: Antimicrobial-coated sewing cuffs produced zones of inhibition against all tested organisms. Coated devices were significantly less likely than uncoated devices to become colonized (2/24; 8% versus 20/24; 83%; p <0.001) or to cause device-related infection (0/24; 0% versus 18/24; 75%; p <0.001) and device-related abscess (0/24; 0% versus 10/24; 42%; p <0.001) due to P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: Prosthetic heart valve sewing cuffs coated with minocycline and rifampin provide broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity in vitro, and are anti-infective in vivo against P. aeruginosa. These results encourage the clinical evaluation of these sewing cuffs.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of resveratrol on dermatophytes and bacterial pathogens of the skin.
AB  - The phytoalexin resveratrol is commonly found in food and drinks, including red wine, grapes, and peanuts. Many studies have shown that this compound has anti-inflammatory properties, and it has been ascribed as having health benefits that help to prevent cancer and coronary heart disease. A treatment that combines antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory actions may be desirable for alleviating many skin conditions that range in severity. Therefore, we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of resveratrol against bacteria and dermatophytes that are major etiologic agents of human skin infections. Using the broth microdilution protocol of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) M7-A5, growth of the bacterial species Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was inhibited at 171-342 microg/mL of resveratrol in the solvent dimethyl sulfoxide. Using the NCCLS protocol M38-P, activity against the fungal species Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton tonsurans, Trichophyton rubrum, Epidermophyton floccosum, and Microsporum gypseum was also tested. The growth of dermatophytes was inhibited at 25-50 microg/mL of resveratrol. Thus, this study indicates a novel application for resveratrol, a molecule of plant defense, to combat human fungal pathogens. Resveratrol and its analogs may have wide application to skin conditions that afflict a significant portion of our population, and may also have promising clinical potentials in diabetic wounds.
TI  - In vitro antagonistic effect of Lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. STUDY DESIGN: Antagonistic activity of different Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. The activity was tested against test organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Prevotella bivia. RESULTS: Many of the 146 Lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as S aureus and E coli, and a marked number of Lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as Gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes P anaerobius and P bivia. Only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of E faecalis and S agalactiae. Indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. The specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus strains taken from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. The specific occurrence rates of active Lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.
TI  - Clinafloxacin versus piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of severe skin and  soft-tissue infections in adults at a Veterans Affairs medical center.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs), particularly diabetic foot infections, are a source of considerable morbidity and mortality. Inappropriate antimicrobial therapy may contribute to the increasing emergence of bacterial resistance, as well as to increased health care costs. Thus, there is a continuing search for reasonably safe, well-tolerated, and effective antimicrobial agents that are less susceptible to the development of resistance than older agents. OBJECTIVE: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, was I site in a multicenter, Phase III, randomized, investigator-blinded clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of clinafloxacin with those of piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of adult patients with SSTI. METHODS: Over an 18-month period, patients aged > or = 18 years with physical findings of acute bacterial SSTI requiring hospitalization and intravenous antimicrobial therapy were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either clinafloxacin 200 mg IV every 12 hours or piperacillin/tazobactam 3.375 g IV every 6 hours. After a minimum of 3 days of intravenous therapy, a switch to oral therapy with clinafloxacin 200 mg PO every 12 hours or amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 mg PO every 8 hours could be made in the respective treatment groups. RESULTS: The center enrolled 84 patients (42 in each group), all but I of whom were male, reflecting the typical VA medical center population. The mean age was 60 years (range, 36-80 years) in the clinafloxacin group and 65 years (range, 35-87) in the piperacillin/tazobactam group; the latter group was significantly older (P = 0.0482), which could have affected recovery rates. Sixty-six patients were white and 18 were black. The mean ( +/- SD) duration of treatment was 10.69 +/- 5.34 days in the clinafloxacin group and 12.07 +/- 5.06 days in the piperacillin/tazobactam group; the mean length of stay was 10.83 +/- 10.28 days and 14.95 +/- 19.20 days, respectively. Fifty-three (63%) patients were switched to oral therapy (21 in the clinafloxacin group, 32 in the piperacillin/tazobactam group). The most commonly isolated pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter cloacae. Clinical cure rates and microbiologic eradication rates were similar between the 2 treatments. The piperacillin/ tazobactam arm experienced more all-cause adverse events than the clinafloxacin arm, although the difference was not statistically significant. The clinafloxacin arm experienced significantly more adverse events (eg, photosensitivity) that were judged by the investigator to be drug related (P = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: In this study population of hospitalized adults, clinafloxacin was as effective as piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of complicated SSTIs. Appropriate precautions must be taken against exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet light in patients receiving clinafloxacin, and adequate monitoring is necessary. Further investigation is necessary into how the phototoxic effects of the flu oroquinolones can be limited.
TI  - Spectrum of CT findings in nosocomial Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate CT findings in nosocomial Pseudomonas aeruginosa Pneumonia (PAP) and to compare features of PAP in patients with isolated P. aeruginosa cultures and those with coexistent infections. A retrospective database search revealed 28 patients with nosocomial PAP (12 men, 16 women; mean age, 57 years) in which thoracic CT had been performed within a mean of 1.7 days from the time of respiratory culture. Two chest radiologists blinded to culture data performed a consensus reading noting distribution and pattern of consolidation, ground-glass opacity, nodules, peribronchial infiltration, necrosis, effusions, and pleural enhancement. Coexistent respiratory cultures were recorded. Consolidation was present in all patients, involving multiple lobes in 23 (82%) and demonstrating upper zonal involvement in 23 (82%). Nodular features were present in 14 (50%), including tree-in-bud patterns with centrilobular distributions in 9 (64%) and larger, randomly distributed nodules in 5 (36%). Five of five patients with consolidations limited to the lower lung zones had associated upper lung nodules. Ground-glass opacity was seen in nine (31%) and peribronchial infiltration in 16 (57%). Necrosis was present in eight (29%). Thirteen (46%) bilateral and five (18%) unilateral pleural effusions were present with enhancement occurring in two (1%). Coexistent positive respiratory cultures were identified in 13 patients. The distribution of consolidation, frequency and distribution of nodules, and frequency of necrosis did not differ significantly between patients with and without other positive cultures. With CT, PAP most commonly presents with multifocal airspace consolidation. Nodular features were identified in half, with one-third demonstrating tree-in-bud opacities. Unsuspected necrosis occurred in one-third of cases. CT findings in patients with and without other respiratory isolates did not differ in the distribution and frequency of consolidations, nodularity, or necrosis.
TI  - A new antibiotic CJ-17,665 from Aspergillus ochraceus.
AB  - A new antibiotic, CJ-17,665 (I) was isolated from the fermentation broth of Aspergillus ochraceus, CL41582. It inhibits growth of multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis, with MICs of 12.5, 12.5 and 25 microg/ml, respectively. The structure contains a diketopiperazine and an indole N-oxide moiety that is unusual in natural products.
TI  - Typing and subtyping of 83 clinical isolates purified from surgically implanted silicone feeding tubes by random amplified polymorphic DNA amplification.
AB  - In this study, 83 clinical isolates purified from biofilms colonizing 18 silicone gastrostomy devices (12 "buttons" and six tubes converted to skin level devices) were selected for subtype characterization utilizing genetic analysis. The tubes, previously used for feeding, remained in place for 3 to 47 months (mean, 20.0 months) in children ranging in age from 6 months to 17 years. Classification of specific microbes using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis revealed genetic similarities and differences among isolates belonging to the same genus. Both gram-positive and -negative bacteria were investigated, including 2 isolates of Bacillus brevis, 4 isolates of Bacillus licheniformis, 2 isolates of Bacillus pumilus, 3 isolates of Enterococcus durans, 19 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, 8 isolates of Enterococcus faecium, 2 isolates of Enterococcus hirae, 7 isolates of Escherichia coli, 8 isolates of Lactobacillus plantarum, 19 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 7 isolates of Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Amplified DNA fragments (amplicons) provided species-specific fingerprints for comparison by agarose gel electrophoresis. A total of 62 distinct RAPD types were categorized from the five genera studied. Typing analysis suggested cross acquisition of E. coli, E. faecalis, and S. aureus in three patient pairs. Genomic polymorphism detection proved efficient and reliable for classifying bacterial subtypes isolated from biofilms adhering to various portions of commonly employed enteral access tubes.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against clinical isolates of Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. tested by Etest.
AB  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of everninomicin, a novel oligosaccharide antibiotic, was tested against clinical isolates of 11 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strains, 11 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains, 22 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, 23 Enterococcus faecalis strains, 23 Enterococcus faecium strains, 23 Enterococcus avium strains, 27 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, 22 Streptococcus pyogenes strains, and 20 Streptococcus agalactiae strains. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of everninomicin were determined by Etest and compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and minocycline. The Etest showed that everninomicin exhibited excellent activity (MIC, <0.016 to 1.5 microg/ml) against the gram-positive cocci tested. The antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against S. aureus and S. epidermidis was stronger than that of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and minocycline, in particular against MRSA, with an MIC50 of 0.38 microg/ml and an MIC90 of 0.5 microg/ml. Against strains of enterococci and streptococci, everninomicin was more active than vancomycin, but as active as teicoplanin.
TI  - Microbial killing activity of peracetic acid.
AB  - In vitro killing activity of peracetic acid (Perasafe) at a concentration of 0.26 per cent w/v was tested against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi A, Acinetobacter baumannii, Sternotrophomonas maltophilia, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Bacillus subtilis spore, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and human immuno-deficiency virus type I. Exposure to Peracetic acid (0.26% w/v) for 10 minutes resulted in massive killing of all the aforementioned organisms and spore.
TI  - In vitro activity of cephalosporin RWJ-54428 (MC-02479) against multidrug-resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - RWJ-54428 (MC-02479) is a novel cephalosporin that binds to penicillin-binding protein (PBP) PBP 2' (PBP 2a) of methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Its in vitro activity was assessed against 472 gram-positive cocci, largely selected as epidemiologically unrelated isolates with multidrug resistance. The MIC at which 50% of isolates are inhibited (MIC(50)) and MIC(90) of RWJ-54428 for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were 1 and 2 microg/ml, respectively, whereas they were 0.5 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) were 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively, for methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS), whereas they were 0.25 and 1 microg/ml, respectively, for methicillin-susceptible isolates. The highest MICs for MRSA and MRCoNS isolates were 2 and 4 microg/ml, respectively. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) of RWJ-54428 for Enterococcus faecalis were 0.5 and 1 microg/ml, respectively, but they were 4 and 8 microg/ml, respectively, for Enterococcus faecium. For penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate, and -resistant pneumococci, the MIC(90)s of RWJ-54428 were 0.03, 0.25, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, with the highest MIC for a pneumococcus being 1 microg/ml, recorded for a strain for which penicillin and cefotaxime MICs were 8 and 4 microg/ml. MICs for Lancefield group A, B, C, and G streptococci were < or =0.008 microg/ml; those for viridans group streptococci, including isolates not susceptible to penicillin, were from 0.015 to 0.5 microg/ml. RWJ-54428 did not select resistant mutants of MRSA or enterococci in challenge experiments and has the potential to be useful for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Assessment of BMS284756 MIC and 5-microg disk diffusion quality control studies tested against seven American type culture collection strains.
AB  - BMS284756 is a novel des-fluoro(6)-quinolone with antimicrobial activity similar  to recently developed fluorinated quinolones. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the appropriate disk diffusion and MIC quality control (QC) ranges for BMS284756 when used against commonly tested QC strains (M23-A2). The BMS284756 5-microg disk content was tested against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Hemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. In addition, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and S. aureus ATCC 29213 were evaluated by the broth microdilution method. Seven laboratories tested 2 disk lots on 3 agar media or 3-4 broth lots over a 10 day period. A total of 420 zone diameter values and 210 or 280 MIC values per organism were generated. The following disk diffusion and MIC QC ranges were suggested for BMS284756 and the seven QC strains: E. coli ATCC 25922 (28-35 mm/0.004-0.016 microg/mL), E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (0.03-0.25 microg/mL), S. aureus ATCC 25923 (30-36 mm), S. aureus ATCC 29213 (0.004-0.016 microg/mL), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (19-25 mm/0.5-2 microg/mL), H. influenzae ATCC 49247 (33-41 mm/0.002-0.008 microg/mL), S. pneumoniae ATCC (26-33 mm/0.016-0.06 microg/mL). The proportion of participant results observed within the proposed ranges was 97.4-98.8% and 94.6-100% for the disk diffusion and MIC tests, respectively.
TI  - Two methods to evaluate the antimicrobial action of calcium hydroxide paste.
AB  - The objective of this study was to analyze two methods for determining the antimicrobial effectiveness of (i) calcium hydroxide plus saline, (ii) calcium hydroxide plus polyethylene glycol, and (iii) calcium hydroxide plus camphorated paramonochlorophenol. Four microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), and Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6633)), one yeast (Candida albicans (ICB/USP-562)), and one mixture of these organisms were used. The strains were inoculated in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Two methods, the direct exposure test and the agar diffusion test were used to evaluate antimicrobial effects. For the direct exposure test (DET) 288 paper points were contaminated with the standard microbial suspensions and exposed to the intracanal dressings for 1, 24, 48, and 72 h. The points were immersed in Letheen Broth, followed by incubation at 37 degrees C for 48 h. An inoculum of 0.1 ml obtained from Letheen Broth was then transferred to 7 ml of BHI under identical incubation conditions, and microbial growth was evaluated. Pastes showed activity between 1 and 72 h, depending on the microorganism/mixture tested. For the agar diffusion test 36 Petri plates with 20 ml of BHI agar were inoculated with 0.1 ml of the same microbial suspension used for the DET, using sterile swabs that were spread on the medium. Five cavities were made in each of two agar plates (total = 10) and completely filled with one of the calcium hydroxide pastes. The plates were preincubated for 1 h at environmental temperature and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 to 48 h. The inhibition zone around each well was recorded in millimeters, and the results were submitted to ANOVA and Tukey test (alpha = 0.05). All intracanal dressings induced inhibition zones (range 5.0-10.0 mm). Data obtained showed that both the DET and agar diffusion test are useful in establishing the calcium hydroxide antimicrobial spectrum, thus improving infection control protocols. The direct exposure method is independent of other variables and is a practical laboratory procedure. A complete antimicrobial effect was observed after 48 h on indicator microorganisms, in both tests, irrespective of the calcium hydroxide paste vehicle.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a castor oil-based irrigant.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of irrigating solutions--Endoquil (castor oil detergent), 2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution, and 0.5% NaOCl solution-was evaluated against gram-positive cocci (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sobrinus), gram-negative rods (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and the yeast Candida albicans. Activity was evaluated using the two-layer agar diffusion technique. The base layer was obtained by pouring 10.0 ml of Muller Hinton Medium or 10.0 ml of Brain Heart Infusion agar in a Petri dish. After solidification a 5.0 ml seed layer of Muller Hinton Medium or Brain Heart Infusion agar with inoculum (106/ml) was added. Absorbent paper disks (6.0 mm in diameter) immersed in the solutions were placed at equidistant points. Plates were maintained at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion of the solutions and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The candle jar system was used for the Brain Heart Infusion agar plates. All tests were performed in duplicate. After incubation the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% triphenyltetrazolium chlorate gel and inhibition halos were measured. All bacterial strains were inhibited by 2.0% chlorhexidine gluconate. Endoquil was effective against gram-positive microorganisms, and 0.5% NaOCl was effective only against S. aureus.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1998 and March 1999].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from April 1998 to March 1999). The number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. A total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). In primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and Escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of Gram-positive aerobes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. On the whole, among Gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by Staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from postoperative infections. Among Gram-positive anaerobes, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. Among Gram-negative aerobes, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. Among Gram-negative anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. In primary infections, the percentage of Gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobes have gradually declined. In postoperative infections, the percentage of Gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. The percentage of MRSA among S. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. The susceptibilities of B. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. Among other bacteria in B. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. E. coli and K. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. We found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of S. aureus and Enterococcus spp.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of new diazoimidazole derivatives containing an N-acylpyrrolidine ring.
AB  - A series of 4-diazoimidazole-5-carboxamides bearing in position 2 lipophilic substituents was synthesized and their antimicrobial activity was evaluated in vitro against pathogenic Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Some compounds presented antifungal activity, particularly two derivatives (1g and 1h) showed good MIC values (10-50 microg/ml) against both moulds and yeasts.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin with ciprofloxacin and beta-lactams against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Gatifloxacin is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone. The in-vitro antibacterial activity of gatifloxacin was compared to that of ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid against 165 streptococcal isolates, 369 staphylococcal isolates, and 50 enterococcal isolates recently recovered from clinical isolates. Gatifloxacin was the most active agent tested against streptococci including penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0.5 microg/mL). Imipenem and gatifloxacin (MIC(90) 0.5 microg/mL) were the most active agents tested against viridans group streptococci. All the agents demonstrated excellent activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. Imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and gatifloxacin had good activity against methicillin-sensitive S. epidermidis. Among the methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci tested, gatifloxacin was the most active agent. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and gatifloxacin were the most active agents against E. faecalis. Thus, gatifloxacin possesses equal or superior activity when compared to ciprofloxacin and beta-lactams making it a promising new fluoroquinolone for clinical use in treating Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Sequence of the 50-kb conjugative multiresistance plasmid pRE25 from Enterococcus faecalis RE25.
AB  - The complete 50,237-bp DNA sequence of the conjugative and mobilizing multiresistance plasmid pRE25 from Enterococcus faecalis RE25 was determined. The plasmid had 58 putative open reading frames, 5 of which encode resistance to 12 antimicrobials. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and the 23S RNA methylase are identical to gene products of the broad-host-range plasmid pIP501 from Streptococcus agalactiae. In addition, a 30.5-kb segment is almost identical to pIP501. Genes encoding an aminoglycoside 6-adenylyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyltransferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase are arranged in tandem on a 7.4-kb fragment as previously reported in Tn5405 from Staphylococcus aureus and in pJH1 from E. faecalis. One interrupted and five complete IS elements as well as three replication genes were also identified. pRE25 was transferred by conjugation to E. faecalis, Listeria innocua, and Lactococcus lactis by means of a transfer region that appears similar to that of pIP501. It is concluded that pRE25 may contribute to the further spread of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms via food into the human community.
TI  - Frequency of isolation and antimicrobial resistance of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria from patients in intensive care units of 25 European university hospitals participating in the European arm of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program 1997-1998.
AB  - A total of 3,981 isolates from patients treated at intensive care units were collected in 25 European university hospitals during 1997 and 1998 as part of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. Overall, the most important species isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. Thirty-nine percent of all Staphylococcus aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. All Staphylococcus aureus isolates were fully susceptible to linezolid and vancomycin. Moreover, all CNS isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and minocycline. All Enterococcus faecalis isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, and 99% of these isolates were also susceptible to ampicillin. The antimicrobial agents most effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, and cefepime, with 87, 85, 84, and 83% of isolates being susceptible, respectively. Escherichia coli isolates were fully susceptible to carbapenems, and at least 99% of these isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefepime, and amikacin. The Enterobacter spp. were also highly susceptible to carbapenems, amikacin, and cefepime, with 99, 97, and 96% of isolates being susceptible, respectively. Haemophilus influenzae was susceptible to most of the antibiotics tested. Only 68% of the pneumococcal isolates were fully susceptible to penicillin, yet 100% were susceptible to a number of fluoroquinolones and vancomycin. There are still sufficient treatment options for patients infected with the most important bacterial species involved in infections in intensive care units. However, the situation for patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections is critical.
TI  - Urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of gemifloxacin and ofloxacin after a single oral dose in healthy volunteers.
AB  - In a randomized crossover study, 16 volunteers (8 men, 8 women) received single oral doses of 320 mg of gemifloxacin and 400 mg of ofloxacin on two separate occasions in the fasting state to assess the urinary excretion and urinary bactericidal titers (UBTs) at intervals for up to 144 h. Ofloxacin showed higher concentrations in urine compared with those of gemifloxacin. The median (range) cumulative excretion of gemifloxacin was 29.7% (8.4 to 48.7%) of the parent drug administered, and median (range) cumulative excretion of ofloxacin was 84.3% (46.5 to 95.2%) of the parent drug administered. The UBTs, i.e., the highest twofold dilutions (with antibiotic-free urine as the diluent) of urine that were still bactericidal, were determined for a reference strain and nine uropathogens for which the MICs of gemifloxacin and ofloxacin were as follows: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 0.016 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.03 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively; Proteus mirabilis, 0.125 and 0.125 microg/ml, respectively; Escherichia coli, 0.06 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; Staphylococcus aureus, 0.008 and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively; Enterococcus faecalis, 0.06 and 2 microg/ml, respectively; Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; Enterococcus faecalis, 0.5 and 32 microg/ml, respectively; and Staphylococcus aureus, 2 and 32 microg/ml, respectively. Generally, the UBTs for gram-positive uropathogens were higher for gemifloxacin than for ofloxacin and the UBTs for gram-negative uropathogens were higher for ofloxacin than for gemifloxacin. According to the UBTs, ofloxacin-resistant uropathogens (MICs, >or=4 mg/liter) should also be considered gemifloxacin resistant. Although clinical trials have shown that gemifloxacin is effective for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, whether an oral dosage of 320 mg of gemifloxacin once daily is also adequate for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections has yet to be confirmed.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of acylides (3-O-acyl-erythromycin derivatives): a novel class of macrolide antibiotics.
AB  - Introduction of an acyl group to the 3-O-position of erythromycin A derivatives instead of L-cladinose led to a novel class of macrolide antibiotics that we named "acylides". The 3-O-nitrophenylacetyl derivative TEA0777 showed significantly potent activity against not only erythromycin-susceptible Gram-positive pathogens but also inducibly macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin B (MLS(B))-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and efflux-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. These results indicated that acylides have potential as next-generation macrolide antibiotics.
TI  - Comparative study of new benzenesulphonamide fluoroquinolones structurally related to ciprofloxacin against selected ciprofloxacin-susceptible and -resistant Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The in vitro activities of benzenesulphonamide fluoroquinolones (BSFQs) I-III, new fluoroquinolones with a p-substituted benzenesulphonyl moiety attached to the C(7) piperazinyl ring of ciprofloxacin, were assessed in comparison with those of N-sulfanilylpiperazinyl fluoroquinolone (NSFQ)-105 and ciprofloxacin for 133 Gram-positive clinical isolates. NSFQ-105 and BSFQ-I were the most active drugs. They were 16- to 64-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, including ciprofloxacin-resistant strains, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (eight- to 32-fold). A high degree of correlation was found between the MICs of the new compounds and ciprofloxacin for Staphylococcus spp. and E. faecalis. Staphylococci and enterococci exhibit cross-resistance to BSFQs and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem and 11 other antimicrobial agents against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from skin and soft tissue animal and human bite wound infections.
AB  - We studied the comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem, a new carbapenem, against 240 aerobic and 180 anaerobic recent clinical bite isolates using an agar dilution method and an inoculum of 10(4) cfu/spot for aerobes and 10(5) cfu/spot for anaerobes. Ertapenem inhibited 410/420 (98%) of the isolates tested at < or = 4 mg/L with only 4/5 Campylobacter gracilis and 1/3 Campylobacter rectus strains requiring . or = 16 mg/L for inhibition. Ertapenem was only moderately active (MIC 8 mg/L) against 4/6 Enterococcus faecalis and 1/11 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. All Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella septica, Pasteurella canis, Pasteurella dagmatis, Moraxella spp. and EF-4 isolates were inhibited at < or = 0.015 mg/L. MIC(90)s for other aerobic genera and species were as follows: Corynebacterium spp., 4 mg/L; Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 mg/L; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 4 mg/L; other coagulasenegative staphylococci, 0.25 mg/L; Streptococcus milleri group, 0.5 mg/L; Eikenella corrodens, 0.03 mg/L; and Bergeyella zoohelcum, 0.5 mg/L. For anaerobes the range of MICs and MIC(90)s were: Prevotella ssp., < or = 0.015-0.5, 0.125 mg/L; Porphyromonas spp., < or = 0.015-0.03, 0.015 mg/L; Fusobacterium spp., 0.015-0.125, 0.03 mg/L; Bacteroides tectum, 0.03-0.125, 0.125 mg/L; and Peptostreptococcus spp., 0.01-2, 1 mg/L. Ertapenem showed excellent potency against the full range of animal and human bite wound pathogens.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid against Gram-positive uropathogens of hospitalized patients with complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of linezolid, a recently developed antibiotic agent active against Gram-positive bacteria, was tested against pathogens from three different collections. (1) Uropathogens from hospitalized urological patients (1990/1991) with complicated and/or hospital-acquired UTIs; Urologic Clinic, Hospital St. Elisabeth, Straubing. (2) Uropathogens from a multi-centre study (1995/1996) comprising 37 urological centres throughout Germany. (3) MRSA isolates of patients and staff (1999/2000) within the Hospital St. Elisabeth, Straubing. Genotyping of the latter isolates was performed by pulsed-field-electrophoresis. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of linezolid determined by an agar (Isosensitest) dilution method using a multipoint inoculator and an inoculum of 10(4) cfu per point ranged for methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (n=27) between 2 and 4 mg/l, for methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (n=35) between 1 and 2 mg/l, for methicillin susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (MSSE) (n=67) between 0.5 and 4 mg/l, for methicillin resistant CNS (MRSE) (n=19) between 0.25 and 2 mg/l, for Enterococcus. faecalis (n=184) between 0.5 and 4 mg/l, for E. faecium (n=3) 2 mg/l and for Streptococcus spp. (n=4) between 0.25 and 1 mg/l, indicating that all strains were susceptible. According to the in vitro activity, linezolid may be considered a promising antibacterial agent for the treatment of complicated UTI caused by Gram-positive uropathogens. Thus, linezolid should be evaluated in a clinical study.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  - Isolates from urine samples obtained during 1999 were identified and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents studied along with any production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) by Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. A total of 13774 samples were analysed using an automatic system for the detection of bacterial ATP (Coral, USA). Of these samples, 49% were reported to be positive and uncontaminated; bacteria most frequently isolated were E. coli (47%), Proteus mirabilis (7%), Enterococcus faecalis (6%) and K. pneumoniae (5%). The susceptibility studies showed 37% E. coli strains resistant to amoxycillin+clavulanate 33% to cotrimoxazole and 22% to ciprofloxacin. Seven strains of E. coli produced ESBL. Thirteen per cent of strains were resistant to cefuroxime but only (1%) to fosfomycin. Resistance to nitrofurantoin in K. pneumoniae was 38%. P. mirabilis showed 52% resistance to cotrimoxazole and 13% Staphylococcus aureus, were methicillin-resistant. E. faecalis did not show any special resistance to normal medication. Fosfomycin continued to show high activity against Gram-negative bacilli. However, enterococci, some species of staphylococci and yeasts were difficult to treat empirically. ESBL were detected in the isolates of E. coli and there were some methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. A total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the National Taiwan University Hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. Most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. For many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. Some strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. Moxifloxacin was less active against P. aeruginosa, but was more active against S. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. In conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. The drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in Taiwan.
TI  - [Utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  - The value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the Fundacion Favaloro, the Fundacion para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurologicas de la Infancia and the Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez. A total of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). Bact-Alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees C for 30 days in the Bact-Alert System. Bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were Gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and Sabouraud agar. A total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. The positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. Only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). The median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. The microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), Escherichia coli (n = 18), Acinetobacter spp (n = 9), Candida spp (n = 8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella spp and Capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Citrobacter diversus, Candida albicans, Klebsiella oxytoca, Chryseomonas luteola, Serratia marcescens, Abiotrophia spp, Campylobacter jejuni, Moraxella catarrhalis, Moraxella urethralis, Neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group G streptococci, Rhodococcus equi, Micrococcus spp, Cryptococcus neoformans and Streptococcus mitis (n = 1). In our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.
TI  - The enterococcal surface protein, Esp, is involved in Enterococcus faecalis biofilm formation.
AB  - The enterococcal surface protein, Esp, is a high-molecular-weight surface protein of unknown function whose frequency is significantly increased among infection-derived Enterococcus faecalis isolates. In this work, a global structural similarity was found between Bap, a biofilm-associated protein of Staphylococcus aureus, and Esp. Analysis of the relationship between the presence of the Esp-encoding gene (esp) and the biofilm formation capacity in E. faecalis demonstrated that the presence of the esp gene is highly associated (P < 0.0001) with the capacity of E. faecalis to form a biofilm on a polystyrene surface, since 93.5% of the E. faecalis esp-positive isolates were capable of forming a biofilm. Moreover, none of the E. faecalis esp-deficient isolates were biofilm producers. Depending on the E. faecalis isolate, insertional mutagenesis of esp caused either a complete loss of the biofilm formation phenotype or no apparent phenotypic defect. Complementation studies revealed that Esp expression in an E. faecalis esp-deficient strain promoted primary attachment and biofilm formation on polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride plastic from urine collection bags. Together, these results demonstrate that (i) biofilm formation capacity is widespread among clinical E. faecalis isolates, (ii) the biofilm formation capacity is restricted to the E. faecalis strains harboring esp, and (iii) Esp promotes primary attachment and biofilm formation of E. faecalis on abiotic surfaces.
TI  - Bioactive compounds from Iostephane heterophylla (Asteraceae).
AB  - The novel bisabolene sesquiterpenes 3-6, were isolated from Iostephane heterophylla, using bioguided fractionation. The new compounds were determined to be (12R/12S)-12,13-epoxy-xanthorrhizols (3,4) and (12R/12S)-12,13-dihydro-12,13-dihydroxy-xanthorrizols (5,6) and their structures were characterized by analysis of spectroscopic data and by chemical correlation from xanthorrhizol (2). The stereochemistry at C-12 of 5 was deduced using the modified Mosher experiment. Some of the isolated compounds elicited activity against gram positive and gram negative bacteria, levadura and dermatophytes.
TI  - Comparison of the methylene blue and toluidine blue photobactericidal efficacy against gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Studies on the photobactericidal efficacy of methylene  blue (MB) and toluidine blue (TB) have shown inconsistent results in the literature. This study evaluated the bactericidal efficacy of MB and TB against different bacteria under light and dark conditions to determine the most effective bactericidal dye. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in saline were treated in dark and red laser light conditions in the presence of each dye using an argon pumped-dye and a diode laser emitting light at 630 and 664 nm, respectively. The effect of dye concentration, dark incubation time, the fluence and intensity of laser light on the destruction of different bacteria were compared. RESULTS: Both dyes eradicated all examined bacteria under laser light. The complete photodestruction of microorganisms was reached at TB concentrations of 1.5-7-fold less than that of MB. CONCLUSION: TB exhibits a greater bactericidal activity than MB against most bacteria in dark and light conditions. Mostly, these results are consistent with their respective dye partition coefficients.
TI  - A simple model host for identifying Gram-positive virulence factors.
AB  - We demonstrate the use of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a facile and inexpensive model host for several Gram-positive human bacterial pathogens. Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus, but not Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecium, or Streptococcus pyogenes, kill adult C. elegans. Focusing our studies on the enterococcal species, we found that both E. faecalis and E. faecium kill C. elegans eggs and hatchlings, although only E. faecalis kills the adults. In the case of adults, a low inoculum of E. faecalis grows to a high titer in the C. elegans intestine, resulting in a persistent infection that cannot be eradicated by prolonged feeding on E. faecium. Interestingly, a high titer of E. faecium also accumulates in the nematode gut, but does not affect the longevity of the worms. Two E. faecalis virulence-related factors that play an important role in mammalian models of infection, fsr, a putative quorum-sensing system, and cytolysin, are also important for nematode killing. We exploit the apparent parallels between Gram-positive infection in simple and more complex organisms by using the nematode to identify an E. faecalis virulence factor, ScrB, which is relevant to mammalian pathogenesis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of traditional Australian medicinal plants.
AB  - Fifty-six ethanolic extracts of various parts of 39 plants used in traditional Australian Aboriginal medicine were investigated for their antibacterial activities against four Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes) and four Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) bacterial species. In a plate-hole diffusion assay, 12 extracts inhibited the growth of one or more of the bacteria, with five extracts showing broad spectrum antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. B. cereus was the most susceptible bacterium, with all 12 extracts displaying activity against this organism. Extracts from the leaves of Eremophila species (Myoporaceae) were the most active, with Eremophila duttonii exhibiting the greatest activity (against Gram-positive bacteria). The antibacterial effects of E. duttonii were further investigated by time-course growth assays which showed that significant growth inhibition was observed in cultures incubated in the presence of the extract within 1 h for B. cereus, E. faecalis and S. aureus and 2 h for S. pyogenes.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1999). III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - The bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 9 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of August 1999 to July 2000. Then, the susceptibilities of these bacteria to various antimicrobial agents were examined and the results were compared with those obtained between 1991 and 1998. Comparison was made by classifying strains isolated from patients into those with uncomplicated UTIs and those with complicated UTIs (including with or without indwelling catheter). About E. faecalis, increase of low sensitive strains noted in the former year showed a decreasing tendency, however, one strain each with MIC of 4 micrograms/ml to vancomycin (VCM) was detected in patients with both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs. As for S. aureus, many sensitive strains to cephems, imipenem (IPM) and VCM were noted, and each MIC50 was better than that in the former years. S. aureus strains showing low susceptibility to arbekacin (ABK) were detected in patients with complicated UTIs in this year as well as in the former year, and one strain each with MIC of 16 micrograms/ml and 32 micrograms/ml was detected. Susceptibilities of E. coli were effective to all drugs except for penicillins and minocycline (MINO). Decrease of low sensitive strains was also noted in all drugs except for quinolones. Each MIC90 of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and sparfloxacin (SPFX) in patients with complicated UTIs against E. coli was 3 degrees classes lower than that in patients with uncomplicated UTIs. As for Klebsiella pneumoniae, decrease of low sensitive strains to cephems was noted in patients with uncomplicated UTIs in 1998. In 1999, low sensitive strains decreased also in patients with complicated UTIs, and few were detected. Susceptibilities of K. pneumoniae to quinolones were effective as compared with those in the former years with the MIC80s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below without detection of low sensitive strains. One low sensitive strain of K. pneumoniae with MIC of 8 micrograms/ml was detected for gentamicin (GM). Susceptibilities of P. aeruginosa to carbapenems were notable. The MIC90 of meropenem (MEPM) and IPM was 4 micrograms/ml each which was 2 degrees better than that in 1998. Resistant P. aeruginosa strains to other drugs except for monobactams decreased in 1999.
TI  - Selective cleavage of D-Ala-D-Lac by small molecules: re-sensitizing resistant bacteria to vancomycin.
AB  - Pathogenic enterococci are becoming resistant to currently available antibiotics, including vancomycin, the drug of last resort for Gram-positive infections. Enterococci pose a significant public health threat, not least because of the risk of transferring vancomycin resistance to the ubiquitous Staphylococcus aureus. Vancomycin resistance is manifested by cell wall peptidoglycan precursors with altered termini that cannot bind the antibiotic. Small molecules with well-oriented nucleophile-electrophile assembly and complementary chirality to the peptidoglycan termini were identified as catalytic and selective cleavers of the peptidoglycan precursor depsipeptide. These molecules were tested in combination with vancomycin and were found to re-sensitize vancomycin-resistant bacteria to the antibiotic.
TI  - Multi-resistance to antimicrobial agents for the ten most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Cross-resistance and multi-resistance to selected antibiotics was determined for  Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Amikacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae often showed cross-resistance to ss-lactam antibiotics. Only 1% of the Escherichia coli isolates showed resistance to more than four antibiotics from a set of seven. This rate was higher for other Enterobacteriaceae and there were high levels of cross-resistance for P. aeruginosa. The cross-resistance of oxacillin with other antibiotics is well known in staphylococci. Penicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates were cross-resistant to macrolides. Cross-resistance was only a minor problem in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Cross- and multi-resistance are important problems for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria but not for fastidious bacteria with the exception of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1999). II. Background of patients].
AB  - Five-hundred forty four bacterial strains isolated from 412 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 9 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of August 1999 to July 2000. Then, the clinical background of patients were investigated such as sex, age and type of infections, infections and kind of bacteria, frequency of isolation of bacteria by age and infections, bacteria and infections by timing of administration of antibiotics, and bacteria and infections by surgical procedures. About the relationship between age and sex of patients and type of infections, the number of male patients aged less than 50 years was few, and complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter was the most frequent. In females, the number of patients aged less than 20 years was few. Complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter was the most frequent among female patients aged between 40 to 59 years, in other age groups, uncomplicated UTIs was most frequent. As for type of infections and kind of bacteria, Escherichia coli decreased when the infections became complicated, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis increased when the infection became complicated. Considering this result by age of patients, isolation frequency of E. coli was gradually decreased with aging in patients aged more than 20 years with uncomplicated UTIs or complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter. The isolation frequencies of E. faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus were gradually increased with aging in complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter. In patients with complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter, there was no difference between age group, and P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis were frequently isolated. As for type of causative organisms in UTIs before and after the administration of antibiotics, the isolation of bacteria was remarkably decreased after administration in patients with uncomplicated UTIs and complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter. E. coli decreased after administration of antibiotics, and P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis increased after administration in patients with all infections. As for type of causative organisms in UTIs and surgical procedures, E. coli were more frequently isolated in patients with uncomplicated UTIs when surgical procedures were experienced. Also, Klebsiella spp. and E. faecalis were more frequently isolated in patients with surgical procedures. However, in complicated UTIs, type of causative organisms had no relationship with surgical procedures.
TI  - Conserved DegP protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The DegP protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Brucella abortus, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The function of DegP in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. Additionally, the DegP protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining the Escherichia coli periplasm and influences E. coli pilus biogenesis. We report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degP allele in S. pyogenes is similar to that reported for E. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. Virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional DegP protease is required for full virulence. These results suggest DegP as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.
TI  - [Profile of bacterial isolates and antimicrobial susceptibility: Multicenter study using a one-day cut-off].
AB  - The frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates from the largest clinical samples collected in 19 Spanish hospitals were studied. A total of 523 strains were identified and grouped by sample. Blood stream: Staphylococcus coagulase-negative (41%) and Escherichia coli (19.7%); oxacillin resistance occurred in 44% of coagulase-negative strains, strains which were also resistant to nonbetalactam agents. All antimicrobial agents tested had good activity against E. coli, with the exception of penicillins (25 to 33% susceptible). Urine: E. coli (59.1%) and Enterococcus faecalis (15%); aminoglycosides and third generation cephalosporins were the most active compounds against E. coli, whereas penicillins and cotrimoxazole were the least active. E. faecalis isolates showed low rates of resistance to the antibiotics tested and no glycopeptide-resistant strains were detected. Skin and soft tissues: Staphylococcus aureus (24.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.7.%); oxacillin resistance occurred in 15.8% of S. aureus strains and co-resistance to nonbetalactam agents was frequently observed among these strains. Ceftazidime susceptibility was elevated among P. aeruginosa (76.9%) and the most active agents were aminoglycosides (100% susceptibility). Lower respiratory tract: P. aeruginosa (21.4%) and Haemophilus influenzae (15.5%). Aminoglycosides (88.8 to 94.4%) and ceftazidime (72%) presented the highest susceptibility rates in P. aeruginosa. All the agents tested were very active against H. influenzae (89% susceptibility). Among Gram-positive cocci, no vancomycin and/or teicoplanin-resistant strains were detected.
TI  - Identification of the UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide:L-alanine ligase for synthesis of branched peptidoglycan precursors in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Many species of gram-positive bacteria produce branched peptidoglycan precursors  resulting from the transfer of various L-amino acids or glycine from amino acyl-tRNA to the epsilon-amino group of L-lysine. The UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide:L-alanine ligase and alanyl-tRNA synthetase genes from Enterococcus faecalis were identified, cloned, and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The purified enzymes were necessary and sufficient for tRNA-dependent addition of L-alanine to UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide in vitro. The ligase belonged to the Fem family of proteins, which were initially identified genetically as factors essential for methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Dental unit waterlines: review and product evaluation.
AB  - Dental practitioners must be knowledgeable regarding microbial contamination and  biofilm formation in dental unit waterlines. Education should stress the need for improvement in the quality of water delivered to patients during treatment. Manufacturers must also play an important role by providing training and education regarding the proper use and maintenance of their systems. Dental facilities, both public and private, need reliable methods to prevent the development of biofilms within DUWs. These methods must be economical and require minimal effort to use on the part of the dental staff. In order for the system to work efficiently, the effluent water that is produced must be compatible with dental materials and be potentially free from toxic or carcinogenic materials. There are numerous models of water filtration units and chemical flushes available to the dental practitioner. However, the Food and Drug Administration have not approved all products currently on the market. Our evaluation of Zerosil, a new waterline-cleaning product, indicates that it is very easy to use and is extremely effective in killing the commonly found microorganisms in dental unit waterlines, as well as eliminating existing biofilms. It is also economical and requires minimum staff time to keep the waterlines clean. Following the initial treatments during week one, the water emanating from the DUWs was free from any viable microorganisms. This effect was present the entire three weeks in which the waterlines were treated. The elimination of viable microorganisms continued into a fourth study week, even though no further treatment of the DUWs was performed. Although the manufacturer recommends weekly treatment of DUWs following the initial treatment regimen, this result indicates that the product has a longer lasting effect than previously thought. Finally, the product can be delivered through any of the commercially available reservoir/bottle water delivery systems. From our study, Zerosil appears to meet the demanding requirements of keeping dental unit waterlines clean. Based on the research that has been done thus far, no universal treatment protocol can be recommended. A combination of approaches may offer the best available assurance of high-quality dental treatment water. Independent water reservoir systems, when used with a periodic chemical treatment protocol, have demonstrated safety and efficacy. Until we reach a point when a recommendation based on thorough evaluations can be made, dental offices should follow current ADA, OSAP, and CDC guidelines: flush waterlines for two to three minutes at the beginning of each day and for 20 to 30 seconds between each patient, and anti-retraction valves should be installed to prevent oral fluids from being drawn into dental waterlines. It is expected that in the near future, the dental practitioner will have a choice of proven systems and products to deal with this issue. Until that time, one should carefully evaluate any product or system being considered to prevent the formation of biofilms in DUWs.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of leaf essential oils and their constituents from Cinnamomum osmophloeum.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of the essential oils from leaves of two Cinnamomum  osmophloeum clones (A and B) and their chemical constituents were investigated in this study. The nine strains of bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella sp., and Vibrio parahemolyticus, were used in the antibacterial tests. Results from the antibacterial tests demonstrated that the indigenous cinnamon B leaf essential oils had an excellent inhibitory effect. The MICs (minimum inhibitory concentrations) of the B leaf oil were 500 microg/ml against both K. pneumoniae and Salmonella sp. and 250 microg/ml against the other seven strains of bacteria. Cinnamaldehyde possessed the strongest antibacterial activity compared to the other constituents of the essential oils. The MICs of cinnamaldehyde against the E. coli, P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, MRSA, K. pneumoniae, Salmonella sp., and V. parahemolyticus were 500, 1000, 250, 250, 250, 250, 1000, 500, and 250 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that C. osmophloeum leaf essential oil and cinnamaldehyde are beneficial to human health, having the potential to be used for medical purposes and to be utilized as anti-bacterial additives in making paper products.
TI  - Control of microorganisms in vitro by calcium hydroxide pastes.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the influence of vehicles on the antimicrobial efficiency of calcium hydroxide. METHODOLOGY: A total of 588 size 50 sterile absorbent paper points, were immersed in various microbial suspensions for 3 min. The points were then placed on Petri dishes and covered with intracanal dressings containing calcium hydroxide: Ca(OH)2 + saline; Ca(OH)2 + camphorated paramonochlorophenol; Ca(OH)2 + 1% chlorhexidine solution: Ca(OH)2 + 3% sodium lauryl sulphate; Ca(OH)2 + Otosporin. After 1 min, 48 and 72 h and 7 days, 147 absorbent paper cones were removed from contact with the intracanal dressings and individually transported and immersed in 5 mL of Letheen Broth, followed by incubation at 37 degrees C for 48 h. Microbial growth was evaluated by turbidity of the culture medium. A 0.1-mL inoculum obtained from the Letheen Broth was transferred to 5 mL of BHI, and incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h. Bacterial growth was again evaluated by turbidity of the culture medium. Positive BHI tubes were selected and inocula were spread on the surface of BHI agar and incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h. Gram staining of the BHI growth and from colonies growing on BHI agar was carried out. RESULTS: An antimicrobial effect occurred after 48 h on the cultures of S. mutans, E. faecalis, S. aureus, P aeruginosa, B. subtilis, C. albicans and a mixed culture, irrespective of the intracanal dressing. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this study, the various vehicles associated with calcium hydroxide pastes did not influence the time required for microbial inactivation.
TI  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates. MICs were determined by an agar dilution method on Mueller-Hinton agar (NCCLS/EUCAST) and on Isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/L free calcium (BSAC). Both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. Daptomycin MICs for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/L. For 99 of the 100 enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; Enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/L. For all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin MICs were 0.016- 0.25 mg/L; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/L. For miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc spp., Pediococcus spp. and isolates of Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin MICs were 0.03-2 mg/L; MICs for the seven isolates of Listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/L. There was little difference between the results on Mueller-Hinton agar and on supplemented Isotonic agar The discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented Isotonic agar. Daptomycin was active (MICs < or = 2 mg/L) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of E. faecium and L. monocytogenes (MICs = 4 mg/L). Our results indicate that daptomycin MICs are independent of methicillin and vancomycin MICs.
TI  - Etiologies of the urinary tract infections in a Yemeni City.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the causative agents of urinary tract infection in Yemeni patients in Sana'a city, and to determine the antibiotic susceptibilities of these agents in vitro. METHODS: Consecutive mid-stream urine specimens were submitted to our laboratory by 4029 patients in Sana'a city from 1990 to the end of 1999. The specimens were cultured and the isolates were identified using standard microbiological techniques. The antibiotic susceptibilities of the isolates were also determined (in vitro). RESULTS: The number of patients with urinary tract infection who yielded positive cultures from their mid stream urine specimens was 685 out of 4029 patients (17%). The ratio of female-to-male patients was 462:223 (2.07:1). The causative agents were mainly members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, 579 out of the 685 isolates (84.5%). Escherichia coli was the main pathogen, 357 isolates out of all the isolates (52%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, 143 isolates (21%) and Proteus species, 56 isolates (8%). The other pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Corynebacterium urealyticum and Enterococcus faecalis) constituted 129 out of the 685 isolates (19%). There was a shift in the types of the causative agents of urinary tract infection between the first and 2nd halves of the study period. The isolation of Escherichia coli decreased from 60% in the first half to 42% in the 2nd. Whereas Klebsiella pneumoniae increased from 16% in the first half to 27% in the 2nd, Proteus species from 8% to 9%, Staphylococcus aureus from 5% to 7%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa from 3% to 7%, Enterobacter aerogenes from 3% to 3.5%, Staphylococcus saprophyticus from 2% to 3% and Corynebacterium urealyticum from 1% to 2%. Ninety percent of all the urinary pathogens were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, 75% to nitrofurantoin, 57% to gentamicin, 46% to cefaclor, 46% to nalidixic acid, 39% to doxycycline, 37% to co-trimoxazole and 20% to ampiclox. CONCLUSION: The types of urinary tract pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibilities in addition to the rate of isolation from male and female patients are reported. It is recommended that ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin or both are used in the blind treatment of urinary tract infection while awaiting the culture and sensitivity results. It is also recommended to continuously monitor the pattern of urinary pathogens from the community to guide the blind treatment of patients in the future.
TI  - Identification of Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus by multivariate analysis of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic data from plate cultures.
AB  - A new fingerprinting technique with the potential for rapid identification of bacteria was developed by combining proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) with multivariate statistical analysis. This resulted in an objective identification strategy for common clinical isolates belonging to the bacterial species Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and the Streptococcus milleri group. Duplicate cultures of 104 different isolates were examined one or more times using (1)H MRS. A total of 312 cultures were examined. An optimized classifier was developed using a bootstrapping process and a seven-group linear discriminant analysis to provide objective classification of the spectra. Identification of isolates was based on consistent high-probability classification of spectra from duplicate cultures and achieved 92% agreement with conventional methods of identification. Fewer than 1% of isolates were identified incorrectly. Identification of the remaining 7% of isolates was defined as indeterminate.
TI  - Comparative killing kinetics of the novel des-fluoro(6) quinolone BMS-284756, fluoroquinolones, vancomycin and beta-lactams.
AB  - The primary bactericidal classes used therapeutically as single agents, are the quinolones and the cell-wall active agents. In this study, their rates of killing were compared. The des-fluoro(6) quinolone BMS-284756 (T-3811ME), fluoroquinolones (trovafloxacin, levofloxacin) and cell wall-active agents (beta-lactams, vancomycin) were evaluated against Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis. Time-kill analysis was done at 10x the MIC, using Mueller-Hinton broth (supplemented with 7% lysed horse blood for Streptococcus pneumoniae and the viridans streptococci), or Brain Heart Infusion broth for beta-haemolytic streptococci. Using a 3-log(10) decrease in viable count as an index of bactericidal activity, BMS-284756 and the fluoroquinolones killed Enterobacteriaceae rapidly, requiring < 2 h versus > or =6 h for beta-lactams. The staphylococcal cell counts generally decreased more rapidly with quinolone exposure, compared with those treated with vancomycin or the beta-lactams. The antimicrobial agents killed streptococci and enterococci more slowly, requiring > 6 h to decrease the viable count by 99.9%. In summary, BMS-284756 killing rates are similar to those of recent fluoroquinolones and are bacterial group-dependent. Overall, the quinolones are more rapidly bactericidal than vancomycin and the beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Multi-laboratory assessment of the linezolid spectrum of activity using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method: Report of the Zyvox Antimicrobial Potency Study (ZAPS) in the United States.
AB  - The in vitro activity of linezolid against common Gram-positive pathogens was compared to that of penicillin or ampicillin or oxacillin (depending upon genus), cefazolin, erythromycin, clindamycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, levofloxacin, nitrofurantoin and vancomycin by disk diffusion methods. One hundred and six centers (31 states in US) tested recent clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecium, E. faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other streptococci. Testing was conducted using the standardized disk diffusion method and concurrent quality control testing was performed. Strains with linezolid zone diameters of < or = 20 mm were requested for referral to the microbiology monitor for confirmation. A total of 3,100 isolates (97% compliance) were tested. Susceptibility (zone diameters, > or = 21 mm) of staphylococci and streptococci to linezolid was reported in 100% and 99.4% of staphylococci and streptococci, respectively. Susceptibility (zone diameters, > or = 23 mm) of enterococci to linezolid was 96.0% with only three isolates (0.4%) reported as resistant (zone diameters, < or = 20 mm; unconfirmed). Among a total of nine isolates (0.3%) reported to have zone diameters 20 mm, six were not submitted for further testing, two were contaminated with Gram-negative bacilli and one was determined to be linezolid-susceptible. There were no differences in linezolid susceptibility in the vancomycin- or oxacillin- or penicillin-resistant subsets of strains. This susceptibility pattern for US medical centers is indicative of the excellent and nearly complete in vitro activity against the key Gram-positive pathogens for which linezolid has received US Food and Drug Administration indications for clinical use.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Marula (Sclerocarya birrea (A. rich.) Hochst. subsp. caffra (Sond.) Kokwaro) (Anacardiaceae) bark and leaves.
AB  - Marula bark is widely used for bacteria-related diseases by indigenous cultures in Africa. This study was undertaken to investigate whether the ethnobotanical use can be validated by laboratory studies. Bark and leaves were extracted with acetone and MIC values were determined using a microplate serial dilution technique with Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis as test organisms. All extracts were active with MIC values from 0.15 to 3 mg/ml. Based on minimum inhibitory concentration values, inner bark extracts tended to be the most potent followed by outer bark and leaf extracts, but the differences were not statistically significant. There were two major bioactive components visible after bioautography of leaf extracts: one strongly polar and the other highly non-polar. The bioactive components could be separated from 92% of the non-active dry matter by solvent-solvent fractionation into the carbon tetrachloride, chloroform and n-butanol fractions; these fractions, however, still contained many different compounds. Using bark may be detrimental to the plant, but leaf material can also be used for antibacterial application.
TI  - Vancomycin resistance plasmid in Enterococcus faecalis that encodes sensitivity to a sex pheromone also produced by Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial evaluation of certain quinolone derivatives.
AB  - A number of 7-substituted quinolone derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial and cytotoxic activities. Preliminary results indicated that most compounds tested in this study demonstrated better activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus than norfloxacin. Among them, 1-(4-amino-2-fluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-7-[4-[2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-hydro xyiminoethyl]-1-piperazinyl]-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid (11d) and its ketone precursor 10d exhibited significant activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, erythromycin- and ampicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. Due to strong cytotoxicities of 11d (a mean log GI(50) of -5.40), compound 10d, with good antibacterial activities and low cytotoxicities (a mean log GI(50) of -4.67), is a more potential drug candidate.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial properties of N-substituted derivatives of (E)-4-azachalcones.
AB  - Syntheses of 11 new N-bromoalkyl substituted bromides of (E)-4-azachalcone and N-o-(m- and p-) halobenzyl substituted halides of (E)-3'-hydroxy-4-azachalcone of antimicrobial activity are reported. Compounds 3d, 3e, 6b, 6c, and 6e reveal good antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis as well as moderate activity against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Activity of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against urinary pathogens.
AB  - This study compares the antibacterial activities of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against recently isolated urinary tract pathogens, by evaluating their MICs and MBCs in accordance with NCCLS susceptibility tests, time-kill curves and interference with bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells. A total of 200 clinical isolates was tested, including the species Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. All E. coli isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin and only one was resistant to ciprofloxacin, and there were no differences between beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains. K. pneumoniae strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were also resistant to levofloxacin. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus seemed to be less susceptible than methicillin-susceptible strains to these quinolones. S. epidermidis strains were susceptible to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with the exception of two isolates. Incubation of S. aureus and E. coli with subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations reduced their capacity to adhere to uroepithelial cells; this was statistically significant at 0.25 x MIC with respect to controls (P < 0.05). Inhibition of adhesion ranged from 36 to 43% when bacteria were incubated in the presence of 0.25 x MIC of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and from 10 to 27% at 0.125 x MIC. These findings suggest that levofloxacin is an effective alternative to ciprofloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract infections and that sub-inhibitory concentrations may contribute to efficacy.
TI  - Synthesis of some benzimidazole derivatives and their antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  - A number of new benzimidazole derivatives were synthesized by the reaction of benzimidazole with appropriate alkyl halides. The compounds synthesized were intensified by 1H-NMR, Fourier Transformation Infrared (FT-IR) and micro analysis. All new and related compounds studied in this work were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard strains: Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and the yeasts Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis. Eleven of the compounds were found effective to inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (E. faecalis and S. aureus) at MIC values between 12.5-400 micrograms/ml. None of the compounds exhibited antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli and P. aeruginosa) at the concentrations studied (6.25-800 micrograms/ml). All compounds (except compound 3) were significantly effective against C. tropicalis with MIC values of 6.25-400 micrograms/ml. Eight of the tested compounds showed an antifungal activity against C. albicans with a range of the MICs between 50 and 400 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Characterization of selected strains of pneumococcal surface protein A.
AB  - Several proteins, in addition to the polysaccharide capsule, have recently been implicated in the full virulence of the Streptococcus pneumoniae bacterial pathogen. One of these novel virulence factors of S. pneumoniae is pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA). The N-terminal, cell surface exposed, and functional part of PspA is essential for full pneumococcal virulence, as evidenced by the fact that antibodies raised against this part of the protein are protective against pneumococcal infections. PspA has recently been implicated in anti-complementary function as it reduces complement-mediated clearance and phagocytosis of pneumococci. Several recombinant N-terminal fragments of PspA from different strains of pneumococci, Rx1, BG9739, BG6380, EF3296, and EF5668, were analyzed using circular dichroism, analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity and equilibrium methods, and sequence homology. Uniformly, all strains of PspA molecules studied have a high alpha-helical secondary structure content and they adopt predominantly a coiled-coil structure with an elongated, likely rod-like shape. No beta-sheet structures were detected for any of the PspA molecules analyzed. All PspAs were found to be monomeric in solution with the exception of the BG9739 strain which had the propensity to partially aggregate but only into a tetrameric form. These structural properties were correlated with the functional, anti-complementary properties of PspA molecules based on the polar distribution of highly charged termini of its coiled-coil domain. The recombinant Rx1 PspA is currently under consideration for pneumococcal vaccine development.
TI  - A new hydrogen peroxide--based medical-device detergent with germicidal properties: comparison with enzymatic cleaners.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the cleaning and bacterial killing ability of a new non-enzyme-based formulation (killing detergent solution [KDS]) compared with commercially available enzymatic detergents that included Metrizyme (Metrex Research Division of Sybron Canada Ltd. Morrisburg, Ontario) and Gzyme (Germiphene Corp, Brantford, Ontario). KDS is a hydrogen peroxide-based detergent formulation that combines cleaning efficacy with the ability to kill microorganisms. The KDS formulation helps ensure the protection of the health care worker from infectious risk during the soaking and cleaning stages of medical device reprocessing and reduces the bioburden on devices before sterilization/disinfection. METHODS: Test organisms that included Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella choleraesuis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were suspended in artificial test soil (ATS-B; patent submitted), inoculated at 10(6) colonyforming units per carrier and dried overnight before detergent exposure. The ATS-B mimics the blood, protein, carbohydrate, and endotoxin levels of patient-used medical devices. Plastic lumen carriers and a flexible colonoscope were used for surface and simulated-use testing, respectively. RESULTS: The results for the microbial challenge dried onto polyvinyl chloride (PVC) carriers demonstrated that the ability of KDS to remove protein, blood, carbohydrate, and endotoxin from surface test carriers was as effective as the enzyme detergents that were evaluated. Furthermore, KDS was able to effect approximately a 5-Log(10) reduction in microbial loads with a 3-minute exposure at room temperature, whereas none of the other detergents were as effective. In simulated-use testing of a soiled colonoscope, KDS was significantly better at ensuring microbial killing compared with Gzyme and Metrizyme and was equivalent to the enzymatic detergents in cleaning ability. CONCLUSIONS: In summary the KDS has excellent microbial-killing ability in 3-minute exposures at room temperature and cleans as well as the existing enzymatic detergent formulations that were tested.
TI  - Post-antibiotic growth suppression of linezolid against Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro post-antibiotic effects (PAEs) of eight different concentrations of  linezolid against Gram-positive cocci were investigated and the results analysed using the sigmoid E(max) model for mathematically modelling the PAE. Mean maximal linezolid PAEs against strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 2.2, 1.8, 2.8, 2.0 and 3.0 h, respectively. Resistance to methicillin (for the staphylococci), vancomycin (for the enterococci) and penicillin (for the pneumococci) had no effect on the duration of the PAE. Results of PAE testing support twice-daily dosing of linezolid in humans.
TI  - Identification of novel essential Escherichia coli genes conserved among pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - We deleted a subset of 27 open reading frames (ORFs) from Escherichia coli which  encode previously uncharacterized, probably soluble gene products homologous to proteins from a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis and only distantly related to eukaryotic proteins. Six novel bacteria-specific genes essential for growth in complex medium could be identified through a combination of bioinformatics-based and experimental approaches. We also compared our data to published results of gene inactivation projects with Mycoplasma genitalium and Bacillus subtilis and looked for homologs in all known prokaryotic genomes. Such analyses highlight the enormous metabolic flexibility of prokaryotes. Six of 27 studied genes have been functionally characterized up to now, amongst these four of the essential genes. The gene products YgbP, YgbB and YchB are involved in the non-mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis. KdtB is characterized as the posphopantetheine adenylyltransferase CoaD. There are indications that the other two essential gene products YjeE and YqgF, which we have identified, also possess enzymatic functions. These findings demonstrate the potential of such proteins to be used in screening of large chemical libraries for inhibitors which could be further developed to novel broad-spectrum antibiotics.
TI  - Resistance studies with daptomycin.
AB  - We studied the in vitro emergence of resistance to daptomycin using three methods: spontaneous resistance incidence, serial passage in the presence of increasing drug concentrations, and chemical mutagenesis. No spontaneously resistant mutants were obtained for any organism tested (<10(-10) for Staphylococcus aureus, <10(-9) for Staphylococcus epidermidis, <10(-9) for Enterococcus faecalis, <10(-9) for Enterococcus faecium, <10(-8) for Streptococcus pneumoniae). Population analysis demonstrated that bacterial susceptibility to daptomycin is heterogeneous. Assay results were sensitive to calcium concentration and culture density, both of which can affect apparent resistance rates. Stable S. aureus mutants were isolated by both serial passage in liquid media and chemical mutagenesis. The daptomycin MICs for these isolates were 8- to 32-fold higher than for the parental strain. Many mutants with high MICs (>12.5 microg/ml) had significant growth defects but did not display phenotypes typical of S. aureus small colony variants. The voltage component (Delta psi) of the bacterial membrane potential was increased in three independent resistant isolates. In vivo data showed that some daptomycin-resistant mutants had lost significant virulence. For other mutants, the degree of in vitro resistance was greater than the change in in vivo susceptibility. These results suggest that infection with some daptomycin-resistant organisms may still be easily treatable.
TI  - Distribution of aminoglycoside resistance genes in recent clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus avium.
AB  - Aminoglycoside modifying enzymes (AMEs) are major factors which confer aminoglycoside resistance on bacteria. Distribution of genes encoding seven AMEs was investigated by multiplex PCR for 279 recent clinical isolates of enterococci derived from a university hospital in Japan. The aac(6')-aph(2"), which is related to high level gentamicin resistance, was detected at higher frequency in Enterococcus faecalis (42.5%) than in Enterococcus faecium (4.3%). Almost half of E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates possessed ant(6)-Ia and aph(3')-IIIa. The profile of AME gene(s) detected most frequently in individual strains of E. faecalis was aac(6')aph(2") + ant(6)-Ia + aph(3')-IIIa, and isolates with this profile showed high level resistance to both gentamicin and streptomycin. In contrast, AME gene profiles of aac(6')-Ii+ ant(6)-Ia+aph(3')-IIIa, followed by aac(6')-Ii alone, were predominant in E. faecium. Only one AME gene profile of ant(6)-Ia+aph(3')-IIIa was found in Enterococcus avium. The ant(4')-Ia and ant(9)-Ia, which have been known to be distributed mostly among Staphylococcus aureus strains, were detected in a few enterococcal strains. An AME gene aph(2")-Ic was not detected in any isolates of the three enterococcal species. These findings indicated a variety of distribution profiles of AME genes among enterococci in our study site.
TI  - Complement evasion by Borrelia burgdorferi: serum-resistant strains promote C3b inactivation.
AB  - The most characteristic features of the Lyme disease pathogens, the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) group, are their ability to invade tissues and to circumvent the immune defenses of the host for extended periods of time, despite elevated levels of borrelia-specific antibodies in serum and other body fluids. Our aim in the present study was to determine whether B. burgdorferi is able to interfere with complement (C) at the level of C3 by accelerating C3b inactivation and thus to inhibit the amplification of the C cascade. Strains belonging to different genospecies (Borrelia garinii, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, and Borrelia afzelii) were compared for their sensitivities to normal human serum and abilities to promote factor I-mediated C3b degradation. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and B. afzelii strains were found to be serum resistant. When the spirochetes were incubated with radiolabeled C3b, factor I-mediated degradation of C3b was observed in the presence of C-resistant B. afzelii (n = 3) and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (n = 1) strains but not in the presence of C-sensitive B. garinii (n = 7) strains or control bacteria (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis). Immunoblotting and radioligand binding analyses showed that the C-resistant strains had the capacity to acquire the C inhibitors factor H and factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1) from growth medium and human serum. A novel surface protein with an apparent molecular mass of 35 kDa was found to preferentially bind to the N terminus region of factor H. Thus, the serum-resistant B. burgdorferi s.l. strains can circumvent C attack by binding the C inhibitors factor H and FHL-1 to their surfaces and promoting factor I-mediated C3b degradation.
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus resistance to human defensins and evasion of neutrophil killing via the novel virulence factor MprF is based on modification of membrane lipids with l-lysine.
AB  - Defensins, antimicrobial peptides of the innate immune system, protect human mucosal epithelia and skin against microbial infections and are produced in large amounts by neutrophils. The bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is insensitive to defensins by virtue of an unknown resistance mechanism. We describe a novel staphylococcal gene, mprF, which determines resistance to several host defense peptides such as defensins and protegrins. An mprF mutant strain was killed considerably faster by human neutrophils and exhibited attenuated virulence in mice, indicating a key role for defensin resistance in the pathogenicity of S. aureus. Analysis of membrane lipids demonstrated that the mprF mutant no longer modifies phosphatidylglycerol with l-lysine. As this unusual modification leads to a reduced negative charge of the membrane surface, MprF-mediated peptide resistance is most likely based on repulsion of the cationic peptides. Accordingly, inactivation of mprF led to increased binding of antimicrobial peptides by the bacteria. MprF has no similarity with genes of known function, but related genes were identified in the genomes of several pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis. MprF thus constitutes a novel virulence factor, which may be of general relevance for bacterial pathogens and represents a new target for attacking multidrug resistant bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial diterpenes from the roots of Salvia blepharochlaena.
AB  - The roots of Salvia blepharochlaena have yielded two new diterpenoids, blephaein  (1) and O-methylpisiferic acid methyl ester (2), together with eight known diterpenoids. The structures of the new compounds were established by spectroscopic analysis and by some chemical reactions. Potent antibacterial activity was exhibited by the known compounds horminone (9) and 7-acetylhorminone (10) against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 P, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12226, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633. Horminone was also found to be active against Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212.
TI  - Linezolid: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  - Linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. It has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus (GISA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Bacteroidesfragilis. In controlled phase III studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by VRE. Further phase III studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (SSTIs). In these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments, including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated SSTIs. Oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated SSTIs or community-acquired pneumonia. Linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. The most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. Thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of S. aureus (including GISA), Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis (including VRE). In controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by VRE. As the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among S. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
TI  - The Enterococcus faecalis pheromone-responsive plasmid pAM373 does not encode an  entry exclusion function.
AB  - pAM373 is a conjugative plasmid in Enterococcus faecalis that confers a mating response to the peptide sex pheromone cAM373 which is produced also by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus gordonii. Unlike other sex pheromone-inducible plasmids, pAM373 does not confer an entry exclusion phenotype.
TI  - Production, purification and some properties of Bac201, a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance produced by Staphylococcus aureus AB201.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus AB201, a clinical isolate from wound pus, produced a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance termed as Bac201, that was inhibitory to Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Neisseria meningitidis and a number of staphylococcal species. It was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration (BioSil-SEC-125), and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (Vydac C4). The native Bac201 was sized at approximately 170-kDa as determined by GF HPLC. Fraction-I (native Bac201), having antibacterial activity was also examined by transmission electron microscopy and appeared as globular structure showing resemblance with phage-like objects. The purification of Bac201 resulted in 466-fold increase in specific activity and recovery of 0.94% of total antibacterial activity. The purified Bac201 migrated as single band on SDS-PAGE with an estimated molecular mass of about 41-kDa. Bac201 was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes, resistant to heat and organic solvents, and active over a wide range of pH (2.5-10). The amino acid composition revealed a general resemblance with other reported high molecular mass bacteriocins and predominance of glycine (39%), proline (13%) and alanine (8%) residues. Further results showed that Bac201 has a bactericidal effect on sensitive cells which is not produced by either cell lysis or apparent loss of membrane permeability.
TI  - Aggregation substance-mediated adherence of Enterococcus faecalis to immobilized  extracellular matrix proteins.
AB  - Aggregation substance (AS) of Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), a sex pheromone plasmid encoded cell surface protein, mediates the formation of bacterial aggregates, thereby promoting plasmid transfer. The influence of pAD1-encoded AS, Asa1, on binding to immobilized extracellular matrix proteins was studied. The presence of AS increased enterococcal adherence to fibronectin more than eight-fold, to thrombospondin more than four-fold, to vitronectin more than three-fold, and to collagen type I more than two-fold (P<0.001). In contrast, binding to laminin and collagen type IV occurred independently of AS. Adherence of the constitutively AS expressing E. faecalis OG1X(pAM721) to immobilized fibronectin was found to be approximately five times higher than that of Staphylococcus aureus Cowan and approximately 30 times higher than that of Streptococcus bovis. Investigation of strains with various deletions within the structural gene of asa1 suggests that attachment to immobilized fibronectin is mainly mediated by amino acids within the variable region or by neighbouring residues. Thus, AS may promote adherence to injured epithelium and endothelium, where extracellular matrix proteins are exposed, thereby facilitating colonization and infection.
TI  - Improvement of water-soluble cephalosporin derivatives having antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - We evaluated a series of novel cephem antibiotics, N-alkylpyridinium (alkyl group), N-carboxyethylpyridinium (carboxylic group), N-sulfoethylpyridinium (sulfonic group) and N-alkylquaternary ammonium salts (ammonioethyl group), N-alkyl-aromatic-quaternary ammonium salts and N-alkyl-heterocyclic quaternary ammonium salts (cyclic group) as vinylthio pyridinium derivatives at the C-3 position and hydroxyiminoaminothiazol at the C-7 position, for their activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and their solubility, by measuring the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and the dissolving test in phosphate buffer. All tested compounds, except for the alkyl group, showed good solubility (>10%) in 1/15 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). The concentrations required to inhibit 80% of the bacterial strains (MIC80s) of the alkyl group, carboxylic group, sulfonic group, ammonioethyl group and cyclic group against MRSA were 1.56, 12.5-25, 6.25, 1.56 and 1.56 microg/ml, respectively. These results indicated that the ammonioethyl and cyclic groups yield the maximum anti-MRSA and anti-Enterococcus faecalis activity, and also good water solubility.
TI  - In vitro activities of RWJ-54428 (MC-02,479) against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - RWJ-54428 (MC-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. In a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), RWJ-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an MIC at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (MIC(90)) of 2 microg/ml. For coagulase-negative staphylococci, RWJ-54428 was 32 times more active than imipenem, with an MIC(90) of 2 microg/ml. RWJ-54428 was active against S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (RWJ-54428 MIC range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). RWJ-54428 was eight times more potent than methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MIC(90), 0.5 microg/ml). For ampicillin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), RWJ-54428 had an MIC(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. RWJ-54428 was also active against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. The potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; RWJ-54428 MICs ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. RWJ-54428 was more active than penicillin G and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). RWJ-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). This survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to RWJ-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.
TI  - A novel heterodimeric antimicrobial peptide from the tree-frog Phyllomedusa distincta.
AB  - We present here the purification and the analysis of the structural and functional properties of distinctin, a 5.4 kDa heterodimeric peptide with antimicrobial activity from the tree-frog Phyllomedusa distincta. This peptide was isolated from the crude extract of skin granular glands by different chromatographic steps. Its minimal inhibitory concentration was determined against pathogenic Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. Amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometric investigations demonstrated that distinctin is constituted of two different polypeptide chains connected by an intermolecular disulphide bridge. Circular dichroism and Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy studies showed that this molecule adopts, in water, a structure containing a significant percentage of anti-parallel beta-sheet. A conformational variation was observed under experimental conditions mimicking a membrane-like environment. Database searches did not show sequence similarities with any known antimicrobial peptides. In the light of these results, we can consider distinctin as the first example of a new class of antimicrobial heterodimeric peptides from frog skin.
TI  - Oral fluoroquinolone therapy results in drug adsorption on ureteral stents and prevention of biofilm formation.
AB  - The oral administration of ciprofloxacin (250mg bid) and ofloxacin (300mg bid) in 40 patients with ureteral stents, led to drug levels on all the device surfaces that were higher than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Escherichia coli (0.004--0.015 mg/l), the most common uropathogen. The drug levels in the film were higher than the MIC of other common pathogens, namely Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.25--1.0 mg/l), Enterococcus faecalis (0.25--2.0 mg/l) and Staphylococcus aureus (0.12--0.5 mg/l) in a few cases (six, three and 14 cases out of 40, respectively). For both antibiotics, the concentrations were greater than the MIC of many uropathogens on the film surrounding the devices (0.89 vs 0.31 mg/l respectively, P=0.05), and on the devices themselves (0.22 vs. 0.12 mg/l, P=0.207). Adsorption of the antibiotics was higher to the film than to the stent (P<0.0001). Ciprofloxacin concentration on the film surrounding the stents was significantly higher than that of ofloxacin (P=0.05), while there was no statistical concentration difference between the two antibiotics adsorbed onto the actual devices (P=0.207). No bacteria were found in patients' urine and no biofilms were detected. This is the first report of an oral antibiotic being adsorbed onto medical devices. It potentially provides a new approach of preventing infection, and avoids the need to pre-coat devices with agents whose use will be restricted once bacteria develop resistance to them. If biomaterial properties can be enhanced to increase further the adsorptive concentration of drug, the risk of infections and recalcitrant biofilm formation could be significantly reduced in a highly susceptible patient population.
TI  - Chlorination of pure bacterial cultures in aqueous solution.
AB  - The fate and distribution of chlorine in aqueous solutions containing four pure bacterial cultures was studied. Solutions were subjected to chlorination at different initial free chlorine concentrations. Resulting concentrations of residual chlorine were determined by both DPD/FAS titration and membrane introduction mass spectrometry (MIMS). In all cases, false-positive breakpoint chlorination curves, probably attributable to the formation of chloroorganic-N compounds, were observed by DPD/FAS titration, while little or no inorganic residual chloramine was found by MIMS. Free chlorine was observed in similar quantities by both methods after chlorine demand by bacterial cellular materials in solution was satisfied. These results indicated the residual chloramines existed in the form of organic chloramines; these compounds are generally recognized as being poor antimicrobial agents. Further investigation confirmed that the bacterial cells were the source of organic-N compounds. The kinetics of chlorination of pure bacterial suspensions was also studied. The pattern of residual chlorine decay following chlorination of the bacterial suspensions indicated rapid initial free chlorine consumption, followed by slow free chlorine consumption, with trace quantities of inorganic chloramine being formed.
TI  - Mdt(A), a new efflux protein conferring multiple antibiotic resistance in Lactococcus lactis and Escherichia coli.
AB  - The mdt(A) gene, previously designated mef214, from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis plasmid pK214 encodes a protein [Mdt(A) (multiple drug transporter)] with 12 putative transmembrane segments (TMS) that contain typical motifs conserved among the efflux proteins of the major facilitator superfamily. However, it also has two C-motifs (conserved in the fifth TMS of the antiporters) and a putative ATP-binding site. Expression of the cloned mdt(A) gene decreased susceptibility to macrolides, lincosamides, streptogramins, and tetracyclines in L. lactis and Escherichia coli, but not in Enterococcus faecalis or in Staphylococcus aureus. Glucose-dependent efflux of erythromycin and tetracycline was demonstrated in L. lactis and in E. coli.
TI  - In vitro activity of teicoplanin against gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The glycopeptide susceptibility of 443 clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci collected from nine general hospitals in 1996 was determined according to the recommendations of the CA-SFM (the Antibiogram Committee of the French Society for Microbiology). In total, 234 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 84 isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), 98 enterococci and 27 streptococci were collected. The mecA gene confirming resistance to methicillin was found in 42.7% of S. aureus isolates and 51.2% of CNS isolates. No resistance to teicoplanin and vancomycin was found in S. aureus but four isolates of CNS had an MIC of teicoplanin > or = 8 mg/L. All isolates of Enterococcus faecalis tested were susceptible to both glycopeptides. This study confirms that teicoplanin has a very good in vitro activity against gram-positive cocci, isolated in France from nosocomial infections.
TI  - Detection of cervical immunoglobulin A in normal pregnancy.
AB  - The aim of our study was to evaluate a feasible method to quantify the immunoglobulin A concentration in the cervical mucus of women with a normal singleton pregnancy. In 60 immunologic healthy pregnant women cervical mucus samples were taken at a random time in pregnancy using an absorbing cylindrical cotton-swab stick. In this cervical mucus immunoglobulin A concentration was measured by radial immunodiffusion. A vaginal bacterial swab was taken from each woman. Concentration of immunoglobulins in maternal serum was estimated. There was no statistically significant difference of cervical immunoglobulin A concentration between the investigated groups (p = 0.952): 18-24 gestational weeks (gw): 52.8 (6.6-258.4) mg/l; 25-29 gw: 89.3 (4.8-193.8) mg/l; 30-34 gw: 55 (1.4-326) mg/l; 35-40 gw: 59.2 (4-400.9) mg/l. Women with a normal vaginal flora showed a significantly higher cervical immunoglobulin A concentration than those with a pathological colonization: 92.2 (6.6-400.9) mg/l vs. 42.5 (1.4-326) mg/l (p < 0.05). The serum levels of immunoglobulins A, A1, A2, M and G do not correlate to cervical immunoglobulin A levels nor to gestational age. In normal pregnancy, cervical immunoglobulin A concentration does not change with advancing gestational age, but a pathological vaginal colonization seems to be associated with decreased immunoglobulin A levels.
TI  - Determination of the antibacterial efficacy of several antiseptics tested on skin by an 'ex-vivo' test.
AB  - There are many skin antiseptics commercially available. Although their antibacterial activity has often been well studied, their potential effectiveness on skin remains poorly documented. To date, in-vivo protocols designed for the testing of the antimicrobial efficacy of antiseptics cannot use, for ethical reasons, pathogenic bacteria or new formulations whose toxicity in human subjects is unknown. An 'ex-vivo' test was recently developed to overcome these problems. Freshly excised human skin from abdominal or breast reduction was placed in a diffusion cell containing a maintenance medium in the recipient compartment. A bacterial inoculum was then applied to the stratum corneum and, after a drying step, antiseptic formulations were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity. Several micro-organisms were investigated: - Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant Ent. faecium (VRE), S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli--with several biocides--para-chloro-meta-xylenol (PCMX, active compound of Dettol), povidone iodine, triclosan (in isopropanol) and chlorhexidine. Results from the ex-vivo test were compared with results obtained in suspension and glass-carrier tests. The bactericidal activity of the biocides depended upon the test performed and results were generally significantly different from one method to the other. All biocides tested in the suspension test achieved >4 log10 reduction in viable bacterial concentrations, apart from povidone iodine tested against Ent. faecalis and VRE. The antibacterial activity of biocides tested in the glass-carrier test was significantly lower than in the suspension test, with the exception of triclosan in isopropanol, which was as effective in both suspension and glass-carrier test. In the ex-vivo test, triclosan in isopropanol achieved a log10 reduction in viable bacterial concentration of 1.105-1.771 (with the exception of P. aeruginosa with 0.758 log10 reduction). PCMX, povidone iodine and chlorhexidine achieved log10 reductions in viable bacterial concentration of 0.303-0.901. Chlorhexidine tested against P. aeruginosa produced a 1.94 log10 reduction in concentration. These results confirm previous observations about the need for testing the antimicrobial activity of antiseptics on skin surface to determine their in-situ efficacy and encourage further the use of the ex-vivo protocol.
TI  - An intelligent rapid odour recognition model in discrimination of Helicobacter pylori and other gastroesophageal isolates in vitro.
AB  - Two series of experiments are reported which result in the discrimination between Helicobacter pylori and other bacterial gastroesophageal isolates using a newly developed odour generating system, an electronic nose and a hybrid intelligent odour recognition system. In the first series of experiments, after 5 h of growth (37 degrees C), 53 volatile 'sniffs' were collected over the headspace of complex broth cultures of the following clinical isolates: Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella sp., H. pylori, Enterococcus faecalis (10(7) ml(-1)), Mixed infection (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and E. faecalis 3 x 10(6) ml each) and sterile cultures. Fifty-six normalised variables were extracted from 14 conductive polymer sensor responses and analysed by a 3-layer back propagation neural network (NN). The NN prediction rate achieved was 98% and the test data (37.7% of all data) was recognised correctly. Successful clustering of bacterial classes was also achieved by discriminant analysis (DA) of a normalised subset of sensor data. Cross-validation identified correctly seven 'unknown' samples. In the second series of experiments after 150 min of microaerobic growth at 37 degrees C, 24 volatile samples were collected over the headspace of H. pylori cultures in enriched (HPP) and normal (HP) media and 11 samples over sterile (N) cultures. Forty-eight sensor parameters were extracted from 12 sensor responses and analysed by a 3-layer NN previously optimised by a genetic algorithm (GA). GA-NN analysis achieved a 94% prediction rate of 'unknown' data. Additionally the 'genetically' selected 16 input neurones were used to perform DA-cross validation that showed a clear clustering of three groups and reclassified correctly nine 'sniffs'. It is concluded that the most important factors that govern the performance of an intelligent bacterial odour detection system are: (a) an odour generation mechanism, (b) a rapid odour delivery system similar to the mammalian olfactory system, (c) a gas sensor array of high reproducibility and (d) a hybrid intelligent model (expert system) which will enable the parallel use of GA-NNs and multivariate techniques.
TI  - Antimicrobial and chemical study of MTA, Portland cement, calcium hydroxide paste, Sealapex and Dycal.
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial action of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), Portland cement, calcium hydroxide paste (CHP), Sealapex and Dycal. The chemical elements of MTA and two Portland cements were also analyzed. Four standard bacterial strains: Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6633), one wild fungus, Candida albicans (ICB/USP-562), and one mixture of these were used. Thirty Petri plates with 20 ml of BHI agar were inoculated with 0.1 ml of the experimental suspensions. Three cavities, each one measuring 4 mm in depth and 4 mm in diameter, were made in each agar plate using a copper coil and then completely filled with the product to be tested. The plates were pre-incubated for 1 h at environmental temperature followed by incubation at 37 degrees C for 48 h. The diameters of the zones of microbial inhibition were then measured. Samples from diffusion and inhibition halos were extracted from each plate and immersed in 7 ml BHI broth and incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h. Analyses of chemical elements present in MTA and in two samples of Portland cement were performed with a fluorescence spectrometer Rx. The results showed that the antimicrobial activity of CHP was superior to those of MTA, Portland cement, Sealapex and Dycal, for all microorganisms tested, presenting inhibition zones of 6-9.5 mm and diffusion zones of 10-18 mm. MTA, Portland cement, and Sealapex presented only diffusion zones and among these, Sealapex produced the largest zone. Dycal did not show inhibition or diffusion zones. Portland cements contain the same chemical elements as MTA except that MTA also contains bismuth.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of antimicrobial activity of sealers and pastes used in endodontics.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers (AH Plus, Sealapex, Ketac Endo, and Fill Canal), two calcium hydroxide pastes (Calen and Calasept), and a zinc oxide paste was evaluated. Seven bacterial strains were used, six of them standard; Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 10541. There was a wild strain of Streptococcus mutans isolated from saliva obtained in an adult dental clinic. Activity was evaluated using the agar diffusion method with Brain Heart Infusion agar and Muller Hinton medium seeded by pour plate. Calcium hydroxide-based sealers and pastes were either placed directly into 4.0 x 4.0 mm wells or by using absorbent paper points. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 hr for diffusion. After incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 hr, the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% TTC gel and inhibition haloes were measured. All bacterial strains were inhibited by all materials using the well method. However, when the materials were applied with absorbent paper points, Enterococcus faecalis was not inhibited by zinc oxide, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not inhibited by AH Plus, Fill Canal, and the zinc oxide-based paste. We conclude that sealers and pastes presented antimicrobial activity in vitro and culture medium optimization with 0.05 g% TTC gel facilitated observation of the inhibition haloes.
TI  - Monitoring of immune response by blood serum profiling using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  - The application of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS) to the analysis of blood serum leads to the observation of a large variety of reproducible mass spectral peaks corresponding to blood components. In this study, the use of MALDI-TOFMS was developed as a tool for monitoring immune response to bacterial infection. Employing the MALDI-TOFMS approach, the levels of many components of blood were found to be immune response independent whereas others were found to correlate directly with the response of the immune system to two known types of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis). The methodologies reported here should be useful for the rapid monitoring of blood, especially that of the immune response mechanisms in various animal species.
TI  - Expression of the major heat shock proteins DnaK and GroEL in Streptococcus pyogenes: a comparison to Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - One of the outstanding problems in the field of heat shock response has been to elucidate the mechanism underlying the induction of heat shock proteins (HSPs). In this work, we initiate an analysis of the expression of heat shock groEL and dnaK genes and their promoters in S. pyogenes. The synthesis of total cellular proteins was studied upon transfer of a log-phase culture from 37 degrees C to 42 degrees C by performing 5-min pulse-labeling experiments with (35)S-Met. The heat shock responses in the pathogenic Gram-positive cocci, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus, were also analyzed.
TI  - A rapid procedure for isolating chromosomal DNA from Lactobacillus species and other Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - This study describes a rapid procedure for the isolation of genomic DNA from various Gram-positive bacteria. Species tested included Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis ATCC 4797, Lact. acidophilus N2, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Propionibacterium jensenii P126, Bacillus pumilus and Enterococcus faecalis. Our technique for chromosomal DNA isolation circumvents the need for phenol-chloroform extractions and caesium chloride gradients. Isolated DNA is consistently greater than 25 kb in size and can be used directly for subcloning, polymerase chain reaction amplification, restriction digestions and library construction.

TI  - Antibacterial properties of human amnion and chorion in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to explore the direct effects of  amnion and chorion on bacterial growth in vitro including the antibacterial spectrum. Chorioamniotic membranes were obtained under sterile conditions from 13 healthy women undergoing elective cesarean section at term. Likewise, chorioamniotic membranes were obtained from 10 healthy women with spontaneous vaginal delivery at term. Five strains of Hemolytic streptococci group B (GBS) were tested and one clinical isolate of the following species or bacterial groups: Hemolytic streptococcus group A, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Lactobacillus species. Bacteriological media included (1) blood-agar medium; (2) a transparent agar medium for submerged cultures; and (3) a nutrient broth medium. RESULTS: An inhibitory effect of fetal membranes against a range of bacteria was found. Consistent results were obtained in experiments with cultures on agar and cultures suspended in agar (membranes from eight women in both studies). In experiments with liquid cultures (seven women) only chorion showed a marginal inhibitory effect. All strains were inhibited, but the most pronounced inhibition was obtained for streptococcus group A, S. aureus and S. saprophyticus by both chorion and amnion. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated an inhibitory effect of the fetal membranes on a diverse panel of bacteria
TI  - Activity of gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin in combination with other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The influence of non-quinolone antimicrobial agents on the antibacterial activities of gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin was determined using chequerboard, fractional inhibitory concentration, (FIC) and time-kill analysis methods. In the chequerboard method, the quinolones were tested in combination with ten antimicrobial agents (macrolides, aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, vancomycin, rifampicin and chloramphenicol) against five bacterial strains (one strain each of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae). In no incidence was antagonism (FIC > or = 4) or synergy (FIC < or = 0.5) observed; all dual drug combinations involving gatifloxacin or ciprofloxacin showed additivity/indifference (FIC > 0.5, < 4). By time-kill analysis, the strains were tested at a quinolone concentration equal to 8 x MIC in combination with a second antibiotic at 0.5xits MIC. These combinations killed non-enterococcal strains at rates similar to those with quinolones alone. However, rifampicin and chloramphenicol were often antagonistic (100-fold lesser killing) to the lethal action of gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin against E. faecalis. These findings indicate that, with the exception of E. faecalis, the antibacterial activities of quinolones are generally additive/indifferent to those of other antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Antibiotic activity and characterization of BB-3497, a novel peptide deformylase  inhibitor.
AB  - Peptide deformylase (PDF) is an essential bacterial metalloenzyme which deformylates the N-formylmethionine of newly synthesized polypeptides and as such represents a novel target for antibacterial chemotherapy. To identify novel PDF inhibitors, we screened a metalloenzyme inhibitor library and identified an N-formyl-hydroxylamine derivative, BB-3497, and a related natural hydroxamic acid antibiotic, actinonin, as potent and selective inhibitors of PDF. To elucidate the interactions that contribute to the binding affinity of these inhibitors, we determined the crystal structures of BB-3497 and actinonin bound to Escherichia coli PDF at resolutions of 2.1 and 1.75 A, respectively. In both complexes, the active-site metal atom was pentacoordinated by the side chains of Cys 90, His 132, and His 136 and the two oxygen atoms of N-formyl-hydroxylamine or hydroxamate. BB-3497 had activity against gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, and activity against some gram-negative bacteria. Time-kill analysis showed that the mode of action of BB-3497 was primarily bacteriostatic. The mechanism of resistance was via mutations within the formyltransferase gene, as previously described for actinonin. While actinonin and its derivatives have not been used clinically because of their poor pharmacokinetic properties, BB-3497 was shown to be orally bioavailable. A single oral dose of BB-3497 given 1 h after intraperitoneal injection of S. aureus Smith or methicillin-resistant S. aureus protected mice from infection with median effective doses of 8 and 14 mg/kg of body weight, respectively. These data validate PDF as a novel target for the design of a new generation of antibacterial agents.
TI  - Clinafloxacin versus piperacillin-tazobactam in treatment of patients with severe skin and soft tissue infections.
AB  - Patients (n = 409) with severe skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) were randomized to receive clinafloxacin or piperacillin-tazobactam (plus optional vancomycin for methicillin-resistant cocci), administered intravenously, with the option to switch to oral medication. Most patients had cellulitis, wound infections, or diabetic foot infections. Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most common baseline pathogens. Fewer baseline pathogens were resistant to clinafloxacin (1.8%) than to piperacillin-tazobactam (6.2%) (P = 0.001). The clinafloxacin and piperacillin-tazobactam groups did not differ significantly in clinical cure rates (68.8 and 65.2%, respectively) or microbiologic eradication rates (61.5 and 57.2%). Clinafloxacin yielded higher eradication rates for all three of the most common pathogenic species, although no differences were statistically significant. Within the power of this study, the overall frequency of adverse events was similar (P = 0.577) in the two treatment groups. Drug-associated adverse events (P = 0.050) and treatment discontinuations (P = 0.052) were marginally more frequent in the clinafloxacin group, primarily due to phototoxicity in outpatients receiving clinafloxacin. Although most cases of phototoxicity were mild to moderate, four cases were reported as severe. In summary, clinafloxacin monotherapy was equivalent in effectiveness to therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam plus optional vancomycin in the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe SSTIs.
TI  - Effect of insulin on microbial growth.
AB  - The ability of insulin to affect the growth kinetics of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was measured. For all organisms, insulin, in the absence of a metabolizable sugar source, i.e., glucose or starch in Mueller-Hinton medium, had no effect on generation time as compared with a homologous control. Response to insulin, in the form of increased or decreased generation times, for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, was dependent on the concentration of insulin, the concentration of glucose present, and the initial concentration of bacteria exposed to the glucose and insulin.
TI  - [Surveillance of gram positive cocci susceptibility to betalactams, glycopeptides, and other antimicrobials].
AB  - BACKGROUND: During the last decade, there has been a progressive increase in the  resistance of gram (+) cocci to betalactamics and other antimicrobials. Therefore, vancomycin and teicoplanin have incorporated as alternative antimicrobial drugs. AIM: To assess the susceptibility of gram (+) cocci to different antimicrobials including vancomycin and teicoplanin. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 447 strains of gram (+) cocci coming from ambulatory and hospitalized patients. These included 308 Enterococcus sp strains, 99 Staphylococcus aureus strains and 40 coagulase negative Staphylococci strains. Enterococci susceptibility was measured using minimal inhibitory concentrations in agar and that of Staphylococci, through diffusion. Susceptibility to vancomycin and teicoplanin was measured using minimal inhibitory concentrations in all strains. RESULTS: Enterococcus faecalis was 100% susceptible to ampicillin, penicillin, vancomycin and teicoplanin, 23% susceptible to tetracyclin and 47% to chloramphenicol. Susceptibility of E faecium was 61% to penicillin, 49% to chloramphenicol, 41% to tetracyclin, 100% to vancomycin and teicoplanin. Of 19 Enterococcus spp strains, 90% were susceptible to ampicillin, 80% to penicillin, 55% to chloramphenicol and 45% to tetracyclin. Only one E casseiflavus strain had a low level resistance to vancomycin and was susceptible to teicoplanin. No Staphylococcus aureus strain was resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin. CONCLUSIONS: A permanent surveillance of gram (+) cocci antimicrobial susceptibility is required to update therapeutic schemes.
TI  - Antimicrobial evaluation of certain plants used in Mexican traditional medicine for the treatment of respiratory diseases.
AB  - Eighteen crude extracts, including six hexanic, six chloroformic and six methanolic from six different plant species used in Mexican traditional medicine for the treatment of respiratory infections, were evaluated for potential antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. The minimal inhibitory concentration was determined for each extract using a two-fold dilution assay. The results showed that 16 crude extracts (89%) exhibited antimicrobial activity against at least one of the microorganisms tested at concentrations of 5 mg/ml or below. The extracts from Gnaphalium oxyphyllum, Gnaphalium americanum, and Crescentia alata possessed strong antimicrobial activity against the pathogens tested.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility to everninomycin of gram-positive nosocomial pathogens isolated from intensive care units in Germany.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gram-positive bacteria are increasingly found to be causative pathogens in nosocomial infections, and the occurrence of vancomycin resistance in enterococci as well as staphylococci has prompted the investigation of alternative antimicrobial agents active against these strains. Everninomycin, a new oligosaccharide antibiotic, has excellent in vitro activity against gram-positive bacteria, including those resistant to vancomycin. However, avilamycin, a related compound, has been used in Europe as a growth promoter in animal food for years and concern has been raised that cross-resistance in clinical isolates may arise. METHODS: We studied a collection of 268 nosocomial gram-positive isolates from intensive care unit patients with nosocomial pneumonia, urinary tract infection and sepsis, using standard in vitro susceptibility testing. RESULTS: It could be shown that all species tested were exquisitely sensitive to everninomycin (MIC(90) of 0.38 microg/ml for Staphylococcus aureus, 0.5 microg/ml for enterococci and 0.75 microg/ml for coagulase-negative staphylococci). Furthermore, no difference could be observed between methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus or between Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that everninomycin is a promising antibiotic for the treatment of nosocomial infections in intensive care unit patients and that the use of a related substance as an additive in animal food has not yet promoted resistance in clinical isolates.
TI  - Use of preclinical data for selection of a phase II/III dose for evernimicin and  identification of a preclinical MIC breakpoint.
AB  - One of the most challenging issues in the design of phase II/III clinical trials  of antimicrobial agents is dose selection. The choice is often based on preclinical data from pharmacokinetic (PK) studies with animals and healthy volunteers but is rarely linked directly to the target organisms except by the MIC, an in vitro measure of antimicrobial activity with many limitations. It is the thesis of this paper that rational dose-selection decisions can be made on the basis of the pharmacodynamics (PDs) of the test agent predicted by a mathematical model which uses four data sets: (i) the distribution of MICs for clinical isolates, (ii) the distribution of the values of the PK parameters for the test drug in the population, (iii) the PD target(s) developed from animal models of infection, and (iv) the protein binding characteristics of the test drug. In performing this study with the new anti-infective agent evernimicin, we collected a large number (n = 4,543) of recent clinical isolates of gram-positive pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, and Staphylococcus aureus) and determined the MICs using E-test methods (AB Biodisk, Stockholm, Sweden) for susceptibility to evernimicin. Population PK data were collected from healthy volunteers (n = 40) and patients with hypoalbuminemia (n = 12), and the data were analyzed by using NPEM III. PD targets were developed with a neutropenic murine thigh infection model with three target pathogens: S. pneumoniae (n = 5), E. faecalis (n = 2), and S. aureus (n = 4). Drug exposure or the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve/MIC (AUC/MIC) was found to be the best predictor of microbiological efficacy. There were three possible microbiological results: stasis of the initial inoculum at 24 h (10(7) CFU), log killing (pathogen dependent, ranging from 1 to 3 log(10)), or 90% maximal killing effect (90% E(max)). The levels of protein binding in humans and mice were similar. The PK and PD of 6 and 9 mg of evernimicin per kg of body weight were compared; the population values for the model parameters and population covariance matrix were used to generate five Monte Carlo simulations with 200 subjects each. The fractional probability of attaining the three PD targets was calculated for each dose and for each of the three pathogens. All differences in the fractional probability of attaining the target AUC/MIC in this PD model were significant. For S. pneumoniae, the probability of attaining all three PD targets was high for both doses. For S. aureus and enterococci, there were increasing differences between the 6- and 9-mg/kg evernimicin doses for reaching the 2 log killing (S. aureus), 1 log killing (enterococci), or 90% E(max) AUC/MIC targets. This same approach may also be used to set preliminary in vitro MIC breakpoints.
TI  - Susceptibility of bacterial isolates to gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin from clinical trials 1997-1998.
AB  - MICs of gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin against 3482 pre-treatment, clinical trial isolates collected during 1997-1998 are reported. These data suggested that gatifloxacin was four- to eight-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria, with gatifloxacin MIC(90)s < or = 0.33 mg/l against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and < or = 1.0 mg/l versus viridans streptococci and Enterococcus faecalis. Both quinolones had similar MIC(90)s versus Enterobacteriaceae (generally < or = 0.38 mg/l, except 0. 7-0.8 mg/l for Citrobacter freundii) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( approximately 8 mg/l). A total of 78% P. aeruginosa had gatifloxacin MICs < or = 2 mg/l. Gatifloxacin was more active than ciprofloxacin against Acinetobacter species and non-P. aeruginosa pseudomonads. Both had exceptional activity versus Haemophilus spp, Moraxella catarrhalis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In summary, compared to ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin had improved activity against Gram-positive bacteria and comparable activity against Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of plant extracts from the families Fabaceae, Oleaceae, Philadelphaceae, Rosaceae and Staphyleaceae.
AB  - The selected plant extracts exhibited antibacterial activity. The strongest effect was manifested by extracts prepared from Gymnocladus dioicus, Amelanchier ovalis, Exochorda racemosa, Holodiscus discolor, Philadelphus microphyllus, Philadelphus coronarius and Pelargonium tabulare. The percentage inhibition of bacterial growth was 0-41.8%. In addition it was found that extracts isolated from Amelanchier ovalis, Exochorda racemosa and Pelargonium tabulare were specifically effective only against the bacterial strains tested.
TI  - Comparative in vitro Activity of Meropenem Versus Other Extended-Spectrum Antimicrobial Agents Against 2,085 Clinical Isolates Tested in 13 Brazilian Centers.
AB  - Meropenem is a parenteral carbapenem antibacterial agent with a very broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. It is the second agent of its class to become available in Brazil. The in vitro antibacterial activity of meropenem was compared with imipenem and four other antimicrobial agents in a multicenter study. This study involved 13 clinical microbiology laboratories, 10 of which came from 8 Brazilian states. A total of 2,085 clinical isolates consecutively collected between December 1995 and March 1996 were susceptibility tested using the Etest and following the NCCLS procedures. Meropenem inhibited more than 90% of isolates of Enterobacteriaceae at 0.5 microg/mL, except for Citrobacter sp. (1 microg/ml). Generally, meropenem was slightly more active than imipenem against Gram-negative organisms and its spectrum of antimicrobial activity was broader than those of all other drugs tested. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, meropenem (MIC50, 0.38 microg/ml) was approximately 8-fold more active than imipenem (MIC 50,3 microg/mL). Imipenem was two-to eight-fold more active than meropenem against some Gram-positive specees oxacillin, including Enterococcus faecalis (MIC 50 of 0.75 microg/mL and 2 microg/mL respectively), oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 50 of 0.47 &mul;g/mL and 0.094 microg/mL), oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC 50 of 0.064 microg/mL and 0.5mg/mL). Against Streptococcus sp. meropenem was slightly more active than imipenem (MIC 50, 0.016 microg/mL). The results of this study may be used to guide empiric therapy in Brazil and indicates that meropenem may have an important role in the treatment of infections caused by multiresistant strains of bacteria.
TI  - The in vitro activity of ABT773, a new ketolide antimicrobial agent.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ABT773, a ketolide antimicrobial agent, was investigated and compared with those of seven other antibiotics. Type strains and 733 Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic isolates of clinical origin and four CHLAMYDIA: isolates were used. The activity of ABT773 was very similar to that of telithromycin, the other ketolide tested. The MIC(90) was < or = 0.5 mg/L for all bacteria examined except methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Haemophilus influenzae and BACTEROIDES: spp. The antichlamydial activity of ABT773 was greater than that of telithromycin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. Neither an increase in the size of the inoculm nor the addition of human serum had any marked affect on the in vitro activity of ABT773.
TI  - Susceptibility of gram-positive cocci from 25 UK hospitals to antimicrobial agents including linezolid. The Linezolid Study Group.
AB  - The prevalence of antibiotic resistance amongst Gram-positive cocci from 25 UK hospitals was studied over an 8 month period in 1999. A total of 3770 isolates were tested by the sentinel laboratories using the Etest; these bacteria comprised 1000 pneumococci, 1005 Staphylococcus aureus, 769 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) and 996 enterococci. To ensure quality, 10% of the isolates were retested centrally, as were any found to express unusual resistance patterns. The prevalence of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) varied widely amongst the sentinel laboratories. The resistance rates to methicillin among S. aureus and CNS were 19.2 and 38.9%, respectively, with MRSA rates in individual sentinel sites ranging from 0 to 43%. No glycopeptide resistance was seen in S. aureus, but 6.5% of CNS isolates were teicoplanin resistant and 0.5% were vancomycin resistant. Vancomycin resistance was much more frequent among Enterococcus faecium (24.1%) than E. faecalis (0.5%) (P<0.05), with most resistant isolates carrying vanA. The rate of penicillin resistance in pneumococci was 8.9%, and this resistance was predominantly intermediate (7.9%), with only six hospitals reporting isolates with high level resistance. The prevalence of erythromycin resistance among pneumococci was 12.3%, with the majority of resistant isolates having the macrolide efflux mechanism mediated by mefE. All the organisms tested were susceptible to linezolid with MICs in the range 0.12-4 mg/L. The modal MICs of linezolid were 1 mg/L for CNS and pneumococci, and 2 mg/L for S. aureus and enterococci. Linezolid was the most potent agent tested against Gram-positive cocci, including multiresistant strains, and as such may prove a valuable therapeutic option for the management of Gram-positive infections in hospitals.
TI  - Quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance among gram-positive bacteria in Taiwan.
AB  - To understand quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance among clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria in Taiwan, where this agent is not yet available for clinical use, we evaluated 1,287 nonduplicate isolates recovered from January 1996 to December 1999 for in vitro susceptibility to quinupristin-dalfopristin and other newer antimicrobial agents. All methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) isolates were susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. High rates of nonsusceptibility to quinupristin-dalfopristin (MICs, >/=2 microg/ml) were demonstrated for the following organisms: methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (31%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (16%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (8%), viridans group streptococci (51%), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (85%), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (100%), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (66%), Leuconostoc spp. (100%), Lactobacillus spp. (50%), and Pediococcus spp. (87%). All isolates of MSSA, MRSA, S. pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci were susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin. The rates of nonsusceptibility to vancomycin and teicoplanin were 5 and 7%, respectively, for CoNS, ranging from 12 and 18% for S. simulans to 0 and 0% for S. cohnii and S. auricularis. Moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin had good activities against these isolates except for ciprofloxacin-resistant vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. In Taiwan, virginiamycin has been used in animal husbandry for more than 20 years, which may contribute to the high rates of quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance.
TI  - In vitro activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin and eight other antimicrobial agents against 360 clinical isolates from Korea.
AB  - The emergence of multi-drug resistant gram-positive cocci such as methicillin-resistant (MR) staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant (VR) enterococci, and vancomycin-intermediate resistant S. aureus (VISA) has given new urgency to the development of new antimicrobial agents. One of these is quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D). We decided to determine the susceptibility of gram-positive cocci isolated at two university hospitals in Seoul to Q/D and compare the results with eight other antimicrobial agents. We investigated 120 isolates of S. aureus including 49 MRSAs and one VISA, 120 isolates of coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS), 64 E. faecalis and 56 E. faecium, including seven strains of VR E. faecium. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) for several antimicrobials, including vancomycin and Q/D, were determined by broth microdilution. All S. aureus including VISA were susceptible to Q/D. Q/D MIC90 for both methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and MRSA was 0.25 g/mL. 49 (87.5%) of 56 E. faecium including six of seven VR E. faecium were susceptible to Q/D. E. faecalis were not susceptible to Q/D (only 1.5% susceptible), but were inhibited by ampicillin (94% susceptible) or vancomycin (95%). CNS was susceptible to Q/D (96% susceptible) and vancomycin (100% susceptible). One of 38 staphylococci and two of 17 E. faecium were tolerant to Q/D. In conclusion, Q/D showed excellent activity against all species of gram-positive cocci including MRSA, VISA, and VR E. faecium except E. faecalis, and may provide a valuable option for the treatment of infections caused by these emerging nosocomial pathogens of gram-positive cocci.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of piperacillin in several fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We investigated activity of piperacillin (PIPC) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. The following results were obtained: 1. PIPC had its MIC90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in Gram-positive bacteria (Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis) and showed its MIC of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible PRSP strains out of 38 isolates of S. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. PIPC showed favorable antibacterial activities as its MIC90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae), except for P. mirabilis in which its MIC90 was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of P. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as PIPC, ABPC, CTM and CZOP. 3. PIPC had its MIC90 of > 128 micrograms/ml in Bacteroides fragilis. From these results, PIPC was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when 20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1997 and March 1998].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 19 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during the period from April 1997 to March 1998. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 215 for one year. A total of 420 strains (170 strains from primary infections and 250 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 174 cases (80.9% of total cases). In primary infections, the isolation rate of anaerobic bacteria was higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, which was frequently isolated from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. We found neither vancomycin nor arbekacin resistant strains of S. aureus, and found no vancomycin resistant strains of Enterococcus spp. The susceptibility of P. aeruginosa against carbapenems did not decline in the year 1997, while resistance of B. fragilis group against cephems advanced increasingly.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro activity of 9 antimicrobials against bacterial strains isolated from patients in intensive care units in brazil: MYSTIC Antimicrobial Surveillance Program.
AB  - Multi-resistant bacterial strains are increasingly prevalent in hospital environments. Bacterial resistance is an important problem, especially for practitioners in intensive care units (ICUs) because of the selective pressure on the prevalent bacteria in these environments. The MYSTIC (Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection) study has been monitoring the performance of carbapenems and other antibiotics in different hospitals for at least 3 years. The in vitro activities of meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, piperacilin/tazobactam, gentamicin, and tobramycin were compared against 452 recent clinical aerobic isolates. The isolates consisted of 19 species of Gram-negative bacteria (n=290) including K. pneumoniae (n=49), E. coli (n=48), A. baumannii (n=47), Enterobacter spp. (n=41), and P. aeruginosa (n=33) and 9 species of Gram-positive bacteria (n=162) including Staphylococcus aureus (n=63), Enterococcus faecalis (n=22), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=22) and coagulase negative Staphylococci (n=21). All isolates were collected from ICU patients. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by Etest methodology, using standardized and controlled procedures. Meropenem and imipenem showed the lowest MIC(90) for all species tested. Gram-negative isolates showed the following overall resistance percentages to the other 7 drugs: tobramycin (43.1%), cefotaxime (38.6%), gentamicin (34.1%), ceftazidime (31.7%), ciprofloxacin (25.5%), piperacillin/tazobactam (26.9%), and cefepime (18.6%). Carbapenems were the most active drugs overall and only P. aeruginosa presented some degree of resistance (18.2%). We also evaluated the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) among all Enterobacteriaceae members (n=176) by Etest/ESBL strip. ESBL production was detected in 51 strains (29.0%). Among them, Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most prevalent at 59.2%, followed by Enterobacter spp. (19.5%) and E. coli (14.6%). The high level of resistance against several antimicrobials and the alarming rate of ESBL production may restrict therapeutic choice to the carbapenems in this selected group of patients.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of telithromycin (HMR 3647), three macrolides, amoxycillin, cefdinir and levofloxacin against gram-positive clinical isolates in Japan.
AB  - The in vitro activities (MIC and MBC) of telithromycin (HMR 3647) against clinical isolates in Japan were investigated in comparison with those of erythromycin A, clarithromycin, azithromycin, amoxycillin, cefdinir and levofloxacin. Telithromycin was more potent than the reference compounds against erythromycin A-susceptible or resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates possessing either mef (mefA or mefE) genes or the ermB gene. Against erythromycin A-susceptible or inducibly resistant Staphylococcus aureus and erythromycin A-susceptible and intermediate Enterococcus faecalis, telithromycin was highly active.
TI  - Evaluation of chlorhexidine and povidone iodine activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis using a surface test.
AB  - Most published studies of the activity of biocides against methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have been based on suspension tests. This study was undertaken to provide information on the effect of chlorhexidine and povidone iodine on bacteria dried on to surfaces, a situation in which biocide activity is known to be reduced. The inactivation of MRSA (10 strains), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 10 strains), VRE (nine strains) and vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus faecalis (VSE, 10 strains) by 0.5% aqueous chlorhexidine gluconate or 10% povidone iodine was evaluated by applying the European surface test method. Povidone iodine was equally active against resistant and sensitive strains of both species with microbicidal effects (ME), i.e. the log(10)concentration of micro-organisms compared with controls treated with distilled water, after 1.5 min of 3.14 and 3.49 for VRE and VSE respectively, and 3.47 and 3.78 for MRSA and MSSA. Chlorhexidine was equally active against VRE and VSE (ME 3.37 vs. 3. 56 after 7 min, respectively), but was significantly less active against MRSA as opposed to MSSA (ME 3.07 vs. 3.83 after 10 min, P= 0. 017).
TI  - Therapeutic efficacy of GAR-936, a novel glycylcycline, in a rat model of experimental endocarditis.
AB  - GAR-936, a novel glycylcycline, was investigated with a rat model of experimental endocarditis. It was compared with vancomycin against both vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. GAR-936 exhibited the lowest MICs (</=0.12 microgram/ml) in vitro against each of the isolates tested. Endocarditis was established by placement of a catheter across the aortic valve, followed by intravenous injection of 10(6) CFU of bacteria 48 h later. Treatment with GAR-936 or vancomycin was initiated 24 to 36 h after bacterial infection and administered subcutaneously twice a day for 3 days at ascending doses. GAR-936 reduced bacterial vegetation titers by >2 log(10) CFU, compared to those in untreated controls, for both vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant (VanA and VanB) E. faecalis strains and >4 log(10) CFU for a methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolate. The glycylcycline was more efficacious at a lower administered dose in the rat model of endocarditis than was vancomycin. The efficacy of GAR-936 in this model was apparently not enhanced by a factor in rat serum, as was observed for vancomycin with a time-kill curve. The results of this study demonstrate the therapeutic potential of GAR-936 for the treatment of enterococcal and staphylococcal infections and warrant further investigation.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of gram-positive bacteria based on grpE, encoded by the dnaK operon.
AB  - The dnaK operon in gram-positive bacteria includes grpE, dnaJ and, in some members, hrcA as well. Both DnaK and DnaJ have been utilized for constructing phylogenetic relationships among various organisms. Multiple copies exist for dnaK and dnaJ genes in some bacterial genera, as opposed to a single gene copy for grpE and for hrcA, according to the currently available data. Here, we present a partial protein-based phylogenetic tree for gram-positive bacteria, derived by using the amino acid sequence identity of GrpE; the results are compared with the phylogenetic trees generated from 5S rRNA, 16S rRNA, dnaK and dnaJ sequences. Our results indicate three main groupings: two are within low-G+C DNA gram-positive bacteria comprising Bacillus species and Staphylococcus aureus on the one hand and Streptococcus species/Lactococcus lactis/Enterococcus faecalis/Lactobacillus sakei on the other hand; the Mycobacterium species and Streptomyces coelicolor, belonging to the high-G+C DNA gram-positive bacteria, form the third cluster. This hierarchical arrangement is in close agreement with that obtained with 16S rRNA and DnaK sequences but not DnaJ-based phylogeny.
TI  - Solution-phase synthesis of a 1,5-dialkylamino-2,4-dinitrobenzene library and the identification of novel antibacterial compounds from this library.
AB  - In this report we demonstrate that a 1,5-dialkylamino-2,4-dinitrobenzene small molecule library can be generated by a highly efficient solution-phase synthesis method. From this 2485-member library, a series of novel compounds with antibacterial activity were isolated. The significance of this report is that the synthetic scheme is extremely simple, with minimal number of liquid handling steps, and the solvents and reagents left in the final library preparation are fully compatible with cell-based assays.
TI  - Characterization of reutericyclin produced by Lactobacillus reuteri LTH2584.
AB  - Lactobacillus reuteri LTH2584 exhibits antimicrobial activity that can be attributed neither to bacteriocins nor to the production of reuterin or organic acids. We have purified the active compound, named reutericyclin, to homogeneity and characterized its antimicrobial activity. Reutericyclin exhibited a broad inhibitory spectrum including Lactobacillus spp., Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria innocua. It did not affect the growth of gram-negative bacteria; however, the growth of lipopolysaccharide mutant strains of Escherichia coli was inhibited. Reutericyclin exhibited a bactericidal mode of action against Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, Staphylococcus aureus, and B. subtilis and triggered the lysis of cells of L. sanfranciscensis in a dose-dependent manner. Germination of spores of B. subtilis was inhibited, but the spores remained unaffected under conditions that do not permit germination. The fatty acid supply of the growth media had a strong effect on reutericyclin production and its distribution between producer cells and the culture supernatant. Reutericyclin was purified from cell extracts and culture supernatant of L. reuteri LTH2584 cultures grown in mMRS by solvent extraction, gel filtration, RP-C(8) chromatography, and anion-exchange chromatography, followed by rechromatography by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Reutericyclin was characterized as a negatively charged, highly hydrophobic molecule with a molecular mass of 349 Da. Structural characterization (A. Holtzel, M. G. Ganzle, G. J. Nicholson, W. P. Hammes, and G. Jung, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 39:2766-2768, 2000) revealed that reutericyclin is a novel tetramic acid derivative. The inhibitory activity of culture supernatant of L. reuteri LTH2584 corresponded to that of purified as well as synthetic reutericyclin.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis conjugative plasmid pAM373: complete nucleotide sequence and genetic analyses of sex pheromone response.
AB  - pAM373 is a 36.7 kb conjugative plasmid in Enterococcus faecalis that encodes a response to a peptide sex pheromone, cAM373, secreted by plasmid-free (recipient) strains of enterococci. It was identified over 15 years ago as one of five plasmids in E. faecalis strain RC73 and was of interest because a related pheromone activity could be detected in culture supernatants of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus gordonii. Because of increased clinical concern relating to the possibility of mobilizing vancomycin resistance determinants from enterococci, where they are becoming common, into pathogens such as S. aureus, efforts were initiated to characterize pAM373 further. The results of a complete nucleotide sequence determination of pAM373, as well as a genetic analysis of key genes related to regulation of the pheromone response, are reported here. With regard to determinants related to conjugation, the plasmid has a structural organization similar to other known pheromone-responsive plasmids such as pAD1, pCF10 and pPD1; however, there are several unique features. Although there are significant homologues relating to a pheromone-binding surface protein (TraC) and a negatively regulating protein (TraA), there is an absence of a determinant equivalent to traB of pAD1 (reduces endogenous pheromone) and a determinant for surface-exclusion protein. The precursor structure of the inhibitor peptide iAM373 was identified, and its determinant (iam373) was found to be about 500 nt upstream of an apparent transcription terminator t1. Tn917-lac insertion analyses provided interesting insights into aspects of control of the pheromone response and showed that, although the traA product is sensitive to pheromone, it appears to act differently from the traA homologue of pAD1.
TI  - In vitro activity of monoclonal and recombinant yeast killer toxin-like antibodies against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monoclonal (mAbKT) and recombinant single-chain (scFvKT) anti-idiotypic antibodies were produced to represent the internal image of a yeast killer toxin (KT) characterized by a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity, including gram-positive cocci. Pathogenic eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms, such as Candida albicans, Pneumocystis carinii, and a multidrug-resistant strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, presenting specific, although yet undefined, KT-cell wall receptors (KTR), have proven to be killed in vitro by mAbKT and scFvKT. mAbKT and scFvKT exert a therapeutic effect in vivo in experimental models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis by mimicking the functional activity of protective antibodies naturally produced in humans against KTR of infecting microorganisms. The swelling tide of concern over increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotic drugs gives the impetus to develop new therapeutic compounds against microbial threat. Thus, the in vitro bactericidal activity of mAbKT and scFvKT against gram-positive, drug-resistant cocci of major epidemiological interest was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: mAbKT and scFvKT generated by hybridoma and DNA recombinant technology from the spleen lymphocytes of mice immunized with a KT-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb KT4) were used in a conventional colony forming unit (CFU) assay to determine, from a qualitative point of view, their bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus, S. haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae strains. These bacterial strains are characterized by different patterns of resistance to antibiotics, including methicillin, vancomycin, and penicillin. RESULTS: According to the experimental conditions adopted, no bacterial isolate proved to be resistant to the activity of mAbKT and scFvKT. CONCLUSIONS: scFvKT exerted a microbicidal activity against multidrug resistant bacteria, which may represent the basis for the drug modeling of new antibiotics with broad antibacterial spectra to tackle the emergence of microbial resistance.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies to CNA, a collagen-binding microbial surface component recognizing adhesive matrix molecules, detach Staphylococcus aureus from a collagen substrate.
AB  - Previous studies showed that Staphylococcus aureus expresses a collagen-binding MSCRAMM (Microbial Surface Component Recognizing Adhesive Matrix Molecules), CNA, that is necessary and sufficient for S. aureus cells to adhere to cartilage and is a virulence factor in experimental septic arthritis. We have now used a monoclonal antibody (mAb) approach to further analyze the structure and function of CNA. 22 mAbs raised against the minimal ligand binding domain, CNA-(151-318), were shown to bind to the MSCRAMM with similar affinity. All mAbs appear to recognize conformation-dependent epitopes that were mapped throughout the CNA-(151-318) domain using a chimeric strategy where segments of CNA are grafted on ACE, a structurally related MSCRAMM from Enterococcus faecalis. These mAbs were able to inhibit (125)I-collagen binding to CNA-(151-318) as well as to intact S. aureus cells. They also interfered with the attachment of bacteria to collagen substrates. Furthermore, some of the mAbs could effectively displace (125)I-collagen bound to the bacteria. These displacing mAbs were also able to detach bacteria that had adhered to a collagen substrate in a preincubation, raising the possibility that some of the mAbs may be used as therapeutic agents.
TI  - The synthesis and antibacterial activity of totarol derivatives. Part 3: Modification of ring-B.
AB  - Ring-B derivatization of totarol (1) afforded the series of compounds 2-22 which  were screened in vitro against: beta-lactamase-positive and high level gentamycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Several of the derivatives retained much of the antibacterial activity of totatol against the first three of these organisms (all gram-positive), but none was more active. The gram-negative Klebsiella was resistant to all compounds examined. Totarol (1) was shown to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation in isolated mitochondria at 50 microM.
TI  - The synthesis and antibacterial activity of totarol derivatives. Part 2: Modifications at C-12 and O-13.
AB  - Alterations of the C-12 and C-13 aromatic ring substituents of totarol (1) afforded the series of derivatives 2-14, and introduction of substituents at C-12 gave exclusively 2a-14a. The majority of these analogues were tested in vitro against the following organisms: beta-lactamase-positive and high level gentamycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. The results were evaluated in terms of structure-activity relationship which reveals that: (a) the phenolic moiety at C-13, in general, is essential for antibacterial activity at < 32 microg/mL against gram-positive species, and (b) derivatization at C-12 has an undesirable effect on the antibacterial activity of this class of compounds, while (c) all compounds tested are ineffective against the gram-negative Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - [Results of antimicrobial susceptibilities of strains clinically isolated at 8 institutions in Hiroshima City to major oral antimicrobial drugs, mainly new quinolone drugs. Hiroshima Levofloxacin Susceptibility Surveillance Group].
AB  - To evaluate the resistance for major oral antimicrobial agents, mainly new quinolones, we carried out a drug susceptibility surveillance of 3,050 strains of 11 microbial species clinically isolated at 8 institutions such as general hospitals and examination centers in Hiroshima city. 10 antimicrobial agents were used: 3 new quinolone drugs, 5 beta-lactam drugs, minocycline and clarithromycin. Among Gram-positive bacteria, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecalis showed low susceptibility to the new quinolone drugs, while methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive to these drugs. Among Gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed high resistance for the new quinolone drugs, but enteric bacteria and Haemophilus influenzae did not show marked resistance, maintaining almost good sensitivity to these drugs. To reduce the appearance of resistant bacteria, appropriate antimicrobial agents should be selected. Drug susceptibility surveillance in the community will be also important in the future.
TI  - Ofloxacin-loaded liposomes: in vitro activity and drug accumulation in bacteria.
AB  - Different ofloxacin-loaded unilamellar vesicles were prepared by the extrusion technique, and their antimicrobial activities were determined in comparison to those of the free drug by means of MIC determinations with both American Type Culture Collection standards and wild-type bacterial strains (six strains of Enterococcus faecalis, seven strains of Escherichia coli, six strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and six strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The accumulation of ofloxacin and liposome-ofloxacin was measured by determining the amount of the drug inside the bacteria as a function of time. Encapsulated fluoroquinolone yielded MICs which were at least twofold lower than those obtained with the free drug. In particular, liposomes made up of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine-cholesterol-dipalmitoylphosphatidylser ine and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine-cholesterol-dihexadecylphosphate (4:3:4 molar ratio) provided the best improvement in antimicrobial activity against the various bacterial strains investigated. The liposome formulation produced higher intracellular fluoroquinolone concentrations than those achieved simultaneously with the free drug in both E. coli and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Mediastinitis after cardiac transplantation.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Assessment of incidence and behavior of mediastinitis after cardiac transplantation. METHODS: From 1985 to 1999, 214 cardiac transplantations were performed, 12 (5.6%) of the transplanted patients developed confirmed mediastinitis. Patient's ages ranged from 42 to 66 years (mean of 52.3 +/- 10.0 years) and 10 (83.3%) patients were males. Seven (58.3%) patients showed sternal stability on palpation, 4 (33.3%) patients had pleural empyema, and 2 (16.7%) patients did not show purulent secretion draining through the wound. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus was the infectious agent identified in the wound secretion or in the mediastinum, or both, in 8 (66.7%) patients. Staphylococcus epidermidis was identified in 2 (16.7%) patients, Enterococcus faecalis in 1 (8.3%) patient, and the cause of mediastinitis could not be determined in 1 (8.3%) patient. Surgical treatment was performed on an emergency basis, and the extension of the debridement varied with local conditions. In 2 (16.7%) patients, we chose to leave the surgical wound open and performed daily dressings with granulated sugar. Total sternal resection was performed in only 1 (8.3%) patient. Out of this series, 5 (41.7%) patients died, and the causes of death were related to the infection. Autopsy revealed persistence of mediastinitis in 1 (8.3%) patient. CONCLUSION: Promptness in diagnosing mediastinitis and precocious surgical drainage have changed the natural evolution of this disease. Nevertheless, observance of the basic precepts of prophylaxis of infection is still the best way to treat mediastinitis.
TI  - Bacteriostatic effects of cerium-humic acid complex: an experimental study.
AB  - The bacteriostatic potency of the cerium-humic acid complex was evaluated by experimental measurement of this complex interaction with E. coli, Bacillus pyocyaneus, Staphylococcus aureus, Leuconostoc and Streptococcus faecalis, and by comparison bacteriostatic effects with the cerium-citrate complex. The experimental results indicated that the cerium-humic acid complex strongly inhibited growth of all five bacterial strains, and its diameter of bacteriostatic circles were more than 30 mm. The minimal bacteria-inhibiting concentration were 1 x 10(-3), 2 x 10(-3) and 1 x 10(-2) mol/L for E. coli and Bacillus pyocyaneus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Leuconostoc and Streptococcus faecalis individually, and the measured minimal bactericidal concentrations were 2 x 10(-3) and 1 x 10(-2) mol/L for Bacillus pyocyaneus, E. coli, and Leuconostoc. To kill Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis, the concentration had to be more than 1 x 10(-20 mol/L. On the contrary, we found that cerium-citrate complex did not inhibit the growth of the above five bacteria, but stimulated bacterial growth. The completely different bacteriostatic results of two cerium complexes may hint that the association and chemical properties of the two complexes were different.
TI  - Diversity of ace, a gene encoding a microbial surface component recognizing adhesive matrix molecules, from different strains of Enterococcus faecalis and evidence for production of ace during human infections.
AB  - Our previous work reported that most Enterococcus faecalis strains adhered to the extracellular matrix proteins collagen types I and IV and laminin after growth at 46 degrees C, but not 37 degrees C, and we subsequently identified an E. faecalis sequence, ace, that encodes a bacterial adhesin similar to the collagen binding protein Cna of Staphylococcus aureus. In this study, we examined the diversity of E. faecalis-specific ace gene sequences among different isolates obtained from various geographic regions as well as from various clinical sources. A comparison of nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of Ace from nine E. faecalis strains identified a highly conserved N-terminal A domain, followed by a variable B domain which contains two to five repeats of 47 amino acids in tandem array, preceded by a 20-amino-acid partial repeat. Using 17 other strains collected worldwide, the 5' region of ace that encodes the A domain was sequenced, and these sequences showed > or =97.5% identity. Among the previously reported five amino acids critical for collagen binding by Cna of S. aureus, four were found to be identical in Ace from all strains tested. Polyclonal immune rabbit serum prepared against recombinant Ace A derived from E. faecalis strain OG1RF detected Ace in mutanolysin extracts of seven of nine E. faecalis strains after growth at 46 degrees C; Ace was detected in four different molecular sizes that correspond to the variation in the B repeat region. To determine if there was any evidence to indicate that Ace might be produced under physiological conditions, we quantitatively assayed sera collected from patients with enterococcal infections for the presence of anti-Ace A antibodies. Ninety percent of sera (19 of 21) from patients with E. faecalis endocarditis showed reactivity with titers from 1:32 to >1:1,024; the only 2 sera which lacked antibodies to Ace A had considerably lower titers of antibodies to other E. faecalis antigens as well. Human-derived, anti-Ace A immunoglobulins G purified from an E. faecalis endocarditis patient serum inhibited adherence of 46 degrees C-grown E. faecalis OG1RF to collagen types I and IV and laminin. In conclusion, these results show that ace is highly conserved among isolates of E. faecalis, with at least four variants related to the differences in the B domain, is expressed by different strains during infection in humans, and human-derived antibodies can block adherence to these extracellular matrix proteins.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of temporin A analogs.
AB  - Temporin A (TA) is a small, basic, highly hydrophobic, antimicrobial peptide amide (FLPLIGRVLSGIL-NH2) found in the skin of the European red frog, Rana temporaria. It has variable antibiotic activities against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, including clinically important methicillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus as well as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium strains. In this investigation the antimicrobial activity and structural characteristics of TA synthetic analogs were studied. For antibacterial activity against S. aureus and enterococcal strains, the hydrophobicity of the N-terminal amino acid of TA was found to be important as well as a positive charge at amino acid position 7, and bulky hydrophobic side chains at positions 5 and 12. Replacing isoleucine with leucine at amino acid positions 5 and 12 resulted in the greatest enhancement of antibacterial activity. In addition, there was little difference between the activities of TA and its all-D enantiomer, indicating that the peptide probably exerts its effect on bacteria via non-chiral interactions with membrane lipids.
TI  - Evaluation of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid) and RPR 106972 stability in susceptibility testing media.
AB  - In response to conflicting reports on the chemical stability of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a study was designed to assess the in vitro longevity and effects of media and storage conditions on this streptogramin combination. Broth microdilution trays containing parenteral (quinupristin/dalfopristin) and oral (RPR 106972) streptogramin combinations as well as pristinomycin components (P-I and P-II) were preincubated at 35 degrees C for 12-72 h before inoculation with control strains (Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619, Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213) and five clinical isolates with various drug resistance phenotypes. Overall, the mean quinupristin/dalfopristin activity loss was 24%/12 h, 41%/18 h, 43%/24 h, 69%/48 h and 79%/72 h with no detected loss of potency when measured by E. faecalis until 18 h. RPR 106972 mean activity loss was 6%/12 h, 19%/18 h, 19%/24 h, 56%/48 h and 71%/72 h with no loss of potency as measured by S. aureus until 48 h. Overall, P-I components had greater stability as compared with P-II for both drug combinations. Bioassays showed similar trends in decreased activity. Bioassay differences among media types were only significant (> 3 mm; greater loss of potency) for haemophilus test media for both P-II components at 72 h. The presence of an organism in the medium had no effect on stability assay results. The effect of storage temperature (4, 25 degrees C) on quinupristin/dalfopristin and RPR 106972 stability was also detrimental to drug potency indicating the requirement for rigid quality assurance for streptogramin diagnostic reagents when determining activity by reference or standardized susceptibility tests.
TI  - Evaluation of gemifloxacin (SB-265805, LB20304a): in vitro activity against over  6000 gram-positive pathogens from diverse geographic areas.
AB  - Gemifloxacin (GEMI), formerly SB-265805 and LB20304, is a newer fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum activity against a wide variety of bacterial pathogens. The present investigation extended earlier observations by sampling an additional 6790 gram-positive organisms from more than 50 medical centres on three continents. The reference broth microdilution method with recommended medium supplements was used throughout. Selected results (number strains tested; MIC90 for GEMI/trovafloxacin in mg/l; % < or = 1 mg/l for GEMI/trovafloxacin) were: Staphylococcus aureus (3672; 2/2; 86/85), S. epidermidis (404; 1/>4; 92/71), Enterococcus faecalis (630; 4/>4; 76/66), E. faecium (216; > 4/>4; 15/11), Streptococcus pneumoniae (300; 0.06/0.25; 100/97), beta-haemolytic streptococci (150; 0.06/0.25; 100/100) and viridans group streptococci (150; 0.12/0.25; 99/97). Gemifloxacin appeared equal or superior to trovafloxacin in its overall gram-positive spectrum of activity pending a choice of the susceptible breakpoint concentration. Continued in vitro, pharmacodynamic and clinical investigations of gemifloxacin appear warranted.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1998). III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - Susceptibilities to various antimicrobial agents were examined for Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Echerichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that were isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 9 hospitals during June 1998 to May 1999, and the results were compared with those obtained during the same period from 1990 to 1997 in uncomplicated UTIs and complicated UTIs. Among E. faecalis strains, those with low susceptibilities to almost drugs have increased in the latest period. All 5 S. aureus strains isolated from uncomplicated UTIs were the most susceptible to gentamicin (GM). Over 50% of S. aureus strains isolated from complicated UTIs were susceptible to GM, and on the contrary the resistant strains have increased with the MIC90 of 256 micrograms/ml or above. Among S. aureus strains isolated from complicated UTIs, those with low susceptibilities to arbekacin (ABK) have increased in the latest period compared to those during period of 1996-1997, and the MIC90s of them have changed into the lower state from 1 microgram/ml in 1996-1997 to 4 micrograms/ml in 1998. S. aureus strains have continued high susceptibilities to vancomycin (VCM). The susceptibilities to minocycline (MINO) of E. coli showed MIC90: 4 micrograms/ml in 1997, but those have returned in the latest period in uncomplicated UTIs. The MIC90s of ofloxacin (OFLX) to E. coli isolated from uncomplicated and complicated UTIs have been lower 2-3 classes in the latest period than those in 1997. Among Klebsiella spp. strains isolated from uncomplicated UTIs, those with low susceptibilities to almost cephems had increased in 1997, but few of them were detected in the latest study. The sensitive strains of P. aeruginosa to almost drugs have increased during the latest period. The MIC50s of cefozopran (CZOP) and OFLX against P. aeruginosa were the best in our history. The sensitive strains of P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime (CAZ) have increased and its percentage was 30%. Piperacilline (PIPC), cefoperazone (CPZ), GM and OFLX resistant P. aeruginosa strains have increased in the latest period.
TI  - Inactivation of the stress- and starvation-inducible gls24 operon has a pleiotrophic effect on cell morphology, stress sensitivity, and gene expression in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis induces the synthesis of at least 42 proteins during 24 h of glucose starvation. Because of its induction during carbohydrate and complete starvation (incubation in tap water) and CdCl(2) and bile salts stresses, one of these proteins (Gls24) was qualified as a "general stress protein" and was analyzed at the molecular level. Its corresponding gene, gls24, seems to be the penultimate gene of an operon composed, altogether, of six open reading frames (ORFs). The ORF preceding gls24 (orf4) showed very strong identity with gls24. The deduced polypeptides of these two genes showed similarity with a 20-kDa hypothetical protein from Lactococcus lactis and an alkaline stress protein from Staphylococcus aureus with no previously known biological significance. Data from the operon sequence and Northern analysis led to the conclusions that (i) gls24 possesses its own promoter which is especially induced at the onset of starvation and (ii) the operon promoter is stress inducible in exponential-phase cells. A mutation in the gls24 gene led to a severe reduction of growth rate and reduction of survival against 0.3% bile salts in the 24-h-starved cells compared to the wild-type strain. Moreover, the chain length of the mutant is significantly reduced during growth. These results argue strongly for a role of the protein Gls24 and/or GlsB in morphological changes and in stress tolerance in E. faecalis. Comparison of two-dimensional protein gels from wild-type cells with those from gls24 mutant cells revealed a pleiotropic effect of the mutation on gene expression. At least nine proteins were present in larger amounts in the mutant. For six of them, the corresponding N-terminal microsequence has been obtained. Three of these sequences map in genes coding for L-lactate dehydrogenase, lipoamide dehydrogenase, and pyruvate decarboxylase, all involved in pyruvate metabolism.
TI  - [Bacteriologic and clinical analysis of nosocomial infections in patients from the intensive care unit].
AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate what pathogens are mainly responsible for infection among all hospitalised at our ITU patients, to define the influence of antibiotic use on the aetiology of nosocomial infection. The research was conducted on a six-bedded surgical ITU in a 700-bed teaching hospital from January 1995 till June 1996. In August 1995 we changed infection control protocols (more stress on: handwashing with antiseptic soaps and routine microbiological culture for early prediction of infection) and antibiotic guidelines on our ITU (third generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and Vancomycin were used only as the last option and never in prevention). 1276 samples for microbiological culture were obtained in routine manner. From 60% positive cultures 1216 strains were isolated (Tab. 1) and resistance to antibiotics were defined (Tab. 3). Monthly antibiotic consumption was expressed in defined daily dose (DDD) for 1000 hospitalisation-days. DDD = (X/Y)/Z x x 1000, were: X-cumulative antibiotic consumption during analysed period (g), Y-standard daily dose (g/24 h), Z-number of hospitalisation-days during analysed period (Tab. 2). Values were expressed as the mean +/- standard error (SE). Relationships between variables were analysed using linear correlation. All data were categorised for the frequency table. Statistically significant differences were considered to exist when calculated p values were less than 0.05. There were no statistically significant differences in the number of treated patients, length of stay and mortality rate on our ITU in 18 months. 58% of isolated strains were Gram-negative bacteria especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22%) and Acinetobacter spp. (16%) and Proteus spp. (9%). The commonly isolated Gram-positive bacteria were Enterococcus faecalis (14%), Staphylococcus aureus (12%)--of which 90% were MRSA. In 8% of cases we have isolated Candida spp. Monthly antibiotic consumption was displayed in table 2. Trend analysis confirmed reduction in Ofloxacin, fluoroquinolones and Colistin consumption over 18 months period (Fig. 2). We observed statistically significant decrease in amount of isolated Proteus spp. strains from 70 in I'95 to 31 in II'95 (p < 0.05) and 10 in I'96 (p < 0.005). This observation was confirmed in trend analysis (Fig. 1). We have observed in analysed period improvement in activities of third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones (Tab. 3). We have analysed the influence of antibiotic use on the aetiology of nosocomial infection. Table 4 shows statistically significant correlation between Acinetobacter spp., MRSA, MRSE isolates and antibiotics consumption. Crosstabulated variables analyses confirm MRSE outbreaks in periods when excessive amount of Amikacin (p < 0.05 for chi 2 test, D Somer rate 0.59, V Cramer rate 0.67), aminoglicosides (p < 0.05 for chi 2 test, D Somer rate 0.57, V Cramer rate 0.59), imipenem (p < 0.05 for chi 2 test, D Somer rate 0.44, V Cramer rate 0.60) and total antibiotics consumption were high (p < 0.005 for chi 2 test, D Somer rate 0.67, V Cramer rate 0.81) (Fig. 3). This study illustrates the influence of antimicrobial therapy on the species and the resistance of strains isolated in nosocomial infection. Restrictive antibiotics policy does not affect ITU outcome. Better strategies for antibiotic administration in the ITU setting may improve their efficacy and control the spread of nosocomial infection caused by multi-resistant organisms. Therefore, restrictive antibiotic policy would be mandatory in each hospital and department.

TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activities of novel anilinouracils which selectively inhibit DNA polymerase III of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The 6-anilinouracils are novel dGTP analogs that selectively inhibit the replication-specific DNA polymerase III of gram-positive eubacteria. Two specific derivatives, IMAU (6-[3'-iodo-4'-methylanilino]uracil) and EMAU (6-[3'-ethyl-4'-methylanilino]uracil), were substituted with either a hydroxybutyl (HB) or a methoxybutyl (MB) group at their N3 positions to produce four agents: HB-EMAU, MB-EMAU, HB-IMAU, and MB-IMAU. These four new agents inhibited Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium. Time-kill assays and broth dilution testing confirmed bactericidal activity. These anilinouracil derivatives represent a novel class of antimicrobials with promising activities against gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to currently available agents, validating replication-specific DNA polymerase III as a new target for antimicrobial development.
TI  - Photochemical inactivation of bacteria and HIV in buffy-coat-derived platelet concentrates under conditions that preserve in vitro platelet function.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A photochemical process has been tested for the inactivation of viruses and bacteria in buffy-coat derived platelet concentrates (BC PCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: BC PCs in 35% CPD plasma and 65% platelet-additive solution (PAS III) were exposed to photochemical treatment (PCT) with 150 microM of the psoralen S-59 and a 3 J/cm(2) treatment with long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA, 320-400 nm). Platelet function was evaluated following PCT using a panel of in vitro assays. RESULTS: This PCT process was highly effective at inactivating gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens). No viable bacteria were detected following PCT and 7 days of platelet storage while bacterial growth was detected in paired untreated control BC PCs. Complete inactivation of the gram-positive Bacillus cereus was achieved only in one of two replicate experiments with BC PCs. PCT was also highly effective for inactivation of human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 in BC PCs inoculated with approximately 10(6) tissue culture infectious doses per milliliter (TCID(50)/ml) of cell-associated HIV-1. Rapid inactivation was observed with increasing UVA doses: with 150 microM S-59 and a 1 J/cm(2) treatment of UVA, a reduction of 5.6+/-0.5 log TCID(50)/ml was achieved, and a reduction of >6.4 log TCID(50)/ml was achieved with 150 microM S-59 and a 3 J/cm(2) treatment of UVA. No physiologically relevant differences in platelet functions were found between the test and the control BC PCs during 7 days of storage. CONCLUSION: PCT with 150 microM S-59 and a 3 J/cm(2) UVA treatment does not adversely affect in vitro properties of BC PCs stored at 22 degrees C for 7 days. The PCT process inactivated bacteria and HIV-1 inoculated into the BC PCs. These results extend the earlier reported efficacy of PCT apheresis PCs to BC PCs.
TI  - [The primary screening of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli strains to develop effective probiotic preparations based on them].
AB  - 10 Bifidobacterium strains and 10 Lactobacillus strains were studied for their antagonistic activity with respect to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella ozaenae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and for their sensitivity to antibiotics, widely used in clinical practice. L. acidophilus strain 5/4, L. acidophilus strain 18/4, B. adolescentis strain UX, B. longum strain 44 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity and the highest degree of antibiotic resistance. The restriction analysis of the chromosomal DNA of these strains was then made and their plasmid content was studied, making it possible to recognize these strains in future in the course of in vivo experiments.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1998). II. Background of patients].
AB  - Clinical background was investigated on 449 patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) from whom 591 bacterial strains were isolated in 9 hospitals during the period from June, 1998 through May, 1999. About distribution of age and sex of patients and type of infections, among males, patients less than 50 years old were few, and uncomplicated UTIs without indwelling catheters was most frequent. Among females, patients less than 20 years old were few, and uncomplicated was most frequent. Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated in uncomplicated UTIs, and the higher the ages of patients, the higher were became the isolation frequencies of Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus spp. and Klebsiella spp. In complicated UTIs with indwelling catheters and without indwelling catheters, the types of pathogens had no relation with ages. The complication of infections had decreased E. coli but that had increased Proteus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Until last year, use of antibiotics had decreased pathogens isolated from patients with uncomplicated UTIs drastically in our study. But, pathogens isolated after antibiotics had increased in 1998. As for surgical procedures and types of causative organisms in UTIs, E. faecalis were more isolated when surgical procedures were experienced, and E. coli were more isolated when they were not in uncomplicated and complicated UTIs without indwelling catheters. In complicated UTIs with indwelling catheters, types of causative organisms had no relationship with surgical procedures.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of 9-O-acyl- and 9-O-benzoyl-substituted berberrubines.
AB  - In the course of a structure-activity relationship study on berberrubine derivatives, a series of compounds bearing 9-O-acyl-(4-6) and 9-O-benzoyl- (7) substituents was synthesized with the expectation of increasing the antimicrobial activity. One of the berberrubine derivatives, 9-lauroylberberrubine chloride was the most active against Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis as well as the Gram-negative bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae in comparison to berberine, the currently used antibiotic in clinic. This result suggested that the presence of lipophilic substituents of certain structures and sizes might be crucial for the optimal antimicrobial activity.
TI  - [The range of antagonistic effects of Lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, Bacteroides spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. On the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus Lactobacillus, most frequently L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the same environment. The diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. Thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this ecosystem. The aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. It was found that nearly all of the tested Lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against Gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit Gram-positive aerobic cocci as Enterococcus faecalis or Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Comparison of a rabbit model of bacterial endocarditis and an in vitro infection  model with simulated endocardial vegetations.
AB  - Animal models are commonly used to determine the efficacy of various antimicrobial agents for treatment of bacterial endocarditis. Previously we have utilized an in vitro infection model, which incorporates simulated endocardial vegetations (SEVs) to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of various antibiotics. In the present study, we compared four experimental rabbit endocarditis protocols to an in vitro infection model in an effort to determine if these models are comparable. We have evaluated the activity of clinafloxacin, trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin in rabbit models against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp. In vitro models were performed simulating the antibiotic pharmacokinetics obtained in the in vivo studies. Models were dosed the same as rabbit models, and SEVs were evaluated at the same time the rabbit vegetations were examined. Clinafloxacin and trovafloxacin were evaluated against methicillin-susceptible (MSSA1199) and -resistant (MRSA494) strains of S. aureus. Ciprofloxacin was studied against MSSA1199 and MSSA487. Sparfloxacin and clinafloxacin were evaluated against Enterococcus faecium SF2149 and Enterococcus faecalis WH245, respectively. We found that reductions in SEV bacterial density obtained in the in vitro model were similar to those obtained in rabbit vegetations, indicating that the SEV model may be a valuable tool for assessing antibiotic potential in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis.
TI  - A new rapid automated method for the detection of Listeria from environmental swabs and sponges.
AB  - Many food and meat processors test environmental swabs and sponges to confirm the absence of Listeria spp. Spectral pattern changes in a liquid growth medium, resulting from esculin hydrolysis by Listeria in contaminated swabs and sponges, were automatically monitored by the BioSys instrument in a semifluid layer (SFL). The blackening of SFL in modified MOX broth resulted in sharply declining curves, which were easily detected by the instrument. The instrument detected all nine strains of Listeria monocytogenes tested. None of the gram negative organisms (Proteus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas, Citrobacter and Yersinia) were detected by the system, nor were most gram positive organisms, including Bacillus, Streptococcus, and Lactobacillus strains, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis, which hydrolyze esculin, produced black colonies on PALCAM and Oxford media and were also detected in the system. A total of 122 sponges and swabs collected at food processing plants were evaluated by this method. Of these, 99 were negative, and 11 were positive. L. innocua was the dominant Listeria species in these environmental samples. Good correlation was obtained between numbers of Listeria and detection times of esculin hydrolysis: 1000 CFU/swab were detected in 10-13 h, whereas 1-10 CFU/swab were detected in less than 22 h. The total assay time was 26 h.
TI  - [The vaginal Bifidobacterium flora in women of reproductive age].
AB  - The composition of vaginal bifidoflora in 56 clinically healthy women of reproductive age was studied. The study revealed that four species of bifidobacteria, viz. Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. breve, B. adolescentis 2 and B. longum, dominated in the composition of this bifidobacterial population. Nine out of 11 isolated strains were found to be capable of inhibiting indicator microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis when tested in vitro; in addition, strains B. adolescentis 2 F1, B. bifidum G1, B. breve P2 and B. longum Z4 inhibited Klebsiella ozaenae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and were also active acid producers. Three of these 4 bifidobacterial strains were capable of adhesion to vaginal epitheliocytes, while B. bifidum G1 was practically incapable of adherence to these cells, similarly to B. bifidum strain 791 of intestinal origin. In addition, the spectra of antibiotic susceptibility varied from strain to strain, but all bifidobacterial strains were susceptible to benzylpenicillin and resistant to lomefloxacin, most of them being also resistant to cyprofloxacin and gentamicin. Thus the data presented in this work are indicative of the possibility and advantages of using bifidobacterial strains belonging to this ecological niche as probiotics for the correction of the microflora of the urogenital tract in females.
TI  - [The antagonistic activity of bifidobacteria in vitro and in vivo studied by using gnotobiological technology].
AB  - The antagonistic activity of 4 strains of bifidobacteria (B. adolescentis 2 F1, B. longum Z4, B. breve R2 and B. bifidum G1), isolated from the vagina of healthy females of the reproductive age, with respect to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella ozaenae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gardnerella vaginalis were studied in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro experiments revealed that all above-mentioned bifidobacteria were capable of inhibiting the growth of all indicator bacterial strains. Still of all the bifidobacteria under study had different levels of activity. B. adolescentis strain 2 F1 exhibited the highest inhibiting activity in vitro. In contrast to in vitro experiments, in vivo experiments with B. breve R2 demonstrated its high antagonistic activity with respect to E. coli. The data thus obtained indicate that in the study of antagonistic activity the use of the in vivo model as also expedient, for it is mainly in vivo that probiotic preparations show their activity.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - Purification, characterization, and primary structure of a novel cell wall hydrolytic amidase, CwhA, from Achromobacter lyticus.
AB  - A novel bacteriolytic enzyme CwhA (cell wall hydrolytic amidase) was purified by  ion exchange and gel-filtration chromatographies from a commercial bacteriolytic preparation from Achromobacter lyticus. CwhA exhibited optimal pH at 8.5 and lysed CHCl(3)-treated Escherichia coli more efficiently than Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pediococcus acidilactici. The enzyme was inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline strongly and by EDTA to a lesser extent, suggesting that it is probably a metalloenzyme. Amino acid composition and mass spectrometric analyses for the CwhA-derived M. luteus muropeptides revealed that CwhA is N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase [EC 3.5.1. 28]. The complete amino acid sequence of CwhA was established by a combination of Edman degradation and mass spectrometry for peptides obtained by Achromobacter protease I (API) digestion and cyanogen bromide (CNBr) cleavage. The enzyme consists of a single polypeptide chain of 177 amino acid residues with one disulfide bond, Cys114-Cys121. CwhA was found to be homologous to N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase from bacteriophage T7 (BPT7). Its sequence identity with BPT7 is 35%, but the amino acid residues functioning as zinc ligands in BPT7 are absent in CwhA. These results suggest that CwhA is a new type of N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a potent antibacterial agent, NH125 against drug-resistant bacteria.
AB  - New imidazole compounds were synthesized to develop a novel and effective antibacterial agent (1-benzyl-3-cetyl-2-methylimidazolium iodide, NH125). In vitro experiments demonstrated that NH125 effectively inhibited a number of different histidine protein kinases. Furthermore, oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ORSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRS), and other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were found to be very sensitive to NH125.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - Structure-activity relationships in the series of eremomycin carboxamides.
AB  - A series of new carboxamides of the glycopeptide antibiotic eremomycin was synthesized and investigated in vitro. The goal of the study was the comparison of the influence of the substituents introduced onto the eremomycin skeleton on the activity of these compounds against vancomycin susceptible and resistant bacterial strains. Eremomycin amides derived from amines with small substituents (C0 approximately C4) demonstrated antibacterial activity against vancomycin susceptible strains similar to that of the parent antibiotic and were inactive against vancomycin resistant strains. The derivatives of alkylamines with linear lipophilic substituents (like C10H21) were active against VanA and VanB enterococci strains with the scope of activity similar to that of N'-decyl or 7d-CH2NH-decyl eremomycins described earlier. Eremomycin amides of 5-methoxy- and 5-benzyloxytryptamine were active both against vancomycin susceptible and resistant strains. The introduction of a spacer (lysine or piperazine) between the decyl and antibiotic moieties did not seriously influence antibacterial properties of the compounds in comparison with the corresponding derivatives without a spacer. The most active carboxamides are of interest for secondary modifications of the antibiotic.
TI  - Sinusitis as a cause of orbital cellulitis.
AB  - To determine the importance of sinusitis as a cause of orbital cellulitis, the causative organisms and peak age of occurrence, 25 patients hospitalized with orbital cellulitis (ages 8 months to 17 years; 80%, 1-4 years) were studied. Complete blood counts were carried out and radiographic sinus examinations and eye swabs (for culturing) performed prior to antibiotic treatment. Sinusitis was evident in 72% of the patients. Eye swab cultures indicated 80% had streptococcal, staphylococcal or enterococcal infection. The data indicate that sinusitis is an important cause of orbital cellulitis. The most common causative organisms were Streptococcus viridans (44%) and Staphylococcus aureus (32%). Initial antibiotics should therefore cover both organisms.
TI  - Problems associated with the direct viable count procedure applied to gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Despite the numerous advantages of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for identifying a single bacterial cell with 16S rRNA probes, problems are encountered with starving bacteria in natural samples. The original direct viable count procedure (DVC) includes a revivification step in the presence of an antibiotic inhibiting cell division. Cells elongate and accumulate ribosomes. This results in a natural amplification of 16S rRNA molecules (target of FISH). However, it is limited to gram-negative bacteria which are sensitive to nalidixic acid. The objective of this study was to develop a procedure for estimating the number of metabolically active gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis cells by the use of a method which combines the number of substrate-responsive cells and their identification by FISH. It was observed that no single published DVC method could apply to taxonomically different gram-positive bacteria. Since cells were not counted, the revivification step in presence of nalidixic acid will be referred to as revivification without cell division. For each species, different low-nutrient media and complex media, different fluoroquinolones and beta-lactam antibiotics, concentrations of antibiotics, combinations of antibiotics, temperature and time were evaluated using bacteria in different physiological states and in natural samples. Enumeration of bacteria by plate counts and direct FISH were compared. The improved procedure should yield information about the physiological state, the taxonomic identity, and the enumeration of viable gram-positive bacteria. The application of DVC to an entire ecosystem is presently still a challenge.
TI  - Butyrolactones from Aspergillus terreus.
AB  - In the process development of lovastatin using Aspergillus terreus DRCC 152 in solid state fermentation, we have isolated a new butyrolactone-IV (3) along with the previously reported butyrolactone-I (1) and butyrolactone-II (2) produced under submerged conditions. The structure of compound 3 has been characterized as 3-hydroxy-5-[2-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)-2(R)-2,3-dihydro-benzo[b]furan- 5 ylmethyl]-4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-methoxycarbonyl-(5R)-2,5-dihydro-2 -furanone on the basis of spectroscopic studies. The absolute stereochemistry has been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The cytotoxic and antibacterial activities of these compounds were determined.
TI  - Comparative killing rates of fluoroquinolones and cell wall-active agents.
AB  - Killing rates of fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, and vancomycin were compared against Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, pneumococci, streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis. The times required for fluoroquinolones to decrease viability by 3 log(10) were 1.5 h for Enterobacteriaceae, 4 to 6 h for staphylococci, and >/=6 h for streptococci and enterococci. Thus, the rate of killing by fluoroquinolones is organism group dependent; overall, they killed more rapidly than beta-lactams and vancomycin.
TI  - In vitro activities of LY333328 and comparative agents against nosocomial gram-positive pathogens collected in a 1997 global surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LY333328 was evaluated for 1,479 nosocomial gram-positive pathogens isolated in 12 countries during 1997. LY333328 MICs at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited for Enterococcus faecalis (n = 351), Enterococcus faecium (n = 100), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 593), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species (n = 325), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 110) were 1, 1, 2, 2, and 0.015 microg/ml, respectively. LY333328 demonstrated potent activity against isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.
TI  - Effects of Enterococcus faecalis fsr genes on production of gelatinase and a serine protease and virulence.
AB  - Three agr-like genes (fsrA, fsrB, and fsrC, for Enterococcus faecalis regulator)  were found upstream of the previously reported gelatinase gene (gelE) and a downstream putative serine protease gene (sprE; accession number Z12296) of Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF. The deduced amino acid sequence of fsrA shows 26% identity and 38% similarity to Staphylococcus aureus AgrA (the response regulator of the accessory gene regulator system in the agr locus), FsrB shows 23% identity and 41% similarity to S. aureus AgrB, and FsrC shows 23% identity and 36% similarity to S. aureus AgrC (the sensor transducer of Agr system). Northern blot analysis suggested that gelE and sprE are cotranscribed and that fsrB and fsrC are also cotranscribed in OG1RF. Northern blot analysis of fsrA, fsrB, fsrC, gelE, and sprE insertion mutants showed that fsrB, fsrC, gelE, and sprE are not expressed in fsrA, fsrB, and fsrC mutants, while insertion in an open reading frame further upstream of fsrA did not effect the expression of these genes, suggesting that agr-like genes may be autoregulated and that they regulate gelE and sprE expression, as further confirmed by complementation of fsr gene mutations with a 6-kb fragment which contains all three fsr genes in the shuttle vector, pAT18. Testing of 95 other isolates of E. faecalis showed that 62% produced gelatinase (Gel(+)), while 91% (including all Gel(+) strains) hybridized to a gelE probe; 71% (including all Gel(+) strains) hybridized to an fsr probe, corroborating the conclusion that both gelE and fsr are necessary for gelatinase production. Testing of fsrA, fsrB, and sprE mutants in a mouse peritonitis model showed that sprE and agr-like gene mutants resulted in highly significantly prolonged survival compared to the parent strain OG1RF, a finding similar to what we had previously shown for a gelE mutant. These results suggest that sprE and agr-like genes contribute to the virulence of E. faecalis OG1RF in this model.
TI  - Equivalence of lauric acid and glycerol monolaurate as inhibitors of signal transduction in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Glycerol monolaurate (GML) inhibits the expression of virulence factors in Staphylococus aureus and the induction of vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecalis, presumably by blocking signal transduction. Although GML is rapidly hydrolyzed by bacteria, one of the products, lauric acid, has identical inhibitory activity and is metabolized much more slowly. At least four distinct GML-hydrolyzing activities are identified in S. aureus: the secreted Geh lipase, residual supernatant activity in a geh-null mutant strain, a novel membrane-bound esterase, and a cytoplasmic activity.
TI  - [Advantages and disadvantages in the use of central venous catheters in children  with malignant diseases].
AB  - The authors report the problem of central venous catheter appliance to the children with malignant diseases, employed for the first time in Bosnia and Herzegovina with the aim of pediatric oncologic patients treatment. During 1997 central venous catheter type Hickman was used in nine children between two and half to eleven years old (average six years and one months). The average time of catheter placement was six months, in two cases catheter were eliminated after two and three months respectively since application (spontaneous elimination and repeated septic attacks, caused bu resistant bacterial strains). Gram-positive bacteria have been isolated with eight children (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis), and gram-negative enterobacteriaceae (Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytocia and pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella group C and Enterococcus faecalis) in samples taken from the catheter and hemoculture. The central venous catheter is useful in treating oncological patients, but may cause serious consequences, like local infections or septicaemia.
TI  - [In vitro activities of levofloxacin and other antibiotics against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - In this study, the in vitro activity of levofloxacin (LVFX) against 1,020 fresh bacterial clinical isolates was compared with the activities of a range of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin (CPFX), ampicillin (ABPC), cefaclor, cefpodoxime, methicillin and benzylpenicillin. The clinical isolates except Vibrio cholerae were collected in Japan during 1998 from patients with infectious diseases. MICs were determined using the agar dilution method according to the recommendations by the Japan Society of Chemotherapy. Some isolates of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus were resistant to fluoroquinolones, but the MIC50 of LVFX against MRSA was 6.25 micrograms/ml. LVFX was the most active against MRSA among the antibiotics tested. Most of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were susceptible to the fluoroquinolones. LVFX showed greater activity against all streptococci strains compared with fluoroquinolones tested. In particular, all Streptococcus pneumoniae strains including PRSP were susceptible to LVFX at < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml. Among Enterococcus, ABPC showed superior activity against Enterococcus faecalis but many isolates of Enterococcus species were resistant to ABPC. LVFX was more active against to these Enterococcus species compared with other fluoroquinolones. On the other hand, LVFX and CPFX showed similar activity against isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. CPFX had an MIC50/90 of 0.20, 0.39 microgram/ml and LVFX showed an MIC50/90 of 0.78, 1.56 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. LVFX (MIC50/90 0.10, 0.20 microgram/ml) was more active against Acinetobacter species than CPFX (MIC50/90 0.10, 0.39 microgram/ml). Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella (Moraxella) catarrhalis and V. cholerae were inhibited by low concentration of the fluoroquinolones tested. The MIC90 of LVFX and CPFX were < or = 0.10 microgram/ml against above three species. Some isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Campylobacter species were moderately resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested but the MIC50 of LVFX and CPFX were < or = 0.39 microgram/ml. Among anaerobes, Propionibacterium acnes was more susceptible than Peptostreptococcus species, and the MIC90 of beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones tested were < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. In conclusion, this study, performed on large number of strains, confirmed an excellent and wide spectrum antibacterial activity of LVFX compared with the fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams tested. And our results suggest that LVFX may be useful in the treatment of various bacterial infections.
TI  - Changing pattern of infection in the Bratislava Burn Center.
AB  - Infection still remains one of the major problems in burn treatment. The authors  investigated the occurrence of burn wound pathogens in burn wound biopsies and/or semiquantitative wound surface off-prints. As the results have shown, trends of a decreased contribution of "classical pathogens", like Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, to burn wound infections were observed. The role of "other pathogens", like Enterobacter, Acinetobacter, etc., which were quite rare in the past, is on the opposite, increasing. One of the explanations can be the increasing rate of early surgical treatment methods of deep burns. The results were in accordance with similar studies from other burn centres.
TI  - Three-year surveillance study of nosocomial bacterial resistance in Argentina. The Antimicrobial Committee; and the National Surveillance Program (SIR) Participants Group.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A national surveillance program (SIR) was introduced in 1996 in Argentina by the Antimicrobial Committee of the Argentinean Society for Microbiology to assess bacterial resistance. The present study reports the rates of nosocomial bacterial resistance found by this program. METHODS: A 2-month point-prevalence study was conducted twice yearly (i.e., April-May and October-November) from 1996 to 1998, by 27 Argentinean centers. Susceptibility testing was carried out by the disk diffusion method following the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines. RESULTS: In all, 6343 isolates recovered from 5603 inpatients (> or =48-hr hospitalization) were included. Methicillin resistance was 58% and 56% in Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), respectively. Although no vancomycin resistance was found in staphylococci, 2% and 8% of the S. aureus and CNS strains, respectively, proved resistant to teicoplanin. No ampicillin resistance was displayed by Enterococcus faecalis. High-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance in enterococci were 33% and 37%, respectively. Acquired glycopeptide resistance in enterococci emerged in 1997 (2%). Imipenem resistance in Acinetobacter spp and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 9% and 21%, respectively. Among Enterobacteriaceae, 1% and 5% of the Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae isolates, respectively, proved resistant to imipenem. Ceftazidime and cefepime resistance was found in 63% and 33% of the E. cloacae strains. Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins was shown by 48%, 26%, and 8% of the K. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli isolates, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The alarming rates of resistance found in this study provide compelling evidence of the need for more rational use of antimicrobial agents in Argentina.
TI  - Group B streptococci and other gram-positive cocci bind to cytokeratin 8.
AB  - Group B streptococci (GBS) adhere to surface receptors present on epithelial cells; these receptors include fibronectin and laminin. To identify other possible receptors, plasma membranes from A549 cells, a respiratory tract epithelial cell line, were prepared. These plasma membranes were tested in a protein blot analysis using radiolabeled GBS as a probe. GBS adhered to two species, with molecular masses of 50 kDa (p50) and 57 kDa (p57). We concluded that p50 and p57 correspond to two forms of cytokeratin 8 (CK8) on the basis of the following results: (i) protein blot results demonstrated that p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with two forms of CK8 after separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE); (ii) p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with CK8 after separation by two-dimensional PAGE; (iii) CK8 in solution bound to GBS, as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of proteins from A549 lysates that bound to GBS in a liquid-phase assay; and (iv) radiolabeled GBS bound to A549 lysate-derived CK8 that had been captured in anti-CK8-coated microtiter wells. CK8 bound to COH1-13, an acapsular mutant of COH1, demonstrating that adherence is not mediated by capsular polysaccharide. Trypsin-treated GBS did not bind to CK8, indicating that adherence is mediated via a protein on the surface of GBS. Soluble CK8 bound to six of six GBS strains tested. Soluble CK8 also bound to Staphylococcus aureus, Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. We hypothesize that adherence of GBS to cytokeratin may be important for maintenance of colonization at sites of keratinized epithelium, such as the vagina, or for adherence of these bacteria to damaged epithelial cells at other sites.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of mefloquine and a series of related compounds.
AB  - Mefloquine was found to have bactericidal activity against methicillin- and fluoroquinolone-susceptible and -resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and gentamicin- and vancomycin-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. The MICs were 16 microg/ml, and the minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were 16 to 32 microg/ml. These concentrations cannot be achieved in serum. Mefloquine was active at a more achievable concentration against penicillin-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, with MICs of 0.2 to 1.5 microg/ml. Mefloquine was not active against gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. In an attempt to find more active derivatives, 400 mefloquine-related compounds were selected from the chemical inventory of The Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. We identified a series of compounds containing a piperidine methanol group attached to pyridine, quinoline, and benzylquinoline ring systems. These had activities similar to that of mefloquine against S. pneumoniae but were far more active against other gram-positive bacteria (MICs for staphylococci, 0.8 to 6.3 microg/ml). They had activities similar to that of amphotericin B against Candida spp. and Cryptococcus neoformans. Combinations of the compounds with gentamicin and vancomycin were additive against staphylococci and pneumococci. The MIC and MBC of gentamicin were decreased by four- to eightfold when this drug was combined with limiting dilutions of the compounds. There was no antagonism with other antimicrobial drugs. The compounds were rapidly bactericidal. They appear to act by disrupting cell membranes. Combinations of the compounds with aminoglycoside antibiotics may have potential for therapeutic use.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and Arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  - Arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. They possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. Although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. Also, the antimicrobial activity of Arnica has not been extensively investigated. Therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by Arnica and propolis extracts. Arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from Minas Gerais State were compared with controls. Fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: Candida albicans--NTCC 3736, F72; Staphylococcus aureus--ATCC 25923; Enterococcus faecalis--ATCC 29212; Streptococcus sobrinus 6715; Strep. sanguis--ATCC 10556; Strep. cricetus--HS-6; Strep. mutans--Ingbritt 1600; Strep. mutans--OMZ 175; Actinomyces naeslundii--ATCC 12104, W 1053; Act. viscosus OMZ 105; Porphyromonas gingivalis; Porph. endodontalis and Prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). Antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. To assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees C in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. To assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 M sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees C in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. Arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. The propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for Actinomyces spp. The Arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. Cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. The Arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for Strep. mutans and 15% for Strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same concentrations. Thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the Arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.
TI  - A comparison of antimicrobial resistance rates in Gram-positive pathogens isolated in the UK from October 1996 to January 1997 and October 1997 to January 1998.
AB  - Rates of resistance for two consecutive years for 28 centres (10 Teaching, nine Associate Teaching and nine District General hospitals) in the UK were compared. Combined rates of resistance for each of the hospital types of Staphylococcus aureus to methicillin revealed an increase in the rate of resistance in Teaching hospitals (12.5% year 1, 23.5% year 2), but, for Associate Teaching and District General hospitals rates fell (Associate Teaching 19.1% year 1, 11.9% year 2; District General 16.5% year 1 and 11.3% year 2). Using conventional methodology to determine MICs, no strain was considered to have reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. Among coagulase-negative staphylococci, increased resistance was observed for Staphylococcus epidermidis to rifampicin, for Staphylococcus haemolyticus to clindamycin, for Staphylococcus saprophyticus to penicillin and for Staphylococcus spp. to clindamycin, methicillin and rifampicin. For Streptococcus pneumoniae an upward trend in low-level resistance to penicillin was observed (18 of the 28 centres), however, for high-level resistance the trend was in the opposite direction (only four centres showed an increase). For Enterococcus faecalis there was a trend to a fall in levels of resistance, the only exception being an increase in high-level gentamicin resistance (10.5% year 1, 15.1% year 2, P = 0.0388). For Enterococcus faecium rates of resistance were not significantly different except for increases in resistance to nitrofurantoin and rifampicin.
TI  - [Acquired antibiotic resistance in Madagascar: first evaluation].
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of acquired resistance to antibiotics in Madagascar. Testing was carried out on total of 1267 strains of medically significant bacteria isolated from specimens sent to the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar in Antananarivo between October 1997 and October 1998. Antibiograms were performed using the diffusion technique on gel media with antibiotic disks. Results were read according to the criteria of the Antibiogram Committee of the French Society of Microbiology. Preliminary findings documented a high incidence of resistance to widely available, low-price antibiotics including penicillin G and tetracycline for which 84 p. 100 and 65 p. 100 of Staphylococcus aureus respectively demonstrated resistance; tetracyclin to which 80 p. 100 of streptococcus were resistant; and ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, and phenicoles to which 60 p. 100, 60 p. 100 and 28 p. 100 of Escherichia coli respectively and 77 p. 100, 83 p. 100, and 71 p. 100 of Shigella sp. respectively were resistant. Second-line antibiotics including penicillin M, macrolides, nalidixic acid, and nitrofuranes were still relatively active, thus providing an effective alternative. Newly developed antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporines were highly effective but a few resistant strains were observed. Although not representative of Madagascar as a whole, the findings of this preliminary study indicate that acquired resistance must be taken into account in designing simplified decision charts for front-line laboratories, that appropriate information must be made available to health care workers, and that further testing is needed to monitor the evolution of antibiotic resistance.
TI  - The in vitro effects of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate on oral and pharyngeal microorganisms of various ecological niches.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility to cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for various aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms responsible for oral and pharyngeal diseases by assessing the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) or minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) and by determining kill-times. The MICs of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for 46 tested strains (25 reference strains and 21 clinical isolates) ranged from 8 to 500 micrograms/ml. The MIC was found to be 31.25 micrograms/ml for 36% of the reference strains. Even lower MIC values (15.63 micrograms/ml) were observed for some anaerobic strains, for Haemophilus influenzae and for Candida tropicalis. MIC and MBC values corresponded for the majority of strains tested while the MFC for C. tropicalis and C. albicans was much higher. Only 9.5% of the clinical isolates gave a MIC value of 31.25 micrograms/ml. Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus showed MIC at 62.5 micrograms/ml. The MIC and MBC values among the isolates were comparable, while the MFC value for the yeasts was greater. A concentration of 125 micrograms/ml of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate inhibited the growth of all bacteria, except Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonaceae, and yeasts. Cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate shows very rapid kill-time for S. sanguis (0"), and rapid (15") for S. pyogenes, S. dysgalactiae and S. mutans and for Moraxella catarrhalis, while a longer kill-time was necessary for the other microbes tested.
TI  - Epidemiology and microbiology of surgical wound infections.
AB  - This study included 676 surgery patients with signs and symptoms indicative of wound infections, who presented over the course of 6 years. Bacterial pathogens were isolated from 614 individuals. A single etiologic agent was identified in 271 patients, multiple agents were found in 343, and no agent was identified in 62. A high preponderance of aerobic bacteria was observed. Among the common pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (191 patients, 28.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (170 patients, 25.2%), Escherichia coli (53 patients, 7.8%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (48 patients, 7.1%), and Enterococcus faecalis (38 patients, 5.6%).
TI  - Rapid identification of bacteria in blood cultures by using fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes.
AB  - The applicability of whole-cell hybridization for the identification of pathogenic bacteria in blood from septic patients was examined. Oligonucleotide probes, fluorescently labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate, directed against the variable regions of the 16S rRNAs of the following bacterial species and/or genera were used: Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the Enterobacteriaceae family. A probe specific for the rRNAs of almost all bacteria and its complementary, reversed counterpart was used as positive and negative control, respectively. The probes were used in conjunction with a fast and simple-to-use protocol for whole-cell hybridization. This protocol yields an identification after 25 to 45 min, depending on whether the bacterium is gram positive or gram negative. A total of 182 blood samples which tested positive in a blood culture machine were investigated. All probes except for the ones for S. aureus and the CoNS showed sensitivities and specificities of 1.000. It was concluded that whole-cell hybridization is well suited for the fast screening of septic blood containing streptococci and/or enterococci or gram-negative rods.
TI  - Surveillance of antibiotic resistance in Taiwan, 1998.
AB  - For the first national surveillance of antibiotic resistance in Taiwan, we collected in 1998 from 22 hospitals (6 medical centers, 15 regional hospitals, and 1 local hospital) 3,211 isolates in all parts of the country. Besides 50 random successive isolates from inpatients, each hospital was requested to collect 25 isolates each from positive blood cultures, hospital-acquired infections, outpatients and the pediatric department. We re-speciated all the submitted specimens and determined their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. The most common isolates were Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae), Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Among hospital-acquired infections, Acinetobacter spp. were among those which accounted for over 10% of the isolates. The oxacillin resistance of S. aureus was 82% in isolates from hospital-acquired infections, and 40% from outpatients. Among Enterococcus spp., 85% were either E. faecalis or E. faecium. They were 14% resistant to vancomycin. Among gram-negative bacteria, K. pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumanii were hospital-acquired isolates that were most clearly more resistant than community acquired isolates. This difference was less apparent in the case of Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa. These bacteria were generally more resistant from all sources. Fifty-one percent of Salmonella were resistant to ampicillin; however, these were all sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Isolates from the East were least resistant. Plotting the disc zone diameters of antibiotics within the susceptible range, we identified subpopulations with smaller diameters in the case of vancomycin against S. aureus, ciprofloxacin against E. coli, and ciprofloxacin against Salmonella spp. These findings represent one of the purposes of this surveillance as they may portend developing resistances which bear careful watching in the future.
TI  - Bacteraemia and antibiotic resistance of its pathogens reported in England and Wales between 1990 and 1998: trend analysis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Determination of causes, trends, and antibiotic resistance in reports of bacterial pathogens isolated from blood in England and Wales from 1990 to 1998. DESIGN: Description of bacterial isolates from blood, judged to be clinically significant by microbiology staff, reported to the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre. SETTING: Microbiology laboratories in England and Wales. SUBJECTS: Patients yielding clinically significant isolates from blood. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency and Poisson regression analyses for trend of reported causes of bacteraemia and proportions of antibiotic resistant isolates. RESULTS: There was an upward trend in total numbers of reports of bacteraemia. The five most cited organisms accounted for over 60% of reports each year. There was a substantial increase in the proportion of reports of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, Streptococcus pneumoniae resistance to penicillin and erythromycin, and Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium resistance to vancomycin. No increase was seen in resistance of Escherichia coli to gentamicin. CONCLUSIONS: Reports from laboratories provide valuable information on trends and antibiotic resistance in bacteraemia and show a worrying increase in resistance to important antibiotics.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of camphorated chloroxylenol (ED 84) in the treatment of infected root canals.
AB  - During and after chemomechanical preparation, particularly before the definitive  filling of an infected root canal, a temporary intracanal dressing with an antimicrobial activity is generally indicated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial effect of ED 84, a liquid root canal disinfectant containing chloroxylenol (10%) and camphor (15%), against selected test organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans) both in vitro and under clinical conditions, using extracted teeth. With a contact time of 180 min between undiluted ED 84 and the four bacterial suspensions in the canal, there was a 2 to 3 log reduction in the number of organisms. Under in vitro conditions, the reduction was even greater than 3 logs. When using a liquid medication as a temporary root canal dressing for a duration of approximately 2 days, ED 84 can definitely be used.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of vancomycin in the presence and absence of sodium carboxymethyl starch.
AB  - The purpose of this work was to determine any effects the presence of sodium carboxymethyl starch may have on the antimicrobial activity of vancomycin given a previously described interaction between vancomycin and sodium carboxymethyl starch. In particular, the in-vitro activity of vancomycin against two clinically relevant bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, was studied in the presence of varying concentrations of sodium carboxymethyl starch. From two independent studies conducted using an agar dilution method, it appeared that the binding of vancomycin to sodium carboxymethyl starch had no effect on the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of vancomycin. The minimum inhibitory concentration of vancomycin against S. aureus in the presence of as much as 1 mg mL(-1) sodium carboxymethyl starch was similar to that of the control where no sodium carboxymethyl starch was added (1-4 microg mL(-1) vs 1-2 microg mL(-1), respectively). Likewise, the minimum inhibitory concentration of vancomycin against E. faecalis in the presence of 1 mg mL(-1) sodium carboxymethyl starch was also similar to that of the control where no sodium carboxymethyl starch was added (1-4 microg mL(-1) vs 1-4 microg mL(-1), respectively). However, there may be factors in the in-vitro method, such as high ionic strength, that could disrupt the interaction between vancomycin and sodium carboxymethyl starch. Therefore, the possibility of diminished vancomycin activity in-vivo cannot be ruled out. A small percentage (8-10%) of vancomycin was determined to be bound to sodium carboxymethyl starch in broth media. Given these results, the impact of sodium carboxymethyl starch on the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of vancomycin is expected to be minimal. Binding studies could not be conducted with gelled agar due to its semi-solid state.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 Gram-positive microorganisms. The MIC(90) (mg/L) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus anginosus and Actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for Streptococcus sanguis and Listeria monocytogenes, 2 for Corynebacterium jekeium and Bifidobacterium bivius. Over 50% of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Nocardia steroides and Clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/L moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards Gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against Gram-positive bacilli.
TI  - Quality control guidelines for disk diffusion and broth microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility tests with seven drugs for veterinary applications.
AB  - This multicenter study proposes antimicrobial susceptibility (MIC and disk diffusion methods) quality control (QC) parameters for seven compounds utilized in veterinary health. Alexomycin, apramycin, tiamulin, tilmicosin, and tylosin were tested by broth microdilution against various National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS)-recommended QC organisms (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853). In addition, disk diffusion zone diameter QC limits were determined for apramycin, enrofloxacin, and premafloxacin by using E. coli ATCC 25922, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and S. aureus ATCC 25923. The results from five or six participating laboratories produced >/=99.0% of MICs and >/=95.0% of the zone diameters within suggested guidelines. The NCCLS Subcommittee for Veterinary Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing has recently approved these ranges for publication in the next M31 document.
TI  - It is possible to use herbarium specimens to screen for antibacterial components  in some plants.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of herbarium specimens of Combretum erythrophyllum growing in the Pretoria area and originally collected between 92 and 12 years ago were compared with freshly collected leaves. There were no differences in the minimal inhibitory concentration of the different samples with Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as test organisms. There were only minor differences in chromatograms separating terpenoids and flavonoids. Light fungal infection indicated by small spots on herbarium leaves generally did not influence the MIC value or the chromatographic profile much, but heavy fungal attack decreased the biological activity of the extracts. Application of the technique to Helichrysum pedunculatum specimens showed that the chemical components apparently did not change over a period of 100 years and the biological activity did not decrease. The examination of herbarium material may be a useful first step to screen plants with stable biologically active components or to establish a scientific base for the use of a plant in traditional medicine.
TI  - Preparation and activity of some novel organo-metallic complexes against Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - Some novel organo-metallic complexes were prepared by complexing the antibiotics  erythromycin (CAS 114-07-8), doxycycline (CAS 564-25-0), ciprofloxacin (CAS 85721-33-1) and amoxicillin (CAS 26787-78-0) with bismuth citrate and their antibacterial activity against Helicobacter pylori and other micro-organisms were investigated. Amoxicillin-bismuth citrate had the strongest activity against H. pylori with a lowest minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.007 mg/l. The complexes exhibited moderate activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus subtilis. The findings suggest that the activity of these organo-metallic complexes might be specifically directed against H. pylori.
TI  - Characterization of high-pressure-treated egg albumen.
AB  - Addition of NaCl or sucrose to egg albumen prior to high-pressure treatment (up to 10 min at 800 MPa) prevented insolubilization or gel formation after pressure treatment. As a consequence of protein unfolding, the treated albumen had increased viscosity but retained its foaming and heat-gelling properties. Susceptibility of egg albumen proteins to hydrolysis by trypsin increased dramatically after pressure treatment. The S-form of ovalbumin, the presence of which is an index of egg aging, was not found in any of the pressure-treated samples, which also did not display evidence for covalent protein aggregation. However, recognition of ovalbumin by an anti-ovalbumin antiserum was reduced to 40% of that of untreated sample.
TI  - Potential of an antibacterial ultraviolet-irradiated nylon film.
AB  - The antibacterial effectiveness of an ultraviolet-irradiated nylon 6, 6 film was  investigated for potential use as a food-packaging material to reduce the surface microbial contamination of foods. The film-surface analyses showed that UV irradiation induced conversion of surface amide groups to amines. Irradiation also increased the dimensional scale of the film surface topography (depth of valleys) approximately 5-fold on the scale of nanometers. The irradiated nylon demonstrated antagonistic activity against Staphylococcus aureus 25923 and Escherichia coli TV1058 with 4.5 and 6 log reductions, respectively, of an initial population of 10(6) cfu mL(-1). The irradiated nylon was ineffective against Pseudomonas fluorescens 13525 and Enterococcus faecalis 19433 under similar conditions. The film demonstrated increased antimicrobial activity against S. aureus 25923 with increasing temperatures up to 45 degrees C, the highest temperature tested. Protein and salt inhibited the antibacterial nature of the irradiated film. Amines in solution (4.31 x 10(-8) M; the calculated equivalent of amines on the film) killed at least 1 x 10(4) cfu mL(-1) E. coli TV1058, and 4. 31 x 10(-7) M amines killed up to 1 x 10(7) cfu mL(-1) E. coli TV1058. The amines in solution required similar exposure time to the bacteria for population reduction as was observed with the irradiated film.
TI  - Structure-activity relationships of novel 2-substituted quinazoline antibacterial agents.
AB  - High-throughput screening of in-house compound libraries led to the discovery of  a novel antibacterial agent, compound 1 (MIC: 12-25 microM against S. pyogenes). In an effort to improve the activity of this active compound, a series of 2-substituted quinazolines was synthesized and evaluated in several antibacterial assays. One such compound (22) displayed improved broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against a variety of bacterial strains. This molecule also inhibited transcription/translation of bacterial RNA, suggesting a mechanism for its antibiotic effects. Structure-activity relationship studies of 22 led to the synthesis of another 24 compounds. Although some of these molecules were found to be active in bacterial growth assays, none were as potent as 22. Compound 22 was tested for its ability to cure a systemic K. pneumonia infection in the mouse and displayed moderate effects compared with a control antibiotic, gentamycin.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxifloxacin, a new 8-methoxyquinolone, against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin, formerly BAY 12-8039, against gram-positive bacteria was tested by the agar dilution method. A total of 189 isolates that included Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, streptococci, rhodococci, leuconostocs, pediococci, lactobacilli, and diphtheroids were tested. Moxifloxacin showed greater potency than ciprofloxacin against S. aureus, streptococci, and enterococci, having Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) lower than those of ciprofloxacin by 2- to 64-fold. This improved activity was most prominent for S. aureus. Moxifloxacin was active against Leuconostoc and Rhodococcus species. Time-kill studies using moxifloxacin at a concentration of 3 micrograms/mL against one isolate each of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MSSA) (MIC, 0.031 microgram/mL), MRSA (MIC, 1 microgram/mL), two isolates of E. faecalis (MICs, 0.25 and 2 micrograms/mL), and two isolates of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (MICs, 0.25 and 2 micrograms/mL) revealed an average decrease in colony forming unit (CFU) by 3.8, 0.4, 4.0, 2.0, 4.2, and 1.8 log10 CFU/mL at 24 h, respectively. Moxifloxacin is a new 8-methoxyquinolone with improved in vitro activity against gram-positive bacteria. Further studies of the in vivo activity of this compound appear warranted.
TI  - The role of recombination and mutation in 16S-23S rDNA spacer rearrangements.
AB  - The intragenomic heterogeneity of the bacterial intergenic (16S-23S rDNA) spacer  region (ISR) was analysed from the following species in which sequences for the complete rRNA operon (rrn) set have been determined (rrn number): Enterococcus faecalis (6) and E. faecium (6), Bacillus subtilis (10), Staphylococcus aureus (9), Vibrio cholerae (4), Haemophilus influenzae (6) and Escherichia coli (7). It was found that some spacer sequence blocks were highly conserved between operons of a genome, whereas the presence of others was variable. When these variations were analysed using the program PLATO and partial likelihood phylogenies determined by DNAml for each operon set, three regions showed significant (Z>3.3) spatial variation [Region I was 78-184 nt long (2.1<Z<49.4), Region II was 10-60 nt long (3.7<Z<23)] and Region III was 6 nt long (3.4<Z>4.4) possibly due to recombination or selection. Within Region I, there was sequence block variation in all operon sets [some operons contained tRNA genes (tRNAala, tRNAile or tRNAglu), whereas others had sequence blocks such as VS2 (S. aureus) or rsl (E. coli)]. Q Analysis of the ISR sequence from E. faecalis and E. faecium showed that there was more interspecies than intraspecies variation (both in DNA sequence and in the presence or absence of blocks). Dot matrix analysis of the sequence blocks in the nine rrn ISRs from S. aureus showed that there was significant homology between VS2 and VS5/VS6. Furthermore, repeat motifs with only A or T were present in higher copy numbers in VS5/VS6 than in VS2. Since these sequence blocks (VS2 and VS5-VS6) are related, intragenic evolution resulting in AT expansion may have occurred between these two regions. A model is proposed that postulates a role for recombination and AT-expansion in intra-genomic ISR variations. This process may represent a general mechanism of concerted evolution for bacterial ISR rearrangements.
TI  - In vitro activity of levofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of levofloxacin was investigated against 256 clinical strains of four gram-positive genera (Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Listeria). Ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were used as comparators. Uniform susceptibility to levofloxacin was recorded among methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae, regardless of their being susceptible, intermediate, or resistant to penicillin (S. pneumoniae) or erythromycin (S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae), in enterococci other than Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, and in Listeria monocytogenes isolates. Moreover, 1 of 22 S. agalactiae isolates and 1 of 19 E. faecium isolates was resistant, and 2 of 19 were intermediate. Resistances to levofloxacin with MIC90s in the resistance range were only observed in methicillin-resistant staphylococci and E. faecalis isolates. In any case, the MICs of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were usually 2-4 times higher than those of levofloxacin. In time-kill assays using three test strains (a methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus isolate, a penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae isolate, and an E. faecalis isolate), the bactericidal activity of levofloxacin was greater than that of ciprofloxacin.
TI  - [Preventive effect of postoperative disinfection of endoscope on bacterial adhesion to endoscope].
AB  - We took culture of throat swab from 77 subjects who were negative for infection of HBV, HCV, HIV and syphilis infection before and after endoscopy. Moreover, the existence of bacterium including Helicobacter pylori at overcoat of endoscopic instrument was investigated right after examination and after disinfection of endoscope. Povidoneiodine, 70% alcohol and 1% benzalkonium chloride was used as a disinfectant for endoscope, and it took less than 10 minutes to wash by hand to disinfection. alpha-haemolytic streptococci, Staphylococcus epidermids, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and MRSA were cultured in throat swab. The rate of adhesion of bacterium especially such as Candida, K. pneumoniae and S. epidermids to endoscope was considerably high. 23 of 77 subjects had H. pylori infection, and the adhesion of H. pylori to endoscope was found to be 65.2% of the subjects. On the contrast, no bacterium was detected from the endoscopic instrument after careful disinfection. These findings stress the importance of postoperative disinfection of the endoscope to prevent the chance to acquire bacterial infection.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin with a wide Gram-positive spectrum.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid) is a new injectable streptogramin antibiotic proposed for the treatment of severe antimicrobial infections, that has been shown to be active against Gram-positive, multi-resistant cocci. We compared the in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin with that of amoxycillin, ampicillin, penicillin, cefixime, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, erythromycin, imipenem, meropenem, oxacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, teicoplanin and vancomycin. The susceptibility of 37 Staphylococcus aureus (14 MS, 23 MR), 26 Staphylococcus epidermidis (16 MS, 10 MR), 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 Group A Streptococcus pyogenes, 15 Streptococcus agalactiae, 10 Enterococcus faecalis (1 vancomycin-resistant), 15 Enterococcus faecium (9 van A) was evaluated. Quinupristin/dalfopristin was active against all Gram-positive species tested, including met-R S. aureus (MIC < or = 2 mg/l), met-R S. epidermidis (MIC < or = 2 mg/l), S. pneumoniae (MIC < or = 1 mg/l), ery-R and ery-S streptococci (MIC < or = 1 mg/l). The strains of E. faecalis were generally less susceptible. Time-kill studies confirmed that quinupristin/dalfopristin at 4 x MIC concentration showed a complete bactericidal effect (3 log reduction) in about 4 6 h against all strains tested. A post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of 3.9-5.2 h was observed at 4 x MIC concentration of quinupristin/dalfopristin against staphylococci. A prolonged PAE was obtained for S. pneumoniae (8 h), S. pyogenes (9 h) and S. agalactiae (7 h), while the shortest PAE was seen for E. faecalis and E. faecium (about 4 h).
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some N-alkyl and N-nitrobenzyl substituted halides of (E)-4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxystilbazoles-4.
AB  - The synthesis of 11 new N-substituted derivatives of (E)-4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxystilbazoles-4 and their antimicrobial activity are reported. The relationships between structure and antibacterial activity are studied. In particular, compounds 5, 7 and 8 showed good antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis and Bacillus subtilis, while compound 6 did so against S. aureus and S. faecalis.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin in treatment of nosocomial meningitis in neonates and in infants: report of 12 cases and review.
AB  - Twelve cases of neonatal and infant nosocomial meningitis treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin in doses of 10 to 60 mg/kg/day are described. Four neonates were 21 to 28 days old and eight infants were 2 to 6 months old. Six presented with Gram-negative meningitis: Escherichia coli (2), Salmonella enteritidis (1), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (1), two with two organisms, and (H. influenzae plus Staphylococcus epidermidis, Acinetobacter spp. plus S. epidermidis), and six were attributable to Gram-positive cocci (four S. aureus and two Enterococcus faecalis). Ten cases were cured. In two cases, reversible hydrocephalus appeared that responded to intraventricular punctures. In seven children, no neurologic sequellae appeared after a 2- to 4-year follow-up. One neonate had relapse of meningitis 3 months later and was ultimately cured, but developed a sequellae of psychomotoric retardation. Follow-up varied from 27 months to 10 years. Current published case reports from Medline on quinolone use in meningitis in neonates and infants are reviewed.
TI  - Polymicrobial endocarditis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus  and glycopeptide-resistant enterococci.
AB  
TI  - The synthesis and antibacterial activity of totarol derivatives. Part 1: modifications of ring-C and pro-drugs.
AB  - A series of analogues of, and potential pro-drugs derived from, the potent antibacterial diterpene totarol (1) were synthesized in order to elucidate the minimum structural requirements for antibacterial activity and to seek compounds with good bioavailability in vivo. These analogues varied in the structural features of their aromatic rings and the prodrugs were O-glycosylated derivatives. They were tested in vitro against three gram-positive bacteria: beta-lactamase-positive and high level gentamycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA); and against the gram-negative multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. None of the analogues was more potent than totarol itself, which is effective against these gram-positive bacteria at MIC values of 7 microM. The results were evaluated in terms of a structure-activity relationship and this showed that a phenolic moiety was essential for potent antibacterial activity. Amongst the pro-drugs, totaryl alpha-D-mannopyranoside (22) proved the most active in vitro (MIC 18 microM). The in vivo antibacterial activities of compounds 1, 22 and totarol beta-lactoside (23) were assessed in a mouse model of infection, but they were found to be ineffective. Compounds 1 and 22 were shown to be cytotoxic towards proliferating human cell cultures, CH 2983, HeLa, and MG 63, but only at concentrations of > 30 microM.
TI  - Antimicrobial evaluation of calcium hydroxide in infected dentinal tubules.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide in infected dentinal tubules. Four microorganisms, strains of ATCC (Streptococcus faecalis (ATCC-29212), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC-6538), Bacillus subtilis (ATCC-6633), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC-27853)) and one mixture of these were used. These strains were inoculated in brain heart infusion (BHI) and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Sixty-three human maxillary central incisors were prepared and sterilized by autoclaving. Five groups of 12 teeth each were contaminated for 28 days using new 24-h cultures every 72 h, prepared and adjusted to tube 2 of the MacFarland scale (6 x 10(8) cells/ml). Root canals were then irrigated with 5 ml of saline, dried, and completely filled with calcium hydroxide paste. At intervals of 0, 48, and 72 h, and 7 days, dressings were removed and teeth were immersed in 5 ml of BHI and incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h to observe the growth and multiplication of the microorganisms. Three uninoculated teeth were maintained in a humid environment as an aseptic control. These teeth were immersed in BHI and maintained at 37 degrees C for 7 days to determine microbial growth. Bacterial growth was shown by turbidity of the culture medium and confirmed by seeding these broths on BHI agar at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The positive BHI tubes were selected, and inoculum was spread on the surface of BHI agar, followed by the same incubation conditions. Gram stain was conducted from BHI growth and from colonies growing on solid medium. Calcium hydroxide in infected dentinal tubules showed no antimicrobial effect on S. faecalis, S. aureus, B. subtilis, P. aeruginosa, or on the bacterial mixture used throughout the experiment.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (CFDN) and cefditoren (CDTR). FK041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK041 was active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms except Enterococcus faecalis with MIC90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. FK041 was more active than CFDN and CDTR against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to CFDN and CDTR against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. FK041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae with an MIC range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to CFDN but inferior to CDTR. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, FK041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of CFDN and CDTR. However, it was inferior to CDTR in activity against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Morganella morganii, and Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With FK041 a small difference between MIC and MBC against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. FK041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. The stability of FK041 to these enzymes was similar to those of CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of S. aureus (PBP 3, 2, and 1) and E. coli (PBP 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
TI  - Effect of antibiotic concentration on the killing of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis: comparison of the novel penem, Men 10700, with other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lidocaine against bacteria associated with nosocomial wound infection.
AB  - The authors characterized the in vitro antibacterial properties of clinical doses of lidocaine on isolates of a variety of bacterial pathogens commonly encountered in the setting of nosocomial wound infection (Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus) as well as a number of resistant strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Time-kill studies were carried out on bacteria exposed to various clinical concentrations of lidocaine (0%, 1%, 2%, and 4%) with and without epinephrine (1:100,000). Minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum bactericidal concentrations were determined for some strains using a broth macrodilution method recommended by the National Committee of Clinical Laboratory Standards. Lidocaine demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of growth for all strains of bacteria tested. The greatest sensitivity to lidocaine was shown by gram-negative organisms; the least sensitive was S. aureus. The addition of epinephrine to the local anesthetic had no effect on the susceptibility of the bacteria to lidocaine. These observations suggest that the surgical benefit of local anesthesia may extend beyond its analgesic properties and may have a role in the prophylaxis and, in the case of methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant bacteria, the treatment of surgical wound infection, mandating a wider application of this modality.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of dental impression materials.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the in vitro killing effects five commercial alginate impression materials had on five test microorganisms. METHODS: Two alginates with no added disinfectant, one supplemented with chlorhexidine and two others containing quaternary ammonium compounds were tested. Challenge microbes included two gram-positive cocci, two gram-negative bacilli and a yeast. Saline solutions containing standardized concentrations of test microbes were used to mix the alginates. Some set specimens were immediately homogenized and the resulting fluids diluted and spread plated. Other specimens were processed 30 or 60 min after setting. After culturing, the numbers of colonies were counted and the levels of microbial reductions determined. RESULTS: Unsupplemented alginates had no antimicrobial effects. The quaternary-ammonium-containing alginates were completely effective against all five test microorganisms. The alginate with chlorhexidine killed all the gram-negative bacilli and the majority (95-99%) of the gram-positive cocci and yeast. SIGNIFICANCE: Results indicated that disinfectant-containing alginate impression materials could reduce the number of soiling microorganisms present on and within test specimens.
TI  - Ace is a collagen-binding MSCRAMM from Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - A putative collagen-binding MSCRAMM, Ace, of Enterococcus faecalis was identified by searching bacterial genome data bases for proteins containing domains homologous to the ligand-binding region of Cna, the collagen-binding MSCRAMM from Staphylococcus aureus. Ace was predicted to have a molecular mass of 71 kDa and contains features characteristic of cell surface proteins on Gram-positive bacteria, including a LPXTG motif for cross-linking to the cell wall. The N-terminal region of Ace contained a region (residues 174-319) in which 56% of the residues are identical or similar when compared with the minimal ligand-binding region of Cna (Cna 151-318); the remainder of the Ace A domain has 46% similarity with the corresponding region of the Cna A domain. Antibodies raised against recombinant Ace A domain were used to verify the cell surface expression of Ace on E. faecalis. These antibodies also effectively inhibited the adhesion of enterococcal cells to a collagen substrate, suggesting that Ace is a functional collagen-binding MSCRAMM. Structural modeling of the conserved region in Ace (residues 174-319) suggested a structure very similar to that reported for residues 151-318 of the Cna collagen-binding domain in which the ligand-binding site was identified as a trench transversing a beta-sheet face (Symersky, J., Patti, J. M., Carson, M., House-Pompeo, K., Teale, M., Moore, D., Jin, L., DeLucas, L. J., Hook, M., and Narayana, S. V. L. (1997) Nat. Struct. Biol. 10, 833-838). Biochemical analyses of recombinant Ace and Cna A domains supported the modeling data in that the secondary structures were similar as determined by CD spectroscopy and both proteins bound at multiple sites in type I collagen with micromolar affinities, but with different apparent kinetics. We conclude that Ace is a collagen-binding MSCRAMM on enterococci and is structurally and functionally related to the staphylococcal Cna protein.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between July 1996 and June 1997].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during period from July 1996 to June 1997. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. A total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). From primary infections 162 strains were isolated, and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. From primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was the highest. In postoperative infections, the majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were Enterococcus avium. The isolation rate of Staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of Enterococcus spp. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like B. fragilis group and of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. We found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither Staphylacoccus aureus nor Enterococcus spp.; however, the MIC of arbekacin for one of strains of S. aureus was 100 micrograms/ml. Both the MIC90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against P. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. Compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides from the Brazilian frog Phyllomedusa distincta.
AB  - Different peptides were purified by chromatographic procedures from the skin-secretory glands of the frog Phyllomedusa distincta. These are the first peptides reported from this frog species. Their primary structure was determined by a combination of automated Edman degradation and mass spectrometry. Peptide Q2 contains 25 amino acid residues, peptide Q1 and L have 28 each, peptide M contains 31, and peptide K has 33 amino acid residues. They all showed potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, presenting minimal inhibitory concentrations from 0.6 to 40 microM, when tested against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Peptides K, L, and Q1 were chemically synthesized and shown to be active.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in key bloodstream bacterial isolates: electronic surveillance with the Surveillance Network Database--USA.
AB  - To assess the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens among the most common bloodstream isolates, we examined antimicrobial susceptibility data from The Surveillance Network Database-USA, an electronic surveillance system that collects data from 118 clinical microbiology laboratories across the United States. Between 1995 and 1997, resistance to both vancomycin and ampicillin was much more prevalent among Enterococcus faecium than Enterococcus faecalis, suggesting the need for laboratories to identify to species. When staphylococcal isolates were examined for reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (minimum inhibitory concentration = 4 microg/mL), the frequency was highest in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci. We also learned that nonsusceptibility to ceftazidime in Klebsiella pneumoniae was more prevalent among isolates from blood (12.7%) than among isolates from urine (7.1%) or respiratory sources (9.3%). Although antimicrobial resistance is low overall for isolates of Escherichia coli from blood, the prevalence of cefoxitin resistance among ceftazidime-resistant strains (61.9%) suggests the action of mechanisms other than extended-spectrum beta-lactamase.
TI  - Nosocomial bloodstream infections in United States hospitals: a three-year analysis.
AB  - Nosocomial bloodstream infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality. In this study, concurrent surveillance for nosocomial bloodstream infections at 49 hospitals over a 3-year period detected >10,000 infections. Gram-positive organisms accounted for 64% of cases, gram-negative organisms accounted for 27%, and 8% were caused by fungi. The most common organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (32%), Staphylococcus aureus (16%), and enterococci (11%). Enterobacter, Serratia, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Candida were more likely to cause infections in patients in critical care units. In patients with neutropenia, viridans streptococci were significantly more common. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common pathogens on all clinical services except obstetrics, where Escherichia coli was most common. Methicillin resistance was detected in 29% of S. aureus isolates and 80% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Vancomycin resistance in enterococci was species-dependent--3% of Enterococcus faecalis strains and 50% of Enterococcus faecium isolates displayed resistance. These data may allow clinicians to better target empirical therapy for hospital-acquired cases of bacteremia.
TI  - Comparison of the D-glutamate-adding enzymes from selected gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The biochemical properties of the D-glutamate-adding enzymes (MurD) from Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus were investigated to detect any differences in the activity of this enzyme between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The genes (murD) that encode these enzymes were cloned into pMAL-c2 fusion vector and overexpressed as maltose-binding protein-MurD fusion proteins. Each fusion protein was purified to homogeneity by affinity to amylose resin. Proteolytic treatments of the fusion proteins with factor Xa regenerated the individual MurD proteins. It was found that these fusion proteins retain D-glutamate-adding activity and have Km and Vmax values similar to those of the regenerated MurDs, except for the H. influenzae enzyme. Substrate inhibition by UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine, the acceptor substrate, was observed at concentrations greater than 15 and 30 microM for E. coli and H. influenzae MurD, respectively. Such substrate inhibition was not observed with the E. faecalis and S. aureus enzymes, up to a substrate concentration of 1 to 2 mM. In addition, the two MurDs of gram-negative origin were shown to require monocations such as NH4+ and/or K+, but not Na+, for optimal activity, while anions such as Cl- and SO4(2-) had no effect on the enzyme activities. The activities of the two MurDs of gram-positive origin, on the other hand, were not affected by any of the ions tested. All four enzymes required Mg2+ for the ligase activity and exhibited optimal activities around pH 8. These differences observed between the gram-positive and gram-negative MurDs indicated that the two gram-negative bacteria may apply a more stringent regulation of cell wall biosynthesis at the early stage of peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway than do the two gram-positive bacteria. Therefore, the MurD-catalyzed reaction may constitute a fine-tuning step necessary for the gram-negative bacteria to optimally maintain its relatively thin yet essential cell wall structure during all stages of growth.
TI  - Prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance in 20 European university hospitals participating in the European SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme.
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyse the current prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance in Europe and compare the in vitro activity of amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin against 7057 bacterial isolates from 20 university hospitals participating in the European SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme. Amikacin exhibited better in vitro activity than tobramycin and gentamicin against most gram-negative bacilli in Europe. The resistance levels were 0.4-3% for amikacin, 2-13.1% for gentamicin, and 2.5-15.3% for tobramycin among different members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates tested, 75% were susceptible to gentamicin. Only 21% of all enterococcal strains tested were fully susceptible to gentamicin. Although intra-country variations in the prevalence of resistance phenotypes in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as in staphylococci and enterococci did occur, aminoglycoside resistance rates were generally higher in Italy, Portugal, Spain, Greece, France, the UK, and Poland than in Austria, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. Compared with the 1987-88 data of the European Study Group on Antibiotic Resistance, gentamicin resistance has increased up to 5% in some gram-negative bacterial species. Furthermore, a greater than 10% increase in resistance to gentamicin has been seen in Staphylococcus aureus during the last decade. The reason for this observation is unclear, although changes in antibiotic prescribing patterns that result in increased selective pressure from gentamicin may have contributed to these increased rates of aminoglycoside resistance.
TI  - Formation and structure of mixed bacterial communities.
AB  - Mixed bacterial communities are formed by unrelated bacteria on solid media. Mixed bacterial communities on solid media are similar to "classical" colonies and are formed after the growth of a large number of unrelated bacteria simultaneously plated onto a limited area of agar. The morphology of the mixed bacterial communities was similar for different combinations of bacteria and did not change when the bacteria were plated on different media. Different bacterial strains form zones of individual and mixed growth in the structure of mixed bacterial communities. The results of electron microscopic examination indicate that mixed bacterial communities are isolated from their external environment by a surface film. The basic part of this film is formed by an elementary membrane. The membrane of the surface film of mixed bacterial communities is a stable structure occupying a large surface area. The results of this investigation seem to indicate the existence of a special type of co-operation between different species of bacteria. This type of co-operation may be very important in the regulation of interactions between different bacteria and between bacteria and the environment.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils and other plant extracts.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of plant oils and extracts has been recognized for many years. However, few investigations have compared large numbers of oils and extracts using methods that are directly comparable. In the present study, 52 plant oils and extracts were investigated for activity against Acinetobacter baumanii, Aeromonas veronii biogroup sobria, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia col, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype typhimurium, Serratia marcescens and Staphylococcus aureus, using an agar dilution method. Lemongrass, oregano and bay inhibited all organisms at concentrations of < or = 2.0% (v/v). Six oils did not inhibit any organisms at the highest concentration, which was 2.0% (v/v) oil for apricot kernel, evening primrose, macadamia, pumpkin, sage and sweet almond. Variable activity was recorded for the remaining oils. Twenty of the plant oils and extracts were investigated, using a broth microdilution method, for activity against C. albicans, Staph. aureus and E. coli. The lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations were 0.03% (v/v) thyme oil against C. albicans and E. coli and 0.008% (v/v) vetiver oil against Staph. aureus. These results support the notion that plant essential oils and extracts may have a role as pharmaceuticals and preservatives.
TI  - Inhibitors of DNA polymerase III as novel antimicrobial agents against gram-positive eubacteria.
AB  - 6-Anilinouracils are selective inhibitors of DNA polymerase III, the enzyme required for the replication of chromosomal DNA in gram-positive bacteria (N. C. Brown, L. W. Dudycz, and G. E. Wright, Drugs Exp. Clin. Res. 12:555-564, 1986). A new class of 6-anilinouracils based on N-3 alkyl substitution of the uracil ring was synthesized and analyzed for activity as inhibitors of the gram-positive bacterial DNA polymerase III and the growth of gram-positive bacterial pathogens. Favorable in vitro properties of N-3-alkyl derivatives prompted the synthesis of derivatives in which the R group at N-3 was replaced with more-hydrophilic methoxyalkyl and hydroxyalkyl groups. These hydroxyalkyl and methoxyalkyl derivatives displayed K(i) values in the range from 0.4 to 2.8 microM against relevant gram-positive bacterial DNA polymerase IIIs and antimicrobial activity with MICs in the range from 0.5 to 15 microg/ml against a broad spectrum of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Two of these hydrophilic derivatives displayed protective activity in a simple mouse model of lethal staphylococcal infection.
TI  - Efficacy of trovafloxacin in an in vitro pharmacodynamic simulation of an intraabdominal infection.
AB  - An in vitro model simulating trovafloxacin concentrations in human serum after standard doses was used to investigate the activity of this drug with time against Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. Antibiotic concentrations used for each incubation period were: 4.24 mg/l (0-1 h), 3.69 mg/l (1-3 h), 3.25 mg/l (3-6 h), 2.38 mg/l (6-8 h), 1.35 mg/l (8-24 h). A 99.9% initial inoculum reduction (> 3 log10 cfu/ml) was defined as bactericidal activity. Bactericidal activity against these organisms was obtained with trovafloxacin after the first hour of incubation, and similar activity was obtained against B. fragilis, E. faecalis and S. aureus after 3 h, when they were tested individually. When the strains were tested as mixed culture, there was bactericidal activity against E. coli after 1 h incubation and after 3 h for S. aureus. This activity was observed against B. fragilis and E. faecalis after 6 h incubation in the mixed culture assays and after 3 h when organisms were tested individually. Regrowth was not observed over a 24 h period. These data show that trovafloxacin might be effective in intraabdominal infections caused by mixed aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of complexes of ruthenium (II).
AB  - Twenty ruthenium (II) complexes (1-5) were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activity against Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis. Compounds 1d, 1e, 1h, 1i and 1j showed more pronounced antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi as compared to the nitrogen donor ruthenium complexes; hydrophobic substituents were significantly more effective. None of the compounds 1-5 exhibited antimicrobial activity against the Gram-negative strains Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) with the concentrations ranging between 12.5 and 800 micrograms/ml.
TI  - A comparison of the antibacterial activity of levobupivacaine vs. bupivacaine: an in vitro study with bacteria implicated in epidural infection.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to compare the antibacterial activity of bupivacaine with levobupivacaine against a range of bacteria implicated in epidural infection to determine whether any differences existed between the two drugs. Concentrations of 0.125%, 0.25% and 0.5% bupivacaine and levobupivacaine were inoculated with suspensions of either Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus or Enterococcus faecalis. After incubation, the mixtures were plated onto blood agar and colony counts were recorded after a further period of incubation. The minimum bactericidal concentration of local anaesthetic against the three bacteria studied was found to be 0.25% for bupivacaine and 0.5% for levobupivacaine showing racemic bupivacaine to have a more potent antibacterial action than levobupivacaine. This finding suggests that the dextrobupivacaine isomer of racemic bupivacaine has a more potent antibacterial action than the levobupivacaine isomer.
TI  - The ex vivo antimicrobial activity and colonization rate of two antimicrobial-bonded central venous catheters.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Catheter-related sepsis is an important complication associated with the use of central venous catheters. Recent studies have suggested that antimicrobial-bonded catheters may reduce catheter colonization and catheter-related sepsis. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the antimicrobial activity and the colonization rate of two commercially available antimicrobial-bonded central venous catheters. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled, nonblinded study. SETTING: Medical intensive care unit of a university-affiliated teaching hospital. PATIENTS: One hundred twenty consecutive medical intensive care unit patients requiring new central venous catheters (fresh stick). INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive a) a Standard Arrow; b) an ARROWgard; or c) a Cook Bio-Guard Spectrum central venous catheter. Central venous catheters were removed when they were no longer required or when catheter-related sepsis was suspected. Under aseptic conditions, the distal 12 cm of the removed catheters were cut into six 2-cm segments. Semiquantitative culture was performed (by roll technique) on the distal segment. Colonization was defined as >15 colony-forming units. Using a modified Kirby-Bauer technique, the zone of inhibition of the remaining five segments was determined against the following organisms: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Candida albicans Catheters that were removed within 24 hrs of insertion were excluded from the analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seven patients were not assessable. The baseline clinical and demographic characteristics were similar among the three groups of patients. Eleven Standard Arrow (28%), seven ARROWgard (19%), and four Bio-Guard (11%) catheters were colonized (p = .05 for Bio-Guard vs. control). Staphylococci were the most common colonizing organisms. Two patients with Standard Arrow catheters (5%) and one patient with an ARROWgard catheter (3%) developed catheter-related sepsis. Antibiotic-coated catheters significantly inhibited the growth of all test organisms except C. albicans (p < or = .05). Zones of inhibition were significantly larger for the Bio-Guard compared with the ARROWgard catheter when tested against MRSA, S. epidermidis, and E. faecalis (p < or = .002). CONCLUSION: The Bio-Guard central venous catheter had greater ex vivo antimicrobial activity against MRSA, S. epidermidis, and E. faecalis compared with the ARROWgard catheter, and this was associated with a significantly lower rate of catheter colonization.
TI  - [Clinical features and outcome of pneumonia in patients with lung cancer].
AB  - We reviewed our experience with pneumonia in patients with lung cancer over a 14-year period at Kurume University Hospital. We examined the clinical features and significance of pathogenic microbes isolated from sputum in patients with lung cancer complicated by pneumonia. Many investigators have noted that patients with squamous cell lung cancer tend to contract pneumonia more readily than patients with cancers of other histopathological types. Our review, however, disclosed no significant differences among histopathological types. Bacteriological examinations of sputum revealed the frequent involvement of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and various gram-negative organisms (e.g., Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, and Klebsiella species) that are known to be causative agents of hospital-acquired infection. Beta-lactam and CLDM were less effective. Carbapenem used alone as the second regimen of treatment for lung cancer patients with pneumonia was found to be as effective as combination therapy with beta-lactam and aminoglycoside. However, more detailed investigations (e.g., randomized prospective studies) will be needed to identify suitable antibiotics against pneumonia in patients with lung cancer. We concluded that it will be necessary to evaluate the clinical features and outcome of pneumonia in lung cancer patients in order to provide more effective treatment.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in gram-positive pathogens isolated in the UK between October 1996 and January 1997.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance in gram-positive pathogens from 30 centres in the UK (ten Teaching, ten Associate Teaching and ten District General Hospitals) was studied over a 4 month period between October 1996 and January 1997. High-level resistance (HLR) and low-level resistance (LLR) to penicillin amongst pneumococci was 3.3% and 3.4%, respectively. However, considerable variation in resistance rates was observed depending on geographical location (LLR range 0-15.4% and HLR range 0-30.8%). Considerable variation in resistance rates was also observed for Staphylococcus aureus to methicillin, with rates ranging from 0% to 56.7% depending on locality. Using conventional MIC methodology, none of the isolates of S. aureus was considered as having reduced sensitivity to vancomycin. However, eight isolates grew on Brain Heart Infusion Agar containing vancomycin (4 mg/L) after prolonged incubation and are therefore worthy of further investigation by electron microscopy. With Enterococcus faecalis, resistance rates were similar between the three types of hospital and only four isolates were considered resistant to glycopeptide antibiotics (one vanA and three vanB phenotype).
TI  - Pathogenesis of gram-positive bacterial endophthalmitis.
AB  - The severity of endophthalmitis has been associated generally with the virulence  of the offending pathogen. However, precisely what constitutes the virulence in intraocular infections remains ill defined. We therefore sought to identify the basis for virulence for three common ocular pathogens (Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus) in terms of intraocular growth rates, bacterial localization patterns, and the contribution of cell walls and secreted products to the pathogenesis of endophthalmitis. Rabbit eyes were injected intravitreally with (i) viable B. cereus, E. faecalis, or S. aureus, (ii) metabolically inactive B. cereus, E. faecalis, or S. aureus, (iii) sacculus preparations from each strain, or (iv) culture fluid containing products secreted by each strain. Eyes were assessed at various times following injection by slit lamp biomicroscopy, electroretinography (ERG), bacterial and inflammatory cell enumeration, and histology. B. cereus endophthalmitis followed a more rapid and virulent course than E. faecalis or S. aureus endophthalmitis, eliminating retinal responsiveness, as measured by ERG, by 12 h. Analysis of bacterial localization revealed that B. cereus uniquely migrated rapidly from posterior to anterior segment during infection. Although injection of neither metabolically inactive bacteria nor cell wall sacculi greatly affected ERG, significant intraocular inflammation was observed. Injection of B. cereus or S. aureus culture fluids caused both significant reductions in retinal responsiveness and significant intraocular inflammation, paralleling that seen in natural infections. The results demonstrate that toxins, intraocular localization, and, to a lesser extent, the intraocular host response to cell walls all contribute to the pathogenesis of B. cereus, S. aureus, and E. faecalis endophthalmitis in a pathogen-specific manner. The key pathophysiologic differences in these intraocular diseases highlight opportunities for optimizing conventional therapies and deriving new ones.
TI  - Bacterial pollution of cutting fluids: a risk factor for occupational diseases.
AB  - An outbreak of occupational diseases involving 38 metal workers with local infections on the hands and the face (53%), bronchitis (29%), and bronchopneumonia (18%) urged an examination of 150 samples of emulsions which the workers used in processing metals. Among the isolated bacteria, the most frequent was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (48%), followed by Escherichia coli (44%), Proteus spp. (11%), Enterococcus faecalis (9%), Enterobacter aerogenes (7%), Citrobacter spp. (5%), Shigella spp., Staphylococcus aureus (3%), and the sulphite reducing Clostridia (1%). Moulds and yeasts were isolated from all tested samples. Most samples counted about 3 x 10(5)/ml of colony forming units. It was concluded that all emulsions and other substances which come in direct contact with the workers should be regularly monitored. Furthermore, preservatives should be added to prevent microbial infection.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of various endodontic irrigants on selected microorganisms.
AB  - AIM: This study was undertaken to determine the antimicrobial effect of various endodontic irrigants against six selected microorganisms. METHODOLOGY: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus salivarius, Str. pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans were included in the study. Pre-sterilized Whatman paper discs, 6 mm in diameter and soaked with the test solution, were prepared and placed onto the previously seeded agar Petri plates. Each plate was incubated aerobically. A zone of inhibition was recorded for each plate and the results were analysed statistically. RESULTS: 5.25% NaOCl was effective against all test microorganisms with a substantial zone of inhibition. Saline was always ineffective. Decreased concentration of NaOCl significantly reduced its antimicrobial effect. Cresophene showed a significantly larger (P < 0.05) average zone of inhibition compared to the other experimental irrigants. Alcohol had smaller but not significantly different zones of inhibition than chlorhexidine. CONCLUSIONS: 5.25% NaOCl was superior in its antimicrobial abilities compared with other irrigants used. A reduced concentration of NaOCl (0.5%) resulted in significantly decreased antimicrobial effects. When compared with 21% alcohol, 0.5% NaOCl and 2% chlorhexidine, paramonochlorophenol (cresophene) showed a greater antimicrobial effect.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1997). III Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - Susceptibilities to various antimicrobial agents were examined for Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Echerichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that were isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 9 hospitals during June 1997 to May 1998, and the results were compared with those obtained during the same period in earlier years. 1. E. faecalis The MIC90s of quinolones for E. faecalis isolated from uncomplicated UTIs have changed better state during the latest period. Among E. faecalis strains, those with high susceptibilities to ampicillin (ABPC) and minocycline (MINO) appeared to had decreased during period of 1995-1997, which recovered during the latest period. 2. S. aureus The sensitive strains of S. aureus to imipenem (IPM) and clindamycin (CLDM) had increased during the period of 1996-1997, but those have decreased again during the latest period. 3. E. coli The susceptibilities of E. coli to MINO have been better in the latest period with the MIC90 was ranged from 2 to 4 micrograms/ml. The susceptibilities to quinolones of E. coli isolated from complicated UTIs had decreased during the period of 1995-1997, but those have recovered during the latest period. 4. Klebsiella spp. Among Klebsiella spp. strains isolated from uncomplicated UTIs, those with low susceptibilities to almost cephems have increased in the latest period. To other antimicrobial agents, the susceptibilities of Klebsiella spp. did not show any changes during the latest period. 5. P. aeruginosa The susceptibilities to most agents of P. aeruginosa did not show any changes, the decreased susceptibilities to cefozopran (CZOP), carbapenems and monobactams of P. aeruginosa observed in 1996 appeared to have been retrieved in 1997. These susceptibility changes should be utilized in determining clinical treatments.
TI  - Screening of medicinal plants from Trinidad and Tobago for antimicrobial and insecticidal properties.
AB  - Antibacterial activity in 51 extracts from 29 plant species currently used in traditional medicine in Trinidad and the neighbouring Caribbean islands was tested for by the agar dilution streak method using six bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Salmonella tophimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis. The extracts from eight of the plants tested showed significant activity against one or more micro-organisms and the most susceptible bacterium was Staphylococcus aureus. In the bioassays for toxicity towards the Aedes aegypti mosquito the most effective plant extracts were from Justicia pectoralis, Manihot utilissima and Stachytarpheta jamaicensis.
TI  - Synthesis and structure-activity relationship of novel glycylcycline derivatives  leading to the discovery of GAR-936.
AB  - A number of new glycylcyclines were synthesized for structure-activity relationship study. Many of the derivatives exhibit potent, broad spectrum antibacterial activity against both tetracycline susceptible and resistant organisms. GAR-936 (TBG-MINO) shows better activity than the previously reported DMG-MINO and DMG-DMDOT.
TI  - Susceptibility testing of linezolid by two standard methods.
AB  - To determine to what extent methodological differences affect susceptibility testing parameters for linezolid, MICs and disk inhibition zones were compared using the methods described by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards and the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy for 198 strains of gram-positive cocci. Zones were 4-5 mm larger by the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy method, but MICs did not differ, except for pneumococci, which were more sensitive when the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy method was used. This is because incubation in CO2 depresses the activity of linezolid against this species only. Breakpoints for linezolid may need adjusting when testing is by other than National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards methods.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and spectrum of SCH27899 (Ziracin) tested against gram-positive species including recommendations for routine susceptibility testing methods and quality control. Quality Control Study Group.
AB  - SCH27899 is an oligosaccharide, everninomicin antibiotic with activity primarily  against Gram-positive pathogens. The activity of SCH27899 was evaluated against 360 routine clinical isolates by the broth microdilution (BMD), agar dilution (AD), disk diffusion (DD), and Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) methods. In addition, results from a nine center SCH27899 quality control (QC) trial were used to establish QC ranges. SCH27899 MICs for 330 Gram-Positive strains, including multiply-resistant staphylococci and enterococci, ranged from 0.015 to 1 microgram/ml with MIC90s of 0.12 to 0.5 microgram/ ml. SCH27899 had no measurable activity against the 30 selected Gram-negative strains tested (MICs, > 256 micrograms/ml), with the exception of Moraxella catarrhalis MICs, 0.12 microgram/ ml). Etest MICs for SCH27899 correlated well with AD and BMD results with > 90% of MICs within +/- one log2 dilutions of the reference test results. Three disk concentrations (2.5-, 5-, 10-microgram) of SCH27899 were evaluated, but minimal difference of zone diameters between disk drug contents was observed (+/- 2 mm). SCH27899 disk zone diameters correlated poorly with reference MICs due to small zone diameters (range, 11 to 22 mm) attributed to poor diffusion through agar mediums, a product of this compound's high molecular weight and solubility. The use of the DD method for SCH27899 was not recommended. The proposed MIC quality assurance limits for SCH27899 using Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 was 0.06 to 0.25 microgram/ml for both QC strains and methods. SCH27899 appears to be a eveminomicin-derivative widely active against important Gram-positive cocci, and in vitro dilution testing methods would be preferred for clinical use, validated by the recommended MIC control ranges cited in this report.
TI  - Conjugative mobilization of the rolling-circle plasmid pIP823 from Listeria monocytogenes BM4293 among gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - We determined the sequence and genetic organization of plasmid pIP823, which contains the dfrD gene; dfrD confers high-level trimethoprim resistance to Listeria monocytogenes BM4293 by synthesis of dihydrofolate reductase type S2. pIP823 possessed all the features of the pUB110/pC194 plasmid family, whose members replicate by the rolling-circle mechanism. The rep gene encoded a protein identical to RepU, the protein required for initiation of the replication of plasmids pTB913 from a thermophilic Bacillus sp. and pUB110 from Staphylococcus aureus. The mob gene encoded a protein with a high degree of amino acid identity with the Mob proteins involved in conjugative mobilization and interplasmidic recombination of pTB913 and pUB110. The host range of pIP823 was broad and included L. monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli. In all these species, pIP823 replicated by generating single-stranded DNA and was stable. Conjugative mobilization of pIP823 was obtained by self-transferable plasmids between L. monocytogenes and E. faecalis, between L. monocytogenes and E. coli, and between strains of E. coli, and by the streptococcal conjugative transposon Tn1545 from L. monocytogenes to E. faecalis, and from L. monocytogenes and E. faecalis to E. coli. These data indicate that the gene flux observed in nature from gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria can occur by conjugative mobilization. Our results suggest that dissemination of trimethoprim resistance in Listeria spp. and acquisition of other antibiotic resistance determinants in this species can be anticipated.
TI  - Lacticin 3147 displays activity in buffer against gram-positive bacterial pathogens which appear insensitive in standard plate assays.
AB  - Lacticin 3147 is a broad-spectrum bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis DPC3147, which has been shown to be active against a range of food-borne bacteria. The reported inhibitory range for lacticin is extended to include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, penicillin-resistant Pneumococcus, Propionibacterium acne and Streptococcus mutans. This extended host range is not obvious from traditional agar plate-based methods, but reductions in bacterial cell numbers by up to 6 log10 cfu ml-1 was observed after 2 h in time-kill curve studies conducted in broth, suggesting that the bacteriocin may have potential as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of human infections.
TI  - New derivatives of benzimidazole and their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Azolium salts and neutral 2-aryl derivatives of benzimidazole, benzothiazole and  benzoxazole were synthesized and compounds were identified by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and microanalytical methods. In this work the salts 1 and the neutral compounds 2 were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against standard strains: Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Candida albicans and Candida tropicals. The compounds 1f, 1g, 1l, 1m, 1n, 2a, 2b, 2c, 2e, 2f showed antimicrobial activity against Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Candida albicans and Candida tropicals, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging between 50 to 200 mg/mL. Compounds 1f, 1g, 1l, lm, 2b, 2c showed the highest activity. Benzothiazolium and benzoxazolium salts were more active than 1,3-disubstituted benzimidazolium salts and neutral 2-substituted benzimidazole, benzothiazole and benzoxazole derivatives.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1997). II. Background of patients].
AB  - Clinical background was investigated on patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) from whom 603 bacterial strains were isolated in 9 hospitals during the period from June, 1997 through May, 1998. 1. Distribution of age and sex of patients and type of infections Among males, those with ages less than 50 years were only 12.5%, and those in the 70's were most frequent (33.3%). Among females, those with ages less than 20 years were only 3.4%, and those in the 60's were the most frequent (22.9%). With regard to type of infections, more than a half of infections among males with ages 50 years or older were of complicated types, but most of infections among females were of uncomplicated types, especially those of ages less than 50 years. 2. Ages of patients and types of pathogens Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated in uncomplicated and complicated UTIs without indwelling catheters. In complicated UTIs with indwelling catheters, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis had mainly detected, they had no relationship with ages. 3. Effect of antibiotic use on isolation frequencies of pathogens Use of antibiotics decreased pathogens isolated from patients with uncomplicated UTIs drastically (183 isolates before antibiotics compared to 13 after). Even isolated pathogens from patients with complicated UTIs decreased drastically with the use of antibiotics when indwelling catheters were not in use (175 isolates before antibiotics compared to 53 after), but when indwelling catheters were in use, antibiotics slightly decreased (109 isolates before antibiotics compared to 70 after). 4. Surgical procedures and types of causative organisms for UTIs E. faecalis were more isolated when a surgical procedures were used, and E. coli were more isolated when, they were not used in uncomplicated and complicated UTIs without indwelling catheters. In complicated UTIs with indwelling catheters, E. coli and E. faecalis were more isolated when a surgical procedures were used, and P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were more isolated when they were not used.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1997). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 560 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 9 hospitals during the period of June 1997 to May 1998. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.3% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.7% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. Imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) were also active with the MIC90s of 2 micrograms/ml. The others had low activities with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA VCM and arbekacin (ABK) showed the highest activities against both S. aureus and MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) had low activities with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. More than a half of S. aureus strains (including MRSA) showed high susceptibilities to gentamicin (GM) and MINO, the MIC50s of 0.25 microgram/ml or 0.5 microgram/ml. 3. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. The MIC90s of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and tosufloxacin (TFLX) were 1 microgram/ml, the MIC90s of amikacin (AMK) and ofloxacin (OFLX) were 4 micrograms/ml, the MIC90 of GM was 16 micrograms/ml. Among E. cloacae strains, those with low susceptibilities to quinolones have decreased in 1997, compared with those in 1996. But the other drugs were not so active in 1997 as 1996. 4. Escherichia coli All drugs except penicillins were active against E. coli with the MIC90s of 8 micrograms/ml or below. Particularly, flomoxef (FMOX), cefmenoxime (CMX), cefpirome (CPR), cefozopran (CZOP), IPM, CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against E. coli with the MIC90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 5. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to almost all the drugs except penicillins. Carumonam (CRMN) had the strongest activity with the MICs for all strains equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. FMOX, CPR, CZOP, CPFX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. The MIC90s of quinolones had changed into a better state in 1997, compared with those in 1996. 6. Proteus mirabilis Almost all the drugs except ABPC and MINO showed high activities against P. mirabilis. CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), latamoxef (LMOX), CPR, cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX) and CRMN showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis. The MICs of them for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. CPFX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 7. Pseudomonas aeruginosa The MIC90 of GM was 8 micrograms/ml, the MIC90s of AMK, IPM and meropenem (MEPM) were 16 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active against P. aeruginosa with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. The MIC90s of quinolones had changed into a lower state in 1997, compared with those in 1996. 8. Serratia marcescens IPM showed the highest activity against S. marcescens. Its MIC90 was 2 micrograms/ml. GM was also active with the MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. The MIC90s of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. The MIC50s of CRMN was 0.125 microgram/ml or below, the MIC50s of CPR and CZOP were 0.25 microgram/ml.
TI  - [In vitro activities of 23 antimicrobial agents against 4,993 gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains isolated from multicenter of Japan during 1994--in vitro susceptibility surveillance.Levofloxacin-Surveillance Group].
AB  - In a surveillance study conducted during 1994 at 24 medical institutes from different geographical areas of Japan, the susceptibility of clinical isolates to twenty three comparative agents, such as ofloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, ampicillin, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin, oxacillin, piperacillin, cefaclor, cefotiam, cefdinir, cefclidin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, imipenem, aztreonam, vancomycin, minocycline, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, amikacin, and gentamicin, were tested by the standard broth micro-dilution method. A total of 4,993 isolates tested in this study included Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), coagllase negative streptococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobactericeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa from patients with urinary tract infections or respiratory tract infections, and Haemophilus influenzae. For MSSA, S. pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae, and H. influenzae, more than 70% of the isolates was susceptible to fluoloquinolones. However, resistance occurred in more than 50% of MRSA and P. aeruginosa isolated from UTI. Fluoroquinolones were found to be effective against high level penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, the third generation cephem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae.
TI  - Bloodstream infections in a neonatal intensive-care unit: 12 years' experience with an antibiotic control program.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of gram-positive coccal (GPC), gram-negative  bacillary (GNB), and fungal blood-stream infections (BSIs) during a 12-year period in which a consistent antibiotic treatment protocol was in place; to evaluate the efficacy of these antibiotic policies in relation to treatment, to the emergence of bacterial or fungal resistance, and to the occurrence of infection outbreaks or epidemics. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and bacteriological information from 363 infants born during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997 who developed 433 blood-culture-proven BSIs was analyzed. Early-onset BSIs were defined as those infections discovered within 48 hours of birth, and late-onset BSIs as those that occurred thereafter. Suspected early-onset BSIs were treated with ampicillin and gentamicin, and suspected late-onset BSIs with vancomycin and gentamicin. Antibiotics were changed on the basis of organism antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: Early-onset BSIs were noted in 52 of 21,336 live births and 40 of 20,402 live births during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997, respectively. GPC (83% due to group B streptococcus [GBS]) accounted for approximately one half of early-onset BSI cases and GNB (68% Enterobacteriaceae) for the remainder. Early-onset GBS declined from 24 to 11 cases (P=.04) and late-onset BSI increased from 111 to 230 cases (P<.01) from the first to the last study period. Sixty-eight percent of late-onset BSIs were due to GPC (primarily coagulase-negative Staphylococcus), 18% to GNB, and 14% to fungus. Over the study period, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the newborn intensivecare unit (unlike those strains from other hospital units) remained fully susceptible to ceftazidime and gentamicin. Although the hospitalwide prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus increased, all 17 newborn BSI cases were due to methicillin-sensitive strains. Prevalence of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus increased, although all strains remained vancomycin-susceptible, as did the 16 Enterococcus faecalis isolates. All fungi recovered (from 48 patients) were susceptible to amphotericin. CONCLUSION: We observed a decrease in the prevalence of early-onset BSIs due to GBS and an increase in late-onset BSIs due to GPC, GNB, and fungi. The combination of ampicillin and gentamicin for suspected early-onset BSIs and vancomycin and gentamicin for late-onset BSIs has been successful for treatment of individual patients without the occurrence of infection outbreaks or the emergence of resistance. Controlled antibiotic programs and periodic evaluations based on individual unit and not on hospitalwide antibiograms are advisable.
TI  - In vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against clinical isolates of common gram-positive bacteria in Taiwan.
AB  - The MICs of quinupristin/dalfopristin against common Gram-positive bacteria isolated from various clinical specimens at a university hospital in Taiwan were determined by the agar dilution method. The tested bacteria included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis (MSSE), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. With the exception of E. faecalis all bacteria were susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin. The MIC50 and MIC90 were, respectively, 0.25 microgram/mL and 0.5 microgram/mL for both MRSA and MSSA; 0.25 microgram/mL and 0.5 microgram/mL for MRSE; 0.25 microgram/mL and 0.25 microgram/mL for MSSE; 0.125 microgram/mL and 0.125 microgram/mL for S. pyogenes; and < or = 0.03 microgram/mL and 0.25 microgram/mL for S. pneumoniae. Eighty-two percent of the tested E. faecalis isolates were intermediately resistant or resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin, with an MIC50 of 2 micrograms/mL and an MIC90 of 4 micrograms/mL. Quinupristin/dalfopristin seems to be a promising antimicrobial agent against common Gram-positive bacteria other than E. faecalis in Taiwan.
TI  - Gatifloxacin (AM-1155, CG 5501) susceptibility testing interpretive criteria and  quality control guidelines for dilution and disk (5-microgram) diffusion methods. The Quality Control Study Group.
AB  - Gatifloxacin (formerly AM-1155 and CG5501), a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone, has  an expanded spectrum of activity against Gram-positive cocci and some anaerobic bacteria. This compound was tested against 600 recent clinical strains of rapidly growing aerobic species to establish susceptibility testing interpretive criteria for the reference broth microdilution and standardized disk (5-microgram) diffusion methods of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). These strains included 285 Enterobacteriaceae (17 species), 165 staphylococci, 49 enterococci, and 101 nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli. Based on achievable serum levels with projected gatifloxacin dosing regimens, MIC break points of < or = 2 micrograms/mL (> or = 18 mm) for susceptibility and > or = 8 micrograms/mL (< or = 14 mm) for resistance were selected. The absolute agreement between tests was 94.3% with no very major false-resistant errors. The quality control ranges (MIC and zone diameters) for the NCCLS recommended strains were determined in a nine-laboratory NCCLS protocol as follows: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 = 0.008-0.03 microgram/mL and 31-37 mm; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 = 0.12-1 microgram/mL; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 = 0.5-2 micrograms/ml and 21-27 mm; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 = 27-33 mm and S. aureus ATCC 29213 = 0.03-0.12 microgram/mL. Gatifloxacin appears to be a promising new fluoroquinolone with acceptable susceptibility testing methods for routine clinical laboratory use.
TI  - Uptake kinetics of nucleic acid targeting dyes in S. aureus, E. faecalis and B. cereus: a flow cytometric study.
AB  - For flow cytometry-based detection as well as susceptibility testing and counting, staining of the bacterial cells is essential. In an attempt to develop rapid preparatory procedures for nucleic acid staining of wild type Gram positive bacteria, the uptake of fluorescent dyes in viable S. aureus, E. faecalis, and B. cereus cells was studied by flow cytometry under conditions intended to block probe efflux and increase cell wall permeability. The aim of the study was to develop procedures which allow rapid nucleic acid staining independent of fixation, since ethanol fixation is time-consuming and may mask phenomena associated with viability and lead to uncontrolled loss and aggregation of cells. The dye uptake was measured repeatedly after treating cells with metabolic inhibitors in order to block probe efflux, or cold shock (0 degree C) to increase permeability. The probes used were mithramycin (Mi), ethidium bromide (EB), DAPI, Hoechst 33342 and Hoechst 33258. None of the procedures facilitated uptake of the dyes to a level similar to that obtained in fixed control cells in all of the species. After metabolic inhibition of B. cereus cells, DAPI and Hoechst fluorescence increased to a level similar to or above that found in fixed cells, indicating that the uptake of these dyes is limited by energy-dependent efflux. A similar increase of DAPI fluorescence was observed after cold shock suggesting the uptake of this dye to be limited also by permeability in B. cereus. The Mi and EB fluorescence increased to the level of the fixed control cells under all conditions tested, suggesting free probe influx in this species. Generally, probe uptake in S. aureus and E. faecalis was lower than in B. cereus cells, and no permeabilizing effect of cold shock was observed. In some experiments the fluorescence exceeded that of ethanol fixed control cells, indicating that the fixation may cause conformational changes in DNA.
TI  - In vitro activities of two ketolides, HMR 3647 and HMR 3004, against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activities of two new ketolides, HMR 3647 and HMR 3004, were tested  by the agar dilution method against 280 strains of gram-positive bacteria with different antibiotic susceptibility profiles, including Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus spp. (group A streptococci, group B streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and alpha-hemolytic streptococci). Seventeen erythromycin-susceptible (EMs), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strains were found to have HMR 3647 and HMR 3004 MICs 4- to 16-fold lower than those of erythromycin (MIC at which 50% of isolates were inhibited [MIC50] [HMR 3647 and HMR 3004], 0.03 microgram/ml; range, 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml; MIC50 [erythromycin], 0.25 microgram/ml; range, 0.25 to 0.5 microgram/ml). All methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains tested were resistant to erythromycin and had HMR 3647 and HMR 3004 MICs of > 64 micrograms/ml. The ketolides were slightly more active against E. faecalis than against E. faecium, and MICs for individual strains varied with erythromycin susceptibility. The MIC50s of HMR 3647 and HMR 3004 against Ems enterococci (MIC < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) and those enterococcal isolates with erythromycin MICs of 1 to 16 micrograms/ml were 0.015 microgram/ml. E. faecalis strains that had erythromycin MICs of 128 to > 512 micrograms/ml showed HMR 3647 MICs in the range of 0.03 to 16 micrograms/ml and HMR 3004 MICs in the range of 0.03 to 64 micrograms/ml. In the group of E. faecium strains for which MICs of erythromycin were > or = 512 micrograms/ml, MICs of both ketolides were in the range of 1 to 64 micrograms/ml, with almost all isolates showing ketolide MICs of < or = 16 micrograms/ml. The ketolides were also more active than erythromycin against group A streptococci, group B streptococci, S. pneumoniae, rhodococci, leuconostocs, pediococci, lactobacilli, and diphtheroids. Time-kill studies showed bactericidal activity against one strain of S. aureus among the four strains tested. The increased activity of ketolides against gram-positive bacteria suggests that further study of these agents for possible efficacy against infections caused by these bacteria is warranted.
TI  - Microbiological safety of essential oils used in complementary therapies and the  activity of these compounds against bacterial and fungal pathogens.
AB  - To determine the safety of plant essential oils we determined the sterility of eight of these products obtained from retail outlets. In addition, the ability of oils to support the growth of fungal and bacterial pathogens was examined. The antimicrobial activity of these products against seven bacterial species and Candida albicans was also investigated. All oils and their respective carriers were sterile. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were unable to survive in oils for longer than 6 h, whereas C. albicans was able to survive, but not multiply, in ylang ylang oil for at least 48 h.
TI  - Antibacterial synergistic effect of chlorhexidine and hydrogen peroxide against Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Chlorhexidine (CHX) and Hydrogen peroxide (HP) are potent antibacterial agents that are used in controlling dental plaque. However, both agents bear undesired side-effects. We have tested the hypothesis that an antibacterial synergistic effect can occur between the two agents against Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. We have found that at several combinations of HP and CHX an antibacterial synergistic effect does occur, while at other combinations a on-significant synergism was noticed. No antagonism between the two agents was found in our experimental system. It can be postulated that the mechanism of this synergistic effect is via alteration of the bacterial cell-surface by CHX thereby allowing for an increased amount of HP to penetrate and to react with the intercellular organelles of the bacteria. These results suggest that CHX and HP can be of use in controlling the dental plaque in the oral cavity.
TI  - [A consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-positive cocci and gram-negative cocci].
AB  - The results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare during the period of January 1993 to July 1995, were analyzed for typical Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative cocci in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. During these 3 years, Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B) showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to ofloxacin (OFLX) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (ST), while Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefaclor (CCL). However, these annual changes were almost negligible. Generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against Gram-positive and -negative cocci. However, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. On the other hand, cefmetazole (CMZ), vancomycin (VCM), latamoxef (LMOX), ST and minocycline (MINO) showed good activities against some of the Gram-positive and -negative cocci to which no indication are approved. In conclusion, beside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of an antimicrobial agent is necessary.
TI  - Coenzyme A-disulfide reductase from Staphylococcus aureus: evidence for asymmetric behavior on interaction with pyridine nucleotides.
AB  - An unusual flavoprotein disulfide reductase, which catalyzes the NADPH-dependent  reduction of CoASSCoA, has recently been purified from the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus [delCardayre, S. B., Stock, K. P., Newton, G. L., Fahey, R. C., and Davies, J. E. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 5744-5751]. Coenzyme A-disulfide reductase (CoADR) lacks the redox-active protein disulfide characteristic of the disulfide reductases; instead, NADPH reduction yields 1 protein-SH and 1 CoASH. Furthermore, the CoADR sequence reveals the presence of a single putative active-site Cys (Cys43) within an SFXXC motif also seen in the Enterococcus faecalis NADH oxidase and NADH peroxidase, which use a single redox-active cysteine-sulfenic acid in catalysis. In this report, we provide a detailed examination of the equilibrium properties of both wild-type and C43S CoADRs, focusing on the role of Cys43 in the catalytic redox cycle, the behavior of both enzyme forms on reduction with dithionite and NADPH, and the interaction of NADP+ with the corresponding reduced enzyme species. The results of these analyses, combined with electrospray mass spectrometric data for the two oxidized enzyme forms, fully support the catalytic redox role proposed for Cys43 and confirm that this is the attachment site for bound CoASH. In addition, we provide evidence indicating dramatic thermodynamic inequivalence between the two active sites per dimer, similar to that documented for the related enzymes mercuric reductase and NADH oxidase; only 1 FAD is reduced with NADPH in wild-type CoADR. The EH2.NADPH/EH4.NADP+ complex which results is reoxidized quantitatively in titrations with CoASSCoA, supporting a possible role for the asymmetric reduced dimer in catalysis.
TI  - Comparative activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and RPR 106972 and the effect of medium on in-vitro test results.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin and RPR 106972 were active in vitro against a wide range of aerobic Gram-positive organisms including Enterococcus faecium. However, most isolates of Enterococcus faecalis were resistant or of intermediate sensitivity. Against Staphylococcus aureus quinupristin/dalfopristin was more active but for all other species the range of activity of the two drugs was the same or RPR 106972 was more active. RPR 106972 was also more active against the respiratory pathogens Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Quinupristin/dalfopristin MICs for isolates of H. influenzae (1-8 mg/L) clustered around the breakpoint. There were differences in the quality of growth, but little difference in MICs or zone diameters was obtained on three different media: Mueller-Hinton (MHA), Iso-Sensitest (ISA), and Diagnostic Sensitivity Test (DST) agars. The addition of blood to the medium increased MICs 2- to 4-fold, with MHA showing the greatest increase, and reduced zone diameters around quinupristin/dalfopristin discs by 3-4 mm, with the greatest effect on ISA.
TI  - In vitro activities of aminomethyl-substituted analogs of novel tetrahydrofuranyl carbapenems.
AB  - CL 188,624, CL 190,294, and CL 191,121 are novel aminomethyl tetrahydrofuranyl (THF)-1 beta-methylcarbapenems. The in vitro antibacterial activities of these THF carbapenems were evaluated and compared with those of biapenem, imipenem, and meropenem against 554 recent clinical isolates obtained from geographically distinct medical centers across North America. The antibacterial activities of the THF carbapenems were equivalent to that of biapenem, and the THF carbapenems were slightly more active than imipenem and less active than meropenem against most of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae but lacked significant activity against Pseudomonas isolates. In general, CL 191,121 was two- to fourfold more active than CL 188,624 and CL 190,294 against the staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates tested. CL 191,121 was twofold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and was as activity as imipenem against Enterococcus faecalis isolates. Biapenem and meropenem were two- and fourfold less active than CL 191,121, respectively, against the methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and E. faecalis. All the carbapenems displayed equivalent good activities against the streptococci. Biapenem was slightly more active than the other carbapenems against Bacteroides fragilis isolates. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated that the THF carbapenems were bactericidal in 6 h against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus isolates. The postantibiotic effect exerted by CL 191,121 was comparable to or slightly longer than that of imipenem against isolates of S. aureus, E. coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - The role of various agents in chicken amyloid arthropathy.
AB  - The results of an inventory of field cases of amyloid arthropathy in chickens and of routine post-mortem recordings over a two years period are described. Studies were also performed to evaluate the amyloidogenic potential of arthrotropic bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis) isolated from chickens as well as several Enterococcus faecalis isolates compared to the amyloidogenic E. faecalis isolate (previously isolated from amyloidotic joints). As chicken anemia virus was also isolated from amyloidotic joints of field cases, it was also screened for its amyloidogenic potential. In another experiment, Mycoplasma synoviae, inactivated E. faecalis isolate 6085.94, Freund's adjuvant and an arthrotropic reovirus field isolate were also screened for amyloidogenicity by intra-articular injection. These studies showed that the ability to elicit extensive amyloid arthropathy is reserved primarily to E. faecalis, but that this property is not common to every E. faecalis isolate. Intra-articular application of complete Freund's adjuvant led to the formation of extensive joint amyloid deposits. Of the other micro-organisms studied, S. aureus, S. enteritidis and E. coli were also able to cause joint amyloidosis, but in very small amounts. Inactivated E. faecalis, chicken anemia virus and reovirus did not cause amyloid arthropathy after intra-articular inoculation. This study is consistent with results of the analyses of previous field cases and of the induction of amyloid arthropathy in chickens, suggesting a considerable role for E. faecalis in this clinical-pathological entity. Finally, strain typing by analysis of chromosomal DNA restriction endonuclease digests by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of amyloidogenic, non-amyloidogenic, amyloid-associated and other E. faecalis isolates from various origins showed that all amyloidogenic and amyloid-associated E. faecalis isolates had similar restriction digests, suggesting clonal spread.
TI  - Obturator internus muscle abscess in children: report of seven cases and review.
AB  - Obturator internus muscle (OIM) abscess is an uncommon entity often mistaken for  septic arthritis of the hip. We describe seven children with OIM abscess and review seven previously reported cases. The most common presenting symptoms were hip or thigh pain (14 patients), fever (13), and limp (13). The hip was flexed, abducted, and externally rotated in 11 patients. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography (CT) were diagnostic for OIM abscess in the 14 patients. Associated abscesses were located in the obturator externus muscle (5 patients), psoas muscle (2), and iliac muscle (1). The etiologic agents were Staphylococcus aureus (8 patients), Streptococcus pyogenes (2), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (2), and Enterococcus faecalis (1). Three patients underwent CT-guided percutaneous drainage, and three had surgical drainage. Three patients had ischial osteomyelitis in addition to OIM abscess. The 11 children with uncomplicated OIM abscess were treated for a median of 28 days. All patients had an uneventful recovery.
TI  - Bactericidal action of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation: an in vitro investigation.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation on bacterial growth. Six different bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Lactococcis lactis, Salmonella typhimurium, and Deinococcus radiodurans) were exposed in vitro to various doses and energy densities of laser radiation. To exclude bacterial killing by supraphysiological heating, the temperature change in the samples during irradiation was measured. Extended antimicrobial effects of XeCl excimer-laser radiation depending on the time of radiation, the energy density of the laser beam, and the irradiated bacterial strain were observed. Reduction of bacterial growth is independent of temperature and not linked to any ablative tissue removal. In almost all cases, a 99.9% reduction of bacteria was reached by total radiation times < 100 ms. The proven antimicrobial effects of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation may be of significant clinical importance in endodontics and periodontology in the future.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in staphylococci and enterococci in 10 Portuguese hospitals in 1996 and 1997. POSGAR. Portuguese Study Group of Antimicrobial Resistance.
AB  - During a 2-year period, 10 Portuguese hospitals located throughout the country studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinically relevant staphylococci and enterococci. Of more than 12,000 Staphylococcus aureus isolates tested, two main patterns were found, methicillin-sensitive organisms most of them resistant only to penicillin but a few to other antimicrobials and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains (prevalence 48.2%) resistant to most of the antimicrobials tested and uniformly susceptible to vancomycin. Among coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), 71% of S. epidermidis (approximately 5,000 isolates tested) and 84% S. haemolyticus (approximately 1,000 isolates tested) were also resistant to methicillin as well as most other antimicrobials except vancomycin. Most of the 5,000 Enterococcus faecalis isolates tested were susceptible to ampicillin and vancomycin, in contrast to 650 E. faecium isolates, 70% of which were resistant to ampicillin and 20% to vancomycin and all other antibiotics. A high prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance occurred in both Enterococcus species. This survey showed that resistance profiles of staphylococci and enterococci hospital isolates have not changed in the last 5 years in Portugal, with the exception of the rise in vancomycin resistance in E. faecium. The high prevalence of methicillin resistance in S. aureus and in the CNS remains an issue of medical concern.
TI  - CtsR, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - clpP and clpC of Bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the Clp ATP-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. They play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the so-called class III group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. The product of ctsR, the first gene of the clpC operon, has now been shown to act as a repressor of both clpP and clpC, as well as clpE, which encodes a novel member of the Hsp100 Clp ATPase family. The CtsR protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. Random mutagenesis, DNasel footprinting and DNA sequence deletions and comparisons were used to define a consensus CtsR recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. This target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several Gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus salivarius, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Leuconostoc oenos, Lactobacillus sake, Lactococcus lactis and Clostridium acetobutylicum. CtsR homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by CtsR is highly conserved in Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a new super-oxidized water, Sterilox, for the disinfection of endoscopes.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of a new super-oxidized water, Sterilox, has been tested against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, Mycobacterium chelonae, Escherichia coli (including type O157), Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis var niger spores, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, poliovirus type 2 and human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1. Under clean conditions, freshly generated Sterilox was found to be highly active against all these micro-organisms giving a 5 log10 (99.999%) or greater reduction in two minutes or less.
TI  - In vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in Taiwan. Meropenem was active against most Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis. For many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. It is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. It is uncommon for these common bacteria, except MRSA and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in Taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.
TI  - A sensitive and quick microplate method to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration of plant extracts for bacteria.
AB  - Agar diffusion techniques are used widely to assay plant extracts for antimicrobial activity, but there are problems associated with this technique. A micro-dilution technique was developed using 96-well microplates and tetrazolium salts to indicate bacterial growth. p-Iodonitrotetrazolium violet [0.2 mg/ml] gave better results than tetrazolium red or thiazolyl blue. The method is quick, worked well with Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli and with non-aqueous extracts from many different plants. The method gave reproducible results; required only 10-25 microliters of extract to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations, distinguished between microcidal and microstatic effects, and provided a permanent record of the results. Using S. aureus, and a Combretum molle extract, the technique was 32 times more sensitive than agar diffusion techniques and was not sensitive to culture age of the test organism up to 24 hours. The S. aureus culture could be stored up to 10 days in a cold room with little effect on the assay results. This method was useful in screening plants for antimicrobial activity and for the bioassay-guided isolation of antimicrobial compounds from plants. MIC values determined for sulfisoxazole, norfloxacin, gentamicin, and nitrofuratoin were similar to values indicated in the literature but values obtained with trimethroprim and ampicillin were higher with some bacteria.
TI  - The structure and function of HPr.
AB  - Histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein, HPr, was one of the early protein tertiary structures determined by two-dimensional 1H-NMR. Tertiary structures for HPrs from Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus have been obtained by 1H NMR and the overall folding pattern of HPr is highly conserved, a betaalpha betabeta alphabeta alpha arrangement of three alpha-helices overlaying a four-stranded beta-sheet. High-resolution structures for HPrs from E. coli and B. subtilis have been obtained using 15N- and 13C-labeled proteins. The first application of NMR to the understanding of the structure and function of HPr was to describe the phosphohistidine isomer, Ndelta1-P-histidine in S. aureus phospho-HPr, and the unusual pKas of the His-15 side chain. The pKa values for the His-15 imidazole from more recent studies are 5.4 for HPr and 7.8 for phospho-HPr from E. coli, for example. A consensus description of the active site is proposed for HPr and phospho-HPr. In HPr, His-15 has a defined conformation and N-caps helix A, and is thus affected by the helix dipole. His-15 undergoes a small conformational change upon phosphorylation, a movement to allow the phosphoryl group to be positioned such that it forms hydrogen bonds with the main chain amide nitrogens of residue 16 (not conserved) and Arg-17. Interactions between residue 12 side chain (not conserved: asparagine, serine, and threonine) and His-15, and between the Arg-17 guanidinium group and the phosphoryl group, are either weak or transitory.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin tested against 1676 strains of ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-positive cocci isolated from patient infections in North and South America.
AB  - Gatifloxacin (formerly AM-115) is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone with an expanded spectrum against Gram-positive cocci and some anaerobes. To assess this new agent's activity, a collection of 1,676 Gram-positive cocci were selected for resistance to ciprofloxacin (> or = 4 micrograms/mL) and tested against gatifloxacin and 18 other compounds by reference broth microdilution methods. The strains (approximately 23,000 total isolates from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program) were from significant blood stream, respiratory tract, wound, and urinary tract infections in patients in North (38 hospitals) and South (10 hospitals) America. Against Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, gatifloxacin inhibited only 16% and 10% of strains compared with 12% and 5% for recently released trovafloxacin, respectively. Among Staphylococcus aureus (90% oxacillin-resistant) strains, gatifloxacin was more active (67% susceptible at < or = 4 micrograms/mL) than trovafloxacin (59%) or sparfloxacin (4%). Gatifloxacin had a wider spectrum than trovafloxacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci especially S. epidermidis, 2% versus 58% resistance. The glycopeptides, chloramphenicol and rifampin were most active. Against all genus/species groups with more than 100 sample strains (1,566), high-level resistance to gatifloxacin and trovafloxacin (> 4 micrograms/mL) was not significantly different (41.7% versus 39.1%; p > 0.05). Emerging resistance to the fluoroquinolones remains a clinical problem among Gram-positive species, and gatifloxacin seems to be active in vitro against many of these contemporary strains isolated in the Americas.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of enterocin EJ97, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecalis EJ97.
AB  - The bacteriocinogenic strain of Enterococcus faecalis EJ97 has been isolated from municipal waste water. It produces a cationic bacteriocin (enterocin EJ97) of low molecular mass (5,340 Da) that is very stable under mild heat conditions and is sensitive to proteolytic enzymes. The amino acid sequence of the first 18 N-terminal residues of enterocin EJ97 indicates that it is different from other known protein sequences. Enterocin EJ97 is active on several gram-positive bacteria including enterococci, several species of Bacillus, Listeria, and Staphylococcus aureus. The producer strain is immune to bacteriocin. Enterocin EJ97 has a concentration-dependent bactericidal and bacteriolytic effect on E. faecalis S-47.
TI  - Detection of a streptomycin/spectinomycin adenylyltransferase gene (aadA) in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Genes encoding streptomycin/spectinomycin adenylyltransferases [ANT(3")(9)] have  been reported to exist in gram-negative organisms and Staphylococcus aureus. During a study of high-level aminoglycoside resistance in enterococci, we encountered an isolate of Enterococcus faecalis that was streptomycin resistant but did not appear to contain the 6'-adenylyltransferase gene (aadE) when examined by PCR with specific primers. Phosphocellulose paper binding assays indicated the presence of an ANT(3")(9) enzyme. Streptomycin and spectinomycin MICs of 4,000 and 8,000 microg/ml, respectively, were observed for the isolate. PCR primers corresponding to a highly conserved region of the aadA gene were used to amplify a specific 284-bp product. The product hybridized with a digoxigenin-labeled PCR product from E. coli C600(pHP45Omega) known to contain the aadA gene. The aadA gene was transferred via filter matings from the E. faecalis donor to E. faecalis JH2-2. PCR primers designed for analysis of integrons were used to amplify a 1-kb product containing the aadA gene, which was cloned into the vector pCRII and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5-alpha competent cells. D-Rhodamine dye terminator cycle sequencing was used to determine the gene sequence, which was compared to previously reported sequences of aadA genes. We found the aadA gene in E. faecalis to be identical to the aadA genes reported by Sundstr om et al. for E. coli plasmid R6-5 (L. Sundstrom, P. Radstrom, G. Swedberg, and O. Skold, Mol. Gen. Genet. 213:191-201, 1988), by Fling et al. for the aadA within transposon Tn7 (M. E. Fling, J. Kopf, and C. Richards, Nucleic Acids Res. 13:7095-7106, 1985), and by Hollingshead and Vapnek for E. coli R538-1 (S. Hollingshead and D. Vapnek, Plasmid 13:17-30, 1985). Previous reports of the presence of the aadA gene in enterococci appear to be erroneous and probably describe an aadE gene, since the isolates were reported to be susceptible to spectinomycin.
TI  - Facile total synthesis and antimicrobial activity of the marine fatty acids (Z)-2-methoxy-5-hexadecenoic acid and (Z)-2-methoxy-6-hexadecenoic acid.
AB  - The total synthesis of the naturally occurring (Z)-2-methoxy-5-hexadecenoic acid  and (Z)-2-methoxy-6-hexadecenoic acid was accomplished using as a key step Mukaiyama's trimethylsilyl cyanide addition to 4- and 5-pentadecenal, respectively. These syntheses further confirm the structures of the natural marine fatty acids and corroborate their cis double-bond stereochemistry. The title compounds were antimicrobial against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 0.35 micromol/mL) and Streptococcus faecalis (MIC 0.35 micromol/mL).
TI  - The effects of ultraviolet radiation on antibiotic-resistant bacteria in vitro.
AB  - Wound infections produced by antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains are particularly difficult to manage. This study examined the effectiveness of ultraviolet (UV) light treatment in killing antibiotic-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis in vitro. Between 2 and 5 replications of each organism at 10(8) organisms/ml were prepared and plated on sheep blood agar medium and treated with UV light (254 nm, 15.54 mW/cm2 output). Irradiation times were 0, 2, 5, 8, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 or 120 seconds. Bacterial cultures were then incubated at 35 degrees C for 24 hours. Kill rates were 99.9 percent for the methicillin-resistant strain of S. aureus (MRSA) at 5, 8, 15, 30, 45, 60 seconds and 100 percent at 90 and 120 seconds. Kill rates were 99.9 percent at 5, 8, 15, 30 seconds for vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (VRE) and 100 percent at 45, 60, 90, 120 seconds. Similar results were found with UV light treatment of the antibiotic-susceptible strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis. A significant difference in kill rates at 30 seconds of UV exposure was detected between the antibiotic-resistant strain of S. aureus and the antibiotic-resistant strain of E. faecalis (Student's t test, p < 0.01). Significant differences were also detected in the kill rates at 30 second exposure times for the antibiotic-susceptible strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis. These findings suggest that the Enterococcal bacteria is more susceptible to the killing effects of UV. This data also suggests that UV light at 254 nm is bactericidal for antibiotic-resistant strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis at times as short as 5 seconds and that the enterococcal bacteria is more susceptible to the killing effects of UV. With recommended patient treatment times for infected wounds being significantly longer than 5 seconds, this data indicates that patient treatment times need to be re-examined.
TI  - Infective endocarditis in the premature neonate.
AB  - We describe a series of 11 high-risk neonates with infective endocarditis (IE) in this retrospective review. Previously IE has rarely been diagnosed in newborns and is usually fatal. The frequency was 4.3 cases per 100 patients. Five patients survived. Microorganisms included gram positives such as S. aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, gram negatives such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Serratia marcescens, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Echocardiographic location of the lesions showed four left sided, five right sided, and two bilateral. We conclude that IE may be more common than previously described. Prompt diagnosis and treatment led to survival in 45% of our patients. Prospective studies are needed to identify patients at risk and to establish the true incidence of IE in high-risk neonates.
TI  - The preliminary isolation of several antibacterial compounds from Combretum erythrophyllum (Combretaceae).
AB  - Freeze dried ground leaves of Combretum erythrophyllum were extracted with different extractants to determine if they contain inhibitors of pathogenic bacteria. Acetone yielded the most compounds inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus using bioautography of thin layer chromatography plates. Acetone also extracted many different compounds and group separation was attempted by solid phase extraction on reverse and normal phase silica gel. Both techniques separated the bioactive components to a degree. The best group separation results, however, were obtained using liquid/liquid extraction. The six fractions obtained inhibited the four test organisms to different degrees. S. aureus was the most sensitive (100%) followed by Enterococcus faecalis (36%), Escherichia coli (11%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3%). With S. aureus as test organism, the chloroform soluble fraction contained by far the largest quantity of inhibiting components (100%), followed by the fractions soluble in water (23%), 35% methanol in water (18%), butanol (5%), carbon tetrachloride (2%) and hexane (traces). The lowest minimum inhibitory concentration for S. aureus was 0.05 mg/ml at this stage of purification compared to MIC values of 0.08 and 0.16 mg/ml for ampicillin and chloramphenicol. There were at least 14 different inhibitors with a wide range of polarities present in the different fractions. The polar components apparently did not contain polysaccharides and were probably basic according to the chromatographic behaviour.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of recent gram-positive isolates to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and trovafloxacin.
AB  - Gram-positive isolates (n = 290) were tested for their susceptibility to three fluoroquinolone antibiotics by standard disk-diffusion technology. Overall, 59%, 72%, and 85% were susceptible and 29%, 25%, and 11% were resistant to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and trovafloxacin, respectively. Of Staphylococcus aureus isolates (n = 84), 55%, 57%, and 88% were susceptible to the three antibiotics, respectively. Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 45), too, was more susceptible to trovafloxacin, although the differences were smaller (60%, 62%, and 78%). Of 35 Enterococcus faecalis isolates, 66% and 74% were susceptible to levofloxacin and trovafloxacin, respectively, but only 9% were susceptible to ciprofloxacin.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of OPC-20011, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum 2-oxaisocephem antibiotic.
AB  - OPC-20011, a new parenteral 2-oxaisocephem antibiotic, has an oxygen atom at the  2- position of the cephalosporin frame. OPC-20011 had the best antibacterial activities against gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae: MICs at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited were 6.25, 6.25, and 0.05 microg/ml, respectively. Its activity is due to a high affinity of the penicillin-binding protein 2' in MRSA, an affinity which was approximately 1,050 times as high as that for flomoxef. Against gram-negative bacteria, OPC-20011 also showed antibacterial activities similar to those of ceftazidime. The in vivo activities of OPC-20011 were comparable to or greater than those of reference compounds in murine models of systemic infection caused by gram-positive and -negative pathogens. OPC-20011 was up to 10 times as effective as vancomycin against MRSA infections in mice. This better in vivo efficacy is probably due to the bactericidal activity of OPC-20011, while vancomycin showed bacteriostatic activity against MRSA. OPC-20011 produced a significant decrease of viable counts in lung tissue at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg of body weight, an efficacy similar to that of ampicillin at a dose of 10 to 20 mg/kg on an experimental murine model of respiratory tract infection caused by non-ampicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae T-0005. The better therapeutic efficacy of OPC-20011 was considered to be due to its potent antibacterial activity and low affinity for serum proteins of experimental animals (29% in mice and 6.4% in rats).
TI  - In vitro susceptibility testing and quality control parameters for sarafloxacin (A-56620): a fluoroquinolone used for treatment and control of colibacillosis in poultry. Quality Control Study Group.
AB  - Sarafloxacin (formerly A-56620) is a fluoroquinolone recently introduced into veterinary practice for the therapy of colibacillosis and other indicated infections. Sarafloxacin was noted to be very active and comparable to ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin for inhibiting 823 strains from a wide variety of species at < or = 1 or < or = 2 micrograms/mL. In vitro susceptibility tests for sarafloxacin using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) methods were also studied and interpretive criteria for Escherichia coli-associated colibacillosis isolates were proposed: susceptible at < or = 0.06 microgram/mL (> or = 25 mm) and resistant at > or = 0.25 microgram/mL (< or = 21 mm). Sarafloxacin agar dilution MIC results were approximately one log2 dilution higher than broth microdilution endpoints. The interpretive criteria demonstrated a low error rate of 5.9%, with a very major rate of only 0.5% (correlation coefficient between methods = 0.94). Quality control trials in six laboratories established MIC and zone diameter (5-microgram disk) limits for the NCCLS recommended strains: for the broth microdilution test, E. coli ATCC 25922 = 0.008 to 0.03 microgram/mL, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 = 0.12 to 1 microgram/mL, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 = 0.5 to 2 micrograms/mL, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 = 0.06 to 0.25 microgram/mL; and for the disk diffusion test, E. coli ATCC 25922 = 30 to 36 mm, S. aureus ATCC 25923 = 25 to 30 mm, and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 = 23 to 29 mm. These criteria for in vitro tests with sarafloxacin should enable the longitudinal monitoring of its activity against the indicated pathogens and allow detection of emerging resistant populations that may necessitate altered dosing regimens.
TI  - Incidence of antibiotic resistance in blood and urine isolates from hospitalized  patients. Report from a European collaborative study. European Study Group on Antibiotic Resistance (ESGAR).
AB  - During 1992-93, 2544 isolates from blood cultures, comprising 52% gram-negative bacilli, 24% Staphylococcus aureus, 15% other staphylococci, 7% Enterococcus faecalis and 2% E. faecium, were consecutively collected and identified in 30 laboratories in 21 European countries. In addition 2512 urine isolates, comprising 82% gram-negative bacilli, 3% S. aureus, 4% other staphylococci and 11% enterococci were collected. The bacteria were sent to 3 laboratories for susceptibility testing by the microdilution method in Mueller-Hinton broth. The MICs of penicillins and aztreonam for all susceptible gram-negative bacilli were 0.25-8 mg/l, penems 0.032-2 mg/l, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and cefpirome or cefepime 0.032-0.25 mg/l, gentamicin, tobramycin and netilmicin 0.125-2 mg/l, amikacin 0.5-4 mg/l, ciprofloxacin 0.016-1 mg/l, trimethoprim 0.25-1 mg/l and tetracycline 1-2 mg/l. For susceptible staphylococci the MICs of erythromycin were 0.25-0.5 mg/l, clindamycin 0.125-0.25 mg/l, methicillin 2-8 mg/l, vancomycin and trimethoprim 1-4 mg/l, ciprofloxacin 0.25-1 mg/l, gentamicin and tobramycin 0.25-1 mg/l. For the enterococci the MICs of ampicillin and vancomycin were 2-4 mg/l and of imipenem, teicoplanin and trimethoprim 0.5-1 mg/l. The antibiotic resistance rates varied between laboratories, being lower in northern Europe, except for the penems, cefpirome and cefepime, which showed uniformly lower resistance rates. Compared to the earlier European studies the resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics among the gram-negatives have not changed except with an increase to cefotaxime and ceftazidime in central Europe. Resistance to aminoglycosides had also increased in central Europe from 7-8% to 20-21%, but decreased in southern Europe from 22-24% to 13-14% among the blood isolates and from 12-28% to 6-7% among the urine isolates. There was an increase in resistance to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin in staphylococci from southern Europe. The prevalence of MRSA was significant in central and southern Europe. It is of importance that collaborative national and international studies on the incidence of antibiotic resistance are being performed on a repetitive basis.
TI  - In-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam relative to other antibiotics against blood culture isolates.
AB  - Resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is an increasing problem in many countries. Accurate locally relevant information is essential for detection and control of emerging resistance and to facilitate choice of empirical antibiotic therapy in the immediate management of seriously ill patients. We have determined the minimum inhibitory concentration of piperacillin/tazobactam for 97 strains of bacteria (55 Enterobacteriaceae, 13 non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli, 22 Staphylococcus aureus, 6 Enterococcus faecalis and 1 Bacillus cereus) isolated from blood cultures and compared its activity to that of amoxycillin, co-amoxiclav, cephalothin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, piperacillin, cefotaxime. The strains were consecutive non-fastidious isolates with the following qualifications: coagulase negative staphylococci and diphtheroids were excluded and the number of Staphylococcus aureus isolates was limited to 12 methicillin-resistant and 10 methicillin-sensitive strains. Multiple isolates of the same species from individual patients were not included. The minimum inhibition concentrations of methicillin, penicillin, teichoplanin and vancomycin were also determined for specific groups of organisms. MICs were determined by the Etest method (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) on Mueller Hinton agar. The MICs of appropriate American Type Culture Collection control strains were determined. Based on the interpretative criteria of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (USA), 87 per cent of Gram-negative bacilli were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam compared with amoxycillin 26 per cent, cephalothin 35 per cent, co-amoxiclav 54 per cent, piperacillin 56 per cent, cefotaxime 69 per cent, ceftazidime 84 per cent, gentamicin 85 per cent and ciprofloxacin 91 per cent. Of all isolates 75 per cent were sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam, compared with amoxycillin 22 per cent, cephalothin 35 per cent, piperacillin 41 per cent, co-amoxiclav 52 per cent, cefotaxime 59 per cent, ceftazidime 60 per cent, gentamicin 74 per cent and ciprofloxacin 77 per cent. Two isolates (1 E. coli and 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae) with antibiograms consistent with the relatively new resistance phenomenon of extended spectrum beta-lactamase production were identified. The spectrum of activity of piperacillin-tazobactam for empirical antibiotic therapy is significantly greater than that of piperacillin alone and is similar to that of ciprofloxacin and gentamicin.
TI  - MJ347-81F4 A & B, novel antibiotics from Amycolatopsis sp.: taxonomic characteristics, fermentation, and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Strain MJ347-81F4 has been found to produce two new cyclic thiazolyl peptide antibiotics, components A and B. Taxonomic studies including morphological and physiological characteristics and chemical analysis of whole cells of the producing strain revealed this microorganism to belong to genus Amycolatopsis, and so we designated the strain Amycolatopsis sp. MJ347-81F4. After 10 to 12 days of fermentation, most of the antibacterial activity was present mainly in the mycelial cake and reached its maximum level. In comparison with reference compounds, A as the major component showed excellent in vitro activity against gram-positive bacteria including highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecalis with MICs in the range of concentration of 0.006 to to approximately 0.1 microg/ml. The results on the antimicrobial activity against thiazolyl peptide-resistant mutants of Bacillus subtilis NRRL B-558 indicated that the possible molecular target of MJ347-81F4 component A might be the 50S subunits of the ribosome, the inactivation of which would inhibit protein synthesis.
TI  - European Glycopeptide Susceptibility Survey of gram-positive bacteria for 1995. European Glycopeptide Resistance Survey Study Group.
AB  - In the European Glycopeptide Susceptibility Survey 7078 Gram-positive isolates collected in 1995 from 70 centers in 9 countries of Western Europe were examined, using a standardized, quantitative susceptibility testing method. Of the 7078 isolates, 6824 (96.4%) were tested by the national coordinating centers. Teicoplanin (mode MIC 0.5 microgram/mL) was generally twice as active as vancomycin (mode MIC 1 microgram/mL) against Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2852). All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin (MIC < or = 4 micrograms/mL) and all but four to teicoplanin (MIC < or = 8 micrograms/mL); these four isolates were of intermediate susceptibility (MIC 16 micrograms/mL). With coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 1444), the distribution of MIC of teicoplanin was wider than for vancomycin. Two and two-tenths percent of coagulase-negative staphylococci excluding Staphylococcus haemolyticus required 16 micrograms/mL teicoplanin for inhibition (intermediate) and 0.4% > or = 32 micrograms/mL (resistant). Among isolates of S. haemolyticus, 4.4% were of intermediate susceptibility (MIC 16 micrograms/mL) and 3.3% were resistant (MIC > or = 32 micrograms/mL) to teicoplanin. However, this species represented only 6.3% of the isolates of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. Generally, teicoplanin (mode MIC < or = 0.12 microgram/mL) was four to eight times more active than vancomycin (mode MIC < or = 0.5 microgram/mL) against the 770 streptococcal isolates. Glycopeptide-susceptible Enterococcus spp. (n = 1695) were generally four times more susceptible to teicoplanin (mode MIC 0.25 microgram/mL) than to vancomycin (mode MIC 1 microgram/mL). Combined vancomycin and teicoplanin (VanA phenotype) resistance was observed more frequently (9.3%) in isolates of Enterococcus faecium than in Enterococcus faecalis (0.8%). Four isolates of unspeciated enterococci (1.4%) also expressed this resistance phenotype. Four isolates of E. faecium and four of E. faecalis expressed the VanB-type (low-level, vancomycin only) resistance. Spain was the only country not to submit resistant E. faecium strains while resistant E. faecalis isolates came only from Spain and Italy.
TI  - Comparison of bactericidal activities of intermittent and continuous infusion dosing of vancomycin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To describe the pharmacokinetic profiles of vancomycin administered by continuous infusion and intermittent dosing and compare the duration of activity of the regimens. DESIGN: Randomized, open-label, crossover study. SETTING: Clinical research center at an academic medical center. SUBJECTS: Twelve healthy, nonpregnant volunteers age 27.6 +/- 2.3 years. INTERVENTION: Subjects received the following intravenous vancomycin regimens: 1 g every 12 hours; 2 g continuous infusion over 24 hours; and 1 g continuous infusion over 24 hours. Dosages were administered with and without gentamicin 2 mg/kg. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Serum samples were collected, drug concentrations determined, and bactericidal activity measured against two isolates each of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Subjects had poor tolerability for continuous infusions. Trough concentration for the intermittent regimen was 5.5 +/- 1.9 mg/ml, and steady-state concentrations were 8.8 +/- 1.6 and 16.9 +/- 1.9 mg/ml for 1 and 2 g continuous infusions, respectively. In general, all regimens provided bactericidal activity throughout the study interval. Against one isolate of E. faecalis, 2 g continuous infusion plus gentamicin provided cidal activity for a significantly greater percentage of the dosing interval (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Continuous infusion does not greatly improve the activity of vancomycin and should not be routinely administered. However, it may prove useful against isolates with reduced susceptibility to the agent.
TI  - Detection and characterization of a novel antibacterial substance produced by a Lactobacillus delbrueckii strain 1043.
AB  - A novel antibacterial substance produced by a strain isolated from Bulgarian yellow cheese was characterized. The producer strain was identified by molecular typing to belong to the species Lactobacillus delbrueckii, which is a rare producer of bacteriocins. The inhibitory agent was heat stable and active against lactic acid bacteria species and several food-borne pathogens: Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis. Its sensitivity to amylolitic enzymes and lipase suggested that a lipid and carbohydrate moiety could be important for the activity. The amino acid content of the purified bacteriocin was estimated to 29 amino acids. The bacteriocin was shown to be small (3.6-6 kDa) by three different methods: HPLC gel-filtration, SDS-PAGE and amino acid contents.
TI  - Resistance to antimicrobial agents used for animal therapy in pathogenic-, zoonotic- and indicator bacteria isolated from different food animals in Denmark: a baseline study for the Danish Integrated Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring Programme (DANMAP).
AB  - This study describes the establishment and first results of a continuous surveillance system of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria isolated from pigs, cattle and broilers in Denmark. The three categories of bacteria tested were: 1) indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium), 2) zoonotic bacteria (Campylobacter coli/jejuni, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia enterocolitica), and 3) animal pathogens (E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus hyicus, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae). A total of 3304 bacterial isolates collected from October 1995 through December 1996 were tested for susceptibility to all major classes of antimicrobial agents used for therapy in Denmark. Bacterial species intrinsically resistant to an antimicrobial were not tested towards that antimicrobial. Acquired resistance to all antimicrobials was found. The occurrence of resistance varied by animal origin and bacterial species. In general, resistance was observed more frequently among isolates from pigs than from cattle and broilers. The association between the occurrence of resistance and the consumption of the antimicrobial is discussed, as is the occurrence of resistance in other countries. The results of this study show the present level of resistance to antimicrobial agents among a number of bacterial species isolated from food animals in Denmark. Thus, the baseline for comparison with future prospective studies has been established, enabling the determination of trends over time.
TI  - Piperazinyl oxazolidinone antibacterial agents containing a pyridine, diazene, or triazene heteroaromatic ring.
AB  - Oxazolidinones are a novel class of synthetic antibacterial agents active against gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as well as selected anaerobic organisms. Important representatives of this class include the morpholine derivative linezolid 2, which is currently in phase III clinical trials, and the piperazine derivative eperezolid 3. As part of an investigation of the structure-activity relationships of structurally related oxazolidinones, we have prepared and evaluated the antibacterial properties of a series of piperazinyl oxazolidinones in which the distal nitrogen of the piperazinyl ring is substituted with a six-membered heteroaromatic ring. Compounds having MIC values </= 2 microg/mL vs selected gram-positive pathogens were discovered among each of the pyridine, pyridazine, and pyrimidine structural classes. Among these the cyanopyridine 17, the pyridazines 25 and 26, and the pyrimidine 31 exhibited in vivo potency vs S. aureus comparable to that of linezolid.
TI  - Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from food animals to antimicrobial growth promoters and related therapeutic agents in Denmark.
AB  - This study was conducted to describe the occurrence of acquired resistance to antimicrobials used for growth promotion among bacteria isolated from swine, cattle and poultry in Denmark. Resistance to structurally related therapeutic agents was also examined. Three categories of bacteria were tested: 1) indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium), 2) zoonotic bacteria (Campylobacter, Salmonella, Yersinia enterocolitica), and 3) animal pathogens (E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus hyicus, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae). All antimicrobials used as growth promoters in Denmark and some structurally related therapeutic agents (in brackets) were included: Avilamycin, avoparcin (vancomycin), bacitracin, carbadox, flavomycin, monensin, olaquindox, salinomycin, spiramycin (erythromycin, lincomycin), tylosin (erythromycin, lincomycin), and virginiamycin (pristinamycin). Bacterial species intrinsically resistant to an antimicrobial were not tested towards that antimicrobial. Breakpoints for growth promoters were established by population distribution of the bacteria tested. A total of 2,372 bacterial isolates collected during October 1995 to September 1996 were included in the study. Acquired resistance to all currently used growth promoting antimicrobials was found. A frequent occurrence of resistance were observed to avilamycin, avoparcin, bacitracin, flavomycin, spiramycin, tylosin and virginiamycin, whereas resistance to carbadox, monensin, olaquindox and salinomycin was less frequent. The occurrence of resistance varied by animal origin and bacterial species. The highest levels of resistance was observed among enterococci, whereas less resistance was observed among zoonotic bacteria and bacteria pathogenic to animals. The association between the occurrence of resistance and the consumption of the antimicrobial is discussed. The results show the present level of resistance to growth promoters in bacteria from food animals in Denmark. They will form the baseline for comparison with future prospective studies, thereby enabling the determination of trends over time.
TI  - Analysis of antibiotic susceptibilities of skin wound flora in hospitalized dermatology patients. The crisis of antibiotic resistance has come to the surface.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Results of an ongoing surveillance of antibiotic resistance in hospitalized dermatology patients are presented. Bacterial isolates cultured from patients with skin wounds admitted to a tertiary care dermatology inpatient unit from May 1995 through May 1996 were evaluated for resistance to commonly used antibiotics. Comparison was made with a previous survey of the same inpatient service from 1992. Our results show an alarming trend toward antibiotic resistance. OBSERVATION: In superficial skin wounds, Staphylococcus aureus constituted 77% of isolates. In leg ulcers, the frequencies of S aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were approximately equal, constituting 43% and 42% of cultures, respectively. Fifty percent of S aureus isolates from leg ulcers were resistant to oxacillin, with 36% of pseudomonad isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin. In superficial wounds, oxacillin resistance in S aureus approached 25%. A comparison of antibiotic resistance profiles using data collected in 1992 for patients admitted to the same inpatient service revealed a marked increase in oxacillin and ciprofloxacin resistance in S aureus and P aeruginosa in leg ulcers, respectively (from 24% to 50% oxacillin resistance in S aureus and from 9% to 24% ciprofloxacin resistance in P aeruginosa), and superficial wounds (24% to 36% ciprofloxacin resistance in P aeruginosa). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria as a problem of growing significance in hospital dermatology and highlights the importance of local surveillance programs to aid in selecting antibiotic treatments.
TI  - Toxicity of hydrogen peroxide produced by electroplated coatings to pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The ability of various electroplated coatings (cobalt, zinc, copper, and cobalt-containing alloys of nickel, zinc, chromium, etc.) to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria (Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) was determined by a drop-method antibacterial experiment. The amounts of H2O2 produced and metal ions dissolved from the surfaces of various electroplated coatings were measured and it was found that the inhibitory ability of coatings corresponded to the amounts of H2O2 produced. The more significant the inhibition of the coating to bacterial growth, the greater the amount of H2O2 production. In addition, the bacterial survival rates on the surfaces of coatings were almost zero when H2O2 was produced in amounts greater than 10(-6) mmol/cm2. However, the dominant concentrations of metal ions dissolved from coatings were outside of the bacterial lethal range.
TI  - Bacteriology of burns.
AB  - A retrospective study was undertaken at University College of Medical Sciences and Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Delhi, to examine the bacterial isolates from the Burns unit and to determine the antibiograms of the isolates to commonly used antimicrobial agents. A total of 600 pus samples from as many patients received, over a period of 5 years (June 1993-June 1997) yielded 920) isolates. Pseudomonas spp. was the most common (36%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (19%), Klebsiella spp. (15.54%), Proteus spp. (11.19%), Enterococcus faecalis (8.5%), Escherichia coli (5.10%), Acinetobacter spp. (1.1%), Salmonella senftenberg (0.8%) and other (3%). Pseudomonas spp. was the most susceptible to ceftazidime (83% susceptible) and cefoperazone (82% susceptible), whereas the drugs most effective in other Gram-negative organisms were amikacin, netilmicin and ciproflox. Vancomycin was effective in 100% of Gram-positive organisms. The infection of burn wounds with multiple organisms, with the superadded problem of drug resistance, necessitate the institution of a drug policy by the hospitals for burn patients.
TI  - Substituted salicylanilides as inhibitors of two-component regulatory systems in  bacteria.
AB  - A new class of inhibitors of the two-component regulatory systems (TCS) of bacteria was discovered based on the salicylanilide screening hits, closantel (1) and tetrachlorosalicylanilide (9). A systematic SAR study versus a model TCS, KinA/Spo0F, demonstrated the importance of electron-attracting substituents in the salicyloyl ring and hydrophobic groups in the anilide moiety for optimal activity. In addition, derivatives 8 and 16, containing the 2, 3-dihydroxybenzanilide structural motif, were potent inhibitors of the autophosphorylation of the KinA kinase, with IC50s of 2.8 and 6. 3 &microM, respectively. Compound 8 also inhibited the TCS mediating vancomycin resistance (VanS/VanR) in a genetically engineered Enterococcus faecalis cell line at concentrations subinhibitory for growth. Closantel (1), tetrachlorosalicylanilide (9), and several related derivatives (2, 7, 10, 11, 20) had antibacterial activity against the drug-resistant organisms, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF).
TI  - Susceptibility survey of piperacillin/tazobactam and some beta-lactam comparators in Italy.
AB  - From September 1994 to March 1995 an Italian multicenter in vitro study to evaluate the susceptibility of piperacillin/tazobactam compared with that of imipenem, ceftazidime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and ampicillin/sulbactam against aerobic bacterial pathogens isolated in 132 different hospitals, was undertaken. In total, 26,732 isolates were collected but only 25,266 aerobic bacteria were able to be evaluated (16,863 Gram-negative and 8,403 Gram-positive). Escherichia coli was the most frequent pathogen isolated (25.9%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (14.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.9%), Enterococcus faecalis (8.2%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.9%). Piperacillin/tazobactam had a general spectrum of activity (84.8% susceptible strains) comparable to imipenem (87.9%), and was distinctly greater than ceftazidime (71.1%).
TI  - Urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of a single oral dose of 400 milligrams of fleroxacin versus a single oral dose of 800 milligrams of pefloxacin in healthy volunteers.
AB  - Twelve healthy volunteers participated in this randomized crossover study to compare the concentrations and recovery levels of fleroxacin and pefloxacin in urine and to assess their bactericidal activities against 12 strains of urinary pathogens with different susceptibilities over a wide range of MICs. The volunteers received a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin or 800 mg of pefloxacin. The mean cumulative renal excretion of unchanged fleroxacin, N-demethyl-fleroxacin, and N-oxide-fleroxacin accounted for 67, 7, and 6% of the total dose, respectively. The total urinary recovery of pefloxacin and the active metabolite norfloxacin was 34%. In the time-kill and the urinary bactericidal titer (UBT) studies, only the subjects' urine not supplemented with broth was used. With most tested organisms and both quinolones it took more than 8 h to achieve a reduction in CFU of 99.9% (3 log units). Overall, there was a good correlation between UBTs and MICs for the strains. Against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 the median UBTs were similar for both antibiotics and at least 1:8 for 96 h; against the E. coli strain for which the MIC was 0.5 microgram/ml the UBT was at least 1:4 for 48 h. The UBTs of both drugs against Klebsiella pneumoniae were at least 1:16 for 72 h. The UBTs for Staphylococcus aureus (the MIC for which was 16 micrograms/ml) of both antibiotics were low, and in some of the samples, no bactericidal titers were observed. UBTs for Proteus mirabilis of pefloxacin are significantly higher than those of fleroxacin. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the median UBTs were present for the 24-to-48-h interval. The same is true for Enterococcus faecalis. Against Staphylococcus saprophyticus, UBTs were present for at least 48 h with both quinolones. Overall, a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin exhibits UBTs comparable to those of 800 mg of pefloxacin. Therefore, it may be expected that half of the dose of fleroxacin gives comparable results in the treatment of urinary tract infections; this should be substantiated in comparative clinical trials.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin (RP 59500, Synercid) tested against over 28,000 recent clinical isolates from 200 medical centers in the United States and Canada.
AB  - A total of 200 medical center laboratories in the USA and Canada contributed results of testing quinupristin-dalfopristin, a streptogramin combination (formerly RP 59500 or Synercid), against 28,029 Gram-positive cocci. Standardized tests [disk diffusion, broth microdilution, Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden)] were utilized and validated by concurrent quality control tests. Remarkable agreement was obtained between test method results for characterizing the collection by the important emerging resistances: 1) oxacillin resistance among Staphylococcus aureus (41.0 to 43.7%); 2) vancomycin resistance among Enterococcus faecium (50.0 to 52.0%); and 3) the penicillin nonsusceptible rate for pneumococci (31.1% overall, with 10.6% at MICs of > or = 2 micrograms/mL). The quinupristin-dalfopristin MIC90 for oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant S. aureus was 0.5 microgram/mL and 1 microgram/mL, respectively. The quinupristin-dalfopristin MIC90 for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium was 1 microgram/mL, and only 0.2% of isolates were resistant. Other Enterococcus species were generally not susceptible to the streptogramin combination but were usually inhibited by ampicillin (86 to 97% susceptible; MIC50, 1.0 microgram/mL) or vancomycin (86 to 95%; MIC50, 1.0 microgram/mL). Among all tested enterococci, the rate of vancomycin resistance was 16.2%. The quinupristin-dalfopristin MIC90 (0.75 microgram/mL) for 4,626 tested Streptococcus pneumoniae strains was not influenced by the penicillin or macrolide susceptibility patterns. When five regions in the USA and Canada were analyzed for significant streptogramin and other antimicrobial spectrum differences, only the Farwest region had lower numbers of streptogramin-susceptible E. faecium. Canadian strains were generally more susceptible to all drugs except chloramphenicol and doxycycline when tested against E. faecalis (73% and 89% susceptible, respectively). The U.S. Southeast region had S. pneumoniae strains less susceptible to macrolides (73%) but had more susceptibility among E. faecium isolates tested against vancomycin and ampicillin. The Northeast region of the USA had the greatest rate of vancomycin resistance among enterococci. Strains retested by the monitor because of quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance (MICs, > or = 4 micrograms/mL) were generally not confirmed (2.2% validation), and only 0.2% of E. faecium isolates were identified as truly resistant. The most common errors were: 1) species misidentification (28.0%); 2) incorrect susceptibility results (65.6%); and 3) mixed cultures (4.3%) tested by participants. Overall, quinupristin-dalfopristin was consistently active (> or = 90% susceptible) against major Gram-positive pathogens in North America, regardless of resistance patterns to other drug classes and geographic location of their isolation.
TI  - Etiology and risk factors of 180 cases of native valve endocarditis. Report from  a 5-year national prospective survey in Slovak Republic.
AB  - Risk factors, etiology, and outcome of 180 cases of infective endocarditis (IE) in the Slovak Republic for 5 years were prospectively studied in a national survey. According to the Duke Endocarditis Service Criteria (1994), 169 cases were considered definitive and 21 possible/probable. The aortic valve was infected in 46.7%, mitral in 47.2%, and tricuspidal/pulmonary in 6.1% of cases. The majority of endocarditis cases was caused by Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (33.3%); only 12.2% were due to viridans streptococci; 11.7% were due to Enterococcus faecalis; 6.1% due to Haemophilus spp.; 10.1% due to other organisms; and 26.7% were culture negative. Single positive cultures of CNS were not considered clinically significant. More than 25% of 180 patients were older than 60 years. Rheumatic fever was a risk factor in 35.5%, dental surgery in 20.5%, prior cardiosurgery in 7.8%, and neoplasia in 6.7%. All patients were treated with antimicrobials (average length of therapy was 29.5 days) and 33.3% of patients also had surgery (valvular prosthesis replacement). Forty (22.2%) died, and 140 (77.8%) survived at day 60 after the diagnosis of endocarditis was made. All 40 deaths were attributable to infection. Univariate analysis comparing deaths and survivors did not show significant differences in most of the recorded risk factors between both groups, except age > 60 (40.0% versus 21.4%, p < 0.05), staphylococcal etiology (55.0% versus 27.1%, p < 0.04), and antibiotic therapy < 21 days (without surgery) (65.0% versus 3.6%, p < 0.01). These risk factors were significantly more frequently associated with deaths. Viridans streptococcal IE and surgical therapy in addition to antibiotics were associated with lower mortality in comparison to staphylococcal endocarditis (p < 0.045) or to cases treated with antibiotics only (p < 0.05). In comparison to other nationally based surveys in Europe (Greece, Croatia, France), the percentage of culture-negative endocarditis and spectrum of pathogens differed significantly.
TI  - Novel antibiotic susceptibility tests by the ATP-bioluminescence method using filamentous cell treatment.
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility testing by the ATP-bioluminescence method has been noted for its speed; it provides susceptibility results within 2 to 5 h. However, several disagreements between the ATP method and standard methodology have been reported. The present paper describes a novel ATP method in a 3.5-h test which overcomes these deficiencies through the elimination of false-resistance discrepancies in tests on gram-negative bacteria with beta-lactam agents. In our test model using Pseudomonas aeruginosa and piperacillin, it was shown that ATP in filamentous cells accounted for the false resistance. We found that 0.5% 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol (AMPD) extracted ATP from the filamentous cells without affecting normal cells and that 0.3 U of adenosine phosphate deaminase (APDase)/ml simultaneously digested the extracted ATP. We used the mixture of these reagents for the pretreatment of cells in a procedure we named filamentous cell treatment, prior to ATP measurements. This novel ATP method with the filamentous cell treatment eliminated false-resistance discrepancies in tests on P. aeruginosa with beta-lactam agents, including piperacillin, cefoperazone, aztreonam, imipenem-cilastatin, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. Furthermore, this novel methodology produced results which agreed with those of the standard microdilution method in other tests on gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis, for non-beta-lactam agents, such as fosfomycin, ofloxacin, minocycline, and aminoglycosides. MICs obtained by the novel ATP method were also in agreement with those obtained by the agar dilution method of susceptibility testing. From these results, it was shown that the novel ATP method could be used successfully to test the activities of antimicrobial agents with the elimination of the previously reported discrepancies.
TI  - A new ketolide, HMR 3004, active against streptococci inducibly resistant to erythromycin.
AB  - HMR 3004 is a new hydrazono ketolide characterized by a 3-keto function instead of the cladinose moiety. The effect of this antimicrobial agent on inducible and constitutive macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB) resistance was tested in a lacZ reporter system under control of several ermAM-like attenuator variants. For one constitutively resistant Streptococcus agalactiae strain, three inducibly resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, and one inducibly resistant Enterococcus faecalis strain, the attenuators fused with lacZ were cloned into the shuttle plasmid pJIM2246 and the plasmid was introduced into Staphylococcus aureus RN4220. For the wild-type attenuators, HMR 3004 was a very weak inducer, unlike its cladinose counterpart RU 6652 and erythromycin. As expected, for the fusion originating from the constitutively resistant S. agalactiae strain, the level of uninduced beta-galactosidase synthesis was high. For one S. pneumoniae attenuator, mutations in the 3' end of the attenuator that weakened the stem-loop structure that sequesters the ribosome-binding site and start codon for ermAM methylase could explain the high level of uninduced beta-galactosidase produced. For streptococci, the activity of HMR 3004 correlated with the basal level of beta-galactosidase synthesized. The weak inducer activity of HMR 3004 explained its activity against inducibly MLSB-resistant S. pneumoniae but did not correlate with the moderate activity of the antibiotic against inducibly resistant E. faecalis.
TI  - Antimicrobial spectrum and target site of D-3-phenyllactic acid.
AB  - Geotrichum candidum excretes D-3-phenyllactic acid, which inhibits the growth of  Listeria monocytogenes. It was found to inhibit a range of gram-positive bacteria found in humans and foodstuffs, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, and gram-negative bacteria from humans, such as Providencia stuartii and Klebsiella oxytoca. Scanning electron microscope studies on the effect of D-3-phenyllactic acid on L. monocytogenes showed that it caused changes in bacterial behavior and structure. The bacteria formed aggregates and secreted polysaccharides; their cell walls lost their rigidity, causing the cells to swell. Finally the bacteria broke down completely and the cells disintegrate.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance: an ecological approach to a growing threat.
AB  
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1996), III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - Susceptibilities to various antimicrobial agents were examined for Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that were isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during June 1996 to May 1997, and the results were compared with those obtained during the same period in earlier years. 1. E. faecalis Among E. faecalis strains, those with high susceptibilities to ampicillin and minocycline appeared to have decreased in the latest study period. 2. S. aureus To almost antimicrobial agents, S. aureus isolated from uncomplicated UTIs showed low susceptibilities. But the MIC50s of those agents for S. aureus from complicated UTIs have changed better state. Particularly, the MIC50s of imipenem and clindamycin were 0.125 microgram/ml or below in the latest period for the first time in our history. 3. E. coli The susceptibilities to piperacillin and quinolones of E. coli isolated from uncomplicated UTIs were better than those isolated from complicated UTIs. 4. Klebsiella spp. The susceptibilities to almost antimicrobial agents of Klebsiella spp. have been better during the latest period, compared to those during period of 1995-1996, but to ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin have appeared to have been lower. 5. P. aeruginosa The susceptibilities to quinolones of P. aeruginosa have been better during the latest period compared those during periods of 1995-1996. But, the susceptibilities to cefozopran, carbapenems and monobactams of P. aeruginosa isolated from complicated UTIs appeared to have been lower. These susceptibility changes should be utilized in determining clinical treatments.
TI  - A standardized protocol for the rapid preparation of bacterial DNA for pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
AB  - A rapid method for the preparation of bacterial DNA for pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was developed for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This method was accomplished by reducing the time for the cell lysis reaction, restriction endonuclease digestion, and electrophoresis to 1, 1.5, and 18 h, respectively. The whole procedure from the initial bacterial culture plate to the final analysis of restriction fragments can be completed within 24 h. This rapid method was successfully achieved for Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Characterization of staphylococci with reduced susceptibilities to vancomycin and other glycopeptides.
AB  - During the last several years a series of staphylococcal isolates that demonstrated reduced susceptibility to vancomycin or other glycopeptides have been reported. We selected 12 isolates of staphylococci for which the vancomycin MICs were > or =4 microg/ml or for which the teicoplanin MICs were > or =8 microg/ml and 24 control strains for which the vancomycin MICs were < or =2 microg/ml or for which the teicoplanin MICs were < or =4 microg/ml to determine the ability of commercial susceptibility testing procedures and vancomycin agar screening methods to detect isolates with reduced glycopeptide susceptibility. By PCR analysis, none of the isolates with decreased glycopeptide susceptibility contained known vancomycin resistance genes. Broth microdilution tests held a full 24 h were best at detecting strains with reduced glycopeptide susceptibility. Disk diffusion did not differentiate the strains inhibited by 8 microg of vancomycin per ml from more susceptible isolates. Most of the isolates with reduced glycopeptide susceptibility were recognized by MicroScan conventional panels and Etest vancomycin strips. Sensititre panels read visually were more variable, although with some of the panels MICs of 8 microg/ml were noted for these isolates. Vitek results were 4 microg/ml for all strains for which the vancomycin MICs were > or =4 microg/ml. Vancomycin MICs on Rapid MicroScan panels were not predictive, giving MICs of either < or =2 or > or =16 microg/ml for these isolates. Commercial brain heart infusion vancomycin agar screening plates containing 6 microg of vancomycin per ml consistently differentiated those strains inhibited by 8 microg/ml from more susceptible strains. Vancomycin-containing media prepared in-house showed occasional growth of susceptible strains, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, and on occasion, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212. Thus, strains of staphylococci with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides, such as vancomycin, are best detected in the laboratory by nonautomated quantitative tests incubated for a full 24 h. Furthermore, it appears that commercial vancomycin agar screening plates can be used to detect these isolates.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of nisin against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - The rapid spread of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens necessitates the search for alternative antibacterial agents. We examined the efficacy of the antibiotic nisin against 56 multidrug-resistant isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 Staphylococcus aureus and 29 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis isolates. The test strains represented a large variety of clonal types (as determined by a combination of DNA fingerprints) isolated from a variety of geographic sources, and included some of the major internationally-spread multiresistant epidemic clones of S. pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), MRSA strains resistant to over 16 generically distinct antibacterial agents, and enterococcal strains resistant to all currently available chemotherapeutic agents including glycopeptides. In the overwhelming majority of cases, treatment of growing cultures with nisin at 1 mg/L (S. pneumoniae) or 10-20 mg/L (in MRSA and enterococci) caused extensive (10(3)- to 10(4)-fold) loss of viable titre accompanied by various degrees of loss in the optical density of the cultures, which was most extensive in pneumococci (>90%) and least extensive (40-50%) in enterococci. Nevertheless, extensive variation in rates of nisin-induced autolysis was observed in each bacterial species. Serial exposure of a penicillin-susceptible strain of S. pneumoniae to nisin (1 mg/L) in liquid culture resulted in the rapid appearance of stable nisin-resistant mutants in which the MIC increased from 0.4 to 6.4 mg/L and the resistance trait was transferable by genetic transformation.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1996). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 680 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1996 to May 1997. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.4% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.6% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptabilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. Imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA Arbekacin (ABK) and VCM showed the highest activities against both S. aureus and MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 or 2 micrograms/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) had low activities with the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and VCM showed the strongest activities against S. epidermis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 2 micrograms/ml. Cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefozopran (CZOP) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Compared with antimicrobial activities of cephems is 1995, the MIC90S of them had changed into a better state. They ranged from 4 micrograms/ml 16 micrograms/ml in 1996. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except MINO were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, CZOP, IPM, and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 micromilligrams. Tosufloxacin (TFLX) and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 0.5 micromilligrams. 5. Citrobacter freundii Gentamicin (GM) showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 0.5 micrograms/ml. IPM and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Cefpirome (CPR) and CZOP were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and TFLX were 1 microgram/ml, the MIC90 of AMK was 2 micrograms/ml, the MIC90S of CZOP, GM and ofloxacin (OFLX) were 4 micrograms/ml. The MIC50S of cephems except CEZ, cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefaclor (CCL) had changed into a better state in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 7. Escherichia coli All drugs except penicillins and MINO were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90S of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Among E. coli strains, those with low susceptibilities to cephems except CEZ, cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX) and CCL have increased in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. CPR had the strongest activity, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.25 microgram/ml. Flomoxef (FMOX), cefixime (CFIX), CZOP and carumonam (CRMN) were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 9. Pseudomonas aeruginosa All drugs except quinolones were not so active against P. aeruginosa with the MIC90S were 32 micrograms/ml or above. Quinolones were more active in 1996 than 1995. The MIC90S of them were between 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, and the MIC50S of them were between 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml. 10. Serratia marcescens GM showed the highest activity against S. marcescens. Its MIC90 was 1 micro
TI  - [Survey of the sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  - Research groups were formed in 21 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance. The activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,282 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at all institutions between October and December 1995. The results were as follows: 1. Carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against MSSA and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Their activities against Enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ABPC. Carbapenems showed low activities against MRSA. 2. OFLX exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity against Haemophilus influenzae, followed by MEPM. The antibacterial activities of the other carbapenems were comparable to those of FMOX and CTM. 3. The carbapenems showed high activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Bacteroides fragilis group. Their activities were greater than that exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents. The carbapenems also exhibited greater antibacterial activities against Serratia marcescens than the other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains were detected. 4. The antibacterial activities of carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were comparable to those of CAZ, AZT, AMK.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY333328 against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - We report the activity of LY333328 against 35 clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (including organisms carrying the vanA, vanB, vanC-1, and vanC-2/3 genes, as determined by PCR), 33 clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and 29 clinical isolates of high-level penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae. All isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were inhibited by 2 micrograms/mL LY333328, and 8 micrograms/mL LY333328 was bactericidal against all isolates tested. All isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus were inhibited by 1 microgram/mL LY333328, and 4 micrograms/mL LY333328 was bactericidal against all methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates tested. All isolates of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae were inhibited by < 0.125 microgram/mL LY333328, and 0.25 microgram/mL LY333328 was bactericidal against all S. pneumoniae isolates tested. LY333328 is a promising new glycopeptide antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of rhodium, iridium, and ruthenium tripodal phosphine complexes.
AB  - Twenty-eight rhodium, iridium, or ruthenium complexes were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonaa aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Ten compounds showed an antibacterial activity against Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 with a range of the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) between 16 and 125 micrograms/ml. None of the compounds exhibited antimicrobial activity against the gram-negative strains E. coli ATCC 25922 or Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 29213 with a concentration range between 4 and 500 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus coenzyme A disulfide reductase, a new subfamily of pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase. Sequence, expression, and analysis of cdr.
AB  - The cdr gene encoding coenzyme A disulfide reductase (CoADR) from Staphylococcus  aureus 8325-4 was cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed. The gene encodes a 438-amino acid polypeptide that has a calculated molecular weight of 49,200 and sequence similarity to the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase family of flavoenzymes. The deduced primary structure contains consensus sequences for flavin adenine dinucleotide and NADPH-binding regions but lacks the catalytic disulfide signature sequence typical of the glutathione reductase family of disulfide reductases. The active site region of CoADR has only a single cysteine residue that is similar to that in the conserved SFXXC active site motif of NADH oxidase and NADH peroxidase from Enterococcus faecalis. CoADR is the first disulfide reductase reported having this active site region, and sequence comparisons of CoADR to representative members of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide reductase superfamily placed CoADR in a distinct subfamily. CoADR was overexpressed in Escherichia coli using the pET expression system, and 5-10 mg of fully active recombinant enzyme were recovered per liter of E. coli cells.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of CFC-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - CFC-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. The in-vitro and in-vivo activities of CFC-222 were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and sparfloxacin. Against gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis, CFC-222 was more active than ciprofloxacin and similar to sparfloxacin. Against gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, the in-vitro activity of CFC-222 was similar to that of sparfloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. However, it was less active than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In mouse systemic infection caused by S. aureus Smith or S. aureus TMS 33, CFC-222 demonstrated an activity similar to that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, but better than that of ofloxacin. The compound was more effective than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin in murine infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 8668. Against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae infections, the efficacy of CFC-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin. The activity of CFC-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against P. aeruginosa MB4-16 in the same infection model. These results suggest that CFC-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various bacterial infections.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic properties of HMR 3647, a novel ketolide, on respiratory pathogens, enterococci and Bacteroides fragilis demonstrated by studies of time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - The pharmacodynamic properties of a novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide), HMR 3647, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect (PAE). The time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides fragilis. The PAEs of HMR 3647 were also investigated on these organisms at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x MIC. The time-kill kinetic data demonstrated that HMR 3647 is predominantly bacteriostatic and only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. HMR 3647 exhibited a significant PAE with all strains studied, ranging from 1.2 h to 8.2 h at 10 x MIC. The bacteriostatic activity and significant PAE demonstrated by HMR 3647 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities and postantibiotic effects of the oxazolidinone compounds eperezolid (PNU-100592) and linezolid (PNU-100766) versus vancomycin against Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - The activities of the oxazolidinone antibacterial agents eperezolid (PNU-100592)  and linezolid (PNU-100766) were compared with that of vancomycin against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n = 200), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 100), and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium (n = 50). Eperezolid and linezolid demonstrated good in vitro inhibitory activity, regardless of methicillin susceptibility for staphylococci (MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [MIC90] range, 1 to 4 microg/ml) or vancomycin susceptibility for enterococci (MIC90 range, 1 to 4 microg/ml). In time-kill studies, eperezolid and linezolid were bacteriostatic in action. A postantibiotic effect of 0.8+/-0.5 h was demonstrated for both eperezolid and linezolid against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. faecalis, and E. faecium.
TI  - Role of chemotherapeutic antagonism in opportunistic infections.
AB  - The most widely-known anti-tumor drugs often induce marked immunosuppression which can give rise to one or more sepses. Anti-infection measures immediately applied can sometimes prove largely ineffective or even useless, the patient dying not as a result of the spread of the tumour but as a direct consequence of opportunistic infection. We postulate that antagonism between anti-tumour and antimicrobial drugs may also play an important part in this. By way of illustration of this hypothesis, we have studied the action of a number of known inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis and of DNA-gyrases on certain strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms cultured in medium containing various concentrations of some of the best-known anti-tumour antimetabolites. The experimental data show that antimicrobial and anti-tumour drugs can sometimes induce synergic or indifferent chemotherapeutic interactions with many bacteria, while in others the effect is antagonistic. In practice, the action of the drugs could lead to bacterial selectivity, which, in conjunction with immunosuppression and the presence of resistant strains, could favour the evolution of opportunistic infection.
TI  - Synergistic activity of trovafloxacin with other agents against gram-positive and -negative organisms.
AB  - The synergistic activity of trovafloxacin with other agents against 55 Gram-positive and -negative bacteria was determined by checkerboard titration. Synergistic fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices (< or = 0.5) were seen in two methicillin-susceptible and one methicillin-resistant Staphyloccocus aureus with teicoplanin, one of each of the latter two with vancomycin; one methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus with rifampin and one with fusidic acid; five Stenotrophomonas maltophilia with cefoperazone; three Pseudomonas aeruginosa with ticarcillin/clavulanate, four with aztreonam, two with ceftazidime, one with tobramycin, one with cefoperazone, and one with ceftriaxone; one pneumococcus with ceftriaxone; one Enterococcus faecalis with ceftriaxone, and one with vancomycin; two Bacteroides fragilis with metronidazole, two with clindamycin, and one with cefoxitin; and one Clostridium perfringens with metronidazole and one with clindamycin. All other FIC indices were additive/indifferent (0.51-2.0), and no antagonistic FIC indices (> 4.0) were observed.
TI  - The challenge of antibiotic resistance.
AB  
TI  - Why does Staphylococcus aureus secrete an Enterococcus faecalis-specific pheromone?
AB  - The long known fact that Staphylococcus aureus can secrete a peptide (staph-cAM373) which acts as a sex pheromone for strains of E. faecalis carrying the sex pheromone plasmid pAM373 was studied in detail. 85 of 100 independent isolates of S. aureus produced an activity inducing the pAM373 encoded adhesin resulting in a clumping reaction of E. faecalis (i.e. secreted staph-cAM373), but not a single one of 100 independent isolates of coagulase-negative Staphylococci possessed this activity. The production of peptides acting as sex pheromone for E. faecalis was observed only for sex pheromone plasmid pAM373, but not for sex pheromone plasmids pAD1 and pPD1. It was shown that the amount of staph-pAM373 produced during growth paralleled cell mass, therefore this peptide should not be used as a cell density indicator by S. aureus (i.e. has no quorum sensing function). The potential function of staph-cAM373 to trigger gene transfer from Escherichia faecalis to S. aureus is discussed.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis in endophthalmitis.
AB  - Genomic DNA fingerprint analysis was performed on 39 Staphylococcus aureus and 28 Enterococcus faecalis endophthalmitis isolates collected from multiple clinical centers. Among 21 S. aureus genomic DNA fingerprint patterns identified, five clonotypes were recovered from multiple unrelated patients and accounted for 58.9% (23 of 39) of the isolates analyzed. Compared with strains having unique genomic DNA fingerprint patterns, the S. aureus clonotypes occurring more than once were more likely to result in visual acuities of 20/200 or worse (P = 0.036 [chi2 test]). In contrast to the S. aureus isolates, the E. faecalis endophthalmitis isolates were a clonally diverse population, enriched for the expression of a known toxin, cytolysin, which is plasmid encoded.
TI  - Glycerol monolaurate inhibits induction of vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus  faecalis.
AB  - Glycerol monolaurate (GML) is a surfactant that has been found to inhibit the post-exponential phase activation of virulence factor production and the induction of beta-lactamase in Staphylococcus aureus. It has been suggested that signal transduction is the most probable target for GML (S. J. Projan, S. Brown-Skrobot, P. M. Schlievert, F. Vandenesch, and R. P. Novick, J. Bacteriol. 176:4204-4209, 1994). We found that GML suppresses growth of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis on plates with vancomycin and blocks the induction of vancomycin resistance, which involves a membrane-associated signal transduction mechanism, either at or before initiation of transcription. Given the surfactant nature of GML and the results of previous experiments, we suggest that GML blocks signal transduction. In contrast, GML has no effect on the induction of erythromycin-inducible macrolide resistance in S. aureus, which does not involve signal transduction.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive Streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain PonSSII.
AB  - An antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive Streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain PonSSII has been isolated and partially characterized. The antibiotic is produced throughout culture growth, with maximum amounts accumulating in the broth when the culture is in the early stationary phase of growth. The activity declines within about 30 h after the culture enters stationary phase. Purification techniques included chromatography on Amberlite XAD-2, DEAE Sephadex and SP Sephadex in addition to C18 HPLC with an average yield of 75%. This antibiotic only inhibits pathogenic strains of S. scabies that cause scab disease on potato and other tuberous vegetables and does not affect S. griseus, S. venezuelae, Actinomyces bovis, Nocardia asteroides, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli. The antibiotic has a molecular weight of 500 or less, and is stable for weeks at acidic pH but is very labile at alkaline pH conditions.
TI  - [Comparative antimicrobial activity of RP 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin), the first semisynthetic injectable streptgramin, against gram-positive cocci and other recent clinical pathogens].
AB  - RP 59,500 (Quinupristin-Dalfopristin) is the first semisynthetic injectable streptogramin antimicrobial agent, which is a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin in a 30:70 ratio. The components of RP 59,500 act synergically to provide bactericidal activity through action at different sites on bacterial ribosomes. In the present study, the antimicrobial activity of RP 59,500 was compared with those of four macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin). Susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution method on 303 strains of 10 species, especially antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive cocci. RP 59,500 was active against a wide range of Gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant Staphylococci and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The MICs90 of RP 59,500 against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis were both 0.25 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. The MICs90 of RP 59,500 against penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant S. pneumoniae were all 0.5 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. RP 59,500 also exhibited equivalent activities to the four macrolides against strains of Streptococcus pyogenes. Streptococcus agalactiae and Moraxella catarrhalis. RP 59,500 exhibited the highest activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus avium strains which are intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents. No cross-resistance was observed between RP 59,500 and the four macrolides, which will merit attention in future clinical trials of the agent. The effect of human serum on the MIC of RP 59,500 was studied with strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. faecalis. The presence of 20% (V/V) serum had little or no effect on the MIC, although 50% (V/V) serum increased MICs by 4-8 folds. Laboratory-induced resistance to RP 59,500 occurred in a stepwise fashion in broth cultures of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. facalis strains and the induction rate was slow and no more than four fold increases were observed. Population analysis was performed on RP 59,500 and the reference macrolides against S. aureus ATCC 25,923 strain. Although low frequencies (less than 0.01%) of resistant sub-population were detected with EM, CAM, AZM and RXM, no RP 59,500-resistant sub-population was detected in this study.
TI  - [Meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  - Meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position C1 which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (DHP-1), thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. Its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in C2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. Meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the PBPs. It covers gram positive aerobes (Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, Enterococcus faecalis, Rhodococcus equi, Listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, Vibrio, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria, Moraxella) and anaerobes (Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, and Propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: P. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and H. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci, streptococci and staphylococci). Meropenem has no activity on Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus resistant to methycillin, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). Resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the OprD porin (OprD2 in enterobacteria and P. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the PBPs (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).
TI  - In-vitro photobactericidal activity of aminoacridines.
AB  - The toxicities of several aminoacridines were measured against pathogenic strains of both Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) organisms. In several cases, illumination at a light dose of 6.3 J/cm2 resulted in considerable decreases in the minimum lethal drug concentrations required, giving up to 50-fold increases in bactericidal activity. Derivatives of 9-aminoacridine (aminacrine) exhibited phototoxicity against one or more of the test organisms, but the established photosensitizing acridines proflavine and acridine orange were photobactericidal against all strains.
TI  - Comparison of agar dilution, broth microdilution, E-test, disk diffusion, and automated Vitek methods for testing susceptibilities of Enterococcus spp. to vancomycin.
AB  - An evaluation was undertaken to determine the optimal method for testing the susceptibilities of 100 clinical isolates and two reference strains of Enterococcus spp. to vancomycin in vitro. Six testing methods were studied by using the following media and incubation times: agar screen with the Synergy Quad Plate (Remel, Lenexa, Kans.), an in-house-prepared brain heart infusion (BHI) agar plate, and an in-house-prepared Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar plate, all incubated for 24 or 48 h; broth microdilution (Sensititre Just One Strip; AccuMed International, Inc., West Lake, Ohio) with BHI or cation-adjusted MH broth incubated for 24 or 48 h; agar dilution with BHI or MH agar incubated for 24 or 48 h; epsilometer test (E test; AB BioDisk, Solna, Sweden) with BHI or MH agar incubated for 24 or 48 h; disk diffusion with BHI or MH agar incubated for 24 or 48 h; and the automated Vitek method with the gram-positive susceptibility Staphylococcus aureus card and R02.03 software (bioMerieux, Inc., Hazelwood, Mo.). Growth failures occurred with MH media (n = 6) but not with BHI media. One growth failure occurred with the Vitek method. Results for each testing method for each Enterococcus strain were interpreted as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant according to current National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) criteria and compared to the vancomycin resistance genotype (i.e., vanA, vanB, vanC-1, or vanC-2/3). For all methods, extension of the incubation time from 24 h to 48 h either produced no difference in the results or gave poorer results. The following methods produced no very major or major interpretive errors: broth microdilution with BHI media incubated for 24 h, agar dilution with BHI media incubated for 24 or 48 h, and E test with BHI media incubated for 24 or 48 h. Unacceptable frequencies of very major errors (> 1%) occurred with all methods for which MH media were used. Minor interpretive errors were frequent with all methods. These minor interpretive errors also occurred most frequently with Enterococcus strains with vanC genes, which encoded low-level vancomycin resistance (MIC < or = 8 microg/ml), as opposed to Enterococcus strains which possessed vanA or vanB genes, which encoded higher-level vancomycin resistance (MIC > or = 64 microg/ml). Modification of NCCLS breakpoints, especially for motile Enterococcus spp. (E. casseliflavus, E. flavescens, and E. gallinarum), may resolve this problem; however, in the current study, one E. faecalis strain and one E. faecium strain carried only the vanC gene. The agar screen method may also require reformulation. The current agar screen plate contains 6 microg of vancomycin per ml, which may not detect all low-level resistance associated with vanC genotypes. Nevertheless, the clinical significance of this low-level vancomycin resistance remains unknown.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of two genes, prtA and prtB, from Myxococcus xanthus, encoding PrtA and PrtB proteases, both of which are required for the protease activity.
AB  - The sequence of a 1955-bp TaqI DNA fragment from Myxococcus xanthus was determined. This fragment contains two complete genes, designated prtA and prtB. The prtA and prtB ORFs extend over 828 and 798 bp, respectively. They are separated only by 3 nt and appear to be present in a polycistronic transcriptional unit. A typical lipoprotein signal sequence is present at the N terminus of the two deduced polypeptides. The aa sequence of PrtA shows a high degree of identity to the region adjacent to the Ser residue belonging to the catalytic triad of serine proteases from Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. It also exhibits features characteristic of trypsin-like serine proteases in that it contains the same pattern of variable and conserved regions. The deduced aa sequence of PrtB reveals a signature zinc-binding consensus motif (HEXXHXXGXXH/Met-turn) characteristic of the class of metalloproteases called metzincins. Plasmids containing prtA, prtB, or both were constructed. Protease activity studies of Escherichia coli clones containing these plasmids showed that both genes are necessary for this activity, whatever their cis or trans position. As prtB produces a putative membrane-bound lipoprotein of 266 aa, the protease activation must occur at the membrane level.
TI  - Ofloxacin otic solution for treatment of otitis externa in children and adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and efficacy of ofloxacin otic solution with those of Cortisporin otic solutions (neomycin sulfate, polymyxin B sulfate, and hydrocortisone) in otitis externa in adults and children. DESIGN: Two randomized, evaluator-blind, multicenter trials, 1 each in children and adults. SETTING: Twenty-three primary care and referral ambulatory care sites per trial. PATIENTS: A total of 314 adults (12 years and older) and 287 children (younger than 12 years). Of the total, data for 247 adults and 227 children were considered clinically evaluable (CE), and those for 98 children and 98 adults were microbiologically evaluable (ME). INTERVENTIONS: Ofloxacin (adults, 0.5 mL; children, 0.25 mL) twice daily or Cortisporin (adults, 0.2 mL; children, 0.15 mL) 4 times daily for 10 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The CE subjects were cured if all signs and symptoms resolved at posttherapy (days 11-13) and test-of-cure (days 17-20) visits. The ME subjects had microbiological and clinical successes if they were cured and had microbiological eradication or presumed eradication. RESULTS: Cure was observed in 82% and 97% of CE adults and children treated with ofloxacin and 84% and 95% of CE adults and children treated with Cortisporin, respectively. The most common pathogens at the pretherapy visit were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and enteric bacilli. There were no statistically significant differences in clinical or microbiological and clinical cure or in the rates of adverse events between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Ofloxacin given twice daily is as safe and effective as Cortisporin given 4 times daily for otitis externa. The bacteriological findings and treatment responses do not differ between adults and children.
TI  - Novel fluoroquinolone antibacterial agents containing oxime-substituted (aminomethyl)pyrrolidines: synthesis and antibacterial activity of 7-(4-(aminomethyl)-3-(methoxyimino)pyrrolidin-1-yl)-1-cyclopropyl-6- fluoro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro[1,8]naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid (LB20304).
AB  - New pyrrolidine derivatives, which bear an alkyloxime substituent in the 4-position and an aminomethyl substituent in the 3-position of the pyrrolidine ring, have been synthesized and coupled with various quinolinecarboxylic acids to produce a series of new fluoroquinolone antibacterials. These fluoroquinolones were found to possess potent antimicrobial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Variations at the C-8 position of the quinolone nucleus included fluorine, chlorine, nitrogen, methoxy, and hydrogen atom substitution. The activity imparted to the substituted quinolone nucleus by the C-8 substituent was in the order F (C5-NH2) > F (C5-H) > naphthyridine > Cl = OMe = H against Gram-positive organisms. In the case of Gram-negative strains, activity was in the order F (C5-NH2) > naphthyridine = F (C5-H) > H > Cl > OMe. The advantages provided by the newly introduced oxime group of the quinolones were clearly demonstrated by their comparison to a desoximino compound 30. In addition, the oxime moiety greatly improved the pharmacokinetic parameters of the novel quinolones. Among these compounds, compound 20 (LB20304) showed the best in vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile in animals, as well as good physical properties. The MICs (microgram/mL) of LB20304, compound 30, and ciprofloxacin against several test organisms are as follows: S. aureus 6538p (0.008, 0.031, and 0.13), methicillin resistant S. aureus 241 (4, 16, and 128), Streptococcus epidermidis 887E (0.008, 0.016, and 0.13), methicillin resistant S. epidermidis 178 (4, 32, and 128), Enterococcus faecalis 29212 (0.063, 0.13, and 1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E (0.25, 0.5, and 0.13), Escherichia coli 3190Y (0.008, 0.016, and 0.008), Enterobacter cloacae P99 (0.008, 0.031, and 0.008), Actinobacter calcoaceticus 15473 (0.063, 0.13, and 0.25). On the basis of these promising results, LB20304 was selected as a candidate for further evaluation.
TI  - Cloning of the Staphylococcus aureus ddh gene encoding NAD+-dependent D-lactate dehydrogenase and insertional inactivation in a glycopeptide-resistant isolate.
AB  - The mechanism of low-level glycopeptide resistance among staphylococci is not known. A cytoplasmic protein, provisionally called Ddh (W. M. Milewski, S. Boyle-Vavra, B. Moreira, C. C. Ebert, and R. S. Daum, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 40:166-172, 1996), and the RNA transcript that contains the ddh gene, which encodes Ddh, are present in increased amounts in a vancomycin-resistant isolate, 523k, compared with the susceptible parent isolate, 523. Sequence analysis had previously revealed that Ddh is related to NAD+-dependent D-lactate dehydrogenase (D-nLDH) and VanH. This latter protein is essential for high-level glycopeptide resistance in Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis by synthesizing the D-lactate needed for biosynthesis of D-lactate-terminating peptidoglycan precursors with low affinity for vancomycin. We now provide the direct evidence that the ddh gene product is Staphylococcus aureus D-nLDH and hereafter refer to the protein as D-nLDH. However, overproduction of this protein in isolate 523k did not result in production of D-lactate-containing peptidoglycan precursors, and susceptibility testing of ddh mutants of 523k demonstrated that S. aureus D-nLDH is not necessary for glycopeptide resistance in this isolate. We conclude that the mechanism of glycopeptide resistance in this isolate is distinct from that in enterococci.

TI  - [Relation between candidiasis and nutrition of patients and MRSA infection].
AB  - We evaluated the relation with nutritional state and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection of 20 patients who isolated Candida of 31 patients who were suspected as candidiasis. All of the patients who were hospitalized in internal medicine wards in our hospital between February 1993 and January 1994. All patients with hematological disease were excluded. MRSA is now gotten much attention as pathogen of hospital infection, but each MRSA is detected not only alone but also concomitant with other bacterium. In our hospital MRSA was detected alone 36.8% (39/106). Candida 9.4% (10/106) was frequent as mixed infectious pathogen concomitant with MRSA following Pseudomonas aeruginosa 19.8% (21/106) and Enterococcus faecalis 12.3% (13/106). Intension of host-immunity is a important factor as prevention of both infection. We evaluated the nutritional state of patients with 7 cases of infection group and 13 cases of colonization group. There was no significance between two groups as for serum total protein (mean) were 5.97 g/dl in infection group and 5.96% g/dl in colonization group. Furthermore there were significance (p < 0.01) for mean serum albumin (mean) were 3.11 g/dl v.s. 3.27 g/dl. But both serum total protein and serum albumin of these evaluated patients who isolated Candida were less than normal limit. Therefore we considered nutritional disturbance was important addition to over-use of antibiotics and severe underlying diseases as risk factor of candidiasis, and revealed the importance of improvement of nutritional state at the prevention and therapy.
TI  - [An epidemiological investigation for gram-positive coccus, especially MRSA, in Kinki area].
AB  - An epidemiological investigation for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) was performed at 21 medical institutes in Kinki area by the questionnaire from Kinki Infection Working Group in 1995. The most frequent specimen for MRSA was pus (25.3%) from out-patients and sputum (34.4%) from in-patients, respectively. As compared to the investigation of the MRSA Forum in 1992 and 1993, MRSA increased over 20%, and furthermore 57.8% was MRSA out of S. aureus under this study. It demonstrated that drug-resistance was accelerated for a few years. Polymicrobial infection, especially with more than 3 pathogens, increased significantly compared with the results of the MRSA Forum (p < 0.01). It was suggested that compromized host increased and therapy turned to be more difficult. Simultaneous pathogens detected with MRSA were Candida species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. In terms of chemosusceptibility, VCM (99.9%), ST (99.4%) and ABK (99.3%) were still determined to be highly sensitivity against MRSA.
TI  - In-vitro activities of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were equally active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens. Ciprofloxacin was the most active compound against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 = 1 mg/L), followed by trovafloxacin (MIC90 = 4 mg/L). Trovafloxacin was twice as active as sparfloxacin against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L) and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90 = 0.06 mg/L) (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, for which the MIC90 was 8 mg/L). Trovafloxacin was the most active compound against Enterococcus faecalis: 80% of strains were susceptible to 0.25 mg/L. There was complete cross-resistance between all fluoroquinolones.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial efficacies of CFC-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - CFC-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone containing a C-7 bicyclic amine moiety with potent antibacterial activities against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms. We compared the in vitro and in vivo activities of CFC-222 with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and lomefloxacin. CFC-222 was more active than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive bacteria. CFC-222 was particularly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [MIC90], 0.2 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.2 microg/ml for ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains), and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 0.39 microg/ml). Against Escherichia coli and other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, CFC-222 was slightly less active than ciprofloxacin (MIC90s for E. coli, 0.1 and 0.025 microg/ml, respectively). The in vitro activity of CFC-222 was not influenced by inoculum size, medium composition, or the presence of horse serum. However, its activity was decreased significantly by a change in the pH of the medium from 7.0 to 6.0, as was the case for the other quinolones tested. The in vivo protective efficacy of CFC-222 by oral administration was greater than those of the other quinolones tested in a mouse model of intraperitoneally inoculated systemic infection caused by S. aureus. CFC-222 exhibited efficacy comparable to that of ciprofloxacin in the same model of infection caused by gram-negative organisms, such as E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. In this infection model, CFC-222 was slightly less active than ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These results suggest that CFC-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent in various bacterial infections.
TI  - A study of photobactericidal activity in the phenothiazinium series.
AB  - The photodynamic antibacterial properties of a closely related series of commercially available phenothiazinium dyes were tested against a range of pathogenic strains of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative organisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The photosensitisers were illuminated using a non-laser light source at a fluence of 1.75 mW cm-2 and this resulted in the enhancement of antibacterial activity in liquid culture. In several cases, illumination resulted in considerable decreases in the minimum lethal concentrations required, giving up to 100-fold increases in bactericidal activity.
TI  - Successful single-dose teicoplanin prophylaxis against experimental streptococcal, enterococcal, and staphylococcal aortic valve endocarditis.
AB  - Teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that is administered both intramuscularly and intravenously. It has a prolonged half-life and a less toxic profile in comparison to those of vancomycin. The efficacy of a single dose of teicoplanin (18 mg/kg of body weight given intramuscularly) for the prevention of endocarditis due to Streptococcus oralis, Enterococcus faecium, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was evaluated after applying the rabbit model. Vancomycin at a single dose of 30 mg/kg given intravenously was used as the comparative agent for the prevention of endocarditis due to MRSA and E. faecium, while ampicillin at a single dose of 40 mg/kg given intravenously was used as the comparative agent for the prevention of endocarditis due to S. oralis. Rabbits in the teicoplanin group were infected at 1 h postdosing with approximately 10(7) CFU of each strain. Rabbits in the other groups were infected at 0.5 h postdosing with approximately 10(7) CFU of S. oralis (ampicillin group) or E. faecium and MRSA (vancomycin group). All rabbits were sacrificed 5 days later. Teicoplanin and vancomycin protected the animals challenged with E. faecium by 87.5 and 50%, respectively, and protected the animals challenged with MRSA by 100 and 92%, respectively. Teicoplanin and ampicillin protected the animals challenged with S. oralis by 100 and 77%, respectively. Prevention of endocarditis by teicoplanin was likely to be due to a prolonged inhibition of bacterial growth by the sustained supra-MICs. It is concluded that teicoplanin is very effective in preventing experimental streptococcal, enterococcal, and staphylococcal endocarditis and may be an attractive alternative antibiotic in patients allergic to beta-lactams, especially in the outpatient setting.
TI  - Identification and characterization of cell wall-cell division gene clusters in pathogenic gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Clusters of peptidoglycan biosynthesis and cell division genes (DCW genes) were identified and sequenced in two gram-positive cocci, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. The results indicated some similarities in organization compared with previously reported bacterial DCW gene clusters, including the presence of penicillin-binding proteins at the left ends and ftsA and ftsZ cell division genes at the right ends of the clusters. However, there were also some important differences, including the absence of several genes, the comparative sizes of the div1B and ftsQ genes, and a wide range of amino acid sequence similarities when the genes of the gram-positive cocci were translated and compared to bacterial homologs.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of vancomycin constant-rate infusion in the treatment of chronic Gram-positive bone and joint infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of vancomycin constant-rate infusion over 24 h in the treatment of Gram-positive bone infections, METHODS: Vancomycin (40 mg/kg/day) was administered without a loading dose to 15 patients (12 male, three female) aged 23--90 years, weighing 46--85 kg, with postoperative chronic bone and joint infections. The 24-h dose was adjusted to maintain plasma levels between 25 and 35 mg/L. Mean duration of therapy was 6.2 months (4--8.5) via a portable infusion pump. Sites of infection included hip and femur (10), tibia (three), patella (one) and vertebrae (one). Sequestrectomy (two), removal of material (7/8 prosthetic hips, 1/5 metal implants) and debridement (two) were performed at the beginning of the treatment. Involved bacteria included Staphylococcus aureus (eight, six methicillin resistant), S. epidermidis (four methicillin-resistant), Enterococcus faecalis (one), Enterococcus avium (one) and Streptococcus bovis (one). RESULTS: MIC of vancomycin ranged from 1 to 4 mg/L. The mean vancomycin bone concentration when available was 67.7plus minus38.9 microg/L. Based on a mean post-treatment follow-up of 14plus minus4 months (6--20.6), cure was achieved in 10 patients (66.6%). Failures were related to the inability to remove the infected prosthesis (one) or implants (three) and to the persistence of a deep wound abcess (one). Adverse events included pruritus (four cases), tinnitus (two), mild transient elevation of creatinine level (three) and transient neutropenia (two). Vancomycin was maintained in all the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged treatment with vancomycin constant-rate infusion is effective and safe for treatment of Gram-positive chronic bone and joint infections, providing that complete surgical debridement and prosthetic material removal are performed.
TI  - Serum inhibitory titers and serum bactericidal titers for human subjects receiving multiple doses of the antibacterial oxazolidinones eperezolid and linezolid.
AB  - In Phase I trials subjects received multiple doses of eperezolid (PNU-100592; formerly U-100592) and linezolid (PNU-100766; formerly U-100766), and steady-state samples were drawn at the projected peak and trough timepoints. Serum inhibitory titer and serum bactericidal titer values were determined using single strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Serum inhibitory titer values generally correlated with drug concentration in serum and inherent organism susceptibility. Against S. aureus and E. faecalis sera from patients dosed with either drug were generally inhibitory at the peak timepoint, but at trough only linezolid exhibited a persistent effect. No bactericidal activity was seen for either drug against S. aureus or E. faecalis. The sera from patients dosed with either drug exhibited inhibition of S. pneumoniae at peak and trough. Bactericidal activity was seen against S. pneumoniae for both drugs at peak time and at trough for many of the sera for patients on the higher dose regimens. The results demonstrated that the sera from most human subjects dosed with eperezolid or linezolid were inhibitory to S. aureus and E. faecalis and S. pneumoniae and that many of the samples exhibited bactericidal activity for S. pneumoniae.
TI  - A review of the in vitro activity of meropenem and comparative antimicrobial agents tested against 30,254 aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated world wide.
AB  - The in vitro activity of meropenem (formerly SM-7738), a new carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem and five other broad-spectrum antimicrobials (ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin) against 30,254 clinically significant pathogens isolated in nine countries worldwide. Overall, the carbapenems, meropenem and imipenem, were the most active drugs. Meropenem was four- to 64-fold more active than imipenem against Gram-negative bacteria, including the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. Meropenem was also quite active against ceftazidime-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting 87.5 to 100% at < or = 4 micrograms/ml. In contrast, imipenem was four- to eight-fold more active than meropenem against Gram-positive species, including methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. Among the anaerobes, strains resistant to meropenem or imipenem were encountered very rarely. These extensive data provide additional in vitro support for the clinical use of meropenem as a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent active against key pathogenic species of bacteria.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin against Gram-positive bloodstream isolates.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, rifampicin, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 414 bloodstream isolates of Gram-positive cocci. Quinupristin-dalfopristin inhibited strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae at 0.12 mg/L, methicillin- and/or erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at 0.5 mg/L, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus anginosus at 1 mg/L and Enterococcus faecalis at 8 mg/L.
TI  - In-vitro activity of clinafloxacin, trovafloxacin, and ciprofloxacin.
AB  - Clinafloxacin and trovafloxacin are two new fluoroquinolones for which few comparative data are available. When MICs of ciprofloxacin against Gram-positive and Gram-negative nosocomial species were compared, clinafloxacin was the most potent although trovafloxacin was also more active than ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci. All three drugs were bactericidal. Clinafloxacin displayed the lowest frequency of resistance, approximating 10(-11). Development of resistance studies over 13-14 passages in the presence of drug revealed a 32-fold increase in MIC of clinafloxacin against S. aureus compared with 512- and 1024-fold for trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin respectively, although the three drugs were comparable against Enterococcus faecalis and the Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activities of 2-[(alpha-methylbenzylidene)-hydrazino]benzoxazoles.
AB  - New 2-[(alpha-methylbenzylidene)hydrazino]benzoxazole derivatives have been synthesized by reacting ortho or para substituted acetophenones with 2-hydrazinobenzoxazole in ethanol. The structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by microanalysis, IR and NMR spectral data. Antimicrobial activities of the compounds were investigated by the microdilution susceptibility test in Mueller-Hinton broth and Sabouraud liquid medium. Test organisms: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 as Gram (+) bacteria, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ATCC 27853 as Gram (-) bacteria, and Candida albicans, Candida stellatoidea, Candida parapsilosis and Candida pseudotropicalis as yeasts. Among the compounds tested 2-[(alpha-methyl-4-chlorobenzylidene)hydrazino]benzoxazole (compounds 4) and 2-[(alpha-methyl-4-nitrobenzylidene)hydrazino]benzoxazole (compound 8) showed the most favorable activity.
TI  - Development of an antimicrobial susceptibility testing method suitable for performance during space flight.
AB  - Very little is known regarding the effects of the microgravity environment of space flight upon the action of antimicrobial agents on bacterial pathogens. This study was undertaken to develop a simple method for conducting antibacterial susceptibility tests during a space shuttle mission. Specially prepared susceptibility test research cards (bioMerieux Vitek, Hazelwood, Mo.) were designed to include 6 to 11 serial twofold dilutions of 14 antimicrobial agents, including penicillins, cephalosporins, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, vancomycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. MICs of the drugs were determined by visual reading of color end points in the Vitek research cards made possible by incorporation of a colorimetric growth indicator (alamarBlue; Accumed International, Westlake, Ohio). This study has demonstrated reproducible susceptibility results in the testing of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, group A Streptococcus species, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In some instances, the MICs were comparable to those determined by a standard broth microdilution method, while in some cases the unique test media and format yielded slightly different values that were themselves reproducible. The proposed in-flight experiment will include inoculation of the Vitek cards on the ground prior to launch of the space shuttle, storage of inoculated cards at refrigeration temperature aboard the space shuttle until experiment initiation, and then incubation of the cards for 18 to 48 h prior to visual interpretation of MICs by the mission's astronauts. Ground-based studies have shown reproducible MICs following storage of inoculated cards for 7 days at 4 to 8 degrees C to accommodate the mission's time schedule and the astronaut's activities. For comparison, ground-based control (normal gravity) MIC values will be generated by simultaneous inoculation and incubation of a second set of test cards in a laboratory at the launch site. This procedure can provide for a safe and compact experiment that should yield new information on the effects of microgravity on the biological activities of various classes of antibiotics.
TI  - [Antimicrobial drug therapy and microbial sensitivity tests: general concept of antibiotics].
AB  
TI  - [The photometric determination of the antilysozyme activity of microorganisms].
AB  - The method for the determination of the antilysozyme activity (ALA) of microorganisms, based on the photometric determination of the residual activity of enzyme with the use of Micrococcus lysodeikticus test culture after the incubation of the strain under test and lysozyme, is proposed. The new method enhances the reliability of the determination of the ALA of microorganisms due to an increase in the accuracy of the quantitative determination of ALA. The elimination of the stage of interaction between the growing bacterial culture and lysozyme and the presence of the antilysozyme factor in the supernatant fluid confirm the constructive and secretory character of antilysozyme activity.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity and MIC quality control guidelines of RPR 106972  (RPR 112808/RPR106950): a novel orally administered streptogramin combination. The Quality Control Study Group.
AB  - RPR 106972 is a novel oral streptogramin combination with reported therapeutic potency against Gram-positive and certain respiratory tract pathogens. MICs for RPR 106972, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and seven comparison drugs were determined by the reference methods against 337 strains selected to define spectrum and potency. RPR 106972 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC ranges of 0.12 to 2 micrograms/ml and 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml, respectively), and coagulase-negative staphylococci were also inhibited by RPR 106972 (MIC90, < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (MIC90, < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). Against all streptococcal strains tested (including penicillin-resistant pneumococcus), RPR 106972 was highly active with MIC results at < or = 1 microgram/ml. RPR 106972 inhibited Corynebacterium jeikeium (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/ml). Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.25 microgram/ml), and some Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50, 2 micrograms/ml). RPR 106972 and quinupristin/dalfopristin demonstrated little activity against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90s, 4 to 32 micrograms/ml) as compared to Enterococcus faecium (MIC90s, 0.5 to 1 microgram/ml) and other Enterococcus ssp. (MIC90s, 1 microgram/ml). Studies to establish MIC quality-control guidelines indicated the following ranges: for E. faecalis ATCC 29212, 0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml; for S. aureus ATCC 29213, 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml; and for Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619, 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml. The results of this study indicate that the in vitro activity of RPR 106972 against Gram-positive bacteria and selected Gram-negative respiratory organisms is promising and warrants additional studies of pharmacokinetics, and in vivo infection model dynamics.
TI  - Susceptibility testing quality control studies with fosfomycin tromethamine.
AB  - Multiple studies were performed to define the quality control ranges for susceptibility tests of fosfomycin tromethamine. For disk diffusion tests, the limits proposed are 22 to 30 mm for Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and 25 to 33 mm for Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. Broth microdilution tests were not reproducible. For agar dilution tests, ranges proposed are 0.5 to 2.0 micrograms/ml for Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 0.5 to 4.0 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213; 2.0 to 8.0 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and 32 to 128 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212.
TI  - Infective endocarditis, 1984 through 1993: a clinical and microbiological survey.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To characterize the epidemiology and the clinical and microbiological spectrum of infective endocarditis in a Danish population. DESIGN: A retrospective review. SETTING: All episodes hospitalized of infective endocarditis from 1984 to 1993 in Viborg County were reviewed. The county is served by one general and four local hospitals. SUBJECTS: One hundred and nine episodes of suspected infective endocarditis with 62 episodes in 59 patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria by von Reyn. RESULTS: An overall incidence of 27 episodes per million per year was found. The incidence was 17.4 episodes per million per year in the first part of the decade and 36.5 episodes per million per year in the second part (P < 0.001). Microscopic haematuria was found in 70.2% of the patients with infective endocarditis, compared to 16.7% of the patients in whom the diagnosis was rejected (P < 0.01). Staphylococcus aureus was found in 38.9%, non-beta-haemolytic streptococci in 24.1% and Enterococcus faecalis in 16.7%. The overall mortality was 35.5%. The mortality decreased significantly from 50.0% in the first part of the decade to 28.6% in the second part (P < 0.01). The mortality was 23.1% in patients in whom the diagnosis was established whilst they were alive. This finding was significantly lower than the overall mortality (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The incidence of infective endocarditis increased during the decade. The frequency of non-beta-haemolytic streptococci was lower than normally reported. Mortality is still high, with the main mortality within the first week in hospital, which stresses the importance of early case detection and treatment.
TI  - Differential induction of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in whole blood by  bacteria: effects of antibiotic treatment.
AB  - The in vitro production of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, and the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) in whole blood upon stimulation with different bacterial strains was measured to study the possible relationship between disease severity and the cytokine-inducing capacities of these strains. Escherichia coli, Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Bacteroides fragilis, Capnocytophaga canimorsus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes induced the cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-1ra. Gram-negative bacteria induced significantly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokine production than gram-positive bacteria. These differences were less pronounced for the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1ra. In addition, blood was stimulated with E. coli killed by different antibiotics to study the effect of the antibiotics on the cytokine-inducing capacity of the bacterial culture. E. coli treated with cefuroxime and gentamicin induced higher levels of IL-1beta and IL-6 production but levels of IL-1ra production similar to that of heat-killed E. coli. In contrast, ciprofloxacin- and imipenem-cilastatin-mediated killing showed a decreased or similar level of induction of cytokine production as compared to that by heat-killed E. coli; polymyxin B decreased the level of production of the cytokines.
TI  - Does tea tree oil have a place in the topical treatment of burns?
AB  - Burnaid is a sorbalene-based cream containing 40 mg/g of tea tree oil and 1 mg/g  of triclosan. This investigation was carried out to determine the effect of Burnaid, a commercial tea tree oil preparation, against Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC29212), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC29213), Escherichia coli (ATCC25922), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27853), with the activity of the base product in the commercial preparation. The organisms were suspended in sterile saline (0.5 McFarland Standard) and inoculated onto horse blood agar (E. faecalis and S. aureus) or Mueller-Hinton agar (E. coli and P. aeruginosa). One hundred microliters of Burnaid unsterilized, Burnaid sterilized and the base product (Tinasolve) were placed in duplicate in wells cut into the agar plates. Sterility and inactivation cultures were also performed on the samples. None of the samples were found to be contaminated with bacteria prior to testing. Only S. aureus and E. coli showed zones of growth inhibition around the Burnaid and Tinasolve. Zones of growth inhibition (22 mm) were similar for the active product (Burnaid) and the base (Tinasolve). There was no activity against E. faecalis or P. aeruginosa. In view of our findings and literature indicating the cytotoxicity of tea tree oil against human fibroblasts and epithelial cells, it is recommended that this product should not be used on burn wounds.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of beta-[(2-benzimidazolyl)thio]-beta-benzoyl styrene derivatives.
AB  - In this study some new beta-[(2-benzimidazolyl)thio]-beta-benzoyl styrene derivatives have been synthesized by reacting 2-(phenacetylthio)benzimidazole and substituted benzaldehydes in piperidine/dry benzene. Structures were verified by microanalysis, IR and NMR spectral analysis. Antimicrobial activities of the compounds were investigated by the microdilution susceptibility test; Muller-Hinton Broth and Sabouraud Dextrose Broth were used for the determination of antibacterial and antifungal activity. Test organisms: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 as Gram (+) bacteria, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATTC 27853 as Gram (-) bacteria, and Candida albicans, Candida pseudotropicalis, Candida parapsilosis and Candida stellatoidea as yeast-like fungi. All the compounds showed good antimicrobial effect, especially against gram (+) bacteria. Among the compounds tested beta-[(2-benzimidazolyl)thio]-beta-benzoyl-4-chloro styrene (compound 9), beta-[(2-benzimidazolyl)thio]-beta-benzoyl-4-nitro styrene (compound 10) and beta-[(2-benzimidazolyl)thio]-beta-benzoyl-4-acetylamino styrene (compound 11) showed the most favorable activity.
TI  - In-vitro activity of trovafloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - Trovafloxacin (CP-99,219) was very active against Gram-negative species examined  including Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella spp., Neisseria spp. and Escherichia coli (MIC90s < or = 0.03 mg/L). In general trovafloxacin was twice as active as ofloxacin but only half as active as ciprofloxacin against Gram-negative species. Trovafloxacin was active against Gram-positive organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90s < or = 0.25 mg/L). Against these organisms activity was eight to 16 times greater for trovafloxacin than for either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. In addition, Chlamydia spp., Mycoplasma spp. and Ureaplasma urealyticum were eight to 16 times more susceptible to trovafloxacin than to either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. These in-vitro data show that trovafloxacin is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone with greater activity against clinically important Gram-positive species compared with ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin.
TI  - In vitro activity of HSR-903, a new quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new fluoroquinolone HSR-903 was compared with those  of ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin. HSR-903 inhibited 90% of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clinical isolates at 0.78 and 1.56 microg/ml, respectively, and its activity against MRSA was 16-fold higher than those of sparfloxacin and levofloxacin and 64-fold higher than that of ciprofloxacin. The MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of HSR-903 for Streptococcus pyogenes and penicillin G-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) were 0.10, 0.05, and 0.05 microg/ml, respectively. Against PRSP, the activity of HSR-903 was 4-fold higher than that of sparfloxacin and 32- to 256-fold higher than those of the other quinolones. The MIC90 of HSR-903 for Enterococcus faecalis was 0.20 microg/ml, and HSR-903 was more active than the other quinolones against enterococci. The activity of HSR-903 against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly similar to that of ciprofloxacin and greater than those of the other quinolones. Against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Helicobacter pylori, HSR-903 was the most potent of the quinolones tested. The activity of HSR-903 was not affected by the medium, the inoculum size, or the addition of serum, but decreased under acidic conditions, as did those of the other quinolones tested. HSR-903 exhibited rapid bactericidal action and had a good postantibiotic effect on S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. HSR-903 inhibited supercoiling by DNA gyrase from Escherichia coli, but it was much less active against human topoisomerase II.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of novel oral carbapenem DZ-2640.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of DZ-2640, against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was compared with those of penems and cephalosporins currently available. MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of the compound for clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were 0.10, 25, and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and of penicillin-susceptible and -insusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.006, 0.025, and 0.20 microg/ml, respectively, and MIC90s of the compound were 6.25 and >100 microg/ml for Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, respectively. MIC90s of DU-6681a were 0.20, 0.10, and 0.025 microg/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC50 and MIC90 of DU-6681a were 25 and 50 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a activity was not affected by different media, varied inoculum size (10(4) to 10(7) CFU), or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions against gram-negative bacteria, under alkaline conditions against gram-positive bacteria, and in human urine, as was the activity of the other antibiotics tested. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DU-6681a was less than or equal to those of the reference compounds. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the bactericidal action of DU-6681a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and H. influenzae.
TI  - Development of provisional disc diffusion breakpoints for testing quinupristin/dalfopristin.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin is an injectable streptogramin with broad activity against many Gram-positive bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. Although a number of studies have reported the MICs of this compound against a variety of bacteria, there are no published reports of disc diffusion testing. We tested total disc masses of 7.5 and 15 micrograms with varying ratios of the component compounds, quinupristin and dalfopristin, combined in the following quinupristin: dalfopristin ratios (in microgram): 7.5:0, 0:7.5, 10:5, 5:10, 5:2.5 and 2.5:5. Zone diameters and MICs were determined in parallel for 44 isolates of staphylococci, 47 isolates pneumococci and 64 isolates of enterococci. Control strains were included for each species tested, including a strain of Enterococcus faecalis with known resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin. Using tentative definitions for quinupristin/dalfopristin of < or = 2 mg/L as susceptible and > or = 4 mg/L as resistant, each of the four discs containing ratios of both component compounds separated presumptive susceptible organisms from resistant ones better than either quinupristin or dalfopristin alone. The best correlation of zone sizes and MICs for predicting susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin at an MIC of < or = 2 mg/L was achieved with the 5 micrograms:10 micrograms disc and a zone diameter of > or = 18 mm. These criteria may be useful for identifying organisms that are presumptively susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin.
TI  - In-vitro bactericidal activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin alone and in combination against resistant strains of Enterococcus species and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - In-vitro activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a semisynthetic injectable streptogramin, and vancomycin were compared against multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and a methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Combinations of quinupristin/dalfopristin and/or vancomycin with ofloxacin or gentamicin were evaluated using the chequerboard technique. The only synergy observed was that between quinupristin/dalfopristin plus vancomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin plus gentamicin against E. faecium (FIC index < 0.5). Time-kill curves were performed over 24 h with an inoculum of 1 x 10(7) cfu/mL and clinically achievable concentrations of quinupristin/dalfopristin, vancomycin, ofloxacin and gentamicin (6, 30, 5 and 5 mg/L, respectively). In time-kill studies, combinations of quinupristin/dalfopristin plus vancomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin plus gentamicin were additive, not synergic, against E. faecium and achieved 99.9% killing in 21.2 h and 19.6 h, respectively. None of the combination regimens suppressed the regrowth of E. faecalis. Quinupristin/dalfopristin combined with vancomycin demonstrated consistent synergy against ATCC 25923 and the MRSA, achieving 99.9% killing in 12.1 h and 11.9 h, respectively. Overall, quinupristin/dalfopristin alone demonstrated inhibitory activity against E. faecium, but not against E. faecalis, and bactericidal activity was achieved only with quinupristin/dalfopristin in combination with vancomycin or gentamicin against E. faecium. Quinupristin/dalfopristin plus vancomycin was the most potent and reliable combination against both strains of S. aureus in time-kill studies.
TI  - Microbiological cultures of heart valves and valve tags are not valuable for patients without infective endocarditis who are undergoing valve replacement.
AB  - We evaluated the significance of the results of microbiological cultures of heart valves and identification tags from newly inserted prosthetic valves that were removed from patients with valvular heart disease; none of these patients had a preoperative diagnosis of endocarditis. We reviewed the charts of patients with positive cultures for evidence of infections before or after surgery. Cultures were positive for 11.9% of 219 valves (206 native valves and 13 prosthetic or bioprosthetic valves) and 11.6% of 224 tags. The most common isolates were coagulase-negative staphylococci. Typical agents of endocarditis--viridans streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus--were cultured from five specimens, and Mycobacterium avium complex was identified in six valves. None of the patients with positive valve or tag cultures developed postsurgical endocarditis or wound infection. Findings on histopathologic examination of the valves were not consistent with endocarditis. We conclude that the results of cultures of valves from patients without preoperative diagnoses of endocarditis lack clinical significance, and positive tag cultures are not predictive of postsurgical infection. Positive cultures are most likely a result of contamination during surgery or thereafter.
TI  - Periodontal microflora of HIV infected patients with periodontitis.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the microbial profile of periodontal lesions in HIV seropositive patients and to compare it with rapidly progressing periodontal lesions in systemically healthy patients. The subgingival microflora of 20 CDC II, 20 CDC III, 20 CDC IV/V and 20 systemically healthy patients with rapidly progressing periodontitis was examined. Four sites with greatest probing depth in each patient were selected for microbiological sampling. The samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. The microflora of periodontitis lesions within the three stages of the HIV infection was similar to that of progressing periodontitis in systemically healthy adults including Campylobacter rectus, Capnocytophaga spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Selenomonas spp. and Peptostreptococcus micros. However, HIV seropositive periodontitis lesions harboured a range of exogenous pathogens rarely associated with common types of periodontitis including Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloaca, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus avium, Clostridium difficile, Aspergillus fumigatus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Mycoplasma incognitum. The lack of immune effector and regulatory cells in HIV infected patients could in fact explain the increase of some opportunistic pathogens and the characteristic and rapidly progressing nature of the periodontal disease in these patients.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). III. Differences in susceptibilities from previous years].
AB  - Susceptibilities to various antimicrobial agents were examined for Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that were isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 11 hospitals during June, 1995 through May, 1996, and the results were compared with those obtained during the same period in earlier years. 1. Macrolide resistant E. faecalis isolated from uncomplicated UTIs during the latest study period appeared to have increased compared to those in previous study periods. More than 50% of the isolated E. faecalis during the latest study period were resistant to macrolide antibiotics, for the first time in our history. 2. No obvious changes were observed through the years for susceptibilities of S. aureus to various antimicrobial agents. Vancomycin (VCM) showed the highest activity against S. aureus, with MICs below 2 micrograms/ml or below. 3. Among E. coli strains, those with low susceptibilities to quinolones appeared to have increased over the years with MIC90 changed from between 0.125 microgram/ml or below and 0.5 microgram/ml in the 1989-1990 period to between 8 micrograms/ml and 128 micrograms/ml in the latest study period. 4. Klebsiella spp. showed higher resistance to most antimicrobial agents during periods of 1993-1994 and 1994-1995, but somewhat lower resistance during period of 1995-1996. No resistant Klebsiella spp. were detected from uncomplicated UTIs during the latest study period. 5. Among P. aeruginosa isolates from complicated UTIs, resistance isolates to gentamicin appeared to be increasing over the years. Resistant strains to quinolones were isolated at lower frequencies during periods of 1991-1994, but higher frequency was observed in the latest period, and MIC50s were between 0.5 and 4 micrograms/ml during 1991-1994, but were 16-32 micrograms/ml during 1995-1996. These susceptibility changes should be utilized in determining clinical treatments.
TI  - Antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. Rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to RP 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. In studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and RP 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference MIC and MBC tests. No significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. Quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/RP 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and Streptococcus ssp. Enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but E. faecalis, Pasteurella multocida, Pediococcus ssp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (MIC90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). The log phase inoculum was preferred for MBC and kill-curve tests with this combination. The 30:70 ratio in vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. Quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant Gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant E. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of 1-dialkylaminomethyl- 2-(p-substituted phenyl)-5-substituted benzimidazole derivatives.
AB  - 1-(Dialkylaminomethyl)-2-(p-substituted phenyl)-5-substituted benzimidazole derivatives 1 have been synthesized by reacting 2-phenylbenzimidazole derivatives with formaldehyde and a secondary amine. The derivatives of 2-phenylbenzimidazole were obtained by reacting the bisulfide addition product of substituted benzaldehydes with 4-substituted-o-phenylenediamines. Their structures were confirmed by microanalysis, IR and NMR spectral analysis. Antimicrobial activity of the compounds was investigated by the microdilution susceptibility test in Mueller-Hinton Broth and Sabouraud Dextrose Broth was used for the determination of antibacterial and antifungal activities. Test organisms: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 as Gram-positive bacteria, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 as Gram-negative bacteria, and Candida albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. stellatoidea as yeast-like fungi. Compounds 1a, 1b, 1c, 1e and 1i showed slight to moderate activity against all microorganisms. Compound 1g showed the highest activity. It was found more potent than streptomycin against Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo activities of DW-116, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - DW-116 is a novel fluoroquinolone that was two- to four-fold more active than rufloxacin and less active than sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria in vitro. Against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, the in-vivo activity of DW-116 was similar or slightly greater than that of rufloxacin and less than that of sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. ED50 (50% effective dose) values for DW-116 did not correlate with in-vitro MICs.
TI  - The activity of the methylpiperazinyl fluoroquinolone CG 5501: a comparison with  other fluoroquinolones.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of CG 5501 against a wide range of recent clinical isolates was compared with that of three fluoroquinolones. CG 5501 inhibited 90% of the species of the family Enterobacteriaceae at 0.5 mg/L or less, exceptions being Enterobacter spp. (MIC90 2 mg/L) and Serratia spp. (MIC90 4 mg/L). Ninety per cent of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by 16, 4 and 1 mg/L respectively. CG 5501 had high activity against Gram-positive cocci, 90% of staphylococci being inhibited at 2 mg/L. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains were generally ciprofloxacin-resistant yet were all susceptible to 4 mg/L or less of CG 5501. Isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae were eight-fold more susceptible to CG 5501 (MIC90 0.5 mg/L) than to ciprofloxacin (MIC90 4 mg/L) and the former had a similar activity to that of trovafloxacin and sparfloxacin. Enterococcus faecalis was generally two- to four-fold more susceptible to CG 5501 or trovafloxacin than to ciprofloxacin. CG 5501 and trovafloxacin had high activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90 0.25 mg/L). Five strains of Chlamydia spp. were inhibited by < or =0.12 mg/L of CG 5501; sensitive and multiresistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were inhibited by < or =0.5 mg/L of CG 5501. The high activity and breadth of its antibacterial spectrum suggests that CG 5501 should be useful in a wide range of clinical infections.
TI  - [Bacteraemia in patients with HIV disease: aetiological spectrum and profile of antimicrobial susceptibility].
AB  - A retrospective survey of non-opportunistic bacterial pathogens isolated from blood cultures of patients with HIV disease has been carried out for a 6-year period, and the antibiotic susceptibility of the 748 microorganisms cultured from 682 consecutive patients, has been evaluated. Gram-positive organisms significantly prevailed over gram-negative ones, with Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Xantomonas maltophilia, Salmonella and Pseudomonas sp. as the most common isolates, and Rhodococcus equi, Serratia, Acinetobacter and Alcaligenes sp. as emerging pathogens. Useful suggestions may be obtained for empiric antimicrobial treatment of suspected sepsis in HIV-infected patients, from the evaluation of the antibiotic susceptibility profile of these non-opportunistic bacterial pathogens.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 704 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 11 hospitals during the period of June 1995 to May 1996. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 microgram/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) and piperacillin (PIPC) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA VCM showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml against both S. aureus and MRSA. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. The other except minocycline (MINO) had very low activities with the MIC90S of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and MINO showed the strongest activities against S. epidermidis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 0.25 microgram/ml. VCM was also active with the MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of cephems ranged from 2 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they ranged from 8 micrograms/ml to 128 micrograms/ml in 1995. These results indicated that some resistances existed among S. epidermidis to cephems. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except gentamicin (GM) were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, cefmenoxime (CMX), IPM, erythromycin (EM), clindamycin (CLDM) and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 2 micrograms/ml or below. 5. Citrobacter freundii IPM showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. GM was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Cefpirome (CPR), cefozopran (CZOP) and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CMX, CPR and CZOP showed low activities with MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. MINO and tosufloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CPR and CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Escherichia coli. Most of the antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. CMX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Penicillins were slightly active with MIC90S of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. Carumonam (CRMN) had the strongest activity against K. pneumoniae, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. Comparing with the result of 1994, the sensitivities of K. pneumoniae against all drugs had obviously changed into a better state. For example, the MIC90S of cephems ranged from 0.25 microgram/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they were all lower than 2 micrograms/ml in 1995. 9. Proteus mirabilis P. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), and CRMN showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis isolated from patients with UTIs. MICs of CRMN for all
TI  - The effect of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) on bacterial translocation in the splenectomized rat.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: We created a study group in order to investigate the effects of  splenectomy and filgrastim. Filgrastim is an immunomodulator granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), that affects bacterial translocation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created 3 study groups with 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats; the first group included sham splenectomy, the second group was splenectomy, and the third group was splenectomy+ filgrastim group. RESULTS: The mean bacterial colony count of the cecum were 2.5 x 10(9) in group 1, 1.2 x 10(10) in group 2 and 3.5 x 10(9) in group 3. The differences between these groups were accepted as statistically significant. The mean counts of the terminal ileum were 1.1 x 10(9) in group 1, 5.5 x 10(10) in group 2 and 2.5 x 10(10) in group 3. The p values of group 1-2 were 0.036 (statistically significant) and 0.123 in groups 2-3) were not statistically significant. The mean counts of the liver were 0.2 x 10(4), 1 x 10(10) and 3.4 x 10(5), respectively. In comparison of the groups the p values of the first and last 2 groups were found to be 0.047 (statistically significant). The mean counts of the mesenteric lymph node were 0.7 x 10(3), 1 x 10(10) and 0.9 x 10(6) respectively. The p values were 0.343 for the first and the last 2 groups both. As they were above 0.05, they were not statistically significant. The degrees of liver Kupffer cell hyperplasia were (+) 40%, (+2) 50% and (+3) 10% (group 1), (+) 10%, (+2) 40% and (+3) 50% (group 2), (+2) 60% and (+3) 40% (group 3) (p = 0.0039). The rates of the absence of pathology in mesenteric lymph nodes were 70% (group 1), 90% (group 2) and 100% (group 3) (p = 0.049). These findings were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: We found that splenectomy has activated the whole predisposing factors of bacterial translocation and created the latter itself. In addition, we showed that filgrastim, a recently widespread used G-CSF, decreases bacterial translocation significantly.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of RP59500 (quinupristin/dalfopristin), CL 329,998, CL 331,002, trovafloxacin, clinafloxacin, teicoplanin and vancomycin against Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro activities of five investigational antibiotics, RP59500 (a semisynthetic injectable streptogramin), CL 329,998 and CL 331,002 (two new glycylcyclines), trovafloxacin (a naphthyridone), and clinafloxacin (a dihalogenated quinolone), were examined and compared with those of minocycline, teicoplanin and vancomycin against 190 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci. The MICs for RP59500 against all isolates with the exception of Enterococcus faecalis were low. RP59500 was bactericidal against all except enterococcal isolates. CL 329,998 and CL 331,002 were significantly more active than minocycline against oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90 0.25 versus 8 mg/L) and all enterococcal isolates (MIC90 0.125 versus 16 mg/L). Clinafloxacin was the most active agent against all staphylococcal isolates and was bactericidal. Trovafloxacin showed good activity against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci and alpha-haemolytic streptococci (MIC90 < or = 0.125 mg/L). This study demonstrates the potential of the five investigational antibiotics as therapeutic agents for infections caused by Gram-positive cocci.

TI  - [Nationwide survey of susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1992].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents in 144 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1992. In this study, the isolates were identified and susceptibility tests were performed at individual laboratories. The susceptibility tests were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS. S. aureus (including MRSA) strains were highly susceptible to arbekacin (ABK) and netilmicin (NTL). S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were susceptible to most of the agents tested. E. faecalis were highly susceptible to penicillins and imipenem (IPM). P. aeruginosa showed high susceptibility to ceftazidime (CAZ), IPM and amikacin (AMK). Annual changes in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns over 5 years (1988-1992) were examined. The frequency of sensitive strains of S. aureus to methicillin (DMPPC) has slightly increased from 1991 to 1992. A moderate increases of PCG-insensitive S. pneumoniae was observed. B. fragilis group showed a slight increase in sensitivity to minocycline (MINO) but no yearly changes in IPM sensitivity was observed.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between July 1995 and June 1996].
AB  - Isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from July  1994 to June 1995 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. One hundred and sixty-four strains were isolated from primary infections, and 202 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while from post operative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by that of Staphylococcus aureus from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-negative, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella spp. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. We noticed that MICs of cefazolin against three out of 23 strains of E. coli were higher than 100 micrograms/ml. Among anaerobic bacteria, there were many resistant strains against penicillins and cephems with MICs higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and the same trend was observed among other Bacteroides spp. and Prevotella spp.
TI  - [A clinical study of skin flora in patients with MRSA colonization after introduction of preventive measures of hospital infection in a geriatric ward].
AB  - In early 1980's methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was reported as a major pathogenic organism of geriatric hospital infection in Japan. At the same time in the geriatric hospital MRSA infection was prevalent. To decrease nosocomial infections some active preventive measures against hospital infection were taken since Oct. 1991. After introduction of preventive measures of hospital infection in the geriatric ward (190 beds) nosocomial bacteremia and pneumonia were markedly decreased in comparison of episode number before introduction of prevention. However several patients with MRSA colonization were observed every month. The aim of this clinical study was to clear how frequent MRSA was isolated from skin. Consequently 3 strains (3.4%) of MRSA were observed in 86 cultured skin. In conclusion we considered frequency of MRSA colonization frequency of MRSA colonization on skin was not so high but rather very low under the preventive measures.
TI  - In vitro activity and spectrum of LY333328, a novel glycopeptide derivative.
AB  - Reference methods were used to determine the potency of LY333328, a semisynthetic glycopeptide derivative with a key N-alkylation substitution, against 833 strains (393 gram-positive strains and representative gram-negative bacilli) with various defined resistance mechanisms. The MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90S) (in micrograms per milliliter) of LY333328 and the percentages of strains at < or = 8 micrograms/ml were as follows: for oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 2 and 100%, and for oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 4 and 100%; for oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermis, 4 and 100%, and for oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 8 and 96%; for Streptococcus serogroups A, B, C, and G, 0.25 to 1 and 100%; for Streptococcus pneumoniae < or = 0.015 to 0.06 and 100%; for Enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 100%; and for vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium, 0.25 and 100%, and for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, 4 and 100%. LY333328 was not active (MIC50, > or = 16 micrograms/ml) against more than 400 representative strains of Enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonads, Acinetobacter spp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, pathogenic Neisseria spp., and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. Gram-positive anaerobes were LY333328 susceptible (MICs, < or = 2 micrograms/ml). Test methods and conditions may have affected MICs of LY333328, with most (species variation) agar dilution MICs being greater than the broth microdilution MICs.
TI  - High incidence of antibiotic resistance among bacteria in 4 intensive care units  at a university hospital in Sweden.
AB  - The frequency of antibiotic resistance among bacteria in 4 intensive care units (ICUs) at a university hospital in Sweden was investigated annually from 1993 to 1996. An increase in ampicillin-resistant enterococci from 1993 to 1995 was seen which was due to a shift from Enterococcus faecalis to Enterococcus faecium. After a special infection control programme was instituted, the rate of ampicillin resistance among enterococci and the number of E. faecium isolates declined during 1996. The oxacillin resistance rates for Staphylococcus aureus were < or = 2%, while most of the coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were oxacillin resistant. No vancomycin-resistant enterococci or staphylococci were seen. The ciprofloxacin resistance rate for CNS and Enterococci spp. were high. Relatively, high levels of resistance to cefotaxime and piperacillin/tazobactam among Enterobacter spp. were also seen. During 1995 and 1996 Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed increasing resistance to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam. This was due to an outbreak among rather few patients. The overall resistance rates for Gram-negative bacteria were low for aminoglycosides and imipenem. From 1993 to 1996 the total antibiotic consumption decreased by 27% in the whole hospital and 16.5% in the ICUs. However, the reduced antibiotic consumption was paralleled with a 23% decrease in the total number of patients treated in the hospital from 1993 to 1996. In contrast there was an 11.5% increase in the number of ICU patients treated during this period. The conclusion is that all ICUs within a hospital should have a programme for 'on-line' antibiotic resistance surveillance of drugs used in that unit in order to change the empiric treatment when there is an increase in antibiotic resistance. It is also important to survey the antibiotic consumption in the ICUs in order to avoid further selective pressure on bacteria showing increased resistance rates.
TI  - Multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens. An update on current microbiological patterns.
AB  - Although resistance has developed among Gram-positive pathogens to penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, quinolones and macrolides, the glycopeptides seem to remain largely unaffected. However, the recent emergence and range of glycopeptide resistance in enterococci, well documented in the USA but not in the rest of the world, have prompted this European surveillance study. The European Glycopeptide Resistance Survey was undertaken in 1995 in 9 countries and involved 70 microbiological centres. The primary aims of the survey were as follows: (i) to perform a microbiological quality assurance assessment to evaluate the ability of participating laboratories to correctly identify the strains and assess their glycopeptide susceptibility; and (ii) to accurately determine the level of glycopeptide resistance among staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci in European hospitals. The in vitro activity of several other antibiotics was assessed on strains isolated from the Italian centres. In total, 7078 Gram-positive isolates were collected in Europe, and national coordinators used the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) agar dilution reference method to successfully retest 96% of these. According to mode minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), teicoplanin activity was similar to that of vancomycin against Staphylococcus aureus. In general, the range of MICs for teicoplanin was wider than that for vancomycin against coagulase-negative staphylococci. Against Enterococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., teicoplanin was 4 times more active than vancomycin. The greatest number of glycopeptide refractory organisms was evident among enterococci; resistance was observed to be approximately 10 times more frequent in Enterococcus faecium than in E. faecalis. The results from the Italian isolates were similar to those from the overall study. In particular, teicoplanin was 2- to 8-fold more active than vancomycin against the majority of the enterococci. The incidence of enterococcal resistance was lower in Italy (0.6% for teicoplanin and 0.9% for vancomycin) than in Europe (1.7% for teicoplanin and 2.3% for vancomycin). This extensive survey confirms that teicoplanin is more active than vancomycin against enterococci and streptococci, and that both display similar potency against staphylococci.
TI  - Cell-cell communication in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - In gram-positive bacteria, many important processes are controlled by cell-to-cell communication, which is mediated by extracellular signal molecules produced by the bacteria. Most of these signaling molecules are peptides or modified peptides. Signal processing, in most cases, involves either transduction across the cytoplasmic membrane or import of the signal and subsequent interaction with intracellular effectors. Concentrations of signal in the nanomolar range or below are frequently sufficient for biological activity. The microbial processes controlled by extracellular signaling include the expression of virulence factors, the expression of gene transfer functions, and the production of antibiotics.

TI  - Validation of Etest for seven antimicrobial agents using regulatory criteria for  the assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility devices.
AB  - Etest, a stable-gradient antimicrobial susceptibility test method (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden), was compared to the agar dilution method for tests with amikacin, tobramycin, aztreonam, cefdinir, cefprozil, ceftazidime and sparfloxacin. The study design followed recommended guidelines for 510(k) application by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Results demonstrated Etest accuracy (MIC +/- 1.0 log2 dilutions compared to agar dilution MIC) to be 90.4% with only one of 1150 comparisons showing a reproducible variation of 2 log2 dilutions. Categorical equivalency was > or = 92% for all drugs except ceftazidime (82 to 89%), but false-susceptible error was rare (< 0.1%). Etest was very reproducible (100% of results +/- 1.0 log2 dilution) and quality control results conformed to published MIC ranges. The Etest seems to render accurate results for these seven antimicrobial agents evaluated.

TI  - The in-vitro activity of faropenem, a novel oral penem.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of faropenem, a novel oral penem, was studied in comparison with other beta-lactam antimicrobials against 711 recent clinical isolates including Gram-negative, Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. MIC data showed that faropenem was active against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae (MICs < or = 4 mg/L), with reduced activity against Serratia spp. (MIC90 = 32 mg/L). In common with its comparators, faropenem had weak activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC > 128 mg/L). Faropenem was active against staphylococci, although for MRSA MICs were raised (MIC90 = 2 mg/L) compared with those for MSSA (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L). Faropenem was also found to be active against streptococci, Neisseria spp., Enterococcus faecalis and beta-lactamase-producing and non-producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Of the anaerobic bacteria studied, faropenem was most active against peptostreptococci and Clostridium perfringens (MIC90 < or = 1 mg/L) and Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90 = 4 mg/L). An increase in inoculum from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu raised faropenem MICs for Morganella morganii from 0.06-1 mg/L to 2-4 mg/L and for MRSA from 0.25-2 mg/L to 8 mg/L (a similar increase was not observed for MSSA). The MICs of faropenem were not affected by the presence of either 20% or 70% (v/v) serum. MICs for faropenem to 11 well characterized beta-lactamase producers were similar to those of non-producers. In hydrolysis studies, faropenem was shown to be highly stable to a number of beta-lactamases, including TEM-1, SHV-1, the extended spectrum beta-lactamases, TEM-3 and TEM-9, and the beta-lactamase produced by Staphylococcus aureus (NCTC 11561).
TI  - Bacterial strains isolated from eggs and their resistance to currently used antibiotics: is there a health hazard for consumers?
AB  - In order to study the putative transfer of antibiotic resistance from poultry to  humans, hens' eggs were examined for the presence of various pathogens. Staphylococcus, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Proteus and Pseudomonas spp. were the most frequently isolated genera. Sensitivity tests, performed with the Kirby-Bauer technique, showed the presence of resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (to penicillin-G, tetracycline, erythromycin, clindamycin, cefalosporins, oxacillin, gentamycin, chloramphenicol and tobramycin), Enterococcus faecalis (to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, gentamycin and tetracyclin), Escherichia coli (to tetracycline, erythromycin, ampicillin and cefalosporins), Enterobacter cloacae (to ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavunalic acid, erythromycin and tetracycline), Pseudomonas stutzeri (to erythromycin and chlorampenicol) and Citrobacter freundii (to ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavunalic acid, cefalosporins and co-trimoxazole).
TI  - Microbiology of otitis externa.
AB  - Microbiologic and clinical data from 26 patients with otitis externa were prospectively evaluated. Specimens were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Bacterial growth was noted in 23 specimens. A total of 33 aerobic and 2 anaerobic bacteria were recovered. Aerobic bacteria only were isolated in 21 (91%) patients, anaerobic bacteria only in 1 (4%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 1 (4%). The most common isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14 instances), Staphylococcus aureus (7), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (2), Proteus mirabilis (2), Enterococcus faecalis (2), Bacteroides fragilis (1), and Peptostreptococcus magnus (1). One isolate was recovered in 13 (57%) patients, 2 isolates in 8 (35%), and 3 isolates in 2 (9%). These data illustrate the polymicrobial nature of otitis externa in about half of the patients and the role of anaerobic bacteria in 8% of them. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the therapeutic implications of these findings.

TI  - [Clinically isolated bacterii seen in complicated infections].
AB  - The spectrum of causative bacterial agents responsible for post-operative infections in the surgical field have dramatically changed with time. This could be due to recent technical progress in bacterial extraction or the result of more effective antibiotics used post-operatively. Nevertheless nosocomial infections including those caused by MRSA still demand our close attention. Commonly extracted bacterii include Staphylococcus spp., E. faecalis, E. coli, Klebsiella spp., E. cloacae, P. aeruginosa and Bacteroides spp., but with regards to pathogenicity, extraction frequency and drug resistance, agents requiring the highest note of caution may be MRSA, P. aeruginosa and Bacteroides spp. MRSA is still the bacterium which makes the most frequent appearance in the clinical field, and the only effective antibiotic to MRSA is vancomycin. In addition, P. aeruginosa is the most common bacterial agent seen in post-operative infections and also the agent to which many of the cephem drugs do not express a high degree of antibacterial effect. Furthermore, about half of the Bacteroides spp. are beta-lactamase-producing strains which deactive the effect of penicillin and cephem drugs within the infection site. A drug which proves effective against E. coli may nevertheless become somewhat ineffective against this agent when found in a mixed infection and if the drug lacks stability against beta-lactamase. Clinically, mixed infections including some or even all the above agents are known to occur, continuously drawing our close attention.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of trovafloxacin (CP-99,219).
AB  - Trovafloxacin was found to be a typical quinolone producing a biphasic dose response against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae. A reduced rate of kill was seen against Enterococcus faecalis, which is also typical of the quinolones. However, the bactericidal activity of trovafloxacin against S. aureus and S. pneumoniae was greater than most other quinolones previously tested. The enhanced bactericidal activity of trovafloxacin against S. aureus may be explained by the possession of a very strong bactericidal mechanism B. Trovafloxacin may prove to be a quinolone of choice against S. aureus infections.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of electron rich olefin derived cyclic ureas.
AB  - Seventeen cyclic ureas containing imidazolidine and benzimidazoline nuclei were synthesised by the reaction of electron-rich olefins with appropriate group 16 elements. (O, S, Se, Te). The compounds synthesised were identified by 1H, 13C-NMR, FT-IR and mass spectroscopic techniques and micro analysis. All compounds studied in this work were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against standard strains: Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853). Eight of the compounds were found effective to inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus) at MIC values between 25-400 micrograms/ml. None of the compounds exhibit antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) at the concentrations studied (6.25-800 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Risk of microbial contamination with multiple use of 5-fluorouracil vials.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether microorganisms are able to survive in a solution of 50 mg/ml of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and, therefore, whether there is a risk of vial contamination with multiple use. METHODS: Ten common nosocomial pathogens were tested. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 5-FU were determined for each organism. Organisms were then inoculated into 1 ml of 5-FU (50 mg/ml) and, after timed periods of exposure, were plated onto blood agar and incubated at 37 degrees C. Plates were checked daily for the presence or absence of growth. RESULTS: The MICs of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas cepacia were within one log unit of the 10 mg/ml concentration of 5-FU used by some clinics. After incubation in 5-FU for 1 h, all species survived; after 24 h of exposure, five of the 10 species-Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, K. pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis-were still viable. CONCLUSION: 5-FU has limited bactericidal activity, and there is a risk of contamination if 5-FU vials are used in multiple dose fashion.
TI  - [Serologic study in patients with streptococcal infective endocarditis].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis is a systemic disease in which there are a continuously antigenic stimulation of immunologic system. Streptococcus is still the most frequent cause of infective endocarditis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated the presence of antibody (AB), total and IgM by indirect immune fluorescence technique, in four groups of population: streptococcal infective endocarditis (SIE), streptococcal bacteraemia (SB), Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis, and healthy people. Antigens used were: 1) their own strain isolated from the blood of patients with SIE and SB inverted question markhomologous AB inverted question mark, and; 2) seven species of Streptococcus: Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus sanguis I, Streptococcus sanguis II, nutritional dependent streptococci and Enterococcus faecalis (heterologous AB). RESULTS: Homologous antibodies: titers > or = 1/512 were found in all patients with SIE and only in 2 with SB (sensitivity 100% and specificity 93%). IgM titer (threshold 1/32) was positive only in patients with SIE (sensitivity 75,5% and specificity 100%). The fall of the AB titer was continuous and slow, despite the good clinical evolution of patients. (AB titers were > or = 1/512 and IgM > or = 1/64 in 30% of patients 1 year later). Heterologous AB: in spite of statistically significant difference found in SIE versus the other groups, sensitivity of this test (threshold 1/256) is low, confidence interval include expected random value (50%), specificity is 88%. CONCLUSIONS: The utility of homologous AB for diagnosing infective endocarditis is demonstrated. On the contrary for heterologous AB, antigenic common fractions must be found in the different species.
TI  - Detection of genes regulating beta-lactamase production in Enterococcus faecalis  and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Four beta-lactamase-producing clinical isolates (WH245, WH257, CH570, and DEL) of Enterococcus faecalis were examined for the presence of the staphylococcal beta-lactamase regulatory genes (blaR1 and blaI) by PCR using six primer pairs. All isolates produced small amounts of beta-lactamase constitutively. In WH245, CH570, and DEL, the corresponding regions of the regulatory genes have lost sequences of various lengths. However, the regulatory genes in WH257 appeared to be the same as those in staphylococcal plasmid pI258. The beta-lactamase genes could be transferred to enterococcal and staphylococcal recipients from WH257 and DEL by conjugation or transformation with selection for gentamicin resistance. After transformation, the expression of beta-lactamase from DEL was still constitutive, whereas the gene from WH257 showed inducible expression in Staphylococcus aureus. The gene coding for inducible beta-lactamase production from pI258 showed constitutive expression in E. faecalis. These findings suggest that constitutive beta-lactamase production in E. faecalis is due not only to the absence of functional regulatory genes but to some other factor(s) as well.
TI  - Beta-lactam stability in frozen microdilution PASCO MIC panels using strains with known resistance mechanisms as biosensors.
AB  - The stability of amoxicillin/clavulanate, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, imipenem, and meropenem in PASCO (PASCO System, DIFCO Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) frozen microdilution susceptibility panels stored for 16 weeks at -20 degrees C and -70 degrees C was evaluated. The increase in MIC values for the five American-Type Culture Collection (ATCC) quality control strains for susceptibility testing recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) and for 13 strains with different well-characterized resistance mechanisms was indicative of bioactivity deterioration. The overall agreement (+/- 1 twofold dilution) at purchase between the MIC values of PASCO frozen microdilution susceptibility panels and the standard agar dilution method was 97.7%. Minimum inhibitory concentration values for the associations of amoxicillin/clavulanate and piperacillin/tazobactam remained unchanged for the study period at -70 degrees C. In contrast, a carbapenem bioactivity decrease was detected only with strains having well-characterized resistance mechanisms from the 12th week onwards. At -20 degrees C, antibiotic deterioration with these latter strains was observed earlier than with ATCC strains: the activity of meropenem and imipenem remained unchanged only for the first 2 weeks, while a loss of activity was detected for amoxicillin/clavulanate and piperacillin/tazobactam at the 7th and 10th week, respectively. Cefepime was highly stable both at -20 degrees C and -70 degrees C. Strains with well-characterized resistance mechanisms should be used in routine quality control studies of antibiotic stability for susceptibility testing panels during the storage period.
TI  - Serological investigation of enterococcal infections using western blot.
AB  - To assess the usefulness of Western blot in the diagnosis of enterococcal infections, a pilot study was conducted with a newly developed Western blot using sera from patients with confirmed enterococcal infections. Sera from 17 of 19 patients with enterococcal endocarditis reacted strongly to enterococcal antigens on the Western blot, and most produced specific bands at molecular weights 98 kDa and 54 kDa. Sera from patients with bacteremic cholangitis and pyelonephritis reacted frequently as well, but the pattern of bands was different from that observed with endocarditis. Eighty-five percent of 26 sera tested from patients with bacteremia and associated deep-seated infections (endocarditis, cholangitis, and pyelonephritis) were positive on Western blot, compared to 30% of sera from bacteremic patients with no clinically determined deep focus of infection (p < 0.001).
TI  - Is the ability of urinary tract pathogens to accumulate glycine betaine a factor  in the virulence of pathogenic strains?
AB  - The regulation of intracellular concentrations of organic solutes, including glycine betaine, is an important adaptive response to osmotic stress for Escherichia coli. The clinical significance of glycine betaine to uropathogens is not clear. Clinical isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus, and Enterococcus faecalis accumulated glycine betaine from hyperosmotic media. The addition of glycine betaine to hyperosmotic minimal medium accelerated the growth rates of all species tested except P. mirabilis. However, when clinical strains of E. coli were transferred from urine with low osmolality to hyperosmotic urine, there was no slowing of the growth rate. There was no difference in growth rates of E. coli isolates from acute pyelonephritis, cystitis, and asymptomatic bacteriuria nor from fecal isolates. The ability to accumulate osmolytes, although it may be a factor in the adaptation to hypertonic environments, was not related to virulence.
TI  - Susceptibility of ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci to trovafloxacin.
AB  - The susceptibilities of clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and enterococci obtained over a 13-year period were tested for trovafloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, and ciprofloxacin. For MRSA, MIC50 values for trovafloxacin increased from 0.03 microgram/ml to 1 microgram/ml from 1984-1985 to 1995-1996, but were lower than those noted for ciprofloxacin, which increased from 0.25 microgram/ml to > 8 micrograms/ml during the same period. Trovafloxacin also showed lower MIC50 values (0.12-0.25 microgram/ml) than ciprofloxacin (MIC50 of 0.5-1 microgram/ml) for E. faecalis isolates from 1985 through 1991, but against E. faecium and E. faecalis isolated in 1995-1996, the MIC50 values for both trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin were 2 micrograms/ml and the MIC90 values were > or 8 micrograms/ml. Thus, cross-resistance between fluoroquinolones was shown for both enterococci and MRSA. Whether the greater intrinsic activity of trovafloxacin might allow its use in treating MRSA and enterococcal infections remains to be seen.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between July 1994 and June 1995].
AB  - Isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from July  1994 to June 1995 were investigated by a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. One hundred and fifty-three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 143 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, both anaerobic Gram-positive and-negative bacteria were predominant, and from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was highest, followed by that of Staphylococcus aureus from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Streptococcus intermedius was highest from primary infections, but from postoperative infections anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria was uncommon. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order. From postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by Serratia marcescens and E. coli. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. We have noticed that resistant strains against imipenem and ofloxacin were increasing among P. aeruginosa and resistant strains against cefazolin were increasing among E. coli. MICs of cefazolin against four out of 30 strains of E. coli were higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and MICs of imipenem was higher than 50 micrograms/ml against 5 out of 22 strains of P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Gentamicin resistance gene transfer from Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium to  Staphylococcus aureus, S. intermedius and S. hyicus.
AB  - Transfer of gentamicin resistance from Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium to Staphylococcus aureus, S. hyicus and S. intermedius was accomplished by filter mating. Transfer from E. faecalis was plasmid mediated and a probe to the gentamicin resistance gene aac(6')-aph(2") hybridized to HindIII fragments of various sizes (7.5, 6.2 and 4.7 kbp) of these plasmids. Transfer from E. faecium was apparently to the chromosome in 9 of 10 instances with HindIII fragments of 3.3 or 3.0 kbp hybridizing to the probe. These results are consistent with transposon mediated resistance. Plasmid transfers to S. intermedius were at much lower frequencies than to S. aureus or to S. hyicus but presumed transposon transfer direct to the chromosome was equal in all three species.
TI  - Semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotics derived from LY264826 active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Certain derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic LY264826 with N-alkyl-linked substitutions on the epivancosamine sugar are active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. Six compounds representing our most active series were evaluated for activity against antibiotic-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. For Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin, the MICs of the six semisynthetic compounds for 90% of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2,048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for LY264826. For E. faecium and E. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the MICs were 0.016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1,024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. The compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant leuconostocs and pediococci. The MICs for 90% of the strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. Against methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis MICs ranged from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. The spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. The compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with MICs of < or = 0.008 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. In in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, or S. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times lower than those of vancomycin. Overall, these new glycopeptides, such as LY307599 and LY333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.
TI  - In vitro activity of the trinem sanfetrinem (GV104326) against gram-positive organisms.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the trinem sanfetrinem (formerly GV104326) (GV) was compared with that of vancomycin, ampicillin, and/or nafcillin against 287 gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and multiresistant enterococci, by the agar and microbroth dilution methods. GV demonstrated 2 to 16 times more activity than ampicillin and nafcillin against the majority of these organisms. The MIC range of GV was 16 to 64 micrograms/ml for 19 Enterococcus faecium strains that were highly resistant to ampicillin (ampicillin MIC range, 64 to 512 micrograms/ml) and vancomycin resistant and 0.25 to 32 micrograms/ml for resistant Rhodococcus spp. Similar activities (+/-1 dilution) were observed by either the agar or the broth microdilution method. GV demonstrated bactericidal activity against a beta-lactamase-producing Enterococcus faecalis strain and against two methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains in 10(5)-CFU/ml inocula. Synergy between GV and gentamicin was observed against an E. faecalis strain that lacked high-level gentamicin resistance. The activity of GV suggests this compound warrants further study.
TI  - Antagonism of teicoplanin and vancomycin activity by chocolatized Mueller-Hinton  agar.
AB  - Chocolatized (80 degrees C, 13 min) Mueller-Hinton agar antagonized the inhibitory activities of teicoplanin and vancomycin against reference strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. This antagonism was due to heat-exposed sheep erythrocytes, sheep hemoglobin, and the supernatant fluid from lysed sheep erythrocytes, but not to sheep serum. Neither water-soluble cholesterol, bovine albumin, bovine serum, hematin, hemin nor egg yolk suspension antagonized teicoplanin and vancomycin.
TI  - Quinupristin-dalfopristin (RP 59500): an injectable streptogramin combination.
AB  - The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, activity, and potential clinical role of quinupristin-dalfopristin (RP 59500) are described. Quinupristin-dalfopristin is the first injectable formulation of the streptogramin antibiotics. Streptogramin drug products are each composed of two chemically distinct compounds, which when administered together act synergistically by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. Quinupristin-dalfopristin has shown activity in vitro against many strains of streptococci and staphylococci, including methicillin- and erythromycin-resistant strains of staphylococci. The combination is more active against Enterococcus faecium than Enterococcus faecalis. It has also shown activity in vitro against certain gram-negative organisms and anaerobes. The mean maximum blood concentration at the end of a one-hour infusion ranged from 0.95 mg/L for a 1.4-mg/kg dose to 24.2 mg/L for a 29.4-mg/kg dose; there was a linear correlation between dose and mean area under the concentration-time curve. Mean half-life ranged from 1.27 to 1.53 hours. The drug is under investigation in the United States in Phase III trials. Of 60 evaluable patients with documented bacteremia involving E. faecium resistant to vancomycin, 40 (67%) had a favorable clinical response. Of 11 patients with bacteremia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 78% had a favorable response. The efficacy of quinupristin-dalfopristin in treating resistant infections has also been suggested by smaller studies and case reports. The drug may be useful in the prophylaxis of endocarditis. Adverse reactions are generally mild and transient. Quinupristin-dalfopristin may be useful in treating serious gram-positive infections, but more clinical study is needed.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of nine antistaphylococcal agents against 275 recent isolates of Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the in vitro activities of 9 antistaphylococcal agents including teicoplanin (TEI) against 275 non-repetitive clinical strains representing 15 species of staphylococci and 27 strains of Enterococcus (E.) faecalis, isolated from various specimens between 1991-1992 at a Canadian teaching hospital. The NCCLS agar dilution method was used (10(4) colonyforming units/spot). In terms of MIC(90), TEI and vancomycin (VAN) appeared to be the most potent antibiotics against all staphylococci tested (TEI: 2.0-4.0 mug/ml; VAN: 1.0-2.0 mug/ml; ciprofloxacin (CPF): 0.25-32 mug/ml; cefazolin (CEF): 8.0-256 mug/ml; methicillin (MET): 2.0->256 mug/ml; imipenem (IMP): 1.0-32 mug/ml; erythromycin (ERT): 16->256 mug/ml; ampicillin (AMP): 16-128 mug/ml; fusidic acid (FSA): 0.5-16 mug/ml). Multiple resistant strains, including MET-resistant Staphylococcus (Staph.) aureus and Staph. epidermidis, were susceptible to TEI and VAN with respective MICs of 2-4 mug/ml and 1-2 mug/ml regardless of specimen type. Moreover, TEI was highly active against E. faecalis (MIC(90) for TEI and VAN: 0.5 and 4.0 mug/ml, respectively).
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of carbene complexes of rhodium(I) and ruthenium(II).
AB  - Twenty-four carbene-rhodium(I), carbene-ruthenium(II) complexes and related compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against the Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213) and Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudmonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853). The compounds 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 16, 18 and 19 were found very effective to inhibit the growth of Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus at the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 5, 25, 5, 50, 25, 24, 24, 24, 6.25and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. The compounds 6, 10, 12, 14, 15 and 17 were significantly effective against Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus with MIC values of 100-200 micrograms/ml. The compounds 2, 6 and 11 were also significantly effective against Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with MIC values of 200-400 micrograms/ml.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of LB10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro activity of LB10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. Against gram-positive bacteria, LB10522 was most active among the compounds tested. It was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. LB10522 was highly effective against most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested. Ninety percent of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. These activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, LB10522 with a MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus giorgio, Streptococcus pneumoniae III, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E, Escherichia coli 851E, Proteus mirabilis 1315E, Serratia marcescens 1826E, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus Ac-54. LB10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as TEM-3, TEM-7, SHV-1, FEC-1, and P-99. LB10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in Enterobacter cloacae 1194E, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. Time-kill study showed that LB10522, at concentrations of two or four times the MIC, had a rapid bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus 6538p, Escherichia coli 851E, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E.
TI  - Proposed MIC quality control guidelines for National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards susceptibility tests using seven veterinary antimicrobial agents: ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, florfenicol, penicillin G-novobiocin, pirlimycin, premafloxacin, and spectinomycin.
AB  - The present multicenter study proposes broth microdilution quality control (QC) ranges for the antimicrobial agents ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, florfenicol, penicillin G-novobiocin, pirlimycin, premafloxacin, and spectinomycin, which are used in veterinary practice. Six separate laboratories tested replicates of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS)-recommended QC organisms (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212) on medium lots both common and unique to all laboratories. The proposed ranges were within 3 or 4 log2 dilution steps of the modal MICs for all organism-antimicrobial agent pairs, depending on their MIC distributions. With > or = 94.7% of all MIC results being within the proposed QC ranges, all combinations tested comply with NCCLS guidelines and all have been accepted by the NCCLS subcommittee developing susceptibility testing procedures for veterinary laboratories.
TI  - Influence of lipoteichoic acid structure on recognition by the macrophage scavenger receptor.
AB  - Lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) belong to the immunostimulatory class of molecules of gram-positive bacteria (GPB). Previous investigations showed that the macrophage scavenger receptor (SR), a glycosylated trimeric transmembrane protein, binds directly to many GPB, possibly via LTA. SR binding to other ligands is dependent upon the spatial characteristics of the repeating negative charge of the ligand. We therefore investigated SR recognition of LTA species with various charge densities and distributions by determining the capacity of these LTAs to compete with the binding of metabolically labeled SR to beads coated with the known SR ligand polyguanylic acid. Staphylococcus aureus LTA, a classical LTA type (unbranched 1,3-linked polyglycerophosphate chain covalently bound to a membrane diacylglyceroglycolipid), had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for inhibition of SR binding of 0.84 microg/ml. When the S. aureus LTA was rendered more negatively charged by removal of ester-linked alanine from the polyglycerophosphate backbone, the IC50 dropped to 0.23 microg/ml. Other polyglycerophosphate LTAs from Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus hirae, Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria welshimeri, and Streptococcus sanguis showed IC50S of 0.5 to 2.1 microg/ml, supporting the role of negative charge in binding to SR. Accordingly, the zwitterionic LTA of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Clostridium innocuum LTA substituted with positively charged sugar residues had no binding capacity. Monoglycerophosphate branches, but not succinyl ester, affected binding of lipoglycans. The data presented above parallel the previous findings for whole organisms and support the role of surface-associated LTA as a major ligand of GPB for binding to SR. Whether binding of LTA and whole GPB to macrophages initiates uptake and degradation or results in signal transduction remains to be determined.
TI  - [Determination of serum aminoglycoside and vancomycin concentrations by the microbiological method in the presence of other antimicrobials].
AB  - The determination of serum concentrations of antimicrobials with a narrow therapeutic range by microbiological method requires some modifications when the patient is under combined antimicrobial therapy. The methodological conditions for the appraisal of aminoglycosides and vancomycin in the presence of other drugs were evaluated by using strains with selective sensitivity to the antimicrobial to be tested or by the adding crude extracts of beta-lactamases for the inactivation of the beta-lactam antimicrobials. These beta-lactamases were obtained from Enterobacter cloacae P99 (derepressed mutant) cultures for the inactivation of penicillins and first, second and third generation cephalosporins, as well as from Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia M 1484 cultures for the hydrolysis of imipenem. The strains allowing vancomycin appraisal and indifferent to the synergic activity of other drugs in the mixture were S. aureus M 2120, when the accompanying antimicrobials were gentamicin, ciprofloxacin or rifampicin, and E. faecalis M 2113, E. avium M 2091 and S. aureus M 2101 when the drugs in the mixture were amikacin, lincomycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, respectively. For the appraisal of gentamicin in the presence of vancomycin or fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin), E. coli M 1376 was the most suitable strain, while the use of K. pneumoniae ATCC 10031 was required for the appraisal of amikacin or netilmicin. When rifampicin was the accompanying antimicrobial, E. coli M 1495 turned out more adequate. E. coli M 1462 proved to be more satisfactory for gentamicin, amikacin and netilmicin dosages in samples also containing chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or tetracycline.
TI  - Purification, partial characterisation and mode of action of enterococcin EFS2, an antilisterial bacteriocin produced by a strain of Enterococcus faecalis isolated from a cheese.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis strain EFS2, isolated from the surface of a traditional cheese, produced a bacteriocin active against Gram-positive bacteria including Listeria spp. and some Staphylococcus aureus strains. The bacteriocin, named enterococcin EFS2, has been purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulphate precipitation and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The molecular weight was determined by mass spectrometry to be 7149.6. The amino acid composition of enterococcin EFS2 revealed that it contained 67 amino acid residues and had a blocked amino-terminal end. Enterococcin EFS2 induced viability loss, efflux of K+ ions and ATP, and cell lysis. Kinetic study of bactericidal activity of enterococcin EFS2 on Listeria innocua strain LIN11 indicated slower cell destruction than by nisin. At pH 7.0, the activity of enterococcin EFS2 was the highest at 35 degrees C and was lost at 15 degrees C. The bacteriocin was more active against L. innocua strain LIN11 in broth adjusted to pH 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0 than to pH 4.5 at 30 degrees C.
TI  - Novel method for assessing postantibiotic effect by using the Coulter counter.
AB  - To study postantibiotic effect, viable counts are routinely acquired by the pour  plate technique. However, this technique is laborious and time-consuming; the required sample dilutions also cause excessive errors and material wastage. A new total cell counting technique in which a Coulter counter is used to obtain more efficient postantibiotic effect measurements has been developed.
TI  - Douglas-fir root-associated microorganisms with inhibitory activity towards fungal plant pathogens and human bacterial pathogens.
AB  - A microbial culture collection composed of 1820 bacterial strains, including 298  actinomycete strains, was established from the roots of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) seedlings harvested from conifer nurseries and forest sites. Two hundred and thirty-four strains inhibited the growth of Fusarium, Cylindrocarpon, and (or) Pythium spp. in in vitro assays. A significantly greater proportion of bacterial strains from actinomycete genera exhibited antifungal properties compared with bacterial strains from nonactinomycete genera. Eighty-nine percent of identified inhibitory strains were Streptomyces, Streptoverticillium, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, or Burkholderia species. The actinomycete species were isolated almost exclusively from forest seedlings. Recovery of inhibitory strains representing 29 microbial species was enhanced using a variety of methods to isolate microorganisms from the roots of seedlings from nursery and forest sites. Bacterial strains (including actinomycete strains) with antifungal activity were tested for in vitro growth inhibition of six clinical human bacterial pathogens (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Forty-eight percent of the tested strains inhibited one or more human pathogens, Inhibitory activity towards fungal and bacterial pathogens was strain specific, not species specific, and many inhibitory strains exhibited broad-spectrum activity. Strains with antifungal activity against several conifer root pathogens were also more likely to inhibit multiple species of clinical bacterial pathogens.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1994). III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - Susceptibilities of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia spp. isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during June 1994 to May 1995 to various antimicrobial agents were compared with those in the same period of previous years according to a classification, uncomplicated UTIs, complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, and complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter. No remarkable changes were found in susceptibilities of Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp. and Serratia spp. The susceptibilities of E. faecalis to amikacin and quinolones were better than those in 1993. As for S. aureus, susceptible strains to all drugs increased in uncomplicated UTIs. Against E. coli in 1993, the antimicrobial activities of piperacillin, cefotiam and aminoglycosides have decreased, however, in 1994, these activities have turned to the better state. As for Klebsiella spp. susceptible strains to ABPC decreased. The susceptibilities of P. mirabilis to all drugs except minocycline were good. Against P. aeruginosa in 1993, the activities of aminoglycosides have decreased, but, in 1994, these activities have turned to the better state. These data should be considered in clinical treatment of various urinary tract infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Paliurus spina-christi Mill. (Christ's thorn).
AB  
TI  - Synergistic induction of tumor necrosis factor alpha by bacterial lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid in combination with polytetrafluoroethylene particles in a murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7.
AB  - The induction of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) by polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) particles (5-50 microns) and by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) was examined in RAW cell cultures. Twenty-four-hour culture supernatants from the treated and control cells were assayed for TNF-alpha using a mouse L929 cell cytotoxicity assay. Untreated RAW cells produced low levels of endogenous TNF-alpha in the culture supernatants. Addition of 0.5 ng to 1 microgram/ mL LPS or 1 ng to 1 microgram/ml LTA increased the TNF-alpha production by 7-3570-fold and 2-815-fold, respectively. Addition of 1-5 mg PTFE increased the TNF-alpha production by 6-17-fold over the untreated control cell levels. The cells exposed to PTFE and 0.5 ng/mL LPS or 5 ng/mL LTA produced TNF-alpha levels that were significantly higher than those produced by any inducer alone. Thus, both LTA, a Gram-positive bacterial cell wall component and LPS, a Gram-negative bacterial cell wall component, can induce TNF-alpha production, which is further enhanced by PTFE particles in RAW cells.
TI  - In vivo activities of U-100592 and U-100766, novel oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  - The Upjohn oxazolidinones, U-100592 and U-100766, are orally bioavailable synthetic antimicrobial agents with spectra of activity against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens. In several mouse models of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, U-100592 and U-100766 yielded oral 50% effective doses (ED50) ranging from 1.9 to 8.0 mg/kg of body weight, which compared favorably with vancomycin subcutaneous ED50 values of 1.1 to 4.4 mg/kg. Similarly, both compounds were active versus a Staphylococcus epidermidis experimental systemic infection. U-100592 and U-100766 effectively cured an Enterococcus faecalis systemic infection, with ED50 values of 1.3 and 10.0 mg/kg, and versus a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infection in immunocompromised mice, both drugs effected cures at 12.5 and 24.0 mg/kg. Both compounds were exceptionally active in vivo against penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, with ED50 values ranging from 1.2 to 11.7 mg/kg in systemic infection models. In soft tissue infection models with S. aureus and E. faecalis, both compounds exhibited acceptable curative activities in the range of 11.0 to 39.0 mg/kg. U-100766 was also very active versus the Bacteroides fragilis soft tissue infection model (ED50 = 46.3 mg/kg). In combination-therapy studies, both U-100592 and U-100766 were indifferent or additive in vivo against a monomicrobic S. aureus infection in combination with other antibiotics active against gram-positive bacteria and combined as readily as vancomycin with gentamicin in the treatment of a polymicrobic S. aureus-Escherichia coli infection. U-100592 and U-100766 are potent oxazolidinones active against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens in experimental systemic and soft tissue infections.
TI  - Isolation and structure of staph-cAM373 produced by Staphylococcus aureus that induces conjugal transfer of Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pAM373.
AB  - Enterococus faecalis plasmid pAM373 encodes a mating response to the sex pheromone, cAM373, which is secreted from pAM373-free E. faecalis. cAM373-like activity was detected in a culture filtrate of Staphylococcus aureus. The major active substance, termed staph-cAM373, was isolated, and its structure was identified as a H-Ala-IIe-Phe-IIe-Leu-Ala-Ala-OH heptapeptide.
TI  - Stability of plasmid pHV1431 in free and immobilized cell cultures. Effect of temperature.
AB  - The segregational and structural stability of pHV1431 has been examined in Bacillus subtilis grown at 30 and 37 degrees C in continuous cultures without selection pressure. Immediately after appearance of plasmid-free cells in the reactor, a competition was observed between bacteria that favored plasmid-free cells because of the faster growth. A stronger instability was found at 30 degrees C compared to that at 37 degrees C. At 30 degrees C after 50 hours of culture, 2% of the cells carried the plasmid, whereas at 37 degrees C this percentage was reached after 130 hours. In both cases, no structural instability was observed. To improve the stability, the recombinant Bacillus subtilis (pHV1431) was immobilized in kappa-carrageenan gel beads. In comparison to free cell systems, a higher cell concentration was obtained. Moreover, the plasmid was maintained stable for longer periods; after 150 hours of culture 40% of cells in the reactor still carried the plasmid at both temperatures.
TI  - Direct application of Etest to gram-positive cocci from blood cultures: quick and reliable minimum inhibitory concentration data.
AB  - The Etest was applied directly to 100 Gram-positive bacterial strains from blood  cultures to measure their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Results showed 100% concordance of MIC data between a direct Etest method and the standard Etest method for Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. In addition, direct Etest for Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus faecalis showed 83 to 100% correlation with standard Etests. These data indicate that the Etest is useful to obtain MIC data on Gram-positive cocci (especially streptococci) directly from positive blood cultures. The advantages of a direct Etest are two fold: MIC results can be obtained 24 hours earlier than standard methods and a more representative population of the bacterial isolate is tested.
TI  - The tetracycline resistance gene tet(M) exhibits mosaic structure.
AB  - Tetracycline resistance genes of the M class, tet(M), are typically found on mobile genetic elements as the conjugative transposons of gram-positive bacteria. By comparing the sequences of eight different tet(M) genes (from Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Neisseria), a mosaic structure was detected which could be traced to two distinct alleles. The two alleles displayed a divergence of 8% and a different G/C content. The block structure of these genes provides evidence for the contribution of homologous recombination to the evolution and the heterogeneity of the tet(M) locus. Unlike described cases of chromosomally located mosaic loci, tet(M) is a relatively recently acquired determinant in the species examined and it would appear that mosaic structure within tet(M) has evolved after acquisition of the gene by the mobile genetic elements upon which it is located.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1994). II. Background of patients].
AB  - Clinical background was investigated on 628 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during period from June, 1994 to May, 1995. 1. Distributions of sex, age and urinary tract infections Among over sixties males, the majority was taken by complicated urinary tract infections. Among females, the uncomplicated urinary tract infections was most frequent without a relation of age. As for over 40 females, the increase of complicated UTI was admitted. 2. Distribution of sex, age and pathogens isolated from UTIs In uncomplicated UTIs, Escherichia coli was most frequently isolated without a relation of age, and next Enterococcus faecalis and CNS. In complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E. faecalis were isolated the most frequent. In complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter, P. aeruginosa was most frequently isolated, and next E. faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. 3. Administration of antimicrobial agents and pathogens isolated from UTIs In uncomplicated UTIs, pathogens, after administration of antibiotics, isolated from patients have obviously decreased from 216 to 32 isolates. And also, pathogens of complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, have decreased from 127 to 50 isolates. However, in complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter, pathogens after or before administration of antibiotics, were not revealed an obvious change. 4. Pathogens and UTIs with or without factor and operation In uncomplicated UTIs with or without factor and operation, E. coli was mainly detected. In complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter and with factor and operation E. faecalis was mainly detected, and next E. coli, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Without factor and operation, E. coli was mainly detected. In complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter and with factor and operation, P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis and S. aureus were mainly detected at 23.5%, 15.0%, 15.0%, respectively. Without factor and operation, Proteus spp. 22%, and next E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa 10% and 12%, were detected, respectively. The distribution of pathogens, in the case of Proteus spp. and P. aeruginosa has been obviously varied by the influence of factor and operation.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1994). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 567 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1994 to May 1995. Of the above total bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 26.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 73.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis. Ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Piperacillin (PIPC) and biapenem (BIPM) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA. VCM showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml against both S. aureus and MRSA.

MINO showed the strongest activity against S. epidermidis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 0.25 microgram/ml. ABK was also active with the MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. Cephems were active with the MIC90s of 2 approximately 16 micrograms/ml, but penicillins and quinolones were not so active with the MIC90s and 64 approximately 128 micrograms/ml. 4. Citrobacter freundii. Gentamicin (GM) showed the highest activities against C. freundii isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. IPM was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Cefpirome (CPR) and cefozopran (CZOP) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 5. Enterobacter cloacae. IPM showed the highest activities against E. cloacae. Its MIC90 was 0.5 microgram/ml. GM and amikacin (AMK), ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and tosulfloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except latamoxef (LMOX), cefmenoxime (CMX), CPR and CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90s of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Escherichia coli. Most of antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. CPR, CZOP, IPM, carumonam (CRMN), CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Cefotiam (CTM), flomoxef (FMOX) CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), and LMOX were also active with the MIC90s of 0.25 microgram/ml. Penicillins were not so active with the MIC90s of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Klebsiella pneumoniae. CRMN showed the highest activities against K. pneumoniae. Its MIC90 was < or = 0.125 microgram/ml. CZOP was also active with the MIC90 of 0.25 microgram/ml. Penicillins were not so active with the MIC90s of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. Proteus mirabilis. P. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. CMX, CAZ, LMOX, CRP, cefpodoxime (CPDX), CRMN, CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. MINO was not so active with the MIC90 of 128 micrograms/ml. 9. Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most of the agents were not so active against P. aeruginosa. IPM showed MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. CPFX showed MIC50 of 0.5 microgram/ml.
TI  - An abietane diterpene and two phenolics from Salvia forskahlei.
AB  - From the roots of Salvia forskahlei a new diterpenoid, forskalinone, two new aromatic compounds, the octanol esters of cis- and trans-4-O-methyl-caffeic acid dimers, were isolated together with the known compounds stigmast-3-one, sitosterol and alpha-amyrin. The structures of the new and the known compounds were established by spectral data. The antimicrobial activity of forskalinone and the dimeric cinnamic acid esters was tested against standard bacterial strains and a yeast, namely Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus 6538P, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumonia ATC 4352, Pseudomonus aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, beta-haemolytic Streptococcus and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Forskalinone showed moderate resistance against S. epidermidis (670 micrograms ml-1) and slight activity against E. faecalis (168 micrograms ml-1). trans-4-O-Methyl-caffeic acid dimer octanol ester was inactive while the cis isomer showed a slight activity against C. albicans (156 micrograms ml-1).
TI  - Chromosomal gentamicin resistance transposon Tn3706 in Streptococcus agalactiae B128.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae B128 is the only highly gentamicin-resistant group B streptococcal (GBS) strain described so far. This strain carries a chromosomal gentamicin resistance transposon, designated Tn3706, which is similar, if not identical, to the Tn4001 and Tn5281 transpons detected in Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, respectively. Transposition of Tn3706 occurred onto the GBS plasmid pIP501 in two different loci of its 7.5-kb AvaII fragment carrying the genes for chloramphenicol and erythromycin resistance. Molecular analysis of pIP501 derivatives showed that Tn3706 is composed of a central fragment containing the aac6'-aph2" gene; this fragment is flanked by two tandemly repeated copies of IS256 at the 5' extremity of the resistance gene and a single inverted copy of IS256 at its 3' extremity. The two tandemly repeated copies of IS256 were separated by a 6-bp segment identical to that found, in the same orientation, in the IS256-aac6'-aph2" junction. The hybrid replicons pIP501::Tn3706 were found to be structurally unstable following conjugative transfer between GBS strains. Numerous individual copies of IS256 were detected in B128, but this insertion sequence was not found in the 11 wild-type, gentamicin-susceptible GBS strains studied.
TI  - [Severe orbital cellulitis: therapeutic results in 9 patients and review of the literature].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Orbital cellulitis can produce severe neuromeningeal infections. Modern antimicrobial agents such as imipenem can be a valid therapeutical choice. METHODS: Patients with severe or complicated orbital cellulitis admitted to our hospital from 1986 through 1994 were retrospectively studied. RESULTS: Nine patients with severe orbital cellulitis, seven of them older than 14 years, are reported. Cellulitis was secondary to different forms of sinusitis in five of them. The incriminated microorganisms were: Streptococcus viridans alone or combined to gram negative bacilli (3 cases), Prevotella melaninogenica and other anaerobes (2 cases), Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus (one case each). Three patients developed brain abscesses, one an acute bacterial meningitis and another a subdural empyema. Eight patients underwent a surgical drainage. Seven patients were treated with IV imipenem at doses of 2-3 g/day with complete cure of the orbital cellulitis and of the associated infectious complications and no secondary effects. Two patients died. CONCLUSIONS: Imipenem is an effective antibiotic in the combined medical-surgical treatment of the severe or complicated orbital cellulitis.
TI  - [Multicenter study of isolated micro-organisms resistant to antimicrobials in 10  Portuguese hospitals in 1994].
AB  - In 1994, Microbiology Laboratories of ten Portuguese hospitals analysed isolated  microorganisms found in blood and urine samples and studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of the most frequent bacterial pathogens. From 63780 blood samples, the most frequent were Staphylococcus spp. and from 69189 urine samples significant numbers of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida spp. were isolated. Escherichia coli strains (c.7000) revealed a low percentage of resistance to antibiotics with the exceptions of ampicillin (48%) and co-trimoxazol (25%). Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (c.2000) revealed important resistance to ampicillin (98%), cephalotin (31%), co-trimoxazol (38%) and gentamicin (28%), while values for 3rd generation cephalosporins varied among hospitals, with several strains showing phenotype of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. A great variation in resistance values of P. aeruginosa (c.4000) was found in relation to the antibiotics as well as to the hospitals. Resistance to methicillin in S. aureus (c.6000) was high, reaching an average of 47%, and it was even higher with S. epidermidis (c.3000) and S. haemolyticus (c.650). Only vancomycin was always active against these strains. In E. faecalis (c.2500) resistance was of 2% to ampicillin, 35% to gentamicin, 45% to streptomycin and 1% to vancomycin. E. faecium isolates (c.300) showed the most worrying results with 70% resistance to ampicillin, 42% to gentamicin, 59% to streptomycin and 9% (30 strains isolated in 5 hospitals) to vancomycin. Vancomycin resistant strains were also resistant to all other antibiotics.
TI  - In vitro activities of U-100592 and U-100766, novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agents.
AB  - Oxazolidinones make up a relatively new class of antimicrobial agents which possess a unique mechanism of bacterial protein synthesis inhibition. U-100592 (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-[4-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-piperazinyl]- phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide and U-100766 (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]- 2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide are novel oxazolidinone analogs from a directed chemical modification program. MICs were determined for a variety of bacterial clinical isolates; the respective MICs of U-100592 and U-100766 at which 90% of isolates are inhibited were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant S. aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 and 2 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecium, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; Streptococcus pyogenes, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.50 and 1 microgram/ml; Corynebacterium spp., 0.50 and 0.50 micrograms/ml; Moraxella catarrhalis, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; Listeria monocytogenes, 8 and 2 micrograms/ml; and Bacteroides fragilis, 16 and 4 micrograms/ml. Most strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the gram-positive anaerobes were inhibited in the range of 0.50 to 2 micrograms/ml. Enterococcal strains resistant to vancomycin (VanA, VanB, and VanC resistance phenotypes), pneumococcal strains resistant to penicillin, and M. tuberculosis strains resistant to common antitubercular agents (isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampin, ethionamide, and ethambutol) were not cross-resistant to the oxazolidinones. The presence of 10, 20, and 40% pooled human serum did not affect the antibacterial activities of the oxazolidinones. Time-kill studies demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect of the analogs against staphylococci and enterococci but a bactericidal effect against streptococci. The spontaneous mutation frequencies of S. aureus ATCC 29213 were <3.8 x 10(-10) and <8 x 10(-11) for U-100592 and U-100766, respectively. Serial transfer of three staphylococcal and two enterococcal strains on drug gradient plates produced no evidence of rapid resistance development. Thus, these new oxazolidinone analogs demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activities against a variety of clinically important human pathogens.
TI  - [In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem, a new penem antibiotic].
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem, a new penem, were evaluated in comparison with imipenem (IPM), meropenem (MEPM), ceftazidime (CAZ) and flomoxef (FMOX). Sulopenem had broad and potent antibacterial spectra against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii. Sulopenem showed concentration-dependent bactericidal activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Morphological observation using phase-contrast microscope revealed that sulopenem induced spherical cell formation with E. coli and K. pneumoniae at lower concentrations and bacteriolysis at higher concentrations. Therapeutic efficacies of sulopenem against systemic infections in mice were almost equal to those of imipenem against Streptococcus pneumoniae. While its therapeutic efficacies were superior to those of meropenem, ceftazidime and flomoxef against S. aureus and S. pneumoniae, they were inferior to those of imipenem/cilastatin against S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and A. calcoaceticus.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of a new parenteral penem, sulopenem].
AB  - Eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, Streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, Enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml, Enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, Escherichia coli CS2(R+): 0.10 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, Proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, Proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, Morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, Providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, Serratia marcescens: 1.56 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and Bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. Sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam against Gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria except P. aeruginosa. Sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of PBPs of S. aureus, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, even of P. aeruginosa. Affinities of sulopenem to PBPs-1 and -3 of S. aureus, PBP-2 of E. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (IPM). Sulopenem generally has small Ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to Ia and IIb types of beta-lactamases than IPM. No synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. However, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. The cells of E. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 MIC of sulopenem. Moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-Is. Sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.
TI  - [In vitro and in vivo activities of sulopenem compared with those of imipenem and cephalosporins].
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem (CP-70,429),a new  parenteral penem antibiotic, were compared with those of imipenem (IPM), flomoxef, cefuzonam (CZON) and cefotaxime. Sulopenem possessed broad-spectrum activities against Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria. Antibacterial activities of sulopenem against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were equivalent to or somewhat superior to those of IPM. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, sulopenem was 4- to 260-fold more active than reference antibiotics with broad-spectra. In a killing kinetics study for Haemophilus influenzae, sulopenem showed a 99.9% decrease of viable cells after 8 hours at a concentration of 0.20 micrograms/ml. This effect was obtained at a concentration 8-fold lower than that of IPM. The protective effects of sulopenem in murine experimental systemic infections were superior to those of imipenem/cilastatin. In murine experimental mixed infection with Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis, sulopenem had lower ED50, in other words stronger antimicrobial activities than IPM. The therapeutic effect of sulopenem are related well with its MIC value. In guinea pigs experimental lung infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae, sulopenem was more effective than CZON or cefotiam.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of LB10517, a novel catechol-substituted cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  - LB10517 is a new injectable cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial  activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. LB10517 inhibited 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) at 0.25 mg/L (MIC90), and was 8-fold more active than cefpirome. LB10517 was two- or four-fold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis. Both methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) were highly resistant to all compounds. LB10517 activity against most Enterobacteriaceae was comparable to or greater than that of cefpirome, and it also showed high activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In a mouse septicaemia model, LB10517 exhibited excellent protective effects. In a respiratory tract infection model, the protective effect of LB10517 was comparable to that of cefpirome and ceftazidime. It was highly stable to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases, showing better physiological efficiency for TEM-9 than the other test compounds. LB10517 had the most potent antibacterial activity against beta-lactamase producing resistant strains. LB10517 did not induce beta-lactamase production in Enterobacter cloacae 1194E.
TI  - Ticarcillin/clavulanic acid: determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations against bacterial strains isolated from patients in intensive care units. Comparison with other agents.
AB  - A total of 303 bacterial strains isolated from bronchoaspirates of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients, collected through June and December 1993, were tested for susceptibility to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, imipenem, amikacin, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and piperacillin. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for each antibiotic was determined according to the NCCLS, by means of serial dilution on microplates. The isolates, 80.8% of which were beta-lactamase producing strains, belonged to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (79 strains), Pseudomonas fluorescens (8 strains), Xanthomonas maltophila (25 strains), Escherichia coli (16 strains), Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia (KES) (62 strains), Proteus spp. (15 strains), Acinetobacter spp. (22 strains), Moraxella spp. (15 strains), Bacteroides catarrhalis (8 strains), Haemophilus spp. (11 strains), Staphylococcus aureus (32 strains), Enterococcus faecalis (10 strains). The highest rate of susceptibility to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid (100%) was detected among E. faecalis (MIC 2-16 micrograms/ml), B. catarrhalis (MIC 1-4 micrograms/ml) and Haemophilus spp. (MIC 1-4 micrograms/ml). Among the non-fermenting microorganisms ticarcillin/-clavulanic acid showed good activity toward P. aeruginosa and P. fluorescens (86% and 75% respectively). It was also very active against X. maltophilia with a susceptibility of 96%. Susceptibility to the other antibiotics tested was within the range of 16% and 28%.
TI  - Structure-activity relationships of cephalosporin derivatives against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  
TI  - Inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an HPr(Ser-P)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-P), has been documented for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus bovis, and Lactococcus lactis, but not for other Gram-positive bacteria. Using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that Enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated ATP-dependent HPr(Ser) kinase that phosphorylates Ser-46 in HPr of the phosphotransferase system. A small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, HPr(Ser-P)-activated sugar-P phosphatase (Pase II), previously identified only in Lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, or Bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. Further, Lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks Pase II. The results reveal that Pase II is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-P hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. They provide correlative evidence that Pase II initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and analysis of pWC1, a pC194-type rolling circle replicon in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - A 2.8-kb cryptic plasmid showing no homology to either pFX3 (rolling circle, pE194-type) or pCI305 (theta-type) lactococcal replicons was identified in Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris 2204. The plasmid, pWC1, was compatible with both pCI3340 (a pCI305 derivative) and pFX3 in L. lactis subsp. cremoris 2204. Sequence analysis of pWC1 showed one major ORF encoding a protein with a deduced size of 316 amino acids (aa). Database comparisons showed that the protein was distinct from the pFX- and pCI-type replication proteins (less than 21% aa identity), but shared significant homology (up to 57% aa identity) with the replication proteins from a different group of rolling circle plasmids (pC194-type) commonly found in gram-positive bacteria. A pC194-type rolling circle plasmid has not been previously described in L. lactis. Further sequence analysis showed a conserved double-stranded origin of replication in pWC1 preceded by a large (118-bp) direct repeat. The chloramphenicol-resistance gene from pC194 was inserted into a nonessential region of pWC1 to give pCP12. The host range of pCP12 included Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, but not Escherichia coli. Both pCP12 and to a lesser extent pWC1 generated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in L. lactis. A possible single-stranded origin of replication was identified by sequence analysis of pWC1 and by comparing levels of ssDNA produced by pCP12 deletion derivatives. The pWC1 replicon may be a useful addition to other replicons currently available for vector construction.
TI  - Role of the C terminus in antigen P1 surface localization in Streptococcus mutans and two related cocci.
AB  - The C terminus of the major surface protein P1 from Streptococcus mutans is composed of a hydrophilic domain, an LPNTGV motif, a hydrophobic domain, and a charged tail. These features are shared by surface proteins from many gram-positive coccal bacteria. To investigate the role of the C-terminal domains in antigen P1 surface localization, full-length and truncated P1 gene constructs, which were expressed on the shuttle vector pDL276, were transformed into the P1-negative mutant S. mutans SM3352, Streptococcus gordonii DL-1, and Enterococcus faecalis UV202. Transformants were tested for expression of P1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assaying and Western blotting. The results showed that full-length P1 was expressed by transformants of all three bacteria and was localized on the cell surface. A fusion protein composed of the Staphylococcus aureus fibronectin binding protein C terminus and the P1 protein N terminus was found to surface localize in S. mutans. Deletion of the entire C-terminal domains resulted in P1 being expressed in the culture supernatant. A P1 truncation, which carried only the hydrophilic domain at its C terminus, was found partially associated with the cell surface. This truncated P1 was readily removed from the isolated cell wall by hot sodium dodecyl sulfate-mercaptoethanol extraction. In contrast, the full-length P1 remained associated with the isolated cell wall after similar treatment, suggesting covalent linkages between the full-length P1 and the cell wall. The results described above showed that antigen P1 was anchored to the cell wall by its C-terminal domains probably via covalent linkages with the cell wall. The results also support a universal mechanism involving the C-terminal domains for protein surface localization among this group of gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - [Phenotypic differences of nosocomial bacterial strains isolated in the obstetric-gynecology service of the University Hospital Center of Dakar].
AB  - A study on nosocomial infections was conducted in the Laboratory of Bacteriology-Virology of Aristide Le Dantec's Hospital, in collaboration with the Gynecology Obstetrics clinic located both in the same Dakar's hospital, during May 1995. The aim of the study was to define the phenotypical characteristics of various bacterial strains isolated from the atmosphere health care staff's hands, medical equipment (material, antiseptics) and patients (hospitalized pregnant and newborns in day Nursery). A total of 133 strains were collected and the most frequent isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (27 strains) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (10 strains) encountered mainly in the atmosphere. Otherwise, Escherichia coli (11 strains) and Enterococcus faecalis (11 strains) were more present in hospitalized patients. Results obtained after antimicrobial agents susceptibility (Antibiotics and Heavy metal salts) by Antibiogramm and Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and also data from biotyping of Klebsiella strains have allowed us to say there's a probable contamination of hospitalized patients by the bacteria from the atmosphere but manuportage too.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. Rationale for clinical use.
AB  - Most Gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500; Synercid). Minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (MIC90) were < or = 1 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Listeria monocytogenes. Importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of S. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin G)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. Enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant Enterococcus faecium. E. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. Among the Gram-negative respiratory pathogens Moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and Haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. are resistant. The drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus. Synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant E. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus with the combination of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus infection in rabbits, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. The drug is rapidly bactericidal against Gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the MIC, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in the 1990s.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae have become increasingly resistant to antimicrobial agents. This chapter reviews the epidemiology of this resistance, its detection in the laboratory, the mechanisms of resistance, and the options for therapy and infection control.
TI  - A one-year survey of respiratory and urinary pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  - A one-year (1993) survey of the distribution of pathogens causing respiratory and urinary infections and their antimicrobial susceptibility was performed. The most common bacteria isolated from the lower respiratory tract of patients in a district general hospital were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (35.9%) and Staphylococcus aureus (21.4%). About half of the Pseudomonas strains revealed a resistance to imipenem and gentamicin, whereas almost all Staphylococcus strains were resistant to penicillin G. The most common isolates from urine of in and out-patients were Escherichia coli (32.3% and 39.8%) and Enterococcus faecalis (16.6% and 14.2%). Escherichia coli strains were largely susceptible to almost all chemoantibiotics tested, whereas Enterococcus faecalis demonstrated a high resistance pattern. Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from urine were more sensitive to chemoantibiotics than respiratory strains and the susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from hospitalized or out-patients was different. A periodic monitoring system devised to give information about the circulation of bacteria and the chemoantibiotic resistance in a local context would be useful to assess the local trends and select drugs for therapy.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and biocompatibility of polyurethane and silicone catheters containing low concentrations of silver: a new perspective in prevention of polymer-associated foreign-body-infections.
AB  - In modern medicine, infection is one of the most serious complications of implanted plastic devices. The host is not able to overcome this special type of opportunistic infection despite having a normal immune response and a low virulence of most of the bacteria involved. Antimicrobial therapy alone generally cannot cure the infection and the removal of catheters often remains the only choice of therapy. Bacterial adhesion to the polymer surface of the catheter, be it luminal or external, is an important step in the pathogenesis of catheter-associated infections. In this report, we describe new approaches to the prevention of infections by impregnation of polyurethane and silicone with silver by two different methods. The antimicrobial activity of these silver-impregnated catheters is more than 10 fold higher for coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) compared to catheters without silver. Similar results are obtained with other microbial organisms like Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. The new polymers show no cytotoxic or thrombogenic side effects in vitro.
TI  - In vitro activity of MDL 62,879 against gram-positive bacteria and Bacteroides species.
AB  - The new thiazolyl peptide antibiotic MDL 62,879 (GE2270 A) showed excellent in vitro activity in testing against staphylococci and streptococci, with MIC90s ranging from 0.23 to 0.9 mg/l. It was very active against Clostridium difficile and Propionibacterium acnes (MIC90 0.06 mg/l in each case) and had variable activity against Bacteroides spp. MDL 62,879 had exceptionally good activity against Enterococcus faecalis, including against a collection of high-level aminoglycoside-resistant isolates where it had an MIC90 of 0.047. The antibiotic was bacteriostatic for enterococcal isolates but bactericidal for a methicillin-resistant isolate of Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of substituted benzimidazole, benzothiazole  and imidazole derivatives.
AB  - New benzimidazole, benzothiazole and imidazole derivatives were synthesized by reacting electron-rich olefins (5, 23 and 29) with appropriate reagents. The compounds synthesized were identified by 1H, 13C-NMR, FT-IR and mass spectroscopic techniques and micro analysis. All new and related compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against different bacteria. The compounds 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 24 were found very effective to inhibit the growth of Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213) at minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 25, 25, 12.5, 50, 25, 50 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. The compounds 4, 10a, 10c, 16, 25, 26 and 31 were significantly effective against Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213) with MIC values of 100-200 micrograms/ml. None of the compounds proved to be effective against Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) in the concentrations studied.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1993). III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - Susceptibilities of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia spp. isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during June 1993 to May 1994 to various antimicrobial agents were compared with those in the same period of previous years according to a classification, uncomplicated UTIs, complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, and complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter. The susceptibilities of E. faecalis to chloramphenicol decreased. As for S. aureus, susceptible strains to minocycline (MINO) decreased in complicated UTIs. As for Citrobacter spp., and Enterobacter spp., their susceptibilities were not observed an obvious change. Against E. coli, the activities of cefotiam decreased in complicated UTIs, and aminoglycosides decreased. As for Klebsiella spp., susceptible strains to aminoglycosides decreased. The susceptibilities of P. mirabilis to all drugs except aminoglycosides and MINO were good. The susceptibilities of P. aeruginosa to quinolones isolated from complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter increased, but susceptible strains to aminoglycosides decreased. The susceptibilities of Serratia spp. to MINO has decreased. These data should be considered in clinical treatment of various urinary tract infections.
TI  - BE-24566B, a new antibiotic produced by Streptomyces violaceusniger.
AB  
TI  - Structure-activity relationship of new 2-substituted penem antibiotics.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of three new penems with 4-hydroxyprolinamide, 1-prolinamide and N-methyl-N-2-propionamide substituents, respectively, in position 2 and of their stereoisomers were examined against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All substitutes conferred a broad antibacterial spectrum on the penem moiety. Changes in stereoisomerism selectively improved the activity against E. coli, S. aureus or enterococci. The structure-activity relationships of each compound were discussed in relation to minimum inhibitory concentrations, penicillin-binding protein (PBP) affinity and outer membrane permeability coefficient in E. coli. In this microorganism, PBP 2 was the target for all compounds. Changes in stereoisomerism influenced the affinity for PBPs 1A/B and 2. All antibiotics easily permeated the outer membrane of E. coli and, within each group of compounds, the penetration rate correlated with the antibacterial activity.
TI  - [Pathogenic bacteria isolated from the sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema].
AB  - Isolated pathogenic bacteria from sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema who were admitted in our hospital from 1984 to 1994 were examined to elucidate the relationship between isolated bacteria from sputum and pulmonary functions including vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory volume (FEV1.0), PaO2 and PaCO2. VC of the patients from whom MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) or Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), Branhamella catarrhalis (B. catarrhalis) or Haemophilus influenza (H. influenza) were isolated. FEV1.0 had a similar tendency as VC in terms of isolated organisms from the patients with emphysema. Similarly, PO2 of the patients from whom MSSA or E. cloacae were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis or H. influenzae were isolated, and PCO2 of the patients from whom S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis or H. influenza were isolated. There was also impaired respiratory function in the patients from whom MSSA, Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Xanthomonas maltophilia (X. maltophilia) or Enterobacter cloacae (E. cloacae) were isolated, compared with those in the patients from whom S. pneumonia, B. catarrhalis or H. influenzae were isolated. These results suggest that isolated pathogenic bacteria are shifted from S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis or H. influenza to MSSA, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, X. maltophilia or E. cloacae in the course of impairment of respiratory function in pulmonary emphysema. The treatment and prophylaxis for acute exacerbation in pulmonary emphysema should be based on these results.
TI  - In vitro activities of the lichen secondary metabolites vulpinic acid, (+)-usnic  acid, and (-)-usnic acid against aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.
AB  - Secondary metabolites of different species of lichen were tested for their activities against a variety of microbial species. While gram-negative rods and fungi were not inhibited by these compounds, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and some anaerobic species (Bacteroides and Clostridium species) were susceptible at the concentrations tested. Vulpinic acid generally was less active than usnic acid, regardless of its stereochemistry. The susceptibility to usnic acid was not impaired in clinical isolates of S. aureus resistant to methicillin and/or mupirocin.
TI  - Antibiotics and prevention of microbial colonization of catheters.
AB  - Slime-producing staphylococci frequently colonize catheters, and when they are embedded in biofilm, they become resistant to various antibiotics. In the study that is described, the comparative efficacies of vancomycin, clindamycin, novobiocin, and minocycline, alone or in combination with rifampin, were tested in an in vitro model of colonization. The model consisted of the modified Robbins device with antibiotic-impregnated cement filling the lumen of catheter segments. The synergistic combination of minocycline and rifampin was the most efficacious in preventing bacterial colonization of slime-producing strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus to catheter surfaces. A similar trend was observed when the inhibitory activities of polyurethane catheters coated with minocycline and rifampin were compared with the inhibitory activities of catheters coated with other antimicrobial agents. The inhibitory activities of catheters coated with minocycline and rifampin against S. epidermidis, S. aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis strains, for example, were significantly better than those of catheters coated with vancomycin (P < 0.05). The inhibitory activities of catheters coated with minocycline and rifampin against gram-negative bacilli and Candida albicans were comparable to those of catheters coated with ceftazidime and amphotericin B, respectively. We found that the combination of minocycline and rifampin is unique and highly effective in preventing the colonization of catheters with slime-producing staphylococci and that it also displays a broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against gram-negative bacteria and yeast cells.

As for S. aureus, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., P. mirabilis and Serratia spp., which were detected very few in 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992, their susceptibilities were not observed an obvious change. E. coli, all strains were highly susceptibilities to latamoxef and cefozopran. And the susceptibilities of E. coli isolated from uncomplicated UTIs and complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter to minocycline has decreased in 1991, but they has been indicated a trend of recovery in 1992. The difference in according UTI's classification of the susceptibilities of Klebsiella spp. to minocycline in 1991 has not recognized in 1992. And the susceptibilities of Klebsiella spp. isolated from complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter to quinolones has decreased.

TI  - 2-Substituted penems with amino acid-related side chains: synthesis and antibacterial activity of a new series of beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - A new series of 6-(hydroxyethyl)penems 2-substituted with amino acid-related side chains was synthesized. The nature of the amino acyl derivative proved to be crucial both from a synthetic point of view, as beta-lactam ring opening can compete with C-2 nucleophilic substitution, and for antibacterial activity. Primary amino acid amides emerged as the most suitable side chains for enhancing permeability through a Gram-negative outer membrane. In vitro activity of the new 2-[(aminoamido)methyl]penems 3a-u was influenced by the nature and position of the amide moiety, the ring size for cyclic amides, and the configuration of the amino acid. Compounds bearing amides derived from small N-methyl amino acids (such as 3a) or from cyclic amino acids (such as prolinamide 3p and 4-hydroxyprolinamide 3r) showed broad spectrum in vitro activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms.
TI  - Susceptibility of staphylococci and enterococci to glycopeptides comparison of 3  test methods.
AB  - The significance of grampositive bacteria, especially staphylococci and enterococci, as nosocomial pathogens has increased in the last decade. Furthermore, resistance to commonly used antibiotics like beta-lactams has also become more common and even resistance to glycopeptides has been observed. We evaluated the susceptibility of 150 staphylococcal clinical isolates (52 S. epidermidis, 52 S. haemolyticus, 10 S. saprophyticus, 10 S. hominis, 4 S. warneri, 4 S. simulans, 4 S. capitis and 14 S. aureus) and of 50 enterococci (49 E. faecalis, 1 E. faecium) to the glycopeptides, vancomycin and teicoplanin. The data from the agar dilution test used as reference method were compared with the results from the E test and the agar disk diffusion test. Concerning vancomycin, no resistance among all the staphylococcal isolates was observed whereas one single enterococcal strain (E. faecium) proved to be resistant. The overall resistance of staphylococcal isolates against teicoplanin was about 10.7% (15 S. haemolyticus, 1 S. epidermidis) being mainly due to the high proportion of S. haemolyticus strains (52 out of 150) among the staphylococcal isolates. Teicoplanin resistance among the enterococci was not detected. For vancomycin, a very close correlation between the MICs from the agar dilution test and the E test was noticed. As concerns teicoplanin, the MICs from the E-test were usually somewhat lower than those obtained by the agar dilution test. No correlation was found between the MICs of resistant and intermediate staphylococcal strains and the results from the teicoplanin agar disk diffusion test. For routine teicoplanin susceptibility testing of staphylococci, the determination of the MIC (e.g., by the E test) is much more reliable for detecting resistant strains than the agar disk diffusion test.

TI  - Activation of human endothelial cells by viable or heat-killed gram-negative bacteria requires soluble CD14.
AB  - In response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS; endotoxin), endothelial cells  are converted to an activation phenotype expressing both proinflammatory and procoagulant properties that include the induction of leukocyte adhesion molecules and tissue factor expression. LPS-induced endothelial cell activation requires a soluble form of the monocyte LPS receptor, sCD14. We evaluated the capacity of multiple strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to induce endothelial E-selectin and tissue factor expression through sCD14-dependent pathways with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVE). Both viable and heat-killed gram-negative bacteria (Bacteroides fragilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) but not viable or heat-killed gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) induced prominent E-selectin surface expression detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Tissue factor activity on HUVE, indicated by factor X activation, was induced in response to gram-negative bacteria but not in response to gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria induced transcriptional activation in HUVE, indicated by the appearance of E-selectin-specific mRNA and by the demonstration of activation of NF-kappa B, a trans-activating factor necessary for E-selectin and tissue factor gene transcription. In contrast, neither E-selectin mRNA nor activation of NF-kappa B was detected in HUVE treated with gram-positive bacteria. Endothelial cell activation by gram-negative bacteria in each of these assays was inhibited with a monoclonal antibody (60bd) against CD14. Furthermore, CHO-K1 cells, transfected with human recombinant CD14, responded to all strains of gram-negative bacteria (viable or heat killed), indicated by CHO-K1 NF-kappa B activation. We conclude that gram-negative bacteria induce endothelial cell activation through a common sCD14-dependent pathway.
TI  - Efficacy of ozonated water against various food-related microorganisms.
AB  - The antimicrobial effects of ozonated water in a recirculating concurrent reactor were evaluated against four gram-positive and four gram-negative bacteria, two yeasts, and spores of Aspergillus niger. More than 5 log units each of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli cells were killed instantaneously in ozonated water with or without addition of 20 ppm of soluble starch (SS). In ozonated water, death rates among the gram-negative bacteria--S. typhimurium, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Yersinia enterocolitica--were not significantly different (P > 0.05). Among gram-positive bacteria, Listeria monocytogenes was significantly P < 0.05) more sensitive than either Staphylococcus aureus or Enterococcus faecalis. In the presence of organic material, death rates of S. aureus compared with L. monocytogenes and E. coli compared with S. typhimurium in ozonated water were not significantly (P > 0.05) affected by SS addition but were significantly reduced (P < 0.05) by addition of 20 ppm of bovine serum albumin (BSA). More than 4.5 log units each of Candida albicans and Zygosaccharomyces bailii cells were killed instantaneously in ozonated water, whereas less than 1 log unit of Aspergillus niger spores was killed after a 5-min exposure. The average ozone output levels in the deionized water (0.188 mg/ml) or water with SS (0.198 mg/ml) did not differ significantly (P < 0.05) but were significantly lower in water containing BSA (0.149 mg/ml).
TI  - Controlled evaluation of BacT/alert standard anaerobic and FAN anaerobic blood culture bottles for the detection of bacteremia and fungemia.
AB  - FAN medium was formulated to improve microbial recovery, particularly for fastidious microorganisms and for microorganisms causing sepsis in patients receiving antimicrobial therapy. In a controlled clinical evaluation performed at four university-affiliated hospitals, FAN anaerobic bottles were compared with standard anaerobic bottles for yield, speed of detection of microbial growth, and detection of septic episodes. A total of 10,431 blood culture sets were received; both anaerobic bottles of 7,694 blood culture sets were adequately filled with blood. Altogether, 925 isolates were recovered: 557 that were the cause of sepsis, 99 that were indeterminate as the cause of sepsis, and 269 contaminants. More Staphylococcus aureus (P < 0.001), coagulase-negative staphylococci (P < 0.001), Escherichia coli (P < 0.02), and all microorganisms combined (P < 0.005) were recovered from FAN bottles; more nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli (P < 0.05), Torulopsis glabrata (P < 0.001), and other yeasts (P < 0.01) were recovered from standard bottles. Growth of S. aureus (P < 0.001), coagulase-negative staphylococci (P < 0.001), Enterococcus faecalis (P < 0.025), streptococci other than Streptococcus pneumoniae (P < 0.01), and all microorganisms combined (P < 0.001) was detected earlier in standard bottles; growth of more isolates of E. coli (P < 0.05) and anaerobic bacteria (P < 0.01) was detected earlier in FAN bottles. The mean times to detection were 14.2 and 16.1 h for standard and FAN bottles, respectively. More septic episodes caused by S. aureus (P < 0.001), coagulase-negative staphylococci (P < 0.005), members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (P < 0.02), and all microorganisms combined (P < 0.02) were detected in FAN bottles; more septic episodes caused by nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli (P < 0.025) and yeasts (P < 0.005) were detected in standard bottles. In summary, more isolates (except for strict aerobes) were recovered from FAN bottles than from standard anaerobic bottles. Similarly, significant more septic episodes (except for those caused by strict aerobes) were detected with FAN bottles than with standard anaerobic bottles. With the exception of E. coli and anaerobic bacteria, growth of more isolates was detected earlier in standard anaerobic bottles.

TI  - Characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  - An internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven Gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase chain reaction assay. The DNA sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactococcus lactis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes were determined. Comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of the SOD proteins from Bacillus stearothermophilus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. Phylogenetic analysis of SOD peptides showed that members of the genera Streptococcus and those of the genera Enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. The method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Typing of sequential bacterial isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
AB  - We typed 39 sets of multiple bacterial isolates of the same species from patients by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA (PFGE). Isolates were cultured from different sites or over a 2-week or longer interval. Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae were tested. Excluding E. cloacae, 28 of 32 sets of isolates (87%) demonstrated only identical or highly related PFGE types. Four of the seven sets of E. cloacae showed different types. For species other than E. cloacae, our results suggest that patients are usually colonized and infected with a single strain of these bacterial pathogens. Unlike all of the other tested species, E. cloacae PFGE typing differences suggested the presence of multiple strains causing colonization and infection.
TI  - Emergence of bacterial resistance to imipenem and ciprofloxacin in a university hospital.
AB  - We have continuously monitored the in-vitro activities of imipenem and ciprofloxacin against large numbers of non-fastidious clinical isolates. After eight years of use, 97-100% of Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter baumannii remained susceptible to imipenem, but susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa declined from 100% to 91%. After six years of use, 94%-100% of Enterobacteriaceae (except Providencia stuartii) remained susceptible to ciprofloxacin but susceptibility of P. stuartii, A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa declined from 100% to 46%, 66% and 84%, respectively. Oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were considered to be resistant to imipenem and all beta-lactams. There were no quinolone-resistant staphylococci observed in 1986, but susceptibilities of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus to ciprofloxacin decreased to 85-93% for oxacillin-susceptible strains and to 7-39% for oxacillin-resistant strains. Enterococcus faecalis has remained susceptible to imipenem and the modal MIC of ciprofloxacin has remained 1 mg/L; however, susceptibility to ciprofloxacin 2 mg/L decreased from 94% to 64%. Imipenem-quinolone cross-resistance was observed for staphylococci but not for P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of AM-1155, a new 8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  - AM-1155 is a new 8-methoxy quinolonecarboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. It inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, most of the Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Haemophilus influenzae at the concentration of 0.39 mg/L. AM-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against Gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant staphylococci. The antibacterial activity of AM-1155 was almost equal to that of sparfloxacin against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative species. AM-1155 also showed a good activity against anaerobes. The protective efficacy of AM-1155 against experimental systemic infections with Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens in mice was almost equal or superior to that of sparfloxacin. AM-1155 was 5- to 28-times more effective than ciprofloxacin, in terms of ED50 at one week, in staphylococcal and streptococcal infections.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of copper and noncopper paints.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To screen copper and noncopper paints for their bactericidal effectiveness in rendering surfaces self-disinfecting. DESIGN: Tested paints were applied to glass coverslips, cured, inoculated with test organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis), and dried. After 0, 24, or 48 hours, surviving organisms were eluted and enumerated, and counts compared with those obtained from inoculated control (unpainted) coverslips for the corresponding time periods. Copper elution from select copper paints was quantified by complete immersion of coated coverslips followed by spectroscopic analysis to infer a threshold relationship between kill and copper release. RESULTS: Nearly all of the tested copper paints were capable of reducing organism counts to negligible levels within 24 hours. Exterior latex paints supplemented with a fungicide were similarly efficacious. Standard interior latex paint reduced bacterial counts to nearly zero within 24 hours for E coli and P aeruginosa, and to zero within 48 hours for E faecalis. However, substantial survival of S aureus occurred (up to 4 logs at 24 hours). Chi-squared analysis of elution and cidal data indicated that lethality was dependent on copper release in excess of 32 micrograms. CONCLUSION: The data support presumptive bactericidal claims for several copper and noncopper paints. Despite controversy over environment-based contagion, such paints could be used to render surfaces self-disinfecting in strategic locations where environmental causation of nosocomial infections is suspected.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of some novel 1-substituted 1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-pyridinyl-3-quinolinecarboxylic acids. Potent antistaphylococcal agents.
AB  - The palladium-catalyzed coupling of 3- and 4-(trialkylstannyl)pyridines with 7-bromo or 7-chloro 1-substituted 1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylates has provided access to the corresponding 1-substituted 1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-pyridinyl-3-quinolinecarboxylic acids. The antibacterial activity of these derivatives was studied with the finding that the optimal 1- and 7-position substituents for Gram positive activity are cyclopropyl and 4-(2,6-dimethylpyridinyl), respectively. We find that for the fluorine-substituted derivatives studied, the position of the fluorine on the quinolone nucleus or the number of fluorine atoms does not seem to be important for good Gram positive activity. For 1-cyclopropyl 7-(2,6-dimethyl-4-pyridinyl) derivatives, the 6-fluoro 4a, 8-fluoro 10d, 6,8-difluoro 10b, and 5,6,8-trifluoro 8, all provided equal antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213. There is also a correlation between the substitution on the 7-(4-pyridinyl) group and the Gram positive activity, particularly for S. aureus, clearly indicating that the 2,6-dimethylpyridinyl group is optimal. The MIC50 value for the most potent agents in this study against S. aureus ATCC 29213 is 0.008 microgram/mL. By comparison, ciprofloxacin and aminopyrrolidine 28 gave values of 0.25 and 0.015 microgram/mL, respectively, against this organism.
TI  - In vitro activity of WY-49605, a penem antimicrobial.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the penem antimicrobial WY-49605 was compared with those of other agents available for oral administration. Based on concentrations inhibiting 90% of isolates (MIC(90)s), the penem inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC(90) = 0.25 microg/ml), penicillin-susceptible streptococci (MIC(90) < or = 0.12 microg/ml) and several other Gram-positive genera at concentrations comparable or superior to the most active comparison agents. WY-49605 and cefpodoxime were the most active agents against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Most strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to the new agent at concentrations < or =4microg/ml, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecium, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were resistant to all agents tested.
TI  - Conjugative mobilization of a vancomycin resistance plasmid by a putative Enterococcus faecium sex pheromone response plasmid.
AB  - Recent epidemiological evidence suggests that horizontal gene transfer may be an  important mechanism for dissemination of vancomycin resistance. A filter mating survey of 21 VanA Enterococcus faecium isolates from The New York Hospital showed that 14 of these isolates transferred vancomycin resistance (Vmr) to the plasmid-free reference strain Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2. One isolate, E. faecium R7, was selected for further study based on its ability to transfer Vmr to strain JH2-2 in liquid culture. Analysis of the plasmid content of transconjugants revealed three general classes. The predominant class (28 of 47 transconjugants) contained two separate plasmids: pHKK702 and pHKK703. pHKK702 is a 41-kb plasmid that contains an element indistinguishable from the Vmr transposon Tn1546 and an element that hybridizes with an ermB probe from the Staphylococcus aureus erythromycin resistance transposon Tn551. pHKK703 is a 55-kb plasmid that hybridizes with probes for the sex pheromone response genes prgA, prgB, and prgX derived from the E. faecalis plasmid pCF10. The second group of transconjugants (18 of 47) contained various recombinant forms of pHKK702 and pHKK703, whereas a third transconjugant class contained only pHKK702 (1 of 47). Transconjugants that contained both pHKK702 and pHKK703 were able to efficiently transfer Vmr to recipient strains in broth or on filters. However, no transfer of Vmr was detected using the donor containing only pHKK702. The transfer of Vmr from the recombination-deficient derivative of E. faecalis JH2-2 [strain UV202(pHKK702, pHKK703)] was reduced 600-fold compared to that of JH2-2(pHKK702, pHKK703). We propose that pHKK703 functions as an E. faecium sex pheromone response plasmid that conjugatively mobilizes pHKK702, and that a major pathway for this mobilization may require donor-mediated recombination proficiency. This report provides the first example in which a plasmid containing a Tn1546-related element is conjugatively mobilized.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fusidic acid and disk diffusion susceptibility testing  criteria for gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The in vitro activity of fusidic acid was assessed and was compared with those of cloxacillin, cefamandole, vancomycin, teicoplanin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, pefloxacin, and fleroxacin against 500 gram-positive cocci: 151 Staphylococcus aureus, 197 coagulase-negative staphylococci, and 152 Enterococcus faecalis strains. All clinical isolates were concomitantly tested by disk diffusion and agar dilution procedures as outlined by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The results with fusidic acid were further analyzed by regression line and error rate-bounded methods. With control American Type Culture Collection organisms, the values were within the limits of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards or published limits. The incidence of resistance to fusidic acid was 0.7% for S. aureus, 2.5% for coagulase-negative staphylococci, and 99.3% for E. faecalis. The correlation coefficient between the results of disk diffusion and agar dilution tests with fusidic acid was 0.90. Current interpretive criteria for susceptibility to fusidic acid (i.e., MIC of < 2 micrograms/ml and inhibitory zone of 20 mm) gave 1% false susceptibility (all strains being E. faecalis). This error rate is practically eliminated if a zone diameter of 21 mm is considered the breakpoint for susceptibility.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of the new 4-quinolones DU-6859a and DV-7751a.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of two new 4-quinolones, DU-6859a and DV-7751a, was investigated against strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. DU-6859a and DV-7751a were more bactericidal than any 4-quinolone tested previously. Furthermore, DU-6859a was unique among 4-quinolones in being able to kill Ent. faecalis after incubation for only 3 h in nutrient broth. The bactericidal mechanisms of DV-7551a were similar to those of other 4-quinolones, but, uniquely, DU-6859a possessed additional bactericidal mechanisms against both Str. pneumoniae and Ent. faecalis. This may explain the unusually potent bactericidal activity of this agent against these species. These results show that DU-6859a is a unique extended-spectrum 4-quinolone, which should prove to be superior to established 4-quinolones.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of FK037: a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - The antibacterial and bactericidal activities and the stability of FK037 to beta-lactamases were investigated and compared with those of cefpirome, flomoxef, ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, and vancomycin. Against clinical isolates of methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, FK037 was less active than vancomycin but more potent than the other drugs tested. Among highly methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MIC for methicillin: 200 mg/l or higher), none of the strains were highly resistant to FK037 (MIC > or = 100 mg/l) unlike the other cephalosporins. With the exception of Enterococcus faecalis, FK037 had an activity equipotent to that of cefpirome and far superior to those of flomoxef, ceftazidime and ceftizoxime against other gram-positive clinical isolates. The activity of FK037 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas cepacia was equipotent to that of cefpirome but 2- to 4-fold less active than that of ceftazidime. FK037 inhibited 90% of Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii growth at a concentration of 6.25 mg/l; it was as active as cefpirome and much more active than ceftazidime. Against the other gram-negative bacteria tested, FK037 was equipotent to cefpirome and ceftazidime and was more effective than flomoxef. FK037, like cefpirome, portrayed a high stability to various beta-lactamases except type II penicillinase and oxyimino-cephalosporinase (CXase). FK037 scored an MIC range of 0.013-6.25 mg/l against numerous beta-lactamase-producing bacterial strains with the exception of some CXase-producing strains and a cephalosporinase-producing C. freundii; and against strains other than P. aeruginosa FK037 was as active as cefpirome and 2- to 32-fold more active than ceftazidime. FK037 displayed highly potent activities against cephalosporinase-producing E. cloacae, C. freundii and Serratia marcescens which were resistant to flomoxef and ceftizoxime. FK037 was highly bactericidal against S. aureus and Escherichia coli at its MIC or higher.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activities of the penem WY-49605 (SUN5555) against recent clinical isolates from five U.S. medical centers.
AB  - The in vitro activity of WY-49605 (SUN5555) (WY) was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid against 2,958 consecutive clinical isolates from five medical centers and 402 respiratory pathogens from 18 other facilities. Most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by WY (MIC at which 50% of the isolates are inhibited [MIC50], < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml). MIC90s of > or = 8.0 micrograms/ml were observed for Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia spp., and Proteus mirabilis. WY was the most active drug against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.12 microgram/ml) and other coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC90, 4.0 micrograms/ml). The four drugs were not active against nonenteric gram-negative bacilli, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. At 2.0 micrograms/ml, WY inhibited 82% of Enterococcus faecalis strains and was equal to or superior to the other drugs against streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of a series of new parenteral optically active 3-[[(N-alkylpyridinium-4'-yl)thio]methyl]-2-oxaisocephems.
AB  - The preparation and biological evaluation of a series of 7-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(Z)-[(cyclopentyloxy)imino]acetamido] optically active 2-oxaisocephems, substituted at the 3-position with [(N-alkylpyridinium-4'-yl)thio]methyl groups, are described. The resulting family of parenteral compounds displays a broad spectrum of in vitro antibacterial activity. These compounds exhibit increased activity against Gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis which are resistant to most cephalosporins with a similar level of Gram-negative activity to that of the third-generation antibiotics. In vivo efficacy of new antibacterial agents in this investigation is excellent against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as compared with reference compounds. The in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity and the structure-activity relationships are presented.
TI  - Primosome assembly site in Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - A single-strand initiation site was detected on the Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pAM beta 1 by its ability to prevent accumulation of single stranded DNA of a rolling circle plasmid, both in Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. This site, designated ssiA, is located on the lagging strand template, approximately 150 bp downstream from the replication origin. ssiA priming activity requires the DnaE primase, the DnaC replication fork helicase, as well as the products of the dnaB, dnaD and dnaI genes of B.subtilis, but not the RNA polymerase. The primase and the replication fork helicase requirements indicate that ssiA is a primosome assembly site. Interestingly, the pAM beta 1 lagging strand synthesis is inefficient when any of the proteins involved in ssiA activity is mutated, but occurs efficiently in the absence of ssiA. This suggests that normal plasmid replication requires primosome assembly and that the primosome can assemble not only at ssiA but also elsewhere on the plasmid. This work for the first time describes a primosome in a Gram-positive bacterium. Involvement of the B.subtilis proteins DnaB, DnaD and DnaI, which do not have any known analogue in Escherichia coli, raises the possibility that primosome assembly and/or function in B.subtilis differs from that in E.coli.
TI  - A simple "universal" DNA extraction procedure using SDS and proteinase K is compatible with direct PCR amplification.

TI  - Antibiotic resistance of bacterial strains isolated from children in Child Health Center, Warsaw.
AB  - This study examines the antibiotic susceptibility of 1792 bacterial strains isolated from hospitalized children between January and December 1993. A total of 1015 Gram-negative rods represented by members of Enterobacteriaceae family (770) and nonfermenters (245) were isolated. The most resistant strains were noticed among Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. From 38% to 46% of K. pneumoniae strains were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, but all of them were sensitive to imipenem. From 60% to 80% of E. cloacae isolates were resistant to all beta-lactams, but sensitive to imipenem. Resistance of P. aeruginosa to aminoglycosides varied from 30% for gentamicin to 5% for amikacin. About 40% of P. aeruginosa strains were resistant to carbenicillin, and 25% to azlocillin and piperacillin, but only two strains were resistant to ceftazidime and imipenem. Among Gram-positive cocci the most frequently encountered were coagulase-negative staphylococci, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. The methicillin-resistant strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci and S. aureus consisted 74.8% and 34%, respectively. All strains of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci and S. aureus were sensitive to vancomycin.
TI  - TOC-39, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin with excellent activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - TOC-39, a new parenteral cephalosporin, is a hydroxyimino-type cephem antibiotic  with vinylthio-pyridyl moiety at the 3 position. TOC-39 was evaluated for antibacterial activity against various clinically isolated strains. TOC-39 had excellent activity, stronger than that of methicillin, oxacillin, the cephalosporins tested, imipenem, gentamicin, minocycline, tobramycin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and had an MIC comparable to that of vancomycin (the MICs of TOC-39 and vancomycin for 90% of the strains tested were 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively). Against Enterococcus faecalis strains, which are resistant to cephalosporins, TOC-39 was twice as active as ampicillin. Against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae, TOC-39 was twice as active as or more active than cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, TOC-39 was superior to cefotiam, ceftazidime, and flomoxef and was similar to cefpirome. In addition, the activity of TOC-39 was equal to or greater than that of cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome against Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Morganella morganii. In terms of bactericidal effect against MRSA, TOC-39 was superior to vancomycin. No mutant resistant to TOC-39 or vancomycin was obtained from susceptible MRSA strains. In murine systemic infection models, TOC-39 showed potent activity against S. aureus and E. coli. Against highly MRSA, the activity of TOC-39 was comparable to that of vancomycin.
TI  - Antineoplastic agents, 326. The stereochemistry of bastadins 8, 10, and 12 from the Bismarck archipelago marine sponge Ianthella basta.
AB  - An investigation of cancer cell-growth inhibitory constituents of the Papua New Guinea marine sponge Ianthella basta led to isolation of the C-6 hydroxybastadins 8 [1] 10 [2], and 12 [3]. The absolute stereochemistry (6S) of each bastadin (or its tetramethyl ester derivative) was determined by means of the Mosher-Trost method. Bastadins 10 [2] and 12 [3] were found to significantly inhibit the growth of a selection of human cancer cell lines. Bastadins 8, 10, and 12 inhibited growth of the Gram-positive opportunists Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - Rapid identification of common human pathogens by high-resolution proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
AB  - Routine procedures for recovery of bacteria from clinical specimens involve culturing the latter on various nonselective and selective agar media. The bacteria are then identified by means of biochemical and immunological test procedures. Reduction of the time required to identify the bacteria is highly desirable for rapid clinical diagnosis. Towards this end the potential of proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for providing a "fingerprint" within the proton spectrum of five bacterial genera, reflecting their characteristic cell wall constituents, has been investigated. Establishing a database of high-resolution proton NMR spectra of a large number of bacterial species is a prerequisite for attaining this objective. A database has been established for five common human pathogens: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. On the basis of the presence of characteristic resonances in their spectra, a simple algorithm has been developed to differentiate and identify these microorganisms. The NMR spectra of E. coli and S. aureus showed no dependency on the type of growth medium, growth density, or incubation time.
TI  - Synergistic interaction between ofloxacin and cefotaxime against common clinical  pathogens.
AB  - Antimicrobial synergy resulting from combined antibiotic therapy is often important in the treatment of serious bacterial infections. To investigate the interactions between cefotaxime (CTX), desacetylcefotaxime (DES), and ofloxacin (OFL), 247 recent clinical isolates were tested for in vitro susceptibility to each antibiotic alone by an agar dilution technique and retested with the various antibiotic combinations using a checkerboard protocol. Fractional inhibitory concentrations were calculated for all organisms with all drug combinations. Time kill kinetic studies were performed on selected isolates to examine the bactericidal activity of the various antimicrobial combinations. Of the 110 gram-negative organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy between CTX, DES and OFL was demonstrable for 89 (81%). Included in the study were 70 members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, 20 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10 strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, and 10 isolates of Xanthomonas maltophilia. Additive activity was observed against an additional 13 (11%) isolates. Findings were similar for the 89 gram-positive isolates examined. Organisms tested included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (9), methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis (10), Enterococcus faecalis (10), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (20). Synergy or partial synergy was observed against 81 (91%). Less synergistic activity was detected, however, with members of the Bacteroides fragilis group. Of the 48 organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy was noted for only 27 (57%). Isolates representative of each major group of organisms included in the study were tested to determine whether synergistic bactericidal activity was also demonstrable with the three drugs. Time kill studies supported the checkerboard results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Efficacies of ABT-719 and related 2-pyridones, members of a new class of antibacterial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  - The 2-pyridones are a new class of broad-spectrum orally bioavailable antibacterial agents. These compounds are potent bacterial DNA gyrase inhibitors which differ from fluoroquinolones by placement of the nitrogen atom in the ring juncture. ABT-719 is an S isomer and a representative 2-pyridone. ABT-719 administered orally or subcutaneously was 4- to 10-fold more effective than ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes infections in normal mice. ABT-719 was equivalent in efficacy to ciprofloxacin for treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Escherichia coli. The racemate and R forms of ABT-719 produced similar results against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. The 50% effective doses of ABT-719 were at least threefold lower than those of ciprofloxacin for therapy of intracellular infections caused by Salmonella typhimurium or Listeria monocytogenes. In immunosuppressed mice, ABT-719 was more effective than ciprofloxacin against quinolone-sensitive S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium. The pharmacokinetic properties of ABT-719 were consistent with its relative efficacy. The 2-pyridones are potent, orally available antibacterial agents with efficacy against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections in mice.
TI  - [Postantibiotic effects (PAE's) of macrolide antibiotics evaluated using Bioscreen C method].
AB  - Postantibiotic effects (PAE's) of macrolide antibiotics were determined for Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis using viable counting and Bioscreen C method and the two methods were compared. No major differences between the two methods were observed. The Bioscreen C method was less laborious than the viable counting. The durations of PAE for S. aureus following exposures to erythromycin (EM), josamycin (JM) and rokitamycin (RKM) for 2 hours at twice the MICs were in ranges of 0.85 to 1.45, 2.36 to 3.48 and 1.93 to 5.45 hours, respectively. A definite PAE of 1.0 to 5.8 hours was also observed in E. faecalis strains exposed for 2 hours to EM, JM and RKM at twice the MICs.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of sulbactam/ampicillin against clinically isolated microbial strains].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities were examined for sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) against clinically isolated microbial strains in 1987, 1990, 1994. Besides, the beta-lactamase productivity and MICs of these strains were measured, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. The ratio of beta-lactamase producing strains were 90% of methicillin (DMPPC)-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus (MSSA), about 80% of DMPPC-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 100% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, 95% of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis and 15-20% of Haemophilus influenzae. Several kinds of beta-lactamase productivity were observed. 2. Antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC against beta-lactamase producing strains of MSSA, M. (B.) catarrhalis, H. influenzae, and almost all of Enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of ampicillin (ABPC) and piperacillin (PIPC), but antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC were weak against MRSA and cephems (CEPs)-resistant strains detected in some of Enterobacteriaceae. 3. It appeared that benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP) or PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) and CEPs-resistant Escherichia coli increased year by year. 4. Antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC were strong against Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, M. (B.) catarrhalis and H. influenzae including beta-lactamase producing strains. Additionally, beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of SBT was observed against beta-lactamase produced by S. aureus and K. pneumoniae which demonstrate indirect pathogenicity. Thus, SBT/ABPC is an injectable antibiotic that is expected to demonstrate clinical usefulness, especially as the first line drug for the respiratory tract infections that are community-acquired.
TI  - Development of a direct viable count procedure for some gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The direct viable count (DVC) is a procedure for enumerating viable-nonculturable cells. It should be noted, however, that bacteria demonstrating the viable but nonculturable phase have to date included only Gram-negative species, mainly because the DVC procedure does not lend itself to the analysis of Gram-positive bacteria since the DVC procedure is dependent on the bacterium being sensitive to nalidixic acid. The authors report here concerning studies on an analogous procedure for the direct enumeration of viable-nonculturable Gram-positive bacteria. To facilitate a differential DVC for Gram-positive bacteria, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin or isopropyl cinodine were substituted for nalidixic acid. These antibiotics were chosen because, like nalidixic acid, they are DNA gyrase inhibitors. The concentrations used for each antibiotic were 1000 micrograms ml-1, 100 micrograms ml-1. Pure cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus subtilis were obtained from the culture collection at the University of Wyoming and a faecal streptococcus was isolated from the Laramie wastewater treatment plant. An antibiotic and optimal concentration thereof was found which gave enlarged cells for all the organisms except the faecal streptococcus isolated from the wastewater plant for which no enlarged cells were ever seen. The antibiotic and concentration thereof which gave the optimal percent enlarged cells in the DVC procedure varied between organisms.
TI  - Prevalence and antibiotic sensitivity of Danish versus other European bacterial isolates from intensive care and hematology/oncology units.
AB  - The prevalence and antibiotic sensitivity patterns of bacteria collected consecutively from medical and surgical intensive care units (ICUs) and from hematology/oncology units in nine hospitals in Denmark were determined and compared to data collected simultaneously in 12 other European countries. Bacterial isolates from 794 Danish patients were tested and compared to 8,625 isolates from European patients. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of eight different antibiotics were determined using a microdilution plate. Similar to findings in European countries, the most common source of bacterial isolates in Danish units was the respiratory tract (49%), followed by blood (18%), urinary tract (14%) and surgical wounds (10%). Staphylococcus aureus was the most prevalent respiratory organism in Danish units, whereas Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa dominated in other countries. In blood, Escherichia coli was most prevalent in Denmark while coagulase-negative staphylococci were predominant in other countries. Urinary tract isolates were dominated by Escherichia coli in both Denmark and the other countries, but Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more frequently isolated in the other countries. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent wound isolate in Denmark, while Enterobacteriaceae other than Escherichia coli dominated in other European countries. Thus, in Denmark Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella spp. (from ICUs) or Enterococcus spp. and Klebsiella spp. (from hematology/oncology units), are the most prominent pathogens in these units today. Indicator organisms of antibiotic consumption (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus) were more frequent in other European countries than Denmark. In general the Danish isolates were more sensitive to antibiotics than the European isolates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Development of wound infection or separation after cesarean delivery. Prospective evaluation of 2,431 cases.
AB  - Wound infections are a common surgical complication, often requiring a prolonged  hospital stay and leading to increased costs. Over a one-year period, 2,431 patients were followed after cesarean delivery with prompt evaluation and culture of all suspicious wounds. Seventy subjects (2.8%) developed confirmed wound infection, and 42 (1.7%) developed noninfected open surgical wounds. Seven (0.3%) fascial dehiscences were diagnosed, requiring surgical repair. Forty of 63 (64%) infected wounds had positive bacterial cultures, with Staphylococcus epidermidis (29%), Enterococcus faecalis (17%), Staphylococcus aureus (17%), Escherichia coli (11%) and Proteus mirabilis (10%) the most frequent isolates. Only 7 of 42 (17%) noninfected wounds had positive cultures, with only S aureus, S epidermidis and Corynebacterium species isolated. Ninety-five percent of the noninfected wounds had blood or serous collections present. Rupture of membranes lasting longer than six hours, emergency cesarean delivery and morbid obesity were associated with a statistically increased likelihood of the development of infected wounds. Emergency cesarean delivery and morbid obesity, but not prolonged rupture of membranes, were associated with an increased likelihood of the development of noninfected wounds. Therefore, it appears that at least two mechanisms are responsible for the development of postcesarean open wounds: (1) increased amniotic fluid and wound colonization due to prolonged rupture of membranes, resulting in a wound infection containing one or more bacterial species derived from the cervicovaginal flora, and (2) increased exogenous bacterial contamination and flora consistent with skin species or breaks in sterile technique, often accompanying difficult or emergency surgery.
TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1991. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and CNS showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (DMPPC). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. Though Enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), imipenem (IPM), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST) compounds, Enterococcus faecium was resistant to almost all antibacterial agents but to ST compounds. High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae to IPM, gentamicin (GM) and ofloxacin (OFLX) and for strains of Proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (LMOX), IPM, aztreonam (AZT), GM and OFLX. Serratia marcescens and Bacteroides fragilis group were highly susceptible only to IPM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (CAZ), IPM, amikacin (AMK) and tobramycin (TOB). Pseudomonas cepacia was relatively susceptible only to CAZ. IPM showed strong antibacterial activity to many species except for S. aureus and CNS.
TI  - Synthesis and biological properties of a series of optically active 2-oxaisocephems.
AB  - A novel series of (6S, 7S)-3,7-disubstituted-8-oxo-1-aza-4-oxabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2- carboxylic acids 9a-o, parenteral optically active 2-oxaisocephems, was synthesized, and in vitro and in vivo activities were determined against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The 7-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(Z)-cyclopentyloxyimino]acet arnido derivatives, 9g, 9m and 9o, had enhanced antibacterial activity against Gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecalis while maintaining Gram-negative activity. It is also significant that these compounds showed more potent activity against MRSA and E. faecalis isolates than cefuzonam (10) and flomoxef (12), which are the most popular third-generation antibiotics. The combination of the 7-[2-(aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(Z)-cyclopentyloxyimino]acetamido group and 2-oxaisocephem nucleus contributes to the increased antibacterial activity against these clinical isolates. The 7-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(Z)-cyclopentyloxyimino]acet ami do derivative 9g provided good subcutaneous efficacy and exhibited more potent activity than cefmenoxime (11) against the systemic infection with S. aureus Smith in mice. The compound 9a with a [2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(Z)-methoxyimino]acetamido group at the 7-position showed high in vivo efficacy on the experimental infection caused by Escherichia coli No. 29 in mice.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical studies of SY5555 in pediatric field].
AB  - Clinical studies were carried out on SY5555, a new oral penem, in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized below. The clinical efficacies were examined in a total 31 patients consisting of 4 patients with pharyngitis, 10 with purulent tonsillitis, 4 with scarlet fever, 7 with impetigo, one with balanitis, one with cellulitis and 4 with UTI. The clinical efficacy rate was 96.8% (30/31). Bacteriological efficacies of SY5555 were examined on identified pathogens including 7 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 6 of Streptococcus pyogenes, 3 of Enterococcus faecalis, 3 of Haemophilus influenzae, one of Escherichia coli and one of Citrobacter freundii. The bacteriological eradication rate was 81.0%. As for side effects, loose stool in one patient was noted. Abnormal laboratory findings test results included eosinophilia in 2 patients, eosinophilia and elevation of serum transaminase in one patient, and thrombocytosis in another.
TI  - The effects of X-ray contrast media on bacterial growth.
AB  - Six widely used X-ray contrast media (XRC) were tested against nine commonly isolated organisms to determine the practicality of using XRC to outline body spaces prior to obtaining specimens for culture and to assess the feasibility of using XRC in divided doses to reduce cost. Preparations of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus milleri in two approximate concentrations of 10(4) and 10(8) colony forming units/mL (cfu/mL) were inoculated into the following XRC: Conray 280, Hexabrix 320, lopamiro 370, Omnipaque 350, Ultravist 300 and Optiray 320 each in two concentrations. Sampling was performed in triplicate at 0, 2, 4 and 20 h with the 20 h counts made after exposure at both 22 degrees C and 4 degrees C. There were 16 significant interactions, predominantly with the Gram-negative organisms. Conray 280 produced the greatest number of effects. Most effects were bacteriostatic. Organisms were most susceptible at low concentration and after prolonged contact with XRC. No effect was seen with dilute XRC. All weekly sterility checks were negative. Non-ionic XRC have no significant effect on the growth of Gram-positive organisms and little effect on Gram-negative organisms if processing is performed promptly. Using standard aseptic technique, no contamination of XRC occurred, suggesting multi-dosing may be a safe and cost-effective method of XRC utilization.
TI  - [The present and future problems of resistance in staphylococci, streptococci and M. tuberculosis].
AB  - Mechanisms of resistance of strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Neisseria meningitidis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis to antibiotics are presented and discussed. The resistance to methicillin-oxacillin in S. aureus and S. epidermidis is chromosomally-mediated by sequence of DNA, namely by gene mecA. This gene codes altered PBP-2A protein. Strains of S.pneumoniae contain PBP-1A, PBP-2B and PBP-2X proteins. They cause resistance to many beta-lactam antibiotics. Resistance to vankomycin, respectively to teikoplanin in strains of E. faecalis and E. faecium is coded by transferable vanA and vanB genes. Strains of N. meningitidis produce mostly the altered PBP-2 protein. The increase of resistance in strains of M. tuberculosis is also significant.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of substituted 4-quinazolyl-hydrazines and their arylhydrazones determined by a modified microdilution method.
AB  - Eight 4-quinazolylhydrazines and eleven their arylhydrazones have been tested for antibacterial effects and for structure-activity relationships by a modified microdilution method. The derivative 6-chloro-2-morpholino-4-quinazolyl-5'-nitro-2'-furylhydrazone++ + had the highest antibacterial effect, the MIC values being 100 mg/L for E. faecalis, 250 mg/L for S. aureus, 200 mg/L for P. aeruginosa and 350 mg/L for E. coli. The most effective derivatives were those with the benzene ring substituted with chlorine or methyl group in position 6 or 8 and with pyrimidine ring substituted with a secondary amine in position 2. The modified microdilution method did not give rise to any statistically significant deviations in the MIC values for ampicillin in comparison with reported reference collection values.

TI  - Growth conditions influence expression of cell surface hydrophobicity of staphylococci and other wound infection pathogens.
AB  - The initial adhesion of microbes to tissue and solid surfaces can be mediated by  hydrophobic interaction. Expression of microbial cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) is influenced by growth conditions, and often best expressed after growth under nutrient-poor conditions, or "starvation". In the present study, the CSH of 133 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, group A streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus magnus, and of 8 Candida albicans strains was measured by the salt aggregation test after growth on hematin agar in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, or under anaerobiosis. Cells of all but 8 strains expressed pronounced or moderate CSH, i.e., they aggregated in 0.01-2 M ammonium sulfate. When the agar surface was covered by human serum (diluted 1:5) to mimic growth conditions in a wound, 94 strains expressed higher CSH, and 44 strains the same CSH as after growth without serum. The CSH of 12 strains of different species was measured after growth on blood, hematin and PDM agar, with or without serum, and in an aerobic or a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The highest CSH was expressed after growth in 5% CO2 with serum, and the lowest growth after on blood agar in aerobic atmosphere. Identical results were obtained with native and heat-inactivated (56 C, 20 min) serum. The reduced surface tension obtained in 5% CO2, as well as yet unidentified serum factors, promotes expression of CSH.
TI  - Everninomicin, a new oligosaccharide antibiotic: its antimicrobial activity, post-antibiotic effect and synergistic bactericidal activity.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of everninomicin (SCH) 27899) in comparison with two glycopeptides (vancomycin, teicoplanin) and six beta-lactam agents was evaluated against recent clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria. Everninomicin showed the highest activity against the species tested and MICs90% of everninomicin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Clostridium difficile were 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.39, 0.1 microgram/ml, respectively. MICs90% of everninomicin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) were 0.78 microgram/ml. Laboratory induced resistance to everninomicin in strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis occurred in a stepwise manner and at a very slow rate. Post-antibiotic effect against strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis were 1.8 and 2.6 h, respectively, and a little longer than that of vancomycin. Adherence to glass surface of an MRSA strain was strongly repressed by the addition of sub MIC of everninomicin in combination with fosfomycin.
TI  - Susceptibility of ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci to clinafloxacin.
AB  - Clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecalis obtained from the Ann Arbor Veterans Affairs Medical Center within the last decade were tested for susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and clinafloxacin. For MRSA isolates, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ciprofloxacin were several fold higher than those noted with clinafloxacin. Prior to the introduction of the fluoroquinolones (1984-1985), all MRSA isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin and clinafloxacin. By 1993, virtually all MRSA isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin and a 50-fold increase in the MIC50 and MIC90 for clinafloxacin was seen. In 1985-1986, most enterococcal isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin and clinafloxacin. By 1993, one-third of all enterococci were resistant to both ciprofloxacin and clinafloxacin. Fluoroquinolone resistance developed more quickly in enterococci that demonstrated high-level gentamicin resistance. Thus, cross-resistance between clinafloxacin and ciprofloxacin was seen; however, the lower MICs of clinafloxacin for MRSA may allow the use of this drug for some MRSA infections.
TI  - In-vitro antimycoplasmal activity of flurithromycin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of flurithromycin, a 14-membered macrolide drug, was found  to be similar to that of erythromycin against 41 strains of Mycoplasma spp. and 100 strains of Ureaplasma urealyticum. All 28 strains of Mycoplasma hominis were uniformly resistant to both macrolides with MICs > 256 mg/L, U. urealyticum showed intermediate resistance with MIC50s of 0.5 and 1 mg/L for erythromycin and flurithromycin, respectively, whereas the ten strains of Mycoplasma pneumonia were susceptible to < or = 0.03 mg/L of both macrolides.
TI  - The microbial flora in venous leg ulcers without clinical signs of infection. Repeated culture using a validated standardised microbiological technique.
AB  - The change of ulcer size in relation to the presence of species and quantities of microorganisms was analysed in 58 patients with venous leg ulcers, all without clinical signs of infection. Microbiological samples were taken on the day of inclusion and then repeated 4 times at monthly intervals or until the ulcer had healed or was too small to be cultured from. There was growth of microorganisms in all ulcers, and the numbers were below 10(4) per mm2 of ulcer surface in all cases. No correlation was found between ulcer size change and the species and amounts of microorganisms. Sixty-nine species were isolated. Staphylococcus aureus was found in 88%, Enterococcus faecalis in 74%, Enterobacter cloacae and Peptococcus magnus in 29%, and fungi in 11% of the samples. One or more obligate anaerobe species was found in 41% of the samples and in half of the ulcers and constituted 62% of all bacterial species. The colonising ulcer flora was markedly constant over time in the individual ulcers regardless of change in size. Resident bacterial species were found in 57 of the 58 ulcers. If all samples were considered, the microorganisms were associated with not more than one fifth of the variability in healing rate, as shown by linear multiple regression analysis. The same species of microorganisms were found in ulcers that decreased (or healed) and in those that increased in size. Although an association between the microorganisms and ulcer healing could not be ruled out in this study, there seems to be no indication for routinely performed culture in the absence of clinical signs of infection in venous leg ulcers.
TI  - Glycopeptides in the treatment of staphylococcal infections.
AB  - Gram-positive bacteria are rapidly becoming the most important pathogens in nosocomial infections. In recent years, attention and concern have been focused on the gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis. These microorganisms are well equipped to exert their pathogenic effects and to display virulence. Treatment of severe infections caused by gram-positive bacteria remains difficult because of the increase in infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci, and this has renewed interest in the glycopeptide antibiotics, vancomycin and teicoplanin. According to National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Study data, in 1989, 60% of coagulase-negative staphylococci and 22% of Staphylococcus aureus strains showed methicillin resistance. Among other factors, successful antimicrobial therapy depends on rapid and reliable antibiotic delivery to the infection site at a concentration adequate to inhibit the majority of infecting organisms. Glycopeptides may be important in the therapy of catheter-related infections, which are mainly caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Hospital-acquired infectious endocarditis not associated with cardiac surgery: an emerging problem.
AB  - To assess the most relevant features of hospital-acquired endocarditis, we conducted a retrospective study of cases of infectious endocarditis at a single university hospital from 1978 through 1992. During this period 248 episodes of infectious endocarditis were documented; 23 (9.3%) of these episodes were hospital-acquired and were not associated with cardiac surgery. (This figure represented a remarkable rise in the frequency of nosocomial endocarditis, only one case of which was identified among 101 cases of endocarditis treated at the same institution between 1960 and 1975.) In each of the 23 nosocomial cases, endocarditis was the result of bacteremia associated with a hospital-based procedure: intravenous catheterization (15 cases), instrumentation of a diseased urogenital tract (seven cases), or liver biopsy (one case). Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis were the predominant organisms isolated from intravenous catheters and the urogenital tract, respectively. Two of seven enterococcal isolates were highly resistant to gentamicin (MIC, > 2,000 micrograms/mL). Overall mortality was 56%. Two subsets of at-risk patients with different anatomic and clinical manifestations were identified. Our results emphasize that infectious endocarditis must be considered a serious nosocomial hazard against which preventive measures must be implemented.
TI  - Interpretive criteria and quality control parameters for testing bacterial susceptibility to the fluoroquinolone PD131628.
AB  - For testing bacterial susceptibility to PD131628, a 5-micrograms disk and the following tentative interpretive criteria may be used: > or = 19 mm for susceptible (MIC, < or = 1.0 micrograms/ml), 16 to 18 mm for intermediate (MIC, 2.0 micrograms/ml), and < or = 15 mm for resistant (MIC, > or = 4.0 micrograms/ml). For standard quality control strains, the following limits are proposed: for Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, zones of 31 to 41 mm or a MIC of 0.002 to 0.016 micrograms/ml; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, zones of 26 to 34 mm or a MIC of 0.12 to 0.5 micrograms/ml; for Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, zones of 27 to 33 mm; for Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, a MIC of 0.03 to 0.12 micrograms/ml; and for Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, a MIC of 0.12 to 0.5 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Characterization of an erythromycin resistance (erm) plasmid in Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Three erythromyxin-resistant Swedish isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, representing different T-types, were studied. Two of the strains showed constitutive high-level (MIC > 200 micrograms/ml) and one showed moderate (MIC 6.4 micrograms/ml) resistance; the latter strain was sensitive to lincosamide and clindamycin, and resistance was not induced by erythromycin. In each of the strains, a plasmid with an estimated Mw of 17.6 +/- 0.9 x 10(6) was isolated in addition to smaller cryptic plasmids. The three plasmids pSE701, pSE702, and pSE703 had very similar restriction enzyme cleavage patterns. Novobiocin curing of the high-level resistance strain ER559 showed the resistance to be linked to its 17.6 x 10(6) plasmid, pSE703. Furthermore, by electroporation this rather large plasmid was reintroduced into an erythromycin-sensitive cured derivative, acquiring resistance, and the plasmid was again recovered from the transconjugant. One of the plasmids, pSE702, was shown by filter mating to be conjugative within S. pyogenes. DNA-DNA hybridization showed that the resistance determinant of the present three isolates was related to the erm gene on plasmid pAM beta 1 of Enterococcus faecalis but not to that of plasmid pE194 of Staphylococcus aureus. The copy numbers of pSE702 and pSE703, derived from the two high-level resistant strains, were 11 +/- 3 and 17 +/- 5 compared to 2 +/- 1 for pSE701, derived from the moderately resistant strain, possibly accounting for the phenotypic variation observed. The plasmids pSE702 and pAM beta 1 showed about 80% homology in DNA-DNA hybridization tests and high similarity in their restriction maps.
TI  - [Clinical study of a new injectable cephem, FK037, for acute bacterial prostatitis].
AB  - FK037, a new injectable cephem antibiotic, was administered in the treatment of 13 acute bacterial prostatitis (mean age 53.5, range 30-79), and its effectiveness and safety were evaluated. The human prostatic fluid (PF) concentration of FK037 on 7 specimens 1 hour after 1 g i.v.d., was in the range of 0.87-7.47 micrograms/ml (mean +/- SD, 3.43 +/- 2.23 micrograms/ml), whereas, the serum concentration averaged 45.3 +/- 2.88 micrograms/ml, the ratio of PF/serum consequently being 0.08 +/- 0.05. In the clinical study, 1g of FK037 was administered to 13 patients by i.v.d. twice a day for 7-9 days. Bacteriological eradication on expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) was obtained for all clinical isolates which included 11 strains of Escherichia coli (MIC < or = 0.05 microgram/ml), 2 of Enterococcus faecalis, and each one of Staphylococcus aureus and Morganella morganii. Symptomatical cure was 100% in all cases. As for safety profile, no side effects were noted. In laboratory values, slight elevation of transaminase were detected in 3 cases, but they were transient and returned to normal 1-2 weeks after completion of the therapy. We conclude that FK037 is highly effective in the treatment of acute bacterial prostatitis, and is well tolerated in comparison with other relative antimicrobials.
TI  - Positive inotropic effect of Streptococcus faecalis in isolated cardiac muscle.
AB  - Infective endocarditis is caused by bacterial colonization of the endocardium. Because endocardium modulates mechanical performance of subjacent myocardium, we studied acute effects of bacteria on isolated cardiac muscle and on the functional role of the endocardium. Bacteria, grown in broth at 37 degrees C, were added at increasing concentrations (10(2) to 10(6) bacteria/ml) to cat papillary muscles in Krebs-Ringer solution (1.25 mM Ca2+, 35 degrees C). The endocardial surface was damaged by exposing muscles to a stream of dry air for 30 s. Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis induced significant increases in total peak isometric twitch tension (TT) and maximal velocity of unloaded shortening (Vmax) and significant decreases in time to TT (TtTT) and time to half isometric twitch tension decline (RT 1/2), both before and after removal of endocardial endothelium. This response could also be elicited with bacterial filtrate, after boiling the filtrate or after extracting the polysaccharides from it with KIO4. Increasing Ca2+ concentrations progressively reduced the response to the filtrate. Propranolol slightly, although not significantly, diminished the effects on TT and Vmax while abolishing the effects on TtTT and on RT 1/2. By contrast, Streptococcus bovis and Staphylococcus aureus did not affect TT or Vmax but induced a slight but significant decrease in TtTT at the highest concentration of bacteria. Accordingly, the filtrate of Strep. faecalis induces a positive inotropic effect. The active component is neither a protein nor a polysaccharide, and its effect may be partly beta-adrenoceptor mediated. Strep. bovis and Staph. aureus have negligible acute effects on contractility.
TI  - In vitro activity of SCE-2787, a new cephalosporin with potent activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The in vitro activity of SCE-2787, 7-[(Z)-2-(5-amino-1,2,4-thiadiazol-3- yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-(1-imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazinium)methy l-3- cephem-4-carboxylate, was compared with those of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and imipenem against recent clinical isolates. SCE-2787 inhibited 50% of tested isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae at < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. SCE-2787 was equally active as or more active than ceftazidime and ceftriaxone against members of the Enterobacteriaceae, with the exception of Proteus vulgaris. The MIC of SCE-2787 at which 90% of the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited was 2 micrograms/ml, two- to fourfold lower than those of imipenem and ceftazidime, respectively. SCE-2787, like ceftazidime and imipenem, did not inhibit the majority of strains of Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia. SCE-2787 inhibited beta-hemolytic streptococci at < or = 0.12 micrograms/ml, but it did not inhibit Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, or the anaerobic species tested. Methicillin-resistant staphylococci required SCE-2787 MICs of > or = 16 micrograms/ml, whereas methicillin-susceptible staphylococci were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. No difference between the MICs and MBCs was noted, except for P. aeruginosa, for which there was a fourfold difference. SCE-2787 was active over a pH range of 6 to 8. The inoculum size of 10(5) to 10(7) CFU caused only a twofold change in the MIC for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus but a 4- to 16-fold change in Enterobacter cloacae and P. aeruginosa. beta-Lactamases from Bush groups 1, 2a, and 2b did not hydrolyze SCE-2787. There was significant hydrolysis of SCE-2787 by the beta-lactamases designated 2b', i.e., TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-7, and TEM-9, and by the group 2d beta-lactamases. SCE-2787 had poor affinity for group 1 and group 2b enzymes and constitutively produced chromosomal beta-lactamases such as P-99 of Enterobacter cloacae and plasmid-mediated TEM-1 of E. coli. SCE-2787 has in vitro activity comparable to that of current parenteral cephalosporin and is more active against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of quaternized heteroxylans.
AB  - A series of quaternized D-xylan polysaccharides, differing in the structural features of their macromolecular backbone, were tested for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Activity was comparable with that of the cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, and depended on the degree of quaternization and the structural backbone of the derivatives.
TI  - Pacemaker endocarditis. Report of 44 cases and review of the literature.
AB  - We conducted a retrospective study to characterize the clinical course, microbiologic spectrum, and risk factors for endocarditis and for associated mortality in a large series of patients with documented pacemaker endocarditis. Using a computerized search through the medical records of 10 major hospitals in Israel from 1982 to 1992, and carefully reviewing the charts, we identified 44 patients with pacemaker endocarditis. The cases were categorized as definite (n = 25), probable (n = 12), or possible (n = 7) infective endocarditis based on strict case definition. Fever and chills were the most common symptoms. Increased ESR, leukocytosis, microscopic hematuria, and anemia were the most common laboratory findings. A relatively high proportion of the patients were diabetic. The most common source of endocarditis was infection acquired by the placement procedure or infection of the pacemaker pouch. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory features were similar to those of endocarditis patients of a similar age range without pacemakers, although the frequency of fever and chills was higher in our patients than in those patients and splenomegaly, vascular embolic phenomena, and new or changing murmurs were rare in our patients. The major pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, similar to other series of pacemaker-associated bacteremia and similar to the microbiologic findings of early prosthetic-valve endocarditis. However, this microbiologic profile is different from that of native-valve endocarditis. Although the present series did not show a statistically significant advantage to electrode removal over conservative treatment, when analyzed together with pooled data from other studies, it suggests that the surgical approach is preferable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefozopran in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefozopran (CZOP, SCE-2787), a newly developed parenteral cephem antibiotic, was  administered to children with bacterial infections. We determined its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety in these patients. 1. Antibacterial activity MICs of cefmetazole, ceftazidime, cefuzonam, flomoxef and CZOP were determined against a total of 19 strains. For Gram-positive cocci, MICs of CZOP ranged from 0.39 to 0.78 microgram/ml against Staphylococcus aureus (3 strains), from 0.05 to 6.25 micrograms/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae (5 strains), and 12.5 micrograms/ml against Enterococcus faecalis (1 strain). These MICs were generally similar to those of other cephems, but the MIC of CZOP against E. faecalis was lower than those of the other cephems examined. For Gram-negative bacilli, MICs of CZOP were 25 micrograms/ml against Citrobacter freundii (1 strain), and 6.25 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 strain). These values were similar to or lower than those of other cephems, MICs of CZOP against Haemophilus influenzae (7 strains) ranged from 0.1 to 0.39 microgram/ml. However, the MIC of CZOP against Serratia marcescens (1 strain) was higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and CZOP was as ineffective as the other cephems against this organism. 2. Pharmacokinetics CZOP was administered to children at 20 or 40 mg/kg via intravenous injection, and determinations were made for its serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using the bioassay. Serum concentrations at 30 minutes after administration were 60.4 micrograms/ml with a dose of 20 mg/kg to one patient and 93.9 and 99.0 micrograms/ml with 40 mg/kg to two patients. The corresponding half-lives were 1.55 hours for 20 mg/kg administration, and 1.10 and 3.41 hours for 40 mg/kg, while the AUCs were 136.5 micrograms.hr/ml for 20 mg/kg, and 194.4 and 264.5 micrograms.hr/ml for 40 mg/kg. The rates of urinary recovery in the first 8 hours after administration were 45.0% in the patient receiving 20 mg/kg, and 84.6 and 97.6% in the two patients receiving 40 mg/kg. The concentrations in the CSF determined in 3 patients with purulent meningitis ranged from 2.6 to 16.0 micrograms/ml 1 hour after administration, and the CSF/serum concentration ratio ranged from 6.5 to 39.0%. These values for pharmacokinetic parameters obtained in the bioassay were similar to those obtained using HPLC. 3. Clinical evaluation Forty-eight patients were clinically evaluated. Of these patients, 75% were less than 3 years of age and there were slightly more male children than female children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and expression in Escherichia coli of the low-affinity penicillin binding protein of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Low-affinity penicillin binding proteins are particular membrane proteins, in several Gram-positive bacteria, which are involved in beta-lactam antibiotic resistance. The structural gene for the low-affinity penicillin binding protein 5 (PBP5) of Enterococcus faecalis was cloned and sequenced. From the sequence of the 3378 bp, a 2040 bp coding region was identified. From biochemical analysis it emerges that E. faecalis PBP5 is a type II membrane protein with an uncleaved N-terminal and is composed of 679 amino acids with a molecular weight of 74055. This protein showed 48 and 33% of identity with Enterococcus hirae PBP5 and Staphylococcus aureus PBP2a, both low-affinity PBPs involved in beta-lactam resistance. Anti-PBP5 antibodies cross-reacted with a membrane protein present in other species of enterococci, but the entire gene fragment cloned hybridized only with DNAs of E. faecalis strains, thus suggesting that genes coding for low-affinity PBPs of enterococci are not strictly homologous. In this experiment digoxigenin-labelled E. faecalis DNA was used.
TI  - Interpretive criteria and quality control for antimicrobial susceptibility tests  of levofloxacin.
AB  - To confirm preliminary interpretive breakpoints for prototype 5 micrograms levofloxacin disks, 490 strains were tested in vitro using commercially manufactured disks. For in vitro susceptibility testing, 5 micrograms levofloxacin disks can be used with interpretive criteria of < or = 12 mm for resistant (MIC > or = 8.0 micrograms/ml) and > or = 16 mm for susceptible (MIC < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml). Proposed quality control limits for tests of levofloxacin are as follows: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, zones 29-37 mm or MIC 0.008-0.03 microgram/ml; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, zones 19-26 mm or MIC 0.5-2.0 micrograms/ml; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, zones 24-31 mm; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, MIC 0.06-0.25 microgram/ml and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, MIC 0.25-2.0 micrograms/ml.
TI  - IgG antibody response in bacterial endocarditis using ELISA with multiple antigens.
AB  - By means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) the antibody responses were detected in sera from normal persons (n = 275), patients with various types of bacteremia (n = 137), and patients with endocarditis (n = 28). Four ELISAs were evaluated. As antigens ultrasonic extracts of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and nonhemolytic streptococci were used. The antibody levels against S. aureus increased with age, while antibodies against the other bacteria showed no age variation. The different ELISA systems showed many serological cross-reactions. The ELISA in this limited material was 72% successful in identifying cases of bacterial endocarditis caused by S. aureus (diagnostic sensitivity 84%; diagnostic specificity 89%), while in other cases of bacterial endocarditis it was less successful.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activities of 2-oxaisocephems.
AB  - A series of 2-oxaisocephems with a thio-substituted methyl group at the 3-position and a 2-aminothiazol-4-yl moiety at the 7-position was synthesized via benzyl 3-acetyloxymethyl-7-azido-8- oxo-1-aza-4-oxabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylate (2), derived from benzyl acetoacetate (1). The new 2-oxaisocephems were tested for antibacterial activities. Among them, the derivatives having a [2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2- (Z)-cyclopentyloxyimino]acetamido group at the 7-position characteristically showed potent activities against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecalis as compared with cefuzonam and cefmenoxime, which are third-generation cephalosporins.
TI  - A lipoprotein signal peptide encoded by the staphylococcal conjugative plasmid pSK41 exhibits an activity resembling that of Enterococcus faecalis pheromone cAD1.
AB  - The traH gene of the staphylococcal conjugative plasmid pSK41 has recently been shown to encode a lipoprotein (N. Firth, K. P. Ridgway, M. E. Byrne, P. D. Fink, L. Johnson, I. T. Paulsen, and R. A. Skurray, Gene 136:13-25, 1993). Here we report that traH encodes a product recognized as a pheromone by Enterococcus faecalis cells harboring the conjugative plasmid pAD1. The mature traH product is not essential for this phenomenon, as expression of pheromone-like activity was found to require sequences encoding only the pro-TraH signal peptide.
TI  - Resistant gram-positive organisms.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance in Gram-positive bacteria has reemerged in the last decade as a major clinical problem. Methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-resistant pneumococci, and enterococci resistant to penicillin, vancomycin, and/or gentamicin have become new considerations in the selection of therapy. Both mutation and acquisition of new DNA on either the chromosome or plasmids can be responsible for resistance in Gram-positive species. Because therapies are often limited, renewed efforts are needed to understand the epidemiology in order to effect control.
TI  - N,N-dimethylglycyl-amido derivative of minocycline and 6-demethyl-6-desoxytetracycline, two new glycylcyclines highly effective against tetracycline-resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The in vitro activities of the N,N-dimethylglycyl-amino derivative of minocycline (DMG-MINO) and 6-dimethyl-6-dexoxytetracycline (DMG-DMDOT), members of a new generation of tetracyclines, were evaluated by an agar dilution method and were compared with those of tetracycline and minocycline against 224 tetracycline-resistant and 73 tetracycline-susceptible recent clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci, including multiple-antibiotic-resistant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The MICs of DMG-MINO and DMG-DMDOT were up to 500- to 2,000-fold lower than those of tetracycline against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC for 50% of strains tested [MIC50], < 0.06 microgram/ml). Against Streptococcus groups A, B, C, and G and Enterococcus faecalis, the MIC50 was 0.5 microgram/ml. MIC50s were greater only for coagulase-negative staphylococci (2 micrograms/ml). These data indicate that DMG-MINO and DMG-DMDOT are very potent drugs, and further in vitro and in vivo studies are warranted.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. SY5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Clostridium spp., and Bacteroides fragilis. Against Providencia spp., Proteus spp., and Haemophilus influenzae, SY5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. SY5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Enterococcus faecium, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. The bactericidal activities of SY5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the MICs for clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. SY5555 was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. However, SY5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by X. maltophilia (L-1) and P. aeruginosa/pMS354 beta-lactamases, two Bush group 3 beta-lactamases, SY5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from C. freundii GN7391 and E. cloacae GN7471 strains. These results suggest that SY5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Childhood bacteremia in Israel: causes, age relation, predisposing factors and source.
AB  - To delineate the spectrum of childhood bacteremia in a tertiary medical center in Israel and to define the historical, clinical and environmental variables that affect it, 339 bacteremic episodes were studied. Ten of the episodes (3%) were polymicrobial and 148 (44%) were hospital acquired. Staphylococcus epidermidis (17%), Staph. aureus (10%), gram-negative bacilli and Haemophilus influenzae (7%) were the most frequent etiologic pathogens. Some organisms (e.g., H. influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae) caused mainly community-acquired bacteremia, while Klebsiella sp., Enterococcus faecalis, and Acinetobacter sp. caused mainly nosocomial bacteremia. Underlying conditions were noted in 72% of the bacteremic children. A source of the bacteremia was identified in 60% of the episodes; the most common was i.v.-line infection. Age, underlying condition, source and location in the hospital markedly affected the profile of microorganisms causing childhood bacteremia. Each of these variables defined 3-5 organisms that were most prominent. In each episode of suspected bacteremia, these variables should be considered, thus defining the most likely causative pathogen(s), which should be covered by appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on combined effects of fosfomycin plus sulbactam/cefoperazone for mixed infections of MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa].
AB  - The time-lag/sequential/step by step chemotherapy by fosfomycin plus sulbactam/cefoperazone including a short time small dose of steroid was done for 27 severely infected patients suffered from various cancer or other severe basal diseases. And the staggered "intensive" chemotherapy with added arbekacin or vancomycin to the previous staggered chemotherapy was done against 13 severely infected patients having MRSAs among their infecting pathogens. 1. Bacteriological effects Pseudomonas aeruginosa 6/8, Staphylococcus epidermidis 5/5, Enterococcus faecalis 3/6, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus 2/2, Klebsiella pneumoniae 2/2, MRSA 2/2, Xanthomonas maltophilia 2/3 and other 10/10 were eradicated (84.2%) by the staggered chemotherapy and MRSA 7/13, P. aeruginosa 3/4, E. faecalis 3/5, A. calcoaceticus 2/2, X. maltophilia 1/1 and others 2/2 were eradicated (53.8% in MRSA, 78.6% in others and 66.7% in total) and 3 of MRSAs were colonized. 2. Clinical effects 1) Staggered chemotherapy: Excellent 18/27, good 8/27, fair 1/27, poor 0/27 (96.3%). 2) Staggered "intensive" chemotherapy: Excellent 6/13, good 4/13, fair 2/13, poor 1/13 (76.9%) in total: excellent 60.0%, efficacy rate 90.0%.
TI  - Glycothiohexides, novel antibiotics produced by "Sebekia" sp. LL-14E605. I. Taxonomy, fermentation and biological evaluation.
AB  - The new glycothiohexide antibiotics, which are related to nosiheptide, were identified in fermentations of an actinomycete belonging to the genus "Sebekia". Strain LL-14E605 was classified as a "Sebekia" based on the presence of both mesodiaminopimelic acid and madurose in the cell wall and the presence of pseudosporangia encasing the spores. Culture LL-14E605 was successfully fermented in 10 to 3,000 liters of a complex medium. Antibiotic activity closely followed cell mass accumulation and usually peaked after 4 to 5 days of incubation. Glycothiohexide alpha demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against Gram-positive bacteria with MICs of 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. However, glycothiohexide alpha failed to protect mice against a lethal challenge with Staphylococcus aureus Smith unless it was administered prior to challenge.
TI  - Gas gangrene following sacral pressure sores.
AB  - We report two cases of gas gangrene developed from sacral pressure sores. The first case was clostridial and the second, non-clostridial gas gangrene. Both patients died within two months. The first patient, a 56-year-old woman suffering from palsy of the lower half of the body for 3 weeks, developed a sacral pressure sore. One month later, crepitus by palpation and gas formation in the X-ray film were detected in the hip and right thigh. A culture of odoriferous pus yielded Clostridium limosum in addition to Staphylococcus intermedius, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides fragilis. Blood culture yielded Bacteroides fragilis. The patient died 50 days after admission in spite of surgical debridement and aggressive therapy with high doses of antibiotics and hyperbaric oxygen. The second patient, a 70-year-old man suffering from diabetic nephropathy, arteriosclerosis obliterans of the lower limbs, and cerebral infarction, developed a large decubitus ulcer covering the whole sacral area. Crepitus and gas were detected in the soft tissue of the left gluteal region. Almost the entire gluteus maximus muscle was necrotic. Bacteroides fragilis, methicillin-resistant or -sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were isolated from the muscle. Bacteroides fragilis was also obtained by blood culture. The patient died on the 72nd day after admission.
TI  - [Method of DNA extraction and mecA, femA and PBP2' in multi-drug resistant bacterial strains].
AB  - Recently, it has become more important to establish rapid and reliable methods for identifying bacterial species and their drug resistances because of the high incidence of nosocomial infection caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria. At first, several enzymes were tested to evaluate the efficacy of DNA extraction. N-acetylmuramidase, lysozyme and achromopeptidase were most effective to extract DNA from E. faecalis, E. faecium and S. aureus, respectively. After achromopeptidase extraction, the mecA gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in clinically isolated MRSA (95 strains), MSSA (66), MRSE (methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, 37), MSSE (methicillin-sensitive S. epidermidis, 1), S haemolyticus(5), S.hominis(1) and others (Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, and Streptococcus, total 45). PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The positive rates were 95% (MRSA), 1.5% (MSSA), and 97% (MRSE). The mecA gene was also positive in 2/2 of methicillin-resistant S.haemolyticus and 2/3 of methicillin-sensitive S.haemolyticus and 1/1 of methicillin-resistant S.hominis. The mecA gene was not detected in 45 non-Staphylococcal strains. MecA and femA gene by PCR and PBP 2' by IRMA were further detected in newly isolated MRSA (20 strains), MSSA(20), MRSE(14), MSSE(1) and S.simulans(2). Complete correlation between MPIPC susceptibility and mecA were found. The femA gene was positive in 39/40 of S. aureus, and 0/14 of S.epidermidis, 2/3 of S.simulans. PBP2' were positive in 20/20 of MRSA, 0/20 of MSSA, 14/14 of MRSE, 0/1 of MSSE, 1/1 of methicillin-resistant S.simulans, and 0/2 of methicillin-sensitive S.simulans. In conclusion, diagnoses of MRSA by simultaneous detection of mecA and femA gene as well as PBP2' are similarly useful because of their specificity and rapidity.
TI  - In-vitro activity of four new fluoroquinolones.
AB  - The in-vitro activities of four new fluoroquinolones, E-4749, E-4874, E-4884 and  E-4904, were compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 1106 clinical isolates. Against majority of Enterobacteriaceae, general antibacterial activities of E-4749 (MIC90s 0.06-1 mg/L), E-4874 (MIC90s, 0.03-0.25 mg/L) and E-4884 (MIC90s 0.01-0.5 mg/L) were comparable or slightly lower than those of ciproloxacin (MIC90s 0.01-0.25 mg/L) and sparfloxacin (MIC90s 0.01-1 mg/L). The activity of E-4904 (MIC90s 0.06-2 mg/L) was lower than those of its analogues. Most of the Escherichia coli which were resistant to ciprofloxacin (MIC > or = 2 mg/L) and Serratia spp., were resistant to the new fluoroquinolones. beta-Lactamase producing strains of Moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible to these compounds (MICs < or = 0.008 mg/L). Most of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, non-aeruginosa Pseudomonas spp., Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Acinetobacter spp. were resistant to the new quinolones (MIC90s 8- > 16 mg/L). On the contrary, these new antimicrobials were active against the majority of the Aeromonas spp. (MIC90s < or = 0.5 mg/L). E-4749, E-4874, E-4884 and E-4904 remained active (MIC90s < or = 0.25 mg/L) against Staphylococcus aureus strains susceptible to methicillin. However, its activity was two- to eight-fold lower than that of ciprofloxacin (MIC90 0.03 mg/L) and sparfloxacin (MIC90 0.06 mg/L). Against S. aureus resistant to methicillin or ciprofloxacin, activity of these new compounds and comparators agents, was very low (MIC90s 2- > 16 mg/L). Most of the strains of Enterococcus faecalis were resistant (MIC90s > 16 mg/L). The activity of E-4874, E-4904 and sparfloxacin (MIC90 1 mg/L for each one) was higher than that of the rest of the agents tested. E-4874 (MIC90 0.25 mg/L) was four-fold more active than the other antibacterials tested (MIC90 2 mg/L) against Listeria monocytogenes. No new quinolone was active against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90s 4-16 mg/L), Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (MIC90s 8- > 16 mg/L), and other B. fragilis group (MIC90s 16- > 16 mg/L). Ciprofloxacin (MIC90s > 16 mg/L), and sparfloxacin (MIC90s 8-16 mg/L) also were inactive. E-4874 (MIC90 4 mg/L) was the most active quinolone tested against B.fragilis.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of a new carbapenem antibiotic, biapenem (L-627), in the pediatric field].
AB  - Biapenem (L-627) was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in 27 children with various bacterial infections. L-627 was effective in cases with osteomyelitis due to Staphylococcus aureus, pneumonia and purulent meningitis due to penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and urinary tract infections due to Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, L-627 failed to produce good responses in 2 of 7 cases of Haemophilus influenzae infections. Pharmacokinetic parameters of 30-minutes infusion of 12 mg/kg were as follows: Cmax 29-46 micrograms/ml, T 1/2 0.68-0.94 hr. Adverse reactions were minimal. These data suggest that L-627 is safe in children, and is valuable especially for treatment of infections in immunocompromised hosts and infections due to multiply resistant bacteria.
TI  - Identification of gram positive cocci isolated from urine.
AB  - A total of 195 strains of Gram positive cocci isolated from urine, in pure culture and in counts of > 10(3) colony forming units/ml, during January-September 1992, were speciated using schema recently described by Facklam and Washington, and Kloos and Lambe. Seventy three (85%) of the 86 enterococci were identified as Enterococcus faecalis while 11 (13%) were E. faecium. Eighteen (29%) of the 62 staphylococcal isolates were Staphylococcus aureus; 20 (45%) of the 44 coagulase negative staphylococci were speciated as Staph. haemolyticus. Of the 47 strains of beta haemolytic streptococci isolated, 45 (96%) were group B; one was group G and the other group F. Our results show the diverse species of Gram positive cocci associated with bacteriuria and the need to speciate them in a diagnostic laboratory. In the context of a larger number of tests required for the speciation of Gram positive cocci, we recommend a simplified scheme which we found feasible on a routine basis.
TI  - Determinations of minimum bactericidal concentrations, kill curves, and postantibiotic effects with the Etest technology.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of antimicrobial agents is generally determined following broth dilution minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) procedures. These methods are cumbersome, require advanced technical experience, and lack proven reproducibility. Etest (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) is a predefined antimicrobial gradient on a plastic carrier strip that is used to generate a precise MIC on an agar plate. A pilot study was conducted to investigate whether a drug's bactericidal effect could be assessed by transferring the "growth-inhibition pattern" from the Etest MIC ellipse onto a drug-free agar plate. The transfer was performed using four techniques of replica plating, a filter method, drug inactivation, and sampling of growth alongside the Etest strip. Defined antimicrobial-organism models were used to determine the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs), killing curves (KCs), and postantibiotic effects (PAEs) of several drugs. Preliminary results suggest that the Etest provides an alternative method for studies determining the MBCs, KCs, and PAEs of various antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Plasmids designed to alter the antibiotic resistance expressed by insertion mutations in Bacillus subtilis, through in vivo recombination.
AB  - Numerous insertion mutations conferring resistance to antibiotics are available in Bacillus subtilis. However, many of them have been constructed in vitro by inserting genes from the Staphylococcus aureus plasmids, pC194 or pE194, conferring resistance to chloramphenicol (Cm) or erythromycin (Er). Others are insertions of the Enterococcus faecalis Tn917 transposon conferring resistance to Er. This paucity of resistance markers has been limiting the possibilities of constructing and studying mutants carrying two or more of these mutations in the past. We constructed plasmids which can be used to change the antibiotic resistance expressed by preexisting chromosomal insertions, through transformation and homologous recombination. These vectors replace the pre-existing resistance to Cm or Er with new resistances to neomycin (Nm), phleomycin (Pm), spectinomycin (Sp) or tetracycline (Tc).
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, FK037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between January 1992 and June 1993. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis. FK037 was superior in potency to ceftazidime against all strains except E. faecalis, P. anaerobius and P. bivia. It was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and P. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. FK037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against MRSA, S. agalactiae and E. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except G. vaginalis and B. fragilis that were 4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to FK037.
TI  - In vitro activities of two glycylcyclines.
AB  - The in vitro activities of two glycylcyclines, CL 329,998 and CL 331,002 (two new semisynthetic tetracyclines), were evaluated in comparison with those of tetracycline and other available oral antimicrobial agents. A total of 523 recent clinical isolates were studied, including strains resistant to tetracycline. Members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were generally > or = 16-fold more susceptible to the glycylcyclines than to tetracycline (although less difference was seen with Proteus spp.). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was modestly susceptible to both new compounds (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 16 micrograms/ml). Tetracycline- and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus were all susceptible to the glycylcyclines (MIC90 < or = 1 microgram/ml). Streptococci (including Streptococcus pneumoniae) and Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium displayed a bimodal distribution of susceptibility to tetracycline yet were uniformly susceptible to the glycylcyclines (MIC90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). The glycylcyclines were highly potent against Neisseria, Moraxella, Haemophilus, and Bacteroides spp. (MIC90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). Strains of Chlamydia spp. (three C. trachomatis strains and one C. pneumoniae strain) were inhibited by < or = 0.25 microgram of CL 329,998 or CL 331,002 per ml. Two strains of Mycoplasma pneumoniae were inhibited by < or = 0.12 microgram of CL 331,002 per ml and by 1 microgram of CL 329,998 per ml. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium were resistant to the two glycylcyclines (MIC > or = 8 micrograms/ml). These results indicate that the two glycylcyclines have potent in vitro activities against a wide range of clinically important pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Contaminated rabbit patellar tendon grafts. In vivo analysis of disinfecting methods.
AB  - In Part 1 of our study, 40 central-third bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts were harvested from 20 adult California White rabbits under strict sterile conditions. Ten grafts were placed directly into a thioglycolate broth, incubated, and subcultured; no growth was noted in any specimen. The next 6 grafts were contaminated 20 seconds each with 2 different species of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Organisms were grown with cultures obtained from an operating room floor during anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Marked growth of both species was noted in all 6 grafts within 24 hours. A subsequent 3 series of 8 grafts each were harvested sterilely, contaminated as described above, and soaked in 1 of 3 solutions 30 minutes before culture. Both 10% povidone-iodine and a triple-antibiotic solution (gentamicin, clindamycin, polymyxin) were 100% ineffective as both organisms grew; 4% chlorhexidine gluconate effectively decontaminated 8 grafts in all cases. Part 2 involved contamination of harvested grafts with 5 common, virulent organisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. Elimination of all except Klebsiella pneumoniae was successful with 4% chlorhexidine gluconate alone for 8 grafts. Using a triple-antibiotic solution after chlorhexidine gluconate in 6 grafts eliminated this organism also.
TI  - Minimum inhibitory concentration quality-control guidelines for biapenem, DU-6859a, FK-037, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, and ceftizoxime when using various National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards susceptibility test methods. Quality Control Study Group.
AB  - Several multilaboratory collaborative studies using broth microdilution and agar  dilution (gonococcal tests only) methods of susceptibility testing were performed to establish quality-control (QC) giudelines. Replicate dilution tests with multiple lots of media were performed with National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards recommended QC strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213) by using the following antimicrobials: biapenem, DU-6859a, FK-037, levofloxacin, and grepafloxacin. In addition QC MIC ranges, using appropriate medium modification for Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ATCC 49226 were reported on four (DU-6859a, FK-037, levofloxacin, and grepafloxacin) and two (ceftizoxime and FK-037) antimicrobials, respectively.
TI  - [Determination of the susceptibility of staphylococci and enterococci to plycopeptides by the E-test method].
AB  - E-test was evaluated by comparison with the reference agar dilution method on 15  enterococci and 15 staphylococci with variable resistance to glycopeptides and isolated from clinical samples: 15 enterococci with 3 glycopeptide-resistant (2 E. facalis and 1 E. faecium), 1 glycopeptide intermediate E. gallinarum and 11 glycopeptide-sensible E. faecalis; 15 staphylococci with 4 teicoplanine-resistant (1 S. aureus, 1 S. epidermidis and 2 S. hominis), 3 teicoplanin-intermediate (1 S. epidermidis, 2 S. haemolyticus) and 8 teicoplanin sensible strains (6 S. aureus, 1 S. epidermidis and 1 S. hominis). Repeatability (10 determinations by strain) and exactitude were tested for all strains. Our data shows very good results for repeatability and exactitude with the reference method except in the case of coagulase negative staphylococci and teicoplanin. Some technical problems appear in our experience: for staphylococci, a 48 h incubation is necessary to detect teicoplanin-intermediate strains but 24 h is sufficient for enterococci. E-test is expensive, require a strict methodology, but is a good method to detect glycopeptide resistance for staphylococci and enterococci except for coagulase negative staphylococci and teicoplanine.
TI  - Molecular requirements for the inhibition of the tetracycline antiport protein and the effect of potent inhibitors on the growth of tetracycline-resistant bacteria.
AB  - Forty-seven compounds and tetracycline (Tc) structural analogues were tested for  their ability to interfere with [3H]Tc uptake in everted inner membrane vesicles derived from Tc-resistant Escherichia coli D1-209, bearing the class B tetracycline resistance efflux protein (Tet protein). For effective inhibition of Tc uptake, the molecule had to have an intact ABCD tetracyclic carbon skeleton and a conjugated phenolic beta-diketone substructure at positions 10-12a with the subsequent development of keto-enol tautomerization. Molecular variations at carbon positions 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 did not decrease, and some increased, the inhibitory activity as compared to that of Tc. Among these compounds, the highest inhibition of uptake occurred with certain position 6 and 13 derivatives of 5-hydroxytetracycline. In a group of 13-(propylthio) derivatives of 5-OH-Tc [13-propyl, 13-(3-chloropropyl), and 13-(2-carboxyethyl)] there was a correlation between uptake inhibitory activity and antibacterial activity. The 13-(3-chloropropyl) derivative, with the best efflux inhibitory activity, exhibited synergistic activity when tested in combination with doxycycline against Tc-resistant E. coli bearing the class A or B determinant, against Staphylococcus aureus bearing class K, and against Enterococcus faecalis bearing the class L determinant. The 13-propyl analogue also showed high transport blocking activity and showed synergistic antibacterial activity against E. coli bearing the class A determinant and additive activity against the other Tc-resistant bacteria. The synergistic antibacterial activity of these compounds was not shown by the 13-[(2-carboxyethyl)thio] homologue, whose efflux blocking activity was 70-fold less. These findings suggest that multiple sites on the Tc molecule are available for synthetic modification toward the development of an effective Tc blocking agent. Such compounds, used alone or in combination with a standard tetracycline, show improved antibacterial activity.
TI  - In vitro resistance to platelet microbicidal protein correlates with endocarditis source among bacteremic staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates.
AB  - Traditionally, platelets have been thought to contribute to the induction and propagation of infective endocarditis (IE). However, recent studies suggest that platelets may potentially mitigate IE via secretion of alpha-granule-derived platelet microbicidal protein (PMP). In this study, we compared the PMP susceptibility of bacteremic isolates from patients with and without IE. Isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n = 17), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS; n = 28), viridans streptococci (VS; n = 54), and Enterococcus faecalis (n = 20), each at a final inoculum of 2 x 10(3) CFU/ml, were exposed to PMP [100 U/ml, (5 micrograms/ml)] for 2 h, and the percent survival was determined. For S. aureus, CNS, and VS isolates, there was a significant correlation between an IE source and increased percent survival post-PMP exposure; the mean percent survivals of S. aureus, CNS, and VS were significantly greater for IE versus non-IE isolates (P < 0.005 for each organism). No significant correlation was observed between the source of bacteremic E. faecalis isolates and PMP susceptibility. These data suggest that staphylococcal and VS (but not enterococcal) resistance to PMP may facilitate either the induction or progression of IE.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of AM-1155, a novel 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of AM-1155 against a wide variety of clinical isolates was compared with those of other fluoroquinolones. The MICs of AM-1155 for 90% of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis isolates tested were 0.10, 0.39, and 0.78 microgram/ml, respectively. The antibacterial activity of AM-1155 against gram-positive bacteria and anaerobes was comparable to those of sparfloxacin and tosufloxacin. AM-1155 inhibited 90% of most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of 0.39 microgram/ml. AM-1155 generally had activity comparable to that of sparfloxacin against gram-negative bacteria. AM-1155 showed moderate activity against methicillin- and quinolone-resistant S. aureus. AM-1155 demonstrated bactericidal activity at the MIC. The frequency of occurrence of spontaneous mutants resistant to four times the MIC of AM-1155 was < 1 x 10(9) for S. aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. AM-1155 strongly inhibited the supercoiling activities of DNA gyrases purified from E. coli and S. aureus.
TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates from urinary tract to antimicrobial agents in Japan, 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of urinary tract isolates to antimicrobial agents examined at 123 hospital laboratories in Japan from September to December in 1991. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory. The susceptibility testing was performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. MRSA showed high resistance rates to all agents tested except to minocycline (MINO). MSSA had good susceptibility to imipenem (IPM) and cephalosporins with susceptibility rates higher than 90%. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to IPM, ampicillin and piperacillin (PIPC) and highly resistant to cephalosporins, gentamicin (GM), erythromycin, clindamycin and MINO. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs, GM and ofloxacin (OFLX). High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii to IPM, GM, and OFLX and of Serratia marcescens for IPM and GM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were highly susceptible to IPM, ceftazidime, AMK, cefsulodin, cefoperazone, PIPC in this order.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of tosufloxacin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of tosufloxacin (TFLX) was compared with those of other new quinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin and fleroxacin) against clinical isolates. These isolates had been collected from May to June 1993 (22 species, 260 strains) and from June to July 1992 (Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 87 strains) in Toyama municipal hospital. TFLX showed the most potent activities against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli in 1993, at MIC50 levels. The MIC50's of TFLX for these species ranged from 0.025 to 0.39 microgram/ml. TFLX showed potent activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, and the MIC50's of TFLX were 0.05 and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. However, new quinolone resistant strains (MIC > or = 6.25 micrograms/ml) were found among some species. Especially, the number of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains resistant to new quinolone exceeded 60% of all the S. aureus isolates in 1993. More MRSA strains resistant to new quinolones were isolated in 1993 than in 1992, and similar result was observed for P. aeruginosa. The coagulase typing was done, and all MRSA strains of resistant to new quinolones produced coagulase type II.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefdinir (FK482) and ten other antibiotics against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from adult and pediatric patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefdinir, an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin was compared with that of cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, ampicillin, vancomycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 279 gram-positive and gram-negative recent clinical isolates from adult and pediatric patients. Cefdinir was the most active drug among the cephalosporins against oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90 0.015-2 mg/l). Cefixime was the most active agent against Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris (MIC90 < 0.015-0.125 mg/l). The activity of cefpodoxime was better than that of cefixime against S. pneumoniae and oxacillin-sensitive staphylococci (MIC90 0.25-8 vs. 0.5-32 mg/l), similar to cefixime against S. pyogenes (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) and not as good as cefixime against H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. (MIC90 < 0.015-0.25 vs. 0.125-0.5 mg/l). The activity of cefdinir was greater than that of the other cephalosporins against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 16-32 vs. > 64 mg/l). None of the cephalosporins were active against methicillin-resistant, coagulase-positive or -negative staphylococci or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 > 64 mg/l). Overall, the susceptibilities of adult and pediatric isolates were similar. Kinetic kill curves demonstrated rapid and similar killing at 6 h by cefdinir, cefixime, cefpodoxime and ofloxacin. At 24 h at 1 x MIC, the least regrowth was observed with cefdinir and cefpodoxime; at 2 x MIC, suppression of growth was similar with all four drugs.
TI  - Bactericidal properties of crude extracts of Mitracarpus villosus.
AB  - Mature leaves and inflorescence of Mitracarpus villosus, collected from Niger State, Nigeria, were shade dried over a period of 5 days, ground into fine particles in a Waring blender and extracted individually with hot distilled water and 95% ethanol. The crude extracts obtained were tested for their in vitro antibacterial activities using agar diffusion and tube dilution techniques. The extracts produced zones of inhibition (8-23 mm) against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus faecalis, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis were not inhibited. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the effective extracts were in the range 0.06-8.0 mg/ml, while the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were in the range 0.06-32.0 mg/ml. The ethanolic extracts appeared to exert more inhibitory action against the bacteria than the hot water extracts.
TI  - Cefepime: a new fourth-generation cephalosporin.
AB  - The chemistry, pharmacology, antimicrobial spectrum, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and dosage of cefepime are reviewed. Fourth-generation cephalosporins, such as cefepime, have a quaternary nitrogen that is positively charged at the 3-position, providing the properties of a zwitterion. A 2-aminothiazolyl-acetamido group in the side chain at the 7-position with an alpha-oxyimino substitution may enhance stability against beta-lactamases by preventing the enzymes' approach to the main nucleus. Cefepime may exert its antimicrobial effect by attaching to specific penicillin-binding proteins, disrupting cell-wall synthesis. Cefepime has good activity against gram-positive organisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus, and gram-negative organisms, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefepime is not active in vitro against Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium difficile, and methicillin- and cefazolin-resistant Staph. aureus. Cefepime's activity against gram-negative organisms is similar to that of most third-generation cephalosporins. The agent has poor activity against Bacteroides species. The most common mechanism of resistance to cefepime is the excess production of beta-lactamases. Maximum peak plasma concentrations are two to three times higher after i.v. administration than after intramuscular administration. In healthy adults, the volume of distribution is 13-22 L and the elimination half-life is 2-2.3 hours. Clinical studies show that cefepime is as effective as cefotaxime or ceftazidime in patients with infections of the lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structures, urinary tract, or female reproductive system. Cefepime reduces fever as effectively as ceftazidime or piperacillin plus gentamicin in neutropenic patients. The most common adverse effects of cefepime are headache (2.4%), nausea (1.8%), rash (1.8%), and diarrhea (1.7%). Depending on creatinine clearance, the dosage of cefepime is 1000-2000 mg i.v. every 8-24 hours for life-threatening infections and 500-2000 mg i.v. every 12-24 hours for severe infections. Cefepime's clinical efficacy is comparable to that of ceftazidime and cefotaxime.

TI  - Survey of bacteraemia in a Spanish hospital over a decade (1981-1990).
AB  - The aetiology, epidemiology and in-vitro antibiotic susceptibility of bacteraemic isolates in a Spanish hospital, over a decade (1981-1990), were reviewed. A total of 4363 possible episodes were microbiologically confirmed (incidence: 15.7 cases per 1000 admissions). A slight increase in the number of Gram-positive cocci and anaerobes over the last 4 years was found. The most frequent species (annual range) were: Escherichia coli (13.5%-18.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.5%-17.8%), Klebsiella spp. (3.0%-9.4%), Enterococcus faecalis (3.0%-8.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%-5.8%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1.8%-5.6%). Males were more affected than females (ratio 1.7:1). The portal of entry was known in 2126 episodes, of which the most frequent were urinary and gasto-intestinal tracts (24.4% and 19.4% respectively). Bacteraemia was associated with rapidly and ultimately fatal underlying diseases in 7.2% and 15.1% of the cases respectively. The hospital location of patients was: medical ward 46.0%, surgical ward 22.7%, paediatric ward 16.9%, and intensive care unit 14.4%.
TI  - Molecular characterization of a plasmid-borne (pGT633) erythromycin resistance determinant (ermGT) from Lactobacillus reuteri 100-63.
AB  - Lactobacillus reuteri 100-63 contains a 9.8 kb plasmid (pGT633) encoding resistance to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) type B antibiotics. The restriction endonucleases AccI, BamHI, BclI, EcoRI, EcoRV, HhaI, HindII, HpaI, KpnI, SalI, and SspI were employed to establish a physical map of pGT633. Next, genetic transfer experiments were conducted to establish the host range of pGT633. The results revealed that pGT633 replicated autonomously and encoded constitutive resistance to erythromycin in a variety of bacterial hosts, including Bacillus subtilis BD170, Streptococcus sanguis DL1, Staphylococcus aureus RN4220, and Enterococcus faecalis 19433, as well as several Lactobacillus spp. A 2.2 kb BamHI fragment of pGT633 containing the genetic determinant (ermGT) encoding resistance to erythromycin was cloned into Escherichia coli. Determination of the nucleotide sequence of ermGT revealed a methylase gene 731 bp in length that was highly related (ca. 81% nucleotide and ca. 78% amino acid identity) to the ermC gene from S. aureus plasmid pE194. The leader sequences of ermGT and ermC were identical except for a single base change at nt 51.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activities of broad spectrum quinolones against clinical  bacterial isolates].
AB  - In vitro activities of broad-spectrum quinolones (sparfloxacin (SPFX), ciprofloxacin (CPFX), lomefloxacin (LFLX), fleroxacin (FLRX), and levofloxacin (LVFX) were examined against clinical bacterial isolates: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae). Antibacterial activities of SPFX, CPFX, and LVFX against Gram-negative bacteria such as K. pneumoniae, M. (B) catarrhalis and H. influenzae were better than those of FLRX and LFLX. SPFX showed the highest activity against all Gram-positive bacteria tested in this study. However, strains showed high MIC (> or = 16 micrograms/ml) to SPFX were found among MRSA, E. faecalis, and E. faecium, whose isolation frequencies were 28.6%, 10.0%, and 6.7%, respectively. The results of this study suggest that resistant strains of Gram-positive bacteria against new quinolone might increase among clinical isolates.
TI  - Postantibiotic effect of DU-6859a and levofloxacin as compared with ofloxacin.
AB  - The postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for two of the newer fluoroquinolones: DU-6859a and levofloxacin. All drugs (including ofloxacin control) had good PAE activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Only DU-6859a had PAE test conditions (< or = 0.5 mu/ml) that coincided with achievable clinical concentrations for all organisms tested. These data indicate that levofloxacin, like ofloxacin (PAEs, 1.0-2.9 h), could be administered once or twice daily and that the dosing of DU-6859a (PAEs, 1.6-2.4 h) might be extended to once every 24 h because of its documented PAE and its potency advantages as compared with levofloxacin and ofloxacin.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced antistaphylococcal activity and beta-lactamase stability.
AB  - Cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced beta-lactamase stability, was tested by microbroth dilution against respiratory, urogenital, and skin and skin-structure bacterial pathogens. Included were beta-lactamase (beta LAC)-producing and -nonproducing isolates. Activity was compared with that of other orally administered beta-lactams. Cefdinir minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates MIC90s (microgram/ml) were < or = 0.5 versus beta LAC+/oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus, aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus; < or = 0.06 versus Streptococcus groups A and B, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae beta LAC+; 0.125 versus S. pneumoniae penicillin-susceptible and Proteus mirabilis beta LAC+; 0.25 versus beta LAC+ versus strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and K. oxytoca; 0.5 versus Haemophilus influenzae beta LAC-; 1 versus H. influenzae beta LAC+; 4 versus Legionella pneumophila beta LAC+; and 8 versus Enterococcus faecalis beta LAC-strains. Cefdinir was equally effective against both standard and high inocula of S. aureus strains producing A, B, C, or D beta LAC types. MICs were also generated versus quality-control reference strains.
TI  - Characterization of a Tn925-induced mutant of Staphylococcus aureus altered in exoprotein production.
AB  - An insertional mutant was isolated from a bovine Staphylococcus aureus strain after membrane-mating with a Streptococcus faecalis strain carrying conjugative plasmid pCF10::Tn925. This mutant, designated RC128, showed enhanced production of alpha-hemolysin and proteases and decreased production of coagulase, extracellular protein A, DNase, lipase and delta-hemolysin. No difference was found in the production of beta-hemolysin. Both, Southern blot analysis and transfer of the pleiotropic mutant phenotype by transduction, indicated that the mutation was originated from a single insertion of transposon Tn925. The LD50 determined by intraperitoneal administration in mice showed that mutant RC128 was slightly less virulent than its parental strain.
TI  - Prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance in Europe. Study Group 'Bacterial Resistance' of the Paul-Ehrlich-Society for Chemotherapy e. V.
AB  - Since 1984, when the first fluoroquinolone, norfloxacin, was marketed in Europe,  there has been a marked increase in the usage of this class of drugs. In order to evaluate the influence of this drug usage on the prevalence of resistance to fluoroquinolones in clinical isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Enterococcus faecalis we reviewed the susceptibility data from four collaborative surveys conducted between 1983 and 1990 by the Study Group 'Bacterial Resistance' of the Paul-Ehrlich-Society for Chemotherapy. All participating laboratories used the same standardized methods. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by the broth microdilution method. More than 20,000 bacterial strains were tested. The results are presented for ciprofloxacin, which is regarded as the representative of the fluoroquinolones. Using > or = 4 mg/l as a breakpoint for resistance to ciprofloxacin, the prevalence of resistant strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae in Central Europe between 1983 and 1990 remained below 1%. In contrast, the resistance rates in P. aeruginosa were 0.7%, 1.0%, 3.8% and 7.0%, in S. aureus 0%, 0.5%, 6.6% and 6.8%, and in E. faecalis 2.2%, 0.7%, 4.9% and 7.7% in 1983, 1986, 1989 and 1990, respectively. The latest study carried out in cooperation with 78 laboratories from 12 European countries revealed great differences in the prevalence of resistance to fluoroquinolones from one species to another ranging from 0% with Proteus vulgaris and Salmonella spp. to 26.7% with Providencia stuartii.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Agar disk diffusion (Bauer-Kirby) tests with various fastidious and nonfastidious reference (ATCC) strains: comparison of several agar media.
AB  - Several agar media (Mueller-Hinton agar, MHA; diagnostic sensitivity test agar, DSTA; Schaedler agar, SchA; Todd-Hewitt agar with added yeast extract, THYA; Wilkins-Chalgren agar, WCA) were compared using the Bauer-Kirby agar disk diffusion test against six nonfastidious quality control strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and ATCC 29213, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and ATCC 35218, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212. MHA, DSTA, and THYA yielded essentially comparable inhibition zones. However, WCA and SchA antagonized cotrimoxazole and aminoglycoside antibiotics; furthermore, SchA antagonized polymyxin B, and both WCA and SchA antagonized imipenem against the P. aeruginosa strain, but not against the E. coli strains. Sheep blood-MHA (Bl-MHA), WCA, THYA, and DSTA were examined with Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615, Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 13813, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 6306. In comparison with Bl-MHA, both WCA and THYA yielded comparable inhibition zones against S. pyogenes; DSTA afforded suboptimal growth. DSTA yielded larger inhibition zones with the majority of antimicrobial drugs against S. agalactiae, whereas WCA and THYA enhanced the activity of oxacillin and penicillin G against this strain. S. pneumoniae strain ATCC 6306 grew well on Bl-MHA, yielded suboptimal growth on WCA and faint growth on THYA, and failed to grow on DSTA. Chocolate-supplemented sheep blood-MHA (CHOC-MHA) was compared with Haemophilus test medium (HTM), WCA with added NAD, and THYA with added hematin and NAD against Haemophilus influenzae strains ATCC 35056 and ATCC 49247. The activities of doxycycline and rifampin were enhanced against both strains by HTM, WCA+NAD, and THYA+hematin+NAD. Only WCA+NAD antagonized cotrimoxazole against both H. influenzae strains, an effect due to thymidine; however, HTM antagonized cotrimoxazole against S. aureus ATCC 25923 and E. coli ATCC 25922. It was concluded that Bl-MHA performed best for beta-hemolytic streptococci quality control strains. Likewise, CHOC-MHA was optimal for the two H. influenzae strains used in this comparative agar disk diffusion study.

TI  - [Clinical studies of S-1108 granules in the pediatric field].
AB  - We studied the clinical use of S-1108 granules in the pediatric field. The results are summarized as follows. 1. S-1108 was administered orally at doses ranging 6.85 and 17.6 mg/kg/day t.i.d. to 9 patients, including 5 cases of pharyngitis and 1 case each of lacunar tonsillitis, bronchitis, pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 4 cases and good in 5 cases, hence an efficacy rate of 100% was obtained. 2. Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae (2 strains each) and Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis (1 strain each) were identified in these cases. Seven of the 8 strains were eliminated upon treatment and the other strain was decreased, hence an eradication rate of 87.5% was obtained. 3. Side effects observed were 1 case each of soft stools and diarrhea. As an abnormal laboratory test result, an increase in GPT level was observed. 4. No refusal of the drug occurred. 5. From the above results, we consider that this drug would be a useful new oral antibiotic for the pediatric field.
TI  - Residual bacterial contamination on reusable pulse oximetry sensors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An early study demonstrated that standard cleaning techniques did not adequately disinfect reusable pulse oximetry sensors that had been intentionally contaminated with high titers of pathogenic microorganisms. This current study evaluated patient-ready sensors being used in hospitals, by testing them for bacterial contamination. METHODS: Reusable pulse oximetry sensors from 15 hospitals throughout the United States were tested. Each sensor was deemed by the hospital to be ready for patient use, and it had been prepared for use according to hospital procedures. Patient-contact areas of each sensor were swabbed, and the swabs were analyzed for bacterial contamination using standard testing procedures. This study had two stages, and different sensors were tested in each stage. In the "bacterial-growth stage," swabs were evaluated for bacterial contamination but organisms were not identified; in the "identification stage," bacterial species were identified. RESULTS: Forty-four sensors were evaluated, 16 in the bacterial-growth stage and 28 in the identification stage. Bacteria were cultured from 29 of the 44 sensors (66%), including 20 that had been cleaned with alcohol or an antibacterial/antiviral agent. Among the isolated organisms were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Klebsiella oxytoca. Bacterial contamination was found on sensors from 12 of the 15 participating hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the need to define effective cleaning methods for reusable sensors, and we are currently conducting such studies. The data also suggest that disposable patient-dedicated sensors may be the most appropriate choice when infection control is of particular concern.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of the glycylcyclines, a new class  of semisynthetic tetracyclines.
AB  - N,N-Dimethylglycylamido (DMG) derivatives of minocycline and 6-demethyl-6-deoxytetracycline are new semisynthetic tetracyclines referred to as the glycylcyclines. The in vitro activities of the glycylcyclines were evaluated in comparison with those of minocycline and tetracycline against strains carrying characterized tetracycline resistance determinants and against 995 recent clinical isolates obtained from geographically distinct medical centers in North America. The glycylcyclines were active against tetracycline-resistant strains carrying efflux [tet(A), tet(B), tet(C), and tet(D) in Escherichia coli and tet(K) in Staphylococcus aureus] and ribosomal protection [tet(M) in S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and E. coli)] resistance determinants. Potent activity (MIC for 90% of strains, < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) was obtained with the glycylcyclines against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, E. faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and various streptococcal species. The glycylcyclines exhibited good activity against a wide diversity of gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, most of which were less susceptible to minocycline and tetracycline. The activities of the glycylcyclines against most organisms tested were comparable to each other. The in vivo efficacies of the glycylcyclines against acute lethal infections in mice when dosed intravenously were reflective of their in vitro activities. The glycylcyclines had efficacies comparable to that of minocycline against infections with methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains, a strain carrying tet(K), and a tetracycline-susceptible E. coli strain but exceeded the effectiveness of minocycline against infections with resistant isolates, including strains harboring tet(M) or tet(B). Levels of DMG-6-deoxytetracycline in serum were higher and more sustained than those of DMG-minocycline or minocycline. Our results show that the glycylcyclines have potent in vitro activities against a wide spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including many resistant strains. On the basis of their in vitro and in vivo activities, the glycylcyclines represent a significant advance to the tetracycline class of antibiotics and have good potential value for clinical efficacy.
TI  - Incidence of bacteria from clean-catch and catheterized urine of nursing home residents.
AB  - Urine cultures from 1990 through 1992 were analyzed to determine the incidence of common isolates in residents from over 50 nursing homes in Oklahoma. Of all 11,480 isolates in clean-catch and catheterized specimens, the most common were: Escherichia coli (24% of all isolates), Pseudomonas aeruquinosa (11%), Proteus mirabilis (10%), Enterococcus faecalis (8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7%), Providencia stuartii (5%), and Staphylococcus aureus (4%). The most striking findings of this study were the similarities in frequencies of isolates from clean-catch and catheterized urines, the common occurrence of P. stuartii, and the low proportion of urea-splitting P. stuartii isolates from catheterized specimens.
TI  - Separation and isolation of viable bacteria by capillary zone electrophoresis.
AB  - Mixtures of bacteria, Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Streptococcus pyogenes  (ATCC 19615), Streptococcus agalactiae (ATCC 13813), Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 6303), and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), were resolved into discrete electrophoretic bands using capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). Bacteria remained viable (> 90%) during the electrophoretic process. Analysis of peak separation indicates organisms were quantitatively resolved and recovered at greater than 98% purity. E. faecalis was resolved into two discrete fractions with different chain assemblages that may reflect different developmental stages. These findings suggest that CZE can afford the microbiologist a new tool for studying the composition and distribution of microorganisms in mixed populations.
TI  - Quinolinecarboxylic acids. 3. Synthesis and antibacterial evaluation of 2-substituted-7-oxo-2,3-dihydro-7H-pyrido[1,2,3-de] [1,4]benzothiazine-6-carboxylic acids related to rufloxacin.
AB  - A series of 2-substituted-7-oxo-2,3-dihydro-7H-pyrido[1,2,3-de][1,4]benzothiazine-6 -carboxylic acids has been prepared and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity. These derivatives were less active than corresponding desmethylated analogues. Among these derivatives, the most active compound 22a was selected for preliminary pharmacokinetics in rats. The pharmacokinetic data indicated that 22a was rapidly absorbed and induced lasting plasma and urinary levels. In comparison with rufloxacin, it was excreted in low quantity in urine; a significant amount of desmethylated piperazinyl urinary metabolite was observed.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity in vitro of cefpirome and 6 other beta-lactam antibacterial agents against clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefpirome (CPR) was compared with that of cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM), flomoxef (FMOX), cefotaxime (CTX), ceftazidime (CAZ) and imipenem/cilastatin (IPM/CS) against 384 clinical isolates, for tested by the both microdilution method. The activity of CPR against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC50, 1 microgram/ml) and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC50, 8 micrograms/ml) was better than CTX and CAZ, but slightly less than IPM/CS. CPR and other antibacterial agents were not effect against methicillin resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecium. The activity of CPR against Enterobacteriaceae was as good as that of CTX, CAZ, and IPM/CS, and more effective than CEZ, CTM and FMOX. The MIC50 of CPR for Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (2 micrograms/ml) and the MIC50 of CPR for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 micrograms/ml) were as good as that of CAZ. Conclusionly, CPR was a new broad spectrum cephalosporin as compared with used cephalosporins.
TI  - [Prevalence of bacterial pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility: a multicenter study in Akita prefecture].
AB  - We report the prevalence of bacterial pathogens isolated from various clinical specimens in 17 medical centers in Akita during the period of December 1990 to February 1991, and their antimicrobial susceptibility. The results were as follows: 1. The total number of isolates was 8,929 and common bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (18.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), Escherichia coli (10.1%), coagulase negative staphylococcus (6.7%) and Enterococcus faecalis (5.0%). This is similar to our previous result which was reported in the same season in 1987. 2. S. aureus was a common isolate from sputum, throat swab, pus, and blood. 53% of isolated S. aureus were methicillin-resistant. Arbekacin (ABK) had a high degree of activity (99%) against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Minocycline (MINO) retained activity against 70% of MRSA strains, and quinolones only 20%. 3. P. aeruginosa and E. coli were frequently found in urine from the patients in the small hospitals. More than 80% of the P. aeruginosa strains were sensitive to imipenem (IPM), cefsulodin (CFS) and amikacin (AMK). The susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime (CAZ) and piperacillin (PIPC) had been decreasing for the last 3 years. 4. CNS were frequently found in blood, pus, and pleural effusion from the patients in the large hospitals. The isolates were resistant to most antibiotics. 5. Enterococcus was common isolates from urine and ascites, the susceptibility to cephem was low. 6. We conclude that attention should be specially paid to S. aureus, P. aeruginosa CNS and E. Faecalis.
TI  - The inhibition by ionophores in vitro of an Enterococcus-like pathogen of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss.
AB  - Streptococcosis is a major disease of several fish species in Australia, Japan and South Africa. The minimum inhibitory concentration of some ionophores (lasalocid, monensin, narasin and salinomycin) was determined in vitro for an Enterococcus-like species pathogenic for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in Australia. Forty isolates of the fish pathogen were tested, together with control strains of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Streptococcus bovis ATCC 9809. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of erythromycin, the drug of choice for controlling streptococcosis, ranged between 0.1 and 0.8 microgram/ml whereas the MIC values for the ionophores ranged between 0.2 and 1.5 micrograms/ml. Of the ionophores tested, narasin was the most inhibitory (0.2-0.4 microgram/ml), while monensin was the least inhibitory (0.4-1.5 micrograms/ml). Salinomycin was marginally more inhibitory (0.4-0.8 microgram/ml) than lasalocid (0.8 microgram/ml).
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of enterococci: results of a survey conducted by the United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Scheme for Microbiology.
AB  - Six strains of enterococci were distributed to participants in the United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Scheme for Microbiology with a request that they be tested for susceptibility to ampicillin/penicillin and vancomycin and for high-level resistance to gentamicin. More than 98% of laboratories correctly reported the resistant strains as resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. However, there was a poorer correlation for the susceptible strains, with only 1-6% and 69-83% of laboratories reporting the strains as susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin respectively. Those laboratories which used 5-25 micrograms ampicillin discs or breakpoint methods reported proportionally more results correctly for the susceptible strains than those using 2 micrograms discs. Participants using Escherichia coli or an enterococcus as a control and those not using a control at all were more likely to report ampicillin-susceptible strains correctly than those using Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 6571 (Oxford strain). For vancomycin-susceptible and high-level vancomycin-resistant strains, 93-96% and 96-99% of reports respectively were correct. For the low-level vancomycin-resistant strains, only 50-54% of reports were correct. Participants using a 5 micrograms vancomycin disc reported proportionally more of the low-level resistant strains correctly than those using 10, 20, 25, 30 or 100 micrograms discs. Participants not using controls were proportionally more likely to report the low-level resistant strains as susceptible than those using an enterococcus or S. aureus NCTC 6571 as a control. For the high-level gentamicin-resistant (HLGR) strains, 96-98% of reports were correct. Depending on the strain, between 12% and 41% of participants also reported high-level resistance for the strains which were not HLGR. Those using low-content discs (< or = 30 micrograms) and breakpoint or MIC methods were more likely to report strains which were not HLGR as HLGR than those using high-content discs. Those using an enterococcus as a control were less likely to report strains which were not HLGR as HLGR than those using either S. aureus NCTC 6571 or E. coli as a control and those not using a control.
TI  - Detection, identification and characterization of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria from retail food products.
AB  - Forty bacteriocin-producing (Bac+) lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from  food samples purchased from retail supermarkets and local farms. Of the 40 Bac+ isolates, 18 were isolated from 85 food samples by enrichment (21% isolation rate) whereas eight were obtained from 63 samples by direct plating (13% isolation rate). By direct plating, Bac+ LAB were detected at levels up to 2.4 x 10(5) cfu/g in ready-to-eat meats. The Bac+ isolates were identified by carbohydrate fermentation patterns, SDS-PAGE protein patterns, and other biochemical characteristics; SDS-PAGE proved invaluable in identifying strains that could not be identified by other means. Differential inhibitory spectra against indicator microorganisms assisted in the identification of 19 unique Bac+ isolates. Bac+ LAB included Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lb. delbrueckii, Lb. plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, and Pediococcus acidilactici. Lb. curvatus (four strains) and Lc. lactis (nine strains) were the only isolates inhibitory to foodborne pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus. Some Lc. lactis isolates inhibited as many as nine Gram-positive genera. Lb. curvatus FS47 and FS65 grew to high cell densities and produced bacteriocin at 6 degrees C; however, Lc. lactis FS56 produced greater levels of bacteriocin at lower cell densities. The high incidence of Bac+ LAB detected in retail foods indicates that the public is consuming a wide variety of Bac+ LAB that occur as natural contaminants. These data suggest a greater role for bacteriocins as biopreservatives in food.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of sultamicillin against clinical isolates obtained from outpatients].
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for sultamicillin (SBTPC), and for other major oral beta-lactam agents against clinically isolated strains collected from outpatients during a period from August, 1992 to February, 1993, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. The ratio of penicillinase (PCase)-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus was 96.0% and that of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was 12.0%. MIC90 of SBTPC against S. aureus including MRSA was 6.25 micrograms/ml. No increasing tendency was observed for S. aureus resistant to SBTPC. 2. No resistant strains were found among Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis against penicillins (PCs) including SBTPC. But PCs and cephems (CEPs) insensitive or resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae were observed in 22.0% among all the strains of S. pneumoniae. 3. 100% of the tested both strains of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis were beta-lactamase producers. 12.0% of the tested strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 16.0% of the strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were also beta-lactamase producers. SBTPC showed strong antimicrobial activity against most of these beta-lactamase producing strains. However, in our study of beta-lactamase productivity using plural substrates and test methods, it appeared that a part of strains of E. coli might produce beta-lactamase of "Extended broad-spectrum". MICs of SBTPC and CEPs against those strains were distributed rather in a high range. 4. The results of the study suggested that the resistant strains of S. pneumoniae against PCs and CEPs might be increasing year by year. Some of strains of E. coli, resistance against the 2 agents were observed. It is important to keep observing changes in resistance of such organisms in the future. 5. The antimicrobial activities of SBTPC against clinically isolated strains in this study indicated potential problems such as those mentioned above. It is, however, also confirmed that SBTPC shows still strong antimicrobial activities against most of beta-lactamase producing strains found in daily medical examinations. Taking into consideration of the strong activities of SBTPC against so-called indirect pathogenicity caused by beta-lactamase producing indigenous bacteria reported lately, SBTPC may be a useful antibiotic for community acquired infections in the 1990's.
TI  - In vitro activities of BAY Y3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract and soft tissue infections.
AB  - BAY Y3118 was highly active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 0.063 micrograms/ml). For Enterococcus faecalis and Corynebacterium jeikeium, MIC90s were 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. BAY Y3118 was as active as ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and had potent activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Genes involved in the regulation of beta-lactamase production in enterococci and  staphylococci.
AB  - In enterococci, the structural gene for beta-lactamase (blaZ) is identical to blaZ from Staphylococcus aureus. However, in the enterococci studied to date, beta-lactamase is produced constitutively, whereas in staphylococci it is often inducible. Recent reports have revealed the presence of two adjacent genes upstream of the staphylococcal blaZ thought to be the antirepressor (blaR1) and repressor (blaI) genes. In the present study, beta-lactamase expression mutants of the staphylococcal beta-lactamase plasmid pI524 were generated by transposon mutagenesis with the transposon Tn917. Tn917 insertions upstream of blaZ in either blaR1 or blaI resulted in constitutive beta-lactamase production, indicating that the repressor function is lost with insertion of Tn917 into either gene. This finding supports the concept that the staphylococcal beta-lactamase regulatory genes are encoded on a polycistronic mRNA. The corresponding region upstream of the enterococcal blaZ from Enterococcus faecalis HH22 was sequenced and compared with the staphylococcal blaR1 sequence. The two sequences were identical for 893 nucleotides, and then the sequences diverged completely. Therefore, in strain HH22, only 51% of the putative antirepressor gene is present and the repressor gene is also absent. In conclusion, constitutive beta-lactamase production in HH22 appears to be due to a lack of the regulatory genes blaR1 and blaI which regulate expression of blaZ in staphylococci.
TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of enterococcal endocarditis.
AB  - Enterococci are frequently encountered in urinary, biliary, and gastrointestinal  tract infections and are increasingly being recognized in nosocomial bacteriuria and bacteremia. Undoubtedly, however, the most serious of all enterococcal infections is endocarditis. At present, enterococci are the third most common cause of infective endocarditis (after streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus), and the incidence of the disease is likely to grow as the population ages and increasing numbers of persons are placed at risk by degenerative valve disease and by predisposition to enterococcal infections through portals such as the genitourinary tract. The case presented here exemplifies many features of enterococcal endocarditis. It also illustrates the therapeutic issues and dilemmas faced in managing this disorder. Although a transesophageal approach (Figure 1) has increased the sensitivity of echocardiography for detecting valvular abnormalities in infective endocarditis, diagnosis continues to rely on blood cultures--which raises the question of how long antimicrobial therapy should be delayed for collection of blood samples. Since enterococcal isolates are often resistant to antibiotics, therapy is based on synergistic drug combinations.
TI  - Multicentre survey of the comparative in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against bacteria from hospitalized patients in the British Isles.
AB  - Twenty-nine British and Irish hospitals each collected up to 300 bacterial isolates from in-patients. The organisms were identified by an appropriate API system or, for staphylococci, by their Gram and coagulase reactions. Disc susceptibility tests were performed. Isolates that gave zones < or = 25 mm to piperacillin/tazobactam (75 micrograms + 10 micrograms) discs were sent to a central laboratory for re-examination and determination of MIC, together with a sample of the more susceptible organisms. Results were evaluated for 6724 isolates. Over 95% of the isolates of Escherichia coli, klebsiellae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus, Moraxella and Bacteriodes, spp. streptococci, pneumococci and Enterococcus faecalis were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (defined as giving a zone > or = 22 mm to a 75 micrograms + 10 micrograms disc), as were 86% of Acinetobacter spp. and 82% of the Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella and Serratia group. Tazobactam particularly extended the activity of piperacillin against E. coli isolates (96% susceptible cf. 61% to piperacillin alone) klebsiellae (95% cf. 70%), P. mirabilis (99% cf. 86%), and Acinetobacter spp. (86% cf. 53%). Occasional (18%) resistance in Enterobacter, Serratia and Citrobacger spp. was probably caused by stable depression of Class I beta-lactamases, which are inhibited poorly by tazobactam. High resistance frequencies (> 25%) were found for Enterococcus faecium and Xanthomonas maltophilia. Tazobactam potentiated piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, but the mode inhibition zone of piperacillin/tazobactam discs was only 26 mm, compared to 38 mm for beta-lactamase-negative isolates. Nevertheless, fewer than 5% of the enzyme producers appeared resistant to 8 + 4 mg/L piperacillin/tazobactam in MIC tests. Similar behaviour was noted for coagulase-negative staphylococci. Amongst the eleven comparator drugs, ceftazidime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were as active as piperacillin/tazobactam against most enterobacteria. However, Acinetobacter and Bacteroides spp. and enterococci were resistant to ceftazidime, and Bacteroides spp., enterococci, pneumococci and other streptococci were inherently resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. Cefuroxime, ampicillin and co-amoxiclav had narrower spectra. Only imipenem showed a consistently wider spectrum and lower frequency of resistance than piperacillin/tazobactam.
TI  - Antibacterial organophosphorus compounds: phosphoranilidohydrazones of 5-nitro-2-furaldehyde.
AB  - A series of phosphoranilidohydrazones of 5-nitro-2-furaldehyde was synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity. The series was prepared to examine the applicability of phosphoramidic hydrazones as carriers for the antibacterial nitrofuran moiety. Designed as analogues of nitrofurantoin, members of the series were chosen according to the Topliss approach to analogue design. The title compounds were devoid of gram-negative activity but possessed moderate antistaphylococcal activity. The most potent members of the series were equipotent with nitrofurantoin against Staphylococcus aureus. The relationship between structure and antistaphylococcal activity is discussed.
TI  - Staphylococcus hyicus associated with turkey stifle joint osteomyelitis.
AB  - Essentially pure cultures of Staphylococcus hyicus were isolated in moderate to high numbers from tibia growth-plate lesions from five of nine turkey hens showing clinical signs of stifle joint osteomyelitis. Of the four other tibia growth-plate specimens examined, Salmonella sp. and Enterococcus faecalis were individually isolated from one bird each, and no bacterial pathogens were isolated from the remaining two cases. Staphylococcus aureus, considered the most common cause of osteomyelitis in turkeys, was isolated from none of the nine birds examined in this flock. These findings suggest a strong association between S. hyicus and turkey stifle joint osteomyelitis.
TI  - Effect of prestorage white cell reduction on bacterial growth in platelet concentrates.
AB  - Platelet concentrates stored with and without autologous white cells were produced from units of whole blood that had been purposefully contaminated with bacteria immediately after phlebotomy. The blood was inoculated with one of five species of bacterium at either 10 or 50 colony-forming units per mL. The growth of the organisms was quantified throughout the conventional 5-day, 22 degrees C storage period of the platelet concentrates. One species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, failed to grow in any of the components. The remaining species, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Salmonella enteritidis, achieved log growth after 1 day of storage and reached a relative maximum concentration by Day 3. Although the concentration of bacteria immediately after inoculation was lower in the units reduced in white cells by filtration, no significant differences were observed thereafter. Data from this in vitro study support the concept that prestorage white cell reduction of platelet concentrates should not increase the likelihood of transfusion-induced septicemia.
TI  - [A nationwide survey of antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics in Japan (1988-1990)].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  antibacterial agents at 149 hospitals throughout Japan from September to December in both 1989 and 1990. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testings were performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci showed high or moderate resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly susceptible to them. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to imipenem (IPM) and piperacillin but resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides. Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs and aminoglycosides. Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had a good susceptibility to IPM and aminoglycosides. Bacteroides fragilis was highly susceptible to IPM. IPM had strong antibacterial activity to many species of clinical isolates, including strains which were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin and its effect on bacterial adherence to medical material].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin (CAM) in comparison with other 6 macrolides was determined against 419 recent clinical isolates including Streptococci, Enterococci, Staphylococci, Moraxella, Haemophilus and Bacteroides strains. MICs80's of CAM against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.78, 0.10 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. MICs80's against Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were 0.05 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. Laboratory-induced resistance to CAM in strains of S. pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in stepwise fashion and at a very low rate. Adherence to silicon filter of strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or S. epidermidis was strongly repressed by the addition of sub-MIC of CAM or other macrolides. Although tosufloxacin (TFLX) alone had no bactericidal activity against the sessile cells of P. aeruginosa strains tested, TFLX showed synergistic bactericidal activity when combined with sub-MICs of CAM or erythromycin.
TI  - Synthetic bactericidal peptide based on CAP37: a 37-kDa human neutrophil granule-associated cationic antimicrobial protein chemotactic for monocytes.
AB  - CAP37 (cationic antimicrobial protein of molecular mass 37 kDa) is a multifunctional protein isolated from the granules of human neutrophils. It is antibiotic and chemotactic and binds lipopolysaccharide. A synthetic peptide, amino acid sequence NQGRHFCGGALIHARFVMTAASCFQ, based on residues 20-44 of CAP37 protein mimics its antibiotic and lipopolysaccharide binding action. Peptide 20-44, at the concentrations tested, has antibacterial activity against Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. The bactericidal action of the peptide was pH dependent, with maximum activity at pH 5.0 and pH 5.5 and decreased activity at pH 7.0. Various truncations, substitutions, and other modifications in the sequence deteriorate its activity. Free sulfhydryl groups and/or disulfide bridge formation are required for optimum antibiotic activity, since substitution of serines for, or alkylation of, cysteine residues 26 and 42 eliminates bactericidal activity. Evidently amino acids 20-44 represent an important, perhaps principal, antibacterial domain of CAP37. This peptide should provide new insight into the mechanism of antimicrobial activity of CAP37 and may serve as a model for new, useful, synthetic antibiotics.
TI  - Interpretive criteria and quality control parameters for determining bacterial susceptibility to fosfomycin tromethamine.
AB  - Studies with fosfomycin tromethamine disks containing 200 micrograms of fosfomycin and 50 micrograms of glucose-6-phosphate confirmed the following zone diameter criteria for the NCCLS method: < or = 12 mm for resistant (MIC > or = 256 micrograms/ml), 13-15 mm for intermediate (MIC 128 micrograms/ml) and > or = 16 mm for susceptible (MIC < or = 64 micrograms/ml). Additional studies defined acceptable MIC and zone diameter ranges for the following quality control strains: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, MIC 0.5 to 4.0 micrograms/ml, zone diameter 23 to 29 mm; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, zone diameter 26 to 32 mm; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27813, MIC 2.0 to 8.0 micrograms/ml; and Enterococcus faecalis, ATCC 29212, MIC 16 to 64 micrograms/ml.
TI  - The efficacy of teicoplanin in the treatment of endocarditis caused by gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-six patients with endocarditis caused by Streptococcus viridans (n = 12),  Enterococcus faecalis (n = 5), Streptococcus bovis (n = 2), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 4) were treated with teicoplanin at a dose of 600 mg/day in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance 80-120 mL/min) and at a dose of 400 mg/day in patients with moderately impaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 75 mL/min). In nine patients valve replacements were performed. Twenty-one patients were cured by medical treatment with teicoplanin, five patients had a surgical intervention during treatment which was subsequently stopped. Overall, eighteen patients with native valve endocarditis were cured. Out of eight patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis six patients were cured. In one patient teicoplanin therapy was withdrawn because of clinical failure. One patient had a clinical relapse. All cultures taken from blood, endocardium and excised artificial valves were sterile after a minimum of seven days therapy. Side effects were seen in seven patients and included a moderate increase in liver enzymes and mild leucopenia. No renal toxicity was observed, trough serum levels of teicoplanin were not correlated with renal function, a slight accumulation of teicoplanin on day 28 being seen. Our study confirms that teicoplanin is effective as single agent therapy in the treatment of endocarditis due to Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Sensitivity of elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) from different bacterial species to the antibiotics efrotomycin, pulvomycin and MDL 62879.
AB  - The sensitivity of elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) from different species of bacteria to the EF-Tu-binding antibiotics efrotomycin, pulvomycin and MDL 62879 was tested by measuring the effect of these antibiotics on cell-free protein synthesis systems. EF-Tu from four different Gram-negative species was sensitive to all three antibiotics. Among Gram-positive bacteria, EF-Tu of Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis was resistant to efrotomycin and less sensitive to pulvomycin than EF-Tu of Gram-negative bacteria. EF-Tus from streptococci were significantly less sensitive than EF-Tus from Gram-negative bacteria to both efrotomycin and pulvomycin. All of the EF-Tus were sensitive to MDL 62879. The same sensitivity pattern emerged from GDP exchange assays, performed with partially purified EF-Tu from different bacterial species and pure Escherichia coli EF-Ts. These results suggest that the site of action of MDL 62879 is more conserved among bacterial species than those of efrotomycin and pulvomycin. Heterogeneity of EF-Tus from different bacterial species was also reflected in differences in their apparent molecular masses estimated by SDS-PAGE. EF-Tus from the Gram-positive species had higher molecular masses than those from all but one of the Gram-negative species.
TI  - Identification, characterization, and nucleotide sequence of a region of Enterococcus faecalis pheromone-responsive plasmid pAD1 capable of autonomous replication.
AB  - A 5-kbp region of pAD1, previously shown to be capable of supporting replication, copy control, and stable inheritance of the plasmid, was cloned into a replicon probe vector and subjected to transposon insertional mutagenesis. Transposon inserts identifying essential replication, copy control, and stability functions were isolated. Deletion of stability functions not essential for replication resulted in delimitation of a basic replicon. The complete DNA sequence of this approximately 3-kbp region and the precise positions of several transposon inserts were determined, and the phenotypic effects of the transposon inserts were correlated with the physical locations of individual determinants. The following three genes, apparently involved in plasmid maintenance, were identified; repA, which encodes a protein required for replication; repB, which encodes a protein involved in copy control; and repC, which may be involved in stable inheritance. In addition, two clusters of repeats composed of a consensus sequence, TAGTARRR, were identified, one located between the divergently transcribed repA and repB genes and another located downstream of repC. The region between repA and repB contained 25 repeats divided into two subregions of 13 and 12 repeats separated by 78 bp. The region located downstream of repC contained only three repeats but may be essential for plasmid replication, since deletion of this determinant resulted in loss of ability to replicate in Enterococcus faecalis. We hypothesize that the repeat units represent protein-binding sites required for assembly of the replisome and control of plasmid copy number. Another region of unrelated repeat units that may also be involved in replication is located within the repA gene. Possible mechanisms of action of these determinants are discussed.
TI  - [Evaluation of a micromethod for the bactericidal activity of five disinfectants  on 108 hospital strains].
AB  - The authors studied 5 disinfectants containing aldehyde and quaternary ammonium against 108 hospital strains. The minimal bactericidal activities (MBC) were determined with a microdilution method and the dilution-neutralization method (AFNOR T 72-150). The microdilution method results were validated using the MBCs of four reference strains tested with the dilution-neutralization method (AFNOR T 72-150). 3 disinfectants proved to be valuable. 1 disinfectant was valuable but with a MBC toward all bacteria only a dilution away from the dilution of use. 1 disinfectant was determined as unsatisfactory as 9.5 p. cent of all strains proved resistant toward it. All disinfectants matched AFNOR standards; but those specifications did not match toward hospital strains. Such an evaluation using a simple and reliable method should be of use.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of the new quinolone, Bay y 3118, and ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, CI-960 and CI-990.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of the new quinolone, Bay y 3118, was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, CI-960 and CI-990 against 1640 isolates belonging to 117 bacterial species. Against members of the Enterobacteriaceae, Bay y 3118 was as active as CI-960 and CI-990, up to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and tosufloxacin and up to 16-fold more active than sparfloxacin. The majority of Enterobacteriaceae which were resistant to ciprofloxacin (MICs > or = 2 mg/L) were sensitive to Bay y 3118. With the exception of ciprofloxacin which was less active, the activities of Bay y 3118 and the other comparator compounds were similar against Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter genospecies 3 and Acinetobacter strain 84. Bay y 3118 inhibited Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates at concentrations comparable with those of ciprofloxacin. However, non-aeruginosa Pseudomonas spp. were four times more susceptible to Bay y 3118 than to ciprofloxacin. All of the agents tested were equally active against Haemophilus, Moraxella, Neisseria and Bordetella spp. Against staphylococci, Bay y 3118 was the most active compound, followed jointly by CI-990, sparfloxacin, CI-960 and tosufloxacin, and then ciprofloxacin. Bay y 3118 remained highly active against Staphylococcus aureus strains resistant to ciprofloxacin; the MIC90 (0.5 mg/L) was 16-fold less than that of CI-990 and sparfloxacin, 32-fold less than that of CI-960 and 128-fold less than that of tosufloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Against haemolytic and non-haemolytic streptococci and Enterococcus faecalis, Bay y 3118 was two- to 16-fold more active than the other compounds. It had only moderate activity against Listeria spp., but this was superior to that of all the other compounds tested. Bay y 3118 was also the most active agent overall against anaerobic bacteria, although CI-960 and CI-990 had slightly better activity against Gardnerella vaginalis. It inhibited Mycobacterium spp. other than Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium scrofulaceum, Mycobacterium gordonae, Mycobacterium xenopi, Mycobacterium flavescens, Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium fortuitum) at concentrations < or = 0.06-4 mg/L and was between two- and 128-fold more active than the other compounds against these isolates; the two strains each of Mycobacterium terrae and Mycobacterium nonchromogenicum were resistant to Bay y 3118. In this study, Bay y 3118 was shown to be the most active and most broad-spectrum of the new quinolone and naphthyridine derivatives.
TI  - [Chemotherapy with imipenem/cilastatin for severe infections accompanied by malignant hematological disorders].
AB  - The clinical and bacteriological efficacy of imipenem/cilastatin (IPM/CS) was evaluated in 30 cases of serious infections associated with hematological malignancies. 1. Among 28 evaluable cases, excellent efficacy was obtained in 6 cases and good effectiveness in 10 cases, resulting in a high clinical efficacy rate (57.1%). The clinical effectiveness of IPM/CS was not dependent on neutrophil count in peripheral blood. A 53.8% efficacy rate was observed in 26 cases which had received pretreatment with other antibiotics. 2. Antibacterial activities of IPM/CS have so far been evaluated against organisms isolated in 20 of 28 cases: 2 strains of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, 2 strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 2 strains of Enterococcus faecalis, 9 strains of Enterobacter cloacae, and 8 other strains. 3. Among 3 evaluable cases treated with IPM/CS alone, response was good in 1 case. Among 25 patients receiving IPM/CS in combination with an aminoglycoside or a penicillin, the efficacy rate was 60%. 4. Five patients had IPM/CS-related adverse events; nausea and vomiting in 2 cases, seizures in 1 case, small increases in GOT and GPT in 2 cases, and the appearance of casts in urine sediment in 1 case. These patients, however, tolerated the complete course of therapy with IPM/CS except the 2 cases with nausea and vomiting. These results indicate that chemotherapy with IPM/CS is effective for the treatment of severe infectious diseases accompanied by hematological disorders.
TI  - Quality control of bacterial enumeration.
AB  - Standard bacterial suspensions can be used to assess test method performance, via control charts, and inhibition of recovery when analyzing water samples. Variability in standard suspensions prepared from different strains and species and the use of frozen environmental samples for quality control for spore and bacteriophage analyses are also discussed.
TI  - Dirithromycin disc susceptibility tests: interpretative criteria and quality control parameters.
AB  - Dirithromycin and its bioactive metabolite (erythromycylamine) were compared in vitro to erythromycin against 450 bacterial isolates. Dirithromycin and erythromycylamine did not differ in their in-vitro activity and the two compounds were additive when combined in equal proportions. Both compounds were active against erythromycin-susceptible bacteria but erythromycin was two to four times more potent on a weight-to-weight basis. Interpretive criteria for dirithromycin were not based on achievable blood concentrations since tissue concentrations may be 20-30 times greater than peak serum levels. Dirithromycin-susceptible strains were those with zones > or = 19 mm in diameter (15 micrograms dirithromycin disc) or MIC < or = 2.0 mg/L and resistance was defined as a zone < or = 15 mm or MIC > or = 8.0 mg/L. Interpretive criteria for testing Haemophilus influenzae on Haemophilus Test Medium (HTM) agar were not defined because of the drug's poor activity in the test system used. Two multi-laboratory studies were also undertaken, one to define quality control limits for disc diffusion tests and the other to define broth microdilution MIC control limits for tests with dirithromycin.
TI  - Plasma level of antisecretory factor (ASF) and its relation to post-weaning diarrhoea in piglets.
AB  - Antisecretory factor (ASF) is a regulatory peptide which counteracts diarrhoea in the pig; ASF is rapidly absorbed from the pig intestine, and significantly reduces the incidence of neonatal diarrhoea in the suckling offspring. ASF is synthesized in the central nervous system, and released to the blood stream via the pituitary gland. In two different experiments (n = 8 and n = 4), the blood concentration of ASF was followed in 5-weeks old piglets from day 7 before weaning up to day 12 days after weaning. In both experiments ASF concentrations were significantly (p < 0.01) lower on day three post-weaning, than either before weaning or on days 7 and 12 post-weaning. In another experiment, where plasma ASF activity was determined in relation to clinical signs of diarrhoea seven days post-weaning, it was found to be 0.87 +/- 0.08 units/ml (mean +/- SEM) in healthy weaners (n = 15), but only 0.22 +/- 0.05 units/ml in piglets suffering from diarrhoea (n = 15), the difference being significant. The faecal flora both of healthy weaners and of their matched controls suffering from diarrhoea were subjected to bacteriological examination before and after weaning, and found to be similar in both groups, namely a mixture of aerobic and anaerobic Gram negative rods, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus/epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis. No particular pathogen was predominant in any of the diseased animals.
TI  - Trends in gram-positive bloodstream organism resistance: a seven-year audit of five glycopeptides and other drugs at a large university hospital.
AB  - Gram-positive pathogens (n = 525) isolated from bloodstream infections were tested by a reference broth microdilution method to establish antibiotic susceptibility trends (1985 to 1991). Cefazolin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, novobiocin, oxacillin, rifampin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, daptomycin and two investigational glycopeptides (LY264826 and MDL62873) were investigated. Strains were selected without bias (first two isolates each month/species; no patient duplicates) as follows: 132 Staphylococcus aureus, 129 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 72 Staphylococcus haemolyticus, 130 Enterococcus faecalis and 62 other enterococci. All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin except for Staphylococcus haemolyticus which had a resistant teicoplanin MIC90 of 64 micrograms/mL. The susceptibilities to vancomycin and teicoplanin were unchanged over the monitored period. Daptomycin, LY264826 and MDL62873 also demonstrated consistent activity; MDL62873 being superior with a MIC90 of 0.12 micrograms/mL. In 1990-1991 a significantly increased resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed among oxacillin-resistant strains of staphylococci. Our data suggest that the emergence of invasive vancomycin-resistant strains in Gram-positive isolates remains a rare phenomenon. However, we have experienced an emergence of numerous ciprofloxacin-resistant strains among staphylococci that precludes its empirical use at our institution.
TI  - Prospective evaluation of the incidence of bacteremia after protected specimen brushing in ICU patients with and without pneumonia.
AB  - To test the hypothesis that the use of protected specimen brushing (PSB) via flexible bronchoscopy does not predispose to bacteremia in ICU patients, we prospectively performed aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures immediately following bronchoscopy with PSB. A total of 123 episodes in 68 consecutive patients with suspected pneumonia were analyzed. Blood cultures were negative in 110 cases (89 percent) and positive in 13 cases (11 percent) (p < 0.001). Twelve of these 13 patients with positive blood cultures had quantitative PSB specimen cultures showing nonsignificant growth (< 10(3) CFU/ml). In nine patients, the bacteria recovered from blood cultures (coagulase-negative staphylococci or sarcina) were considered nonpathogenic according to conventional criteria. Blood cultures grew a Staphylococcus aureus in two patients with previously documented staphylococcal septicemia. In one patient with no identifiable site of infection, the blood culture yielded Enterococcus faecalis. The only patient with both a positive blood culture and PSB culture results indicating pneumonia had different organisms recovered from the two samples. Blood cultures taken after PSB in the 17 other episodes of pneumonia (PSB specimen cultures > or = 10(3) CFU/ml) were negative. At the time of brushing and blood sampling for culture, none of these patients was receiving antibiotics active on the organisms found. In conclusion, the incidence of bacteremia after PSB in ICU patients seems very low even in patients with documented pneumonia. Substantial savings would result from not performing routine blood cultures after PSB.
TI  - Antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin B, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the N-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - A physiologically diverse range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin B, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. The list of susceptible organisms includes Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens. Concentrations of lactoferricin B required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and the culture medium used. The peptide showed activity against E. coli O111 over the range of pH 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. Its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of Na+, K+, Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. Lactoferricin B was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterococcus faecalis and Bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.
TI  - Occurrence and mechanisms of glycopeptide resistance in gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Despite belief that the unique mechanism of glycopeptide action would preclude the development of resistance in susceptible organisms, clinical isolates of enterococci and staphylococci resistant to these compounds have been described. Among the enterococci, there are at least three types of resistance. Type A (high-level) resistance was described in Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis. It is inducible and mediated by elaboration and/or increased activity of at least three enzymes: a ligase, a dehydrogenase, and a carboxypeptidase, which orchestrate the production of peptidoglycan precursors that do not bind vancomycin. Type B (low-level) resistance described in E. faecium is also mediated by increased carboxypeptidase activity and, possibly, by elaboration of a protein detectable after incubation in vancomycin whose function is unknown. Type C resistance is associated with production of a ligase constitutively produced, chromosomally encoded, and unique to E. gallinarum. Among the staphylococci, coagulase-negative clinical isolates were obtained that were resistant to glycopeptides and one coagulase-positive isolate was resistant to teicoplanin but the mechanism of resistance is unknown. Additionally, coagulase-positive staphylococci resistant to glycopeptides have been prepared in the laboratory. They produce an approximately 39-kDa cytoplasmic protein, whose function is unknown, and have undergone extensive reorganization of their cell surface. The era in which universal gram-positive susceptibility to glycopeptides can be presumed is over; susceptibility testing must now accompany isolation of an enterococcus or staphylococcus of clinical importance.
TI  - [The effect of culture media on bacteriocin production in various strains of bacteria].
AB  - Some staphylococcus and enterococcus strains were used to investigate the effect  of culture medium on bacteriocin production. Staphylococcus cohnii SC7, Staphylococcus sp. ZTJ 151, S. saprophyticus SS 877, Enterococcus faecium EF1 and E. faecalis EFG2 were isolated from the rumen wall and contents of lambs, calves and fallow deer, Enterococcus gallinarum EG10 and E. avium EA12 were isolated from the caecum of Japanese quail. The tested bacteria belong to producers with a wide antimicrobial effectiveness spectrum, they have low to medium adherence and urease activity (Tab. III). These culture media were used to test the effect of culture medium on bacteriocin production: nutrient agar no. 2 and VL agar enriched with 2% of glucose and lactose (ZAG, ZAL, VLG, VLL), agar for isolation of faecal streptococci (SA) and the base for blood agar no. 4 and no. 2 (KA4, KA2). The strains Streptococcus bovis AO 24/85 and Staphylococcus aureus Oxford 209 P were used as indicator bacteria. Tables I and II show the results of these tests. The tested strains produced the widest inhibition zones (6 mm) with both indicators on SA medium, and this indicates massive bacteriocin production. On ZAG medium, the zones of enterococci with the AO 24/85 strain were larger size than those of staphylococci, but the zones were dim. All strains with the 209P indicator produced dim zones of the 2mm size. The larger inhibition zones (2-5mm) in comparison with staphylococci were observed in enterococci on the ZAL medium with the AO24/85 strain. The production of tested strains was balanced on VLG agar with respect to the use of both indicators.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of cefpirome (HR 810) against enterococci and staphylococci.
AB  - The inhibitory activity of cefpirome (HR 810), a new cephalosporin derivative for parenteral use, was tested by agar dilution methods against Enterococcus faecalis (100 strains), Staphylococcus aureus (40 strains) and coagulase-negative staphylococcal species (60 strains) in comparison with other beta-lactam antibiotics. For E. faecalis, the cefpirome minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range was 2-128 micrograms/ml, with an MIC50 of 8 micrograms/ml, and an MIC90 of 64 micrograms/ml. The optimal bactericidal activity against strains with MICs of < or = 8 micrograms/ml occurred at 2-4 times the MIC, and the reduction in the initial inoculum was 99.9-99.7% after 24 h incubation at these concentrations. Mec gene-negative staphylococci (both S. aureus and coagulase-negative species) had cefpirome MICs of 0.25-2 micrograms/ml (MIC50 0.5 microgram/ml, MIC90 1 microgram/ml). Mec gene-positive strains had MICs of 0.5-128 micrograms/ml (MIC50 2 micrograms/ml, MIC90 32 micrograms/ml). Strains with borderline resistance to oxacillin which did not harbor the mec gene and which were susceptible to cefpirome maintained their susceptibility even when high-density inocula were used and after several passages in media containing the antibiotic. These studies present some potential advantages of cefpirome over other cephalosporins in the inhibitory activity against Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Comparison of the autoSCAN-W/A and Vitek Automicrobic systems for identification  and susceptibility testing of bacteria.
AB  - The identification and susceptibility testing of bacteria by the autoSCAN-W/A rapid panels and Vitek Automicrobic systems were compared. A total of 291 clinical isolates, including 207 members of the Enterobacteriaceae, 41 nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli, 31 Staphylococcus aureus strains and 12 Enterococcus faecalis strains, were tested. autoSCAN-W/A and Vitek correctly identified 93% and 94% respectively of the Enterobacteriaceae, the identification in an additional 2% and 5% of strains respectively being reported as correct with a low probability. autoSCAN-W/A reported all identification results within 2 h after inoculation, whereas Vitek reported the identification results for the majority of gram-negative bacilli between 4 h and 6 h after inoculation. autoSCAN-W/A and Vitek reported 81% and 74% of MIC results respectively after 3-6 h incubation. The rates of very major susceptibility errors were 0.4% and 0.4% for autoSCAN-W/A and Vitek respectively, the rates of major errors 0.4% and 1% respectively, and the rates of minor errors 4% and 3% respectively. Six of 30 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains failed to grow sufficiently for susceptibility testing in the autoSCAN-W/A system, and four Xanthomonas maltophilia strains had insufficient growth for susceptibility testing in both systems. The majority of results of susceptibility testing of nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli were reported more than 6 h after inoculation. Both systems were reliable and easy to operate, and gave accurate results for common clinical isolates.
TI  - Optimal method for culturing vascular prosthetic grafts.
AB  - Vascular prosthetic infection may be underrecognized when identified by standard  culture techniques. Improved microbiologic methodology may enhance detection of bacteria in prosthetic graft specimens, and thus may alter clinical decisions. Quantitative culture techniques were employed to compare three methods of enhancing bacterial recovery from Dacron graft cylinders seeded with commonly encountered bacterial pathogens. Methods included: (1) ultrasonic bath treatment, (2) direct ultrasonic disruption, and (3) agitation on a Vortex mixer. Ultrasonic bath treatment released bacteria with colony counts that were consistently greater by 1 log than direct ultrasonic disruption and Vortex agitation. Direct ultrasonic disruption at high energy levels selectively killed gram-negative bacteria by as much as a 4 log decrease in viable organisms. Agitation (Vortex mixing) of the specimen produced the lowest counts among the three methods tested. These data would indicate that a 5-min ultrasonic bath treatment was the optimal method of preparation of vascular prostheses for bacterial culture.
TI  - [A comparative microbiological and pharmacokinetic activity of vancomycin and teicoplanin].
AB  - Vancomycin and teicoplanin are two commercially available glycopeptide antibiotics. They have identical spectra of activity and similar mechanisms of action, and both are complex molecules. In vitro, vancomycin is more active against coagulase-negative staphylococci, while teicoplanin is more active against enterococci and pneumococci. The activity of the two antibiotics against Staphylococcus aureus is similar. The serum pharmacokinetics of vancomycin and teicoplanin are highly different, teicoplanin having a longer elimination half-life (40 hours versus 6-8 hours for vancomycin), but a higher degree of protein binding (90% versus 55%). We compared the two antibiotics on the basis of their inhibitory quotient kinetics, using the MIC90 values for the above bacterial species as the microbiological parameters, and the total and free (non-protein bound) serum concentrations as the pharmacokinetic parameters. The inhibitory quotient kinetics of vancomycin were always more favorable in terms of the free concentrations, even against those bacteria for which the teicoplanin MIC was lower.
TI  - [Evaluation of in vitro antimicrobial activity of cefazolin alone and in combination with cefmetazole or flomoxef using agar dilution method and disk diffusion method].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of cefazolin (CEZ) against 251 strains of various clinical isolates obtained during 1989 and 1990 were determined using the Mueller-Hinton agar dilution method at an inoculum level 10(6) CFU/ml. The reliability of the disk susceptility test was also studied using Mueller-Hinton agar and various disks at inoculum levels of 10(3-4) CFU/cm2 in estimating approximate values of MICs. In addition, antimicrobial activities of CEZ and cefmetazole (CMZ) or flomoxef (FMOX) in combination were investigated against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA and MRSA) using the checkerboard agar dilution MIC method and the disk diffusion test either with the disks contained CEZ, CMZ, and FMOX alone, or CEZ, and CMZ or FMOX in combination. In this study, the MICs of CEZ against S. aureus were distributed with the 3 peak values at 0.39 microgram/ml, 3.13 micrograms/ml and > 100 micrograms/ml. MICs against MSSA were 0.39 microgram/ml to 0.78 microgram/ml, whereas those against MRSA were greater than 0.78 microgram/ml. MICs against majority of strains of Enterococcus faecalis were 25 micrograms/ml. Over 90% of strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were inhibited at the level of 3.13 micrograms/ml. About 60% of isolates of indole negative Proteus spp. were inhibited at the levels of less than 3.13 micrograms/ml and 100% at 6.25 micrograms/ml, but MICs against indole positive Proteus spp., Serratia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were over 100 micrograms/ml. The antimicrobial activities of CEZ against these clinical isolates were not significantly different compared to those reported about 15-20 years ago, except for S. aureus. Highly resistant strains of S. aureus to CEZ were more prevalent in this study. The inhibitory zones obtained with the disk test were compared with MICs. The results of CEZ disk susceptibility test with 30 micrograms disk (Showa) or 10 micrograms disk (prepared in this laboratory) were well correlated with MICs (r = -0.837 and -0.814, respectively), showing the reliavility of the disk method in estimating approximate values of MICs. In the 4 category classification system currently used in Japan, break points in MIC values proposed are () MIC < or = 3 micrograms/ml, (++) > 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) > 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) > 60 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with 30 micrograms disks showed false positive in 7.7% and false negative in 6.8% of the samples. The disk results with E. faecalis showed a higher ratio of false positive results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - A descriptive analysis of urine cultures: pure versus mixed isolates.
AB  - Out of 5,670 urine cultures performed in 1989, 1,448 positive cultures with unique results were analyzed. Of these 1,448, 67% were pure cultures, and 50% had at least one isolate with a colony count greater than 100,000 colony forming units/ml. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and diphtheroids were more likely (p < 0.01) to occur in mixed than pure culture, while Escherichia coli was more likely to occur in pure than mixed culture. The most common organism combinations were diphtheroids-coagulase negative Staphylococcus (30 cultures), E. faecalis-coagulase negative Staphylococcus (28), E. faecalis-P. aeruginosa (13), K. pneumoniae-P. aeruginosa (9), and E. coli-P. aeruginosa (9).
TI  - Sequence analysis of the beta-lactamase repressor from Staphylococcus aureus and  hybridization studies with two beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The putative beta-lactamase (Bla) repressor gene, blaI, from the staphylococcal plasmid pI524 was isolated, and the DNA sequence was determined. The sequence of blaI was found to be identical to the blaI sequence from pI9789 (blaI blaZ seg-1), a plasmid related to pI524. A blaI probe from pI524 was hybridized with plasmid and genomic DNA from Bla+ Enterococcus faecalis isolates HH22 and PA. The Bla structural gene of HH22 has been previously shown to be of staphylococcal origin, but DNA homologous to the staphylococcal Bla repressor was not found, indicating that the constitutive production of beta-lactamase in these E. faecalis isolates may be the result of a missing repressor protein.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic interaction between RP 59500 and gram-positive bacteria infecting fibrin clots.
AB  - The fibrin clot penetration and in vivo bactericidal activity of RP 59500, a new  semisynthetic streptogramin, for two Staphylococcus aureus strains (one methicillin resistant and the other methicillin susceptible), two Staphylococcus epidermidis strains (one methicillin resistant and the other methicillin susceptible), and one Enterococcus faecalis strain were evaluated. The clots, inserted subcutaneously, were infected with a mean of 10(8) CFU of the pathogen per g. For each strain, groups of four rabbits received a single intravenous injection of 50 mg of RP 59500 per kg of body weight over 30 min. The mean peak level of RP 59500 in serum in the infected rabbits was 61.9 +/- 6.3 micrograms/ml. The drug was detectable in serum at a level of 0.8 micrograms/ml up to 4 h after administration. The mean peak fibrin clot drug level at 1 h was 3.3 +/- 0.1 micrograms/g. At 6 h, the level in clots was 1.2 +/- 0.1 micrograms/g. The mean half-life in serum in infected rabbits was 0.34 +/- 0.01 h, while in clots the drug exhibited a longer half-life of 3.8 +/- 0.4 h. In vivo, this new streptogramin sterilized the clots infected with the two S. aureus strains studied in less than 1 h and induced a marked reduction in colony counts of the two S. epidermidis strains studied for up to 24 h. The activity of the streptogramin against E. faecalis was limited. These results suggest that RP 59500 should be further evaluated for the treatment of infection with methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
TI  - Comparison of the gentamicin resistance transposon Tn5281 with regions encoding gentamicin resistance in Enterococcus faecalis isolates from diverse geographic locations.
AB  - The genetic determinant encoding gentamicin resistance (Gmr) on the beta-lactamase encoding plasmid pBEM10 of Enterococcus faecalis HH22 is carried on a transposon, termed Tn5281, that is highly related to the staphylococcal Gmr transposons Tn4001 found in Australian isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Tn4031 found in United States isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis. We have now studied plasmid DNA from Gmr strains of E. faecalis isolated from diverse geographical locations (Houston, Pennsylvania, Thailand, and Chile) by using restriction endonuclease analysis and DNA-DNA hybridization to determine whether other Gmr E. faecalis carry Tn5281 or a similar type of element. We also compared these enterococci to several United States isolates of Staphylococcus aureus with nonmobile Gmr determinants. Three E. faecalis isolates (from Houston and Chile) carried Tn5281-like elements, whereas two isolates (from Houston and Pennsylvania) had restriction endonuclease and DNA-DNA hybridization patterns more similar to those of the Tn4001-IS257 hybrid found in the nonmobile Gmr determinants in United States isolates of S. aureus. A strain from Thailand had a third pattern unrelated to either Tn5281 or the nonmobile Gmr determinants present in United States isolates of S. aureus. Our results demonstrate that there is both similarity and diversity between the Gmr determinant of strains of E. faecalis isolated in diverse geographic locations.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AM-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  - AM-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. AM-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis; its MICs for 90% of strains tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. The activity of AM-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Xanthomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Campylobacter jejuni, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. At a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, AM-1155 inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Development of resistance to AM-1155 in S. aureus and S. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. In the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, AM-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. The efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of AM-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. Against experimental pneumonia with Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. AM-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. These results suggest that AM-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.
TI  - Macrophage response to bacteria: induction of marked secretory and cellular activities by lipoteichoic acids.
AB  - Lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) from various bacterial species, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes, were examined for the ability to induce secretory and cellular responses in a pure population of bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes. Some of the highly purified LTAs, in particular LTAs from Bacillus subtilis, S. pyogenes, E. faecalis, and Enterococcus hirae, were able to affect each of the macrophage parameters measured, i.e., reductive capacity, secretion of tumor necrosis factor and nitrite, and tumoricidal activity. As after stimulation with whole organisms or other bacterial products, secretion of tumor necrosis factor induced by these LTAs reached its maximum within the first few hours of the interaction, while secretion of nitrite and tumoricidal activity required 24 to 36 h for full expression. Other purified LTAs, i.e., LTAs from Streptococcus sanguis, S. pneumoniae, and L. monocytogenes, as well as lipomannan from Micrococcus luteus affected only some of these parameters, while native LTA from S. aureus was inactive. There was no obvious correlation between biological activity and chain length, kind of glycosyl substituents, glycolipid structures, or fatty acid composition of LTAs. Deacylation of LTAs resulted in a complete loss of activity, and deacylated LTAs did not impair the activity of their acylated counterparts, suggesting that acyl chains may be essential for binding of LTA to the cell surface. The results demonstrate that some LTA species are potent inducers of macrophage secretory and cellular activities.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of clarithromycin. Spanish Collaborative Group.
AB  - The activity in vitro of clarithromycin, a new macrolide, was compared to that of various antibiotics in tests using 3,880 clinical isolates. Clarithromycin was two times more active than erythromycin against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, streptococci of groups C, G and F, Brucella melitensis, Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma spp., 16 times more active against Ureaplasma urealyticum and 2 to 4 times less active against Campylobacter spp. In general, clarithromycin showed intrinsic activity 2 to 4 times higher than that of roxithromycin and 4 to 8 times higher than that of miocamycin. Cross-resistance was found between the macrolides. Clarithromycin was bactericidal against Streptococcus spp. and Haemophilus influenzae.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1988). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - Isolation frequencies and sensitivities to antibacterial and antibiotic agents were investigated on 801 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 9 hospitals during the period of June to November 1988. Of the above total bacterial population, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.3% and a majority of them were Enterococcus spp. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.7% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis: Vancomycin was most active with its MIC90 < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. Ampicillin, piperacillin, ofloxacin (OFLX), ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and imipenem (IPM) were also active. 2. Staphylococcus aureus: Arbekacin and minocycline were most active with their MIC90s 0.39 microgram/ml and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. Among penicillins, dicloxacillin was the most active. Activities of cephems were considerably lower. 3. E. coli: Most of the agents were tested active. Particularly the second and third generation cephems were active in a range of < or = 0.10-0.20 microgram/ml. Carumonam (CRMN), IPM, OFLX and CPFX were also active with MIC90s < or = 0.10 microgram/ml. 4. Klebsiella pneumoniae CRMN and IPM were highly active. Penicillins generally showed lower activities. Cephems and new quinolones had high activities with their MIC90s in a range of 0.39-0.78 microgram/ml. 5. Proteus mirabilis: The third generation cephems were active with their MIC90s in a range of < or = 0.10-0.20 microgram/ml. CRMN, OFLX and CPFX were also active with their MIC90s < or = 0.10 microgram/ml, 0.39 microgram/ml and 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. 6. Pseudomonas aeruginosa: IPM and tobramycin were active with their MIC90s 1.56 micrograms/ml and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. CRMN and new quinolones showed MIC80s of 25-100 micrograms/ml. Most of penicillins and cephems were not active. 7. Other Gram-negative rods: Against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens, IPM, CPFX and OFLX were active. Penicillins and cephems were not so active. CRMN was active against S. marcescens with its MIC80 at 6.25 micrograms/ml.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of E1077, a novel parenteral cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  - E1077 is a new injectable cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The in vitro activities of E1077 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC of E1077 for 90% of the strains tested [MIC90], 0.78 microgram/ml) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MIC90, 50 micrograms/ml) were similar to those of cefpirome and flomoxef. Against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 6.25 micrograms/ml), E1077 was the most active of the drugs tested and four times more active than cefpirome. The MIC90S of E1077 for streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ranged from 0.05 to 0.78 microgram/ml; E1077 was similar in activity to cefpirome. E1077 inhibited 90% of most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae at concentrations of less than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml, with the exception of Serratia marcescens and Proteus vulgaris (12.5 micrograms/ml). The activity of E1077 against P. aeruginosa (MIC90, 6.25 micrograms/ml) was comparable to that of ceftazidime. In vivo activity was evaluated with systemic infections in mice. E1077 showed a protective effect against systemic infections by gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria, as reflected by its in vitro activity. The protective effects of E1077 were higher than those of cefpirome against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa infections and similar to those of cefpirome against other bacterial infections. Morphological studies using differential interference and phase-contrast microscopy showed that low concentrations of E1077 caused swelling of S. aureus and spheroplast and bulge formation in P. aeruginosa. In general, the antibacterial profile of E1077 is similar to that of cefpirome.
TI  - A novel electrical method for the prevention of microbial colonization of intravascular cannulae.
AB  - An electrical device designed to prevent microbial attachment to plastic intravascular cannulae is described. The device produced an electrical current (10 microA) in both carbon-impregnated and 'Hydrocath' cannulae. In-vitro models were utilized to demonstrate that the current can block several mechanisms by which microorganisms gain initial access to intravascular devices, including extra- and intra-luminal routes. The electrical system prevented organisms from traversing along both the external and internal surfaces of the cannulae. Effective prevention of cannula colonization was demonstrated subsequent to challenge with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. The findings suggest that the electrical device may offer in-vivo cannula protection from microbial attachment and colonization, thereby reducing the potential for infection.
TI  - Evaluation of the E test by using selected gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The E test (AB Biodisk NA Inc.) was compared with standard reference methods using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards's recommendations for determining the MICs of four selected antibiotics against 208 clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria. These bacteria included 32 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 25 strains of Enterococcus faecium, 20 strains of oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (OSSA), 96 strains of oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (ORSA), and 35 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Evaluation included MIC accuracy within 1 dilution, reproducibility testing, and cost analysis. There was 94% agreement between the E test and the reference method in testing S. pneumoniae and penicillin G. There was 92% agreement with ampicillin and 100% agreement with vancomycin in testing E. faecium isolates. Accuracy of the oxacillin E test with staphylococci was significantly improved by the use of salt-supplemented Mueller-Hinton agar, for an agreement of 100% with coagulase-negative staphylococci and oxacillin-sensitive S. aureus and that of 85% with oxacillin-resistant S. aureus, with no major discrepancies. The E test with American Type Culture Collection isolates and clinical strains gave excellent reproducibility and was less costly than microdilution panels when used to test fewer than three antibiotics. The E test is a simple, reliable, reproducible, and cost-effective method for MIC determination for gram-positive organisms.
TI  - The activity of metal compounds against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - We evaluated the antimicrobial activity of two metal compounds, JM-1397 (OsO2[xylyl]2) and JM-2469 (AuCl[S2CPEt3]). Both inhibited methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus at concentrations of 0.5-2 micrograms/ml, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) of 1 microgram/ml for JM-1397 and 0.5 microgram/ml for JM-2469. Similar concentrations inhibited methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus). JM-2469 inhibited group A, B, C, F, and G beta-hemolytic streptococci and viridans group streptococci at 1-8 micrograms/ml (MIC90 4 micrograms/ml) but Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium had MICs of 8-16 micrograms/ml. JM-1397 had MICs for these organisms of greater than 64 micrograms/ml. Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides, and Clostridium species were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.12-4 micrograms/ml (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/ml). MICs of both compounds for Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. were greater than 64 micrograms/ml. These studies show that osmium and gold compounds have potential as topical agents against Gram-positive and anaerobic species.
TI  - In vitro activity of MC-352, a new 16-membered macrolide.
AB  - The in vitro activity of MC-352, 3,4'-dideoxy-5-O-mycaminosyltylonolide, was compared with those of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and rokitamycin. The MC-352 MIC90 (MIC for 90% of isolates) for erythromycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, similar to those of the other agents. The MC-352 MIC50 for erythromycin-resistant S. aureus was 2 micrograms/ml, similar to that of rokitamycin. The MC-352 MIC90 (0.12 micrograms/ml) for Streptococcus pyogenes was similar to those of erythromycin and clarithromycin and superior to that of rokitamycin, and the MC-352 MIC90 for group B, C, and G streptococci was 0.25 microgram/ml. MC-352 and clarithromycin had an MIC90 of 0.12 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Erythromycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis was inhibited by MC-352 at 1 microgram/ml, but the MIC for constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates was greater than 16 micrograms/ml. Legionella pneumophila was inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. MC-352 was the most active agent against Bacteroides fragilis, with an MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml, and was more active than the other agents against Haemophilus influenzae, with an MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. Moraxella spp. were inhibited by MC-352 at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. The MIC90 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia spp. was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MC-352 was bactericidal for S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, and its activity was not altered by human serum.
TI  - Evaluation of Bactec high blood volume resin media.
AB  - BACTEC PLUS high-blood-volume resin media (aerobic BP 26 vial and anaerobic BP 27 vial) were compared with standard BACTEC media (aerobic NR 6A and anaerobic NR 7A vial). A total of 2253 blood culture sets, each consisting of the four vials, were collected. Positive cultures were obtained from 403 sets and grew 428 organisms; 271 organisms were considered as significant. The BACTEC PLUS high blood volume resin (BP-HBV) media grew significantly more Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. After taking into account the difference of blood volume between the two systems, only S. aureus was significantly more detected by the aerobic BP 26 vial. An enhanced recovery rate with the anaerobic BP 27 vial could not be established. BP-HBV media had an enhanced recovery rate over the standard BACTEC media for S. aureus and C. albicans in patients receiving antibiotics.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of SCE-2787, a new parenteral cephalosporin with  a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  - SCE-2787, a new cephalosporin having a condensed azolium moiety in the 3 position and an aminothiadiazolyl group in the 7 beta side chain, was evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo activities in comparison with those of ceftazidime, flomoxef, cefpirome, and E1040. Against methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, SCE-2787 was more active than ceftazidime and E1040 and was as active as flomoxef and cefpirome, with MICs for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) being 1.56 micrograms/ml or less. SCE-2787 was also active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, for which the MIC90 was 6.25 micrograms/ml, which was lower than that of cefpirome and comparable to that of ceftazidime. SCE-2787 was marginally active against methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci and Enterococcus faecalis, although its MIC90s were the lowest among those of the antibiotics tested. The activities of SCE-2787 against Streptococcus species, most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, and Haemophilus influenzae exceeded those of ceftazidime and flomoxef and were comparable to those of cefpirome. Furthermore, MIC90s of SCE-2787 were significantly lower than those of ceftazidime for ceftazidime-resistant isolates of Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae. SCE-2787 was resistant to hydrolysis by various types of beta-lactamases, including the Bush group 1 beta-lactamases, and had low affinities for these enzymes, with Km or Ki values of greater than 100 microM. The in vitro activity of SCE-2787 was reflected in its efficacy in mouse protection tests. Thus, SCE-2787 appears to be a promising cephalosporin that should be further evaluated in clinical trials.
TI  - In-vitro activity of RP 59500, a semisynthetic streptogramin, against staphylococci and streptococci.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of RP 59500, an injectable streptogramin derived from pristinamycin, was determined by agar dilution and compared with that of pristinamycin. Two hundred and sixty-one recent clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci were tested against both antibiotics. The two compounds displayed similar activities. The MIC90s of RP 59500 ranged from 0.5 to 2 mg/L in 114 strains of Staphylococcus aureus showing various phenotypes of antibiotic resistance (penicillin-susceptible; penicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible; methicillin-resistant; erythromycin-resistant, either inducible or constitutive; quinolone-resistant). Similar results were obtained with coagulase-negative staphylococci. RP 59500 was consistently active against streptococci, with MIC90s of 0.25, 0.25 and 0.50 mg/L for Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 20), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 20) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 20), respectively. Enterococcus faecalis (n = 20) appeared to be notably less susceptible (MIC90, 8 mg/L). In view of this consistent activity against all staphylococci and streptococci tested, including multiply resistant isolates, RP 59500 merits further investigation.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of teicoplanin, daptomycin, ramoplanin, vancomycin, and PD127,391 against blood isolates of gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The in vitro activities of teicoplanin, daptomycin, ramoplanin, and PD127,391, a  new quinolone, were compared with that of vancomycin. Teicoplanin showed the lowest MICs against Enterococcus faecalis. Ramoplanin was slightly more active than the other peptide antibiotics against oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The MICs of the four peptide antibiotics were similar for the oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus. Daptomycin had good activity against staphylococci but was the least active agent against E. faecalis. The MICs of vancomycin against all isolates were in general higher than those of the new antibiotics, with the exceptions of the MICs of daptomycin against E. faecalis and teicoplanin against oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis. PD127,391 was the most active agent against all staphylococcal isolates.
TI  - Influence of transient salivary flora on assessment of mutans streptococci level  by the "Strip mutans" method.
AB  - The Dentocult SM ("Strip mutans") method occasionally shows decoloration of broth and of colonies of mutans streptococci on the plastic strip, thereby making interpretation difficult. In an attempt to explain the phenomenon and to investigate the influence of the salivary flora on the "Strip mutans" method, a total of 46 subjects were sampled. Saliva was analyzed using the "Strip mutans" method and conventional plating techniques to identify mutans streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci, enteric bacteria, and yeasts. Approximately 85% of the "Strip mutans" scores coincided with the conventional MSB-plating method. Two samples showed decolored mutans streptococci colonies on the "Strip mutans" strip. Enterococcus spp. were present in the saliva of these test subjects and could grow in the "Strip mutans" broth. Enterococcus faecalis was able to induce the same type of decoloration under experimental pure culture conditions. Three "Strip mutans" samples showed small colonies of mutans streptococci, visible only under magnification (x 10-20). Staphylococcus epidermidis was present in these saliva samples and showed heavy growth in the broth. Under experimental pure culture conditions S. epidermidis also inhibited the growth of mutans streptococci to some extent.
TI  - Study on the influence of adsorbent substances against the antigen activity of inactivated orovaccines.
AB  - Specific IgAGM, IgA and IgG levels were evaluated in two groups of rabbits orally treated with inactivated vaccine consisting of Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis and with the same vaccine supplemented with charcoal and kaolin, respectively. The determinations demonstrated that charcoal and kaolin do not have a significant, negative effect on immunoresponses at the intestinal and hematic level after both medium (two-week) and prolonged (four-week) treatment.
TI  - Co-transfer of vancomycin and other resistance genes from Enterococcus faecalis NCTC 12201 to Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Conjugative transfer, in the apparent absence of plasmid DNA, of high-level vancomycin resistance from Enterococcus faecalis NCTC 12201 to Staphylococcus aureus B111 has been demonstrated in vivo and in vitro. Selection of transconjugants on media containing erythromycin or chloramphenicol may result in the transfer of resistance to erythromycin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, streptomycin and vancomycin though these are capable of separate transfer. Vancomycin resistance has not been transmitted from staphylococcus to staphylococcus though transfer of erythromycin and of chloramphenicol resistance has been achieved.
TI  - The postantibiotic suppressive effect of L-ofloxacin, an optically active isomer  of ofloxacin.
AB  - The postantibiotic suppressive effect (PAE) of L-ofloxacin was studied and compared with those of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin. The PAE of L-ofloxacin was observed against all Gram-positive organisms tested: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis. At the achievable serum concentrations L-ofloxacin showed a longer PAE than ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin. Exposure of organisms to 4 micrograms/ml of L-ofloxacin for 2 hr produced a 3.1 and 4.2 hr PAE for methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant staphylococci, respectively. Against E. faecalis and S. epidermidis, the PAEs of L-ofloxacin were 1.9 and 1.6 hr, respectively.
TI  - Handwashing and disinfection of heavily contaminated hands--effective or ineffective?
AB  - Hands are among the principal vehicles for transfer of nosocomial pathogens in hospitals. Often, outbreaks of infection are thought to be caused by a lack of compliance with handwashing guidelines, rather than due to the inadequacy of the handwashing agents used. In this study the effectiveness of proper handwashing and the use of three different hand disinfectants: ethanol 70% (E), isopropanol 40% (I) and alcoholic chlorhexidine (70%) (AC) was compared using three volunteers whose fingertips were heavily contaminated with a succession of bacteria including: Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae. After each contamination, thorough handwashing and application of one disinfectant on the hands were performed three times. Fingerprint-samples were taken before and 1 min after application of the disinfectants. Thorough handwashing with an ordinary liquid soap ('Sterisol') did not reduce the confluent growth of bacteria on fingertips for any of the species used (197 examinations). Only AC had a significant effect on fingers heavily contaminated with S. aureus (126 examinations; AC compared with E and I; P less than 0.0002 and P less than 0.0002 respectively), but did not completely eradicate the bacteria. After contamination with Ent. cloacae (118 examinations), none of the three agents were particularly effective, but E and AC seemed to be somewhat more effective than I (P less than 0.0002 and P less than 0.01 respectively). When successive contamination was performed using all bacterial species, AC was the most effective decontaminant. However, Ent. cloacae was still present on the fingertips after 15 repeated courses of handwashing and applications of disinfectants. Bathing of hands in AC for 20s completely eradicated all bacteria from the hands. The study demonstrates that, when heavily contaminated, an ordinary handwashing followed by disinfectants is not enough to eradicate potentially pathogenic bacteria from the hands.
TI  - In vitro activity of the new glycopeptide decaplanin.
AB  - The activity of decaplanin, a new glycopeptide, was compared to that of vancomycin, teicoplanin and daptomycin. Decaplanin was two- to four-fold less active than vancomycin, telcoplanin and daptomycin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with an MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml for methicillin-susceptible and 4 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant isolates. Decaplanin had activity similar to that of vancomycin against Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, group C and G streptococci, with an MIC90 of 0.12 micrograms/ml. It was less active than the other agents against the viridans group streptococci (MIC90 4 micrograms/ml). The activity of decaplanin against enterococci (MIC90 4 micrograms/ml) was similar to that of vancomycin. Clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, peptostreptococci and peptococci by 0.25 microgram/ml. Decaplanin was active from pH 5.5 to 7.5. Inoculum size had a minimal effect on MICs, and increased concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ and 50% serum did not alter MICs or MBCs.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of a 1,8-naphthyridine quinolone, PD 131628.
AB  - A new 1,8-naphthyridine quinolone antimicrobial, PD131628, was found to be as, or more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against Escherichia coli and considerably more active than the two 4-quinolone agents against staphylococci in terms of both MIC and OBC (the optimum bactericidal concentration, at which the rate of kill is greatest). In common with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, the rate of kill of PD131628 against Enterococcus faecalis was considerably slower than against the other three species tested. Bacterial protein synthesis, RNA synthesis and cell division were not required for the bactericidal activity of PD131628 against E. coli or the staphylococci, although the lethality of PD131628 in the absence of these activities was reduced.
TI  - The in-vitro antibacterial activity of a combination of cefpirome or cefoperazone with vancomycin against enterococci and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Cefpirome, cefoperazone and ceftazidime were tested for their in-vitro activity against Enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates. Cefpirome was the most active cephalosporin followed by cefoperazone. Ceftazidime had only very limited activity against these strains. In experiments with cefpirome/vancomycin and cefoperazone/vancomycin combinations, synergy was detected against most MRSA strains and some enterococci. Antagonism did not occur.
TI  - In vitro activity of decaplanin (M86-1410), a new glycopeptide antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro activity of decaplanin (formerly M86-1410), a novel glycopeptide antimicrobial agent, was tested against 169 gram-positive bloodstream isolates from patients at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics and 12 selected vancomycin-resistant strains. Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, bacilli, corynebacteria, and listeria were inhibited by decaplanin (MICs for 90% of the strains tested [MIC90s], 0.12 to 4 micrograms/ml). However, some rarely isolated and selected Enterococcus sp. populations had a MIC90 of 16 micrograms/ml, and S. haemolyticus strains had a MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml. These in vitro results suggest that decaplanin may be useful against most gram-positive strains, even though some Enterococcus species and coagulase-negative staphylococci were potentially resistant (MICs, greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Antibacterials. synthesis and structure-activity studies of 3-aryl-2-oxooxazolidines. 4. Multiply-substituted aryl derivatives.
AB  - The synthesis and structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of the effect of  different polysubstitution patterns in the aromatic ring of 5-(acetamidomethyl)oxazolidinone antibacterials (I) on antibacterial activity are presented. Compounds I were prepared by the six-step synthesis described previously (Gregory, W. A.; et al. J. Med. Chem. [formula: see text] 1989, 32, 1673), electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions of 3-substituted compounds, and functional-group interchange reactions of 3,4-disubstituted compounds. Antibacterial evaluation of compounds I against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis gave the following results. The 2,4- and 2,5-disubstituted derivatives have weak or no antibacterial activity. Antibacterial activities of 3,4-disubstituted compounds are comparable to those of the 4-monosubstituted analogues for small 3-substituents (smaller than Br), but decline rapidly for larger 3-substituents. 3,4-Annulated derivatives are comparable in activity to their open-chain analogues. 3,5-Disubstituted and 3,4,5- and 2,4,6-trisubstituted derivatives are devoid of antibacterial activity.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of E1077, a new cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  - E1077 is a novel parenteral cephalosporin with a wide spectrum of potent antibacterial activity against aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, E1077 was twice as active as cefpirome, with an MIC for 90% of strains tested (MIC90) of 0.78 micrograms/ml. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was moderately to highly resistant to E1077, but E1077 was at least twice as active as other beta-lactams tested. Against Enterococcus faecalis, E1077 was the most active of the cephalosporins tested (MIC90, 12.5 micrograms/ml) and was at least fourfold more active than cefpirome and ceftazidime. At concentrations of less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml, E1077 inhibited 90% of streptococci and most of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested, with the exceptions of Serratia marcescens and Proteus vulgaris, for which the MIC90s of E1077 were both 3.13 micrograms/ml. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E1077 was two- to fourfold more active than cefpirome and ceftazidime. For the anaerobes, E1077 was as active against Bacteroides fragilis as was cefuzonam, and its activity was fourfold higher than those of cefpirome and ceftazidime. E1077 was at least as resistant as cefpirome to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases, and these enzymes had a low affinity for E1077.
TI  - [Antimicrobial and membranolytic activities of anti-burn drug fenozan].
AB  - Fenozan, an anti-burn preparation, was shown to have antimicrobial activity against freshly isolated clinical strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis, as well as against collection strains of the other gram-positive bacteria. The antimicrobial action of the preparation was possibly due to impairment of permeability of the cytoplasmic membranes in the sensitive bacterial cells and their liberation of intracellular low molecular weight compounds to the environment. The membranolytic and minimum inhibitory concentrations of fenozan with respect to the sensitive bacterial cells were one order of magnitude lower than the concentration stabilizing the membranes of animal cells in the treatment of burns. Combination of the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties in fenozan was likely to provide its satisfactory therapeutic effect in the treatment of burn wounds.
TI  - The housefly (Musca domestica) as a carrier of pathogenic microorganisms in a hospital environment.
AB  - Houseflies have long been regarded as potential carriers of microorganisms. Since pathogenic microorganisms are widespread in the hospital environment, there is abundant opportunity for flies to become contaminated and, in turn, to contaminate the patient environment. In the present study, an attempt was made to isolate and identify pathogenic bacteria, fungi and parasites from the housefly Musca domestica collected in the surgical ward of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences Hospital and also in a remote residential area located 5 km from the hospital. A total of 113 flies were collected: 65 from a surgical ward (test) and 48 from a residential area for comparison. Ten genera of bacteria were isolated from the test group of flies compared with nine from the control group. In primary isolations, it was observed that the load of bacteria carried by the test group of flies was significantly more (P less than 0.001) than for the control flies. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and viridans streptococci were isolated only from the test flies. The isolation rate of Staphylococcus aureus was significantly higher (P less than 0.001) in test houseflies than in the control houseflies. There was no significant difference in isolation of parasitic ova and cysts from test and control houseflies. Candida spp. were isolated in almost equal numbers from both groups of houseflies, yet none of these was Candida albicans. Houseflies therefore may act as vectors of potentially pathogenic bacteria in a hospital environment.
TI  - [A report on a clinical experience of which has successfully made several antibiotics-resistant bacteria (MRSA etc.) negative on a bedsore].
AB  - At the treatment of a bedsore of which had been resistant to various sorts of antibiotics, the mixture of several drugs was used for the treatment of its bedsore. Those drugs from which were used as the drugs-mixture, are 1% liquid of Pioctanin (C24H28N3Cl). 600 mg of Ascorbic acid, 9 mg of Pantothenic calcium and 20mg of hydrochloric Amitriptyline, respectively. The drugs-mixture, as mentioned above, has been scattered over its bedsore before the usual traditional treatment. After that, the bedsore has been treated by Gebencream (1% Cream of Sulfadiazine silver) as usually. Since a few days after that, Pseudomonas aeruginosa has never been able to be found on its bedsore at all. After a month, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Serratia marcescens, which had been resistant to many antibioticus till that, cannot be found at all, too.
TI  - Comparison of enterococcal and staphylococcal beta-lactamase-encoding fragments.
AB  - A restriction map of a 13.5-kb EcoRI fragment encoding beta-lactamase from a plasmid isolated from enterococcal strain PA was prepared and found to differ markedly from the published maps of beta-lactamase-encoding EcoRI fragments of two staphylococcal plasmids and the plasmid from enterococcal strain HH22. This comparison also showed that one of two contiguous EcoRV fragments that encompass the beta-lactamase gene differs in size in the PA strain from that found in the other strains. However, restriction sites in the beta-lactamase structural gene (blaZ) were identical in all four plasmids. Further studies compared the beta-lactamase genes of four clinical enterococcal isolates from various geographic locations with those described above. Isolates from Virginia and Florida generated EcoRV fragments identical to those from the plasmid from strain PA, while isolates from Lebanon and Argentina showed EcoRV fragments analogous to those from HH22 and the staphylococci studied. Although there is evidence suggesting that some of these beta-lactamase-producing enterococcal isolates represent a single strain, this study indicates that there is significant variation in the plasmids that encode beta-lactamase.
TI  - The effect of isolated high-energy shock wave treatments on subsequent bacterial  growth.
AB  - To determine whether high-energy shock waves possess bactericidal potential, ATCC strains of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were suspended in solution at concentrations approximating 10(6) bacteria per milliliter, placed in polypropylene cryovials, and immersed in the water bath of a Dornier HM3 lithotriptor. Each cryovial was then fluoroscopically guided to the epicenter of the f2 focal point and 2000 shocks at 20 kV applied. Suspensions were then serially diluted and colony counts obtained. The procedure was then repeated with 4000 shocks at 20 kV from the Dornier HM3 and 4000 shocks at intensity level 4 from a Wolff Piezolith 2200 shock wave lithotriptor. Comparison of shock-wave-treated and sham-treated bacterial suspensions revealed no significant difference in bacterial growth according to the colony count technique. We conclude that high-energy shock waves, whether generated by spark gap or piezoelectric array, do not possess significant bactericidal activity.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefodizime.
AB  - Cefodizime is a bactericidal cephem with the typical broad spectrum activity of an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, including both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria: its MIC90 is 0.125 mg/l for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and other streptococci; and 0.05 mg/l for Haemophilus spp., Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Moraxella catarrhalis; while beta-lactamase positive strains of M. catarrhalis require 1 mg/l. Less than 1 mg/l is needed for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp. and Shigella spp. The MIC90 is 4 mg/l for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. and most strains of Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and most strains of Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. are considered cefodizime-resistant. Cefodizime is unaffected by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but it is hydrolyzed by some chromosomally mediated enzymes, thus resembling other third-generation cephalosporins. Cefodizime has high affinity for PBP 3 and PBP IA and IB (Escherichia coli); in S. aureus it shows the highest affinity for PBP 1.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BAY Y3118, a new full-spectrum fluoroquinolone.
AB  - BAY Y3118, 1-cyclopropyl-7-(2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8- chloro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity against an expanded spectrum of species including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and also anaerobes such as Bacteriodes fragilis and Clostridium perfringens. MIC90s for S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. faecalis, and S. pneumoniae clinical isolates were 0.125, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against methicillin- and/or quinolone-resistant S. aureus, MIC50 levels of BAY Y3118 were 10- to 100-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, or ciprofloxacin. The potency of BAY Y3118 against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae generally was equal to or 2-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin or tosufloxacin. BAY Y3118 was also highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Increasing inoculum concentrations had a minimal effect on MIC determinations. The drug was determined to be bactericidal based upon reference MBCs and time-kill curves. From the results presented here, it was concluded that this new compound surpasses other known 4-quinolones both in spectrum and activity and that its further evaluation by in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies seems warranted.
TI  - Stimulation of monokine production by lipoteichoic acids.
AB  - Lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) isolated from bacterial species, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes A, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Listeria monocytogenes, were tested for their ability to stimulate the production of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha in cultured human monocytes. LTAs from S. aureus and S. pneumoniae failed to induce monokine production when applied in the concentration range of 0.05 to 5.0 micrograms/ml. However, LTAs from several enterococcal species (0.5 to 5 micrograms/ml) induced the release of all three monokines at levels similar to those observed after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. The kinetics of IL-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha release elicited by LTAs closely resembled those observed following lipopolysaccharide application. Cytokine production occurred in the presence of both fetal calf serum and autologous human serum. Hence, it was not dependent on complement activation and could not be suppressed by naturally occurring human antibodies. Deacylation caused the total loss of monocyte stimulatory capacity. Deacylated LTAs were unable to prevent monocyte activation by intact LTAs, so primary binding of these molecules probably does not involve a simple interaction of a membrane receptor with the hydrophilic portion of the molecule. The results identify some species of LTAs as inducers of monokine production in human monocytes.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents, 1989. A study mainly focused on imipenem. The Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibilities of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1989. The susceptibility testing was carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: (+++), (++), (+) and (-). IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Bacteroides fragilis and had rather strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Achromobacter xylosoxidans, but was less active to Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Xanthomonas maltophilia. IPM has been found to have activities superior to those of other antibiotics tested against E. faecalis, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis. No antibiotics tested showed good activities against MRSA except minocycline.
TI  - The killing activity of microwaves on some non-sporogenic and sporogenic medically important bacterial strains.
AB  - The killing activity of microwaves of 2450 MHz frequency and 325 W, 650 W and 1400 W power on some bacterial strains was investigated. Vegetative strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes Group A, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis and spores of Bacillus subtilis and Bacillis stearothermophilus in aqueous suspensions were exposed to 325 W and 650 W waves for different lengths of time. Enterococcus faecalis and spores of B. subtilis and B. stearothermophilus were exposed additionally to 1400 W waves in aqueous and 'dried' suspensions. Vegetative bacteria were promptly killed in 5 min or less, E. faecalis being slightly more resistant. Bacterial spores were only killed in aqueous suspension when a 1400 W setting was used for 10 to 20 min. Bacterial spores adhering to the tube walls after the aqueous suspension was poured out were reduced in number. We assume that the conventional microwave ovens available on the market may be used for a high level of disinfection but not for sterilization, and only then if sufficient water is present.
TI  - In-vitro activity of temafloxacin for gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of temafloxacin against aerobic Gram-positive cocci was compared to that of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, fleroxacin and pefloxacin using the broth microdilution technique. Temafloxacin was more active than the other four fluoroquinolones, particularly for viridans streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The MIC90 of temafloxacin was at least four-fold lower than that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for viridans streptococci and penicillin-susceptible pneumococci. The MIC50s and MIC90s of temafloxacin were equal to or lower than those of the other fluoroquinolones for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci. Temafloxacin was more active against all the other Gram-positive aerobes (except Enterococcus faecalis) tested than the other fluoroquinolones.
TI  - Interaction of imipenem with erythromycin and tetracycline assessed by microdilution checkerboard techniques.
AB  - Microdilution methodology was used to study the interaction of imipenem with erythromycin and tetracycline, a combination therapy that might be used for the treatment of serious pelvic inflammatory disease. The combination of imipenem and erythromycin showed no antagonism for Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae but was antagonistic for Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and group B streptococci; the combination of imipenem and tetracycline was antagonistic for all strains except H. influenzae. Correlation between the results of kill curves and the measurement of fractional bactericidal concentration (FBC) indices was good, although FBC indices showed less antagonism than kill curves. Fractional inhibitory concentration indices showed poor correlation, rarely showing antagonism, and indeed showed synergy in three cases. If erythromycin or tetracycline is considered necessary in addition to imipenem in the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease, it is probably more effective when given after the course of imipenem has been completed.
TI  - Crossover assessment of serum bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin alone and in combination in healthy elderly volunteers.
AB  - To better define the pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activity (SBA) of ciprofloxacin and other antimicrobial agents in the elderly, six healthy (greater than 65 years) volunteers with normal renal function were given ciprofloxacin alone orally, ciprofloxacin plus rifampin orally, ciprofloxacin plus clindamycin orally, rifampin alone orally (three volunteers), and, for comparison of SBA against gram-positive cocci, vancomycin intravenously. Mean peak ciprofloxacin concentrations and other pharmacokinetic parameters were not altered significantly by coadministration of either rifampin or clindamycin. Ciprofloxacin had somewhat greater SBA against the oxacillin-susceptible and oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains tested than did vancomycin, but rifampin was by far the most active single agent tested. The SBA of rifampin against S. aureus was modestly antagonized during combination therapy with ciprofloxacin, but substantial SBA still was present. The ciprofloxacin SBA against S. aureus was completely antagonized by clindamycin if the strains were susceptible to the latter agent. Ciprofloxacin had modest SBA against group A streptococci and no SBA against the three pneumococcal strains tested. All of the regimens had poor to absent SBA against Enterococcus faecalis. By contrast, ciprofloxacin had excellent SBA against Escherchia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and moderate SBA against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Combination therapy with rifampin or clindamycin in general enhanced the SBA against the nonenterococcal streptococci and had no effect on the SBA against the gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Bacterial growth on suction drain tips. Prospective study of 489 clean orthopedic operations.
AB  - The study included 489 clean orthopedic operations with implantation of major foreign materials (joint replacements and internal fixations of fractures). Specimens for culture were taken from the suction drainage system, either from the drain fluid or from the drain-tube tip or from both. Six superficial and five deep infections were seen following the operations. Only two cultures of drain fluid were positive, and neither of these became infected. Positive drain-tip cultures were seen after 56 operations, and of these, five were followed by infection. The risk of infection was increased if Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, or Streptococcus faecalis was cultured from drain tips. Drain-tip cultures growing only coagulase-negative staphylococci, nonhemolytic streptococci, and corynebacteria were not correlated with increased risk of infection. There was a not significant tendency towards fewer infections if positive drain-tip cultures with virulent bacteria were treated with specific antibiotics.
TI  - Synergy and cumulated killing effect of the penems FCE 22101 and FCE 25199 in combination with gentamicin against bacteria isolated from septicaemia.
AB  - Blood isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli and Klebsiella oxytoca were tested for their synergistic and cumulated killing effect (CKE) with the new penems FCE 22101 or FCE 25199 in combination with gentamicin. The tissue cage model in rabbits was used to study the CKE in vivo after antibiotic treatment of the bacteria in vitro. Synergy was observed within two to seven h with all isolates in early logarithmic phase, except with S. aureus, which was rapidly killed by the penems alone. After one h treatment with the antibiotic combinations in vitro, a CKE was demonstrated for up to six h both in vitro and in vivo. The magnitude of the CKE differed between strains and in vitro vs. in vivo.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of ofloxacin against recent isolates from patients with community-acquired infections].
AB  - In order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (OFLX) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. The following conclusions were reached. 1. Comparison of the MIC distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of OFLX-resistant isolates with the passage of time of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella ssp., Enterobacter spp., Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Most common elevations of MIC values against these bacteria were observed in MIC80 and MIC90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in MIC50 values. However, MIC50's of OFLX against Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. Most of the OFLX-resistant strains of S. aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (MRSA). Furthermore, MIC80 of OFLX against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. Susceptibility of Streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. The results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. Bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of OFLX-resistant strains even in 1990 were Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Campylobacter spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. 4. Recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of OFLX-resistant strains among many bacteria. However, the bacteria which contained high percentages of OFLX-resistant strains except for MRSA were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of MIC values were only observed in MIC80 and MIC90. These results suggested that OFLX preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from patients at 6 hospitals in Osaka].
AB  - We examined MICs of 6 oral new quinolones and 4 oral cephems against bacteria isolated from patients at 6 hospitals in Osaka during the period from January to June in 1990, and the following results were obtained. 1. All species excluding Streptococcus pyogenes were more sensitive with less frequencies of resistance to new quinolones than to cephems. In new quinolones, tosufloxacin (TFLX) was the most active against Gram-positive cocci and ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and TFLX had the highest activities against Gram-negative rods. 2. Resistant (MIC of CPFX greater than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml) strains to new quinolones were observed at higher frequencies than 10% among Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Serratia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia. 3. The frequency of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to new quinolones isolated from in-patients or urine was significantly higher than that from out-patients or other sources. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in resistance frequencies of P. aeruginosa due to types of patients or sources. But, there were significant differences in frequencies of resistant organisms of either species to new quinolones among hospitals. 4. Twenty-seven strains (19.7%) of 137 S. aureus strains examined were methicillin-resistant, and they were similarly resistant to new quinolones also. Methicillin susceptible S. aureus were also similarly sensitive to new quinolones.
TI  - Lack of homology of enterococci which have high-level resistance to trimethoprim  with the dfrA gene of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Multiresistant enterococci were tested for susceptibility to trimethoprim (TMP).  Although most enterococci are inhibited by less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, the MICs for 7 of 29 selected multiresistant isolates were greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, including for two beta-lactamase positive (Bla+) strains, for which the MICs of TMP were greater than 1,000 micrograms/ml, and for another Bla+ strain, for which the MIC was 128 micrograms/ml. None of five isolates tested transferred TMP resistance and none of the resistant isolates hybridized to the dfrA gene of Staphylococcus aureus. Whether TMP resistance in enterococci is due to a mutation(s) or to acquisition of a new gene is not known. Acquisition of resistance to TMP is another example of the multiple antimicrobial resistance typically displayed by enterococci.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the beta-lactamase gene from Enterococcus faecalis HH22 and its similarity to staphylococcal beta-lactamase genes.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the constitutively produced beta-lactamase (Bla) gene  from Enterococcus faecalis HH22 was shown to be identical to the published sequences of three of four staphylococcal type A beta-lactamase genes; more differences were seen with the genes for staphylococcal type C and D enzymes. One hundred forty nucleotides upstream of the beta-lactamase start codon were determined for an inducible staphylococcal beta-lactamase and were identical to those of the constitutively expressed enterococcal gene, indicating that the changes resulting in constitutive expression are not due to changes in the promoter or operator region. Moreover, complementation studies indicated that production of the enterococcal enzyme could be repressed. The genes for the enterococcal Bla and an inducible staphylococcal Bla were each cloned into a shuttle vector and transformed into enterococcal and staphylococcal recipients. The major difference between the backgrounds of the two hosts was that more enzyme was produced by the staphylococcal host, regardless of the source of the gene. The location of the enzyme was found to be host dependent, since each cloned gene generated extracellular (free) enzyme in the staphylococcus and cell-bound enzyme in the enterococcus. On the basis of the identities of the enterococcal Bla and several staphylococcal Bla sequences, these data suggest the recent spread of beta-lactamase to enterococci and also suggest the loss of a functional repressor.
TI  - Effect of NaCl-induced osmotic stress on intracellular concentrations of glycine  betaine and potassium in Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococci.
AB  - Staphylococci are more salt tolerant than are enterococci or Escherichia coli. They have a more rigid cell wall and higher internal turgor pressure. The mechanisms of NaCl-induced osmotic tolerance among these bacteria were examined by determining the generation of osmoprotective activity of cellular extracts and intracellular concentrations of glycine betaine and potassium (K+) in response to graded amounts of NaCl. Staphylococci as well as E. coli were shown to require choline or glycine betaine to achieve maximal salt tolerance. In response to 0.9 mol/L NaCl, E. coli exhibited a marked increase in osmoprotective activity, a 168-fold rise in glycine betaine, and a 2.3-fold rise in K+. Enterococcus faealis exhibited a small increase in osmoprotective activity, a 9.3-fold increase in glycine betaine, and a twofold increase in K+. In contrast, strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus were found to have considerably greater osmoprotective activity, glycine betaine, and K+ than other organisms, even in the absence of external osmotic stress. Glycine betaine rose in some strains, but K+ remained virtually unchanged as the concentration of NaCl was increased. The high concentrations of glycine betaine and K+ in staphylococci, even in the absence of osmotic stress, may explain in part their remarkable salt tolerance and high turgor pressure.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new glycopeptide SK&F 104662 against problematic gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new glycopeptide antibiotic SK&F 104662 against problematic gram-positive microorganisms was determined using the agar dilution technique. For comparison, ampicillin, oxacillin, vancomycin, erythromycin and gentamicin were tested. SK&F 104662 was found to have high activity against Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (both methicillin sensitive and resistant strains), Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium jeikeium and Corynebacterium group D2. All of 254 isolates, except one vancomycin-resistant strain of Enterococcus faecium, were inhibited by 2 mg/l of SK&F 104662; this compound may thus be potentially useful in the treatment of infections with the above-mentioned gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Distribution, antibiotic susceptibility and tolerance of bacterial isolates in culture-positive cases of endocarditis in The Netherlands.
AB  - During a two-year period data were collected nationwide in The Netherlands on 438 episodes of bacterial endocarditis (BE) in 432 patients. Of the strains isolated in these patients 419 were available for analysis. Of these, 326 were isolated in native valve endocarditis (NVE) and 93 in prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). Viridans streptococci, staphylococci and enterococci together constituted 87% of the isolates. More than 46% of the viridans streptococci consisted of Streptococcus sanguis. Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus were the predominant species in the late form of PVE. The majority of the viridans streptococci and haemolytic streptococci were highly susceptible to penicillin. Five of 35 strains of coagulase negative staphylococci were resistant to methicillin. Eleven percent of a random sample of the streptococci collected were tolerant to penicillin. After repeated exposure to a concentration gradient of an appropriate beta-lactam antibiotic, this figure increased to 49%. Of the staphylococci, 5-6% of the strains were tolerant before induction and 16-20% after induction. Of the Enterococcus strains (n = 40), 12.5% showed high-level resistance to one or more aminoglycoside.
TI  - [Clinical features of enterococcal septicemia and antimicrobial susceptibilities  for clinical isolates of enterococci in Nagoya University Hospital].
AB  - Enterococci are important causative organisms of nosocomial infections as well as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Enterococcal bacteremia has been increased in Nagoya University Hospital from April 1983 to March 1990. We analyzed the clinical backgrounds, portal of entry and mortality for the patients with Enterococcal septicemia. Thirty-four cases with enterococcal septicemia (24 Enterococcus faecalis, 10 Enterococcus faecium) were subjected in this study. Twenty-seven cases were monomicrobial septicemia and 7 cases were polymicrobial septicemia. As to the portal of entry, intra-abdominal infections in 21 cases, urinary tract infections in 4 cases, respiratory tract infections or chest tubes in 2 cases, decbitus infection in 1 case, intravascular catheter in 1 case, and unknown sources in 5 cases. Total mortality of the septicemia was 44.1%. E. faecium and Enterococcus avium were much more resistant to antimicrobial agents than E. faecalis. Enterococci with high-level resistance to gentamicin (minimal inhibitory concentration, greater than 2000 micrograms/ml) accounted for 35% of the 26 clinical isolates of enterococci.
TI  - [The characteristics of Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan in the spectrum of the reactivity of human lymphocytes to bacterial peptidoglycans].
AB  - The sensitivity of lymphocytes of healthy persons to S. aureus peptidoglycan as compared with that to the polyclonal stimulator zymosan C3b and peptidoglycans of other bacteria (Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Bacterium bifidum) was analyzed with a test system permitting the determination of specific reactivity to peptidoglycans. The analysis showed that at the peak of luminol-dependent chemiluminescence (25-30 minutes) individual reactivity to S. aureus peptidoglycan varied within wide limits (the coefficient of lymphocyte stimulation was 1.4-9.6, 3.5 +/- 0.6), exceeding sensitivity to other bacteria, as well as the values obtained in the negative control. The conclusion of the wide spread of sensitization to S. aureus peptidoglycan and the possibility of using this preparation for the study of cell-mediated immunity reactions was made.
TI  - Bacteriological nasal flora in newborns indicating health and/or development of infection.
AB  - During delivery, a fetus otherwise sterile during the intrauterine life, comes in contact with bacterial flora of the mother's birth canal, and then also with the ward personnel's skin and respiratory system flora. Due to the absence of competitive bacteriological flora, the nasal cavity is gradually colonized by microorganisms, especially those with a capacity of adhesion to epithelial cells of respiratory nasal mucosa. Bacteriological flora of the newborn's nasal flora was observed on days 1 and 3 postpartum, in an attempt to determine whether a finding of pathogenic bacterial flora in newborn's nasal mucosa indicates a localized infection only or points to the possible development of generalized infection. Bacteriological nasal flora was monitored in infants born by spontaneous delivery and in those born by cesarean section. In mothers of infants born by spontaneous delivery, bacteriological flora from the cervix uteri was investigated. Results of the study performed by usual methods revealed Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus to prevail in the pathogenic flora. Gram-negative microorganisms were found to be good indicators of local infection of newborn's nasal mucosa, regardless of the absence of clinical symptoms.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide base sequence analysis of a spectinomycin adenyltransferase AAD(9) determinant from Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis LDR55, a human clinical isolate, is resistant to tetracycline (Tcr), erythromycin (Emr), and high levels (greater than 2,000 micrograms/ml) of spectinomycin (Spr) but not streptomycin. Filter matings between strain LDR55 and E. faecalis OG1-RF produced transconjugants with the following resistance phenotypes: Tcr Emr Spr, Tcr Emr, Tcr Spr, and Tcr only but never Emr or Spr only. The genetic determinant encoding resistance to spectinomycin was cloned in Streptococcus sanguis Challis from pDL55, a 26-kb plasmid harbored by a Tcr Spr transconjugant. Subcloning experiments yielded a 1.1-kb ClaI-NdeI fragment that encoded very high-level Spr in S. sanguis (10 mg/ml) and Escherichia coli (50 mg/ml). Cell extracts of cultures obtained from Spr strains expressed adenylating activity for spectinomycin but not for streptomycin, indicating that Spr was due to an AAD(9) activity. The nucleotide base sequence of the 1.1-kb ClaI-NdeI fragment contained a single 750-base open reading frame. The protein predicted from the open reading frame consisted of 250 amino acids and had a calculated size of approximately 28,000 daltons, similar to the size estimated from maxicell analysis (29,000 daltons). The deduced amino acid sequence of the streptococcal AAD(9) was compared with that of the AAD(9) encoded by staphylococcal transposon Tn554. The two proteins shared approximately 39% amino acid identity, which was expanded to 53% when conservative amino acid changes were included. When the streptococcal protein was compared with an AAD(3")(9) protein of E. coli, the degrees of identity were 27 and 47%, on the basis of actual amino acids and conservative replacements, respectively. The cloning and nucleotide base sequence analyses of the spectinomycin AAD(9) determinant from E. faecalis that results in high-level Spr when transferred to S. sanguis or E. coli are presented.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of daptomycin and vancomycin on Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus demonstrated by studies of initial killing and postantibiotic effect and influence of Ca2+ and albumin on these drugs.
AB  - The pharmacodynamics of daptomycin and vancomycin on Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 were investigated by studying the postantibiotic effect (PAE) and initial killing. The influence of Ca2+ and albumin on these drugs was also evaluated. The PAE was studied by use of bioluminescence assay of bacterial ATP. Daptomycin at clinically achievable concentrations produced a dose-dependent PAE on E. faecalis (0.6 to 6.7 h) and S. aureus (1.0 to 6.3 h). The long PAE of daptomycin was seen simultaneously with a potent dose-dependent initial killing assayed by viable count determination. The initial change in bacterial ATP was not as extensive as the decrease in viability. Vancomycin at corresponding concentrations produced shorter PAEs on E. faecalis (0.5 to 1.0 h) and S. aureus (1.3 to 1.8 h). This coincides with a weak non-dose-dependent initial change in viability and intracellular ATP. The MICs of vancomycin were not influenced by different Ca2+ concentrations or by the addition of albumin to the broth. The MICs of daptomycin for both strains were lowered, and the PAEs were prolonged with increasing concentrations of Ca2+ in the broth. The PAE of daptomycin was Ca2+ dependent to the same extent as the MIC was. In the presence of physiological concentrations of albumin and free Ca2+, the PAEs of daptomycin on both strains were reduced and the MICs were increased in comparison with the results obtained in pure Mueller-Hinton broth with approximately the same free Ca2+ concentration. This decrease in daptomycin activity was considered to be due to the albumin binding of daptomycin. Despite the albumin binding of daptomycin, the PAE produced on E. faecalis and S. aureus in the presence of a physiological free Ca2+ concentration was still over 6 h at clinically achievable concentrations.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of ME1207, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - ME1207 is the prodrug of ME1206. Its in vitro antibacterial activity was compared with that of cefteram, cefpodoxime, cefixime, and cefaclor against various clinical isolates. ME1206 was more active than the other cephems tested against staphylococci, streptococci, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Flavobacterium meningosepticum and had the most potent activity against Haemophilus influenzae and Neiserria gonorrhoeae. The drug also showed a wide spectrum of activity against other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, except methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Alcaligenes xylosoxydans.
TI  - Bacteriology of the anal wound after open hemorrhoidectomy. Qualitative and quantitative analysis.
AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the size of the bacterial colonies in anal wounds after open hemorrhoidectomy. Twenty patients were studied during predetermined postoperative time periods. Material was collected from the surface and from within the tissue of each patient's three open wounds, intraoperatively, on the 6th, 13th and 20th postoperative days for bacteriologic examination in aerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic media. The bacterium most commonly identified was Escherichia coli, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Proteus mirabilis were also identified. Critical indexes of colonization were present since the intraoperative stage (greater than 10(5) bacteria/g of tissue and greater than 10(6) bacteria/ml); obligate anaerobic bacteria were not identified; neither the species nor the number of bacteria, even when critical indexes were present, prevented proper healing. The same bacteria were not necessarily present on the surface and in the tissue; the bacterial load observed among the three wounds (left lateral, right posterior, and right anterior), was the same.
TI  - In vitro activity of the novel cephalosporin GR69153.
AB  - The in vitro activity of GR69153 was compared to that of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem and gentamicin against a total of 702 recent clinical isolates. MICs were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(8) cfu) were used throughout. GR69153 inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Proteus mirabilis at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and 90% of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at less than or equal to 1 mg/l. Citrobacter freundii (MIC90 16 mg/l), Morganella morganii (MIC90 128 mg/l) and Enterobacter spp. (MIC90 greater than 128 mg/l) were considerably more resistant to GR69153. GR69153 was four-fold more active than ceftazidime against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus but was inactive against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacteroides fragilis group.
TI  - The fluoroquinolones exert a reduced rate of kill against Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The bactericidal activities of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and DR-3355 have been investigated against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis over 24 h. The three fluoroquinolones were found to be rapidly bactericidal against the staphylococci, killing over 99% of the bacteria during the first 3 h of exposure with a further reduction in viability of approximately one logarithm occurring over the next 21 h. In contrast, the fluoroquinolones displayed a much slower rate of kill against E. faecalis, as little or no bactericidal activity was detected over the first 3 h for both E. faecalis ATCC19433 and a clinical isolate. At 6 h all three of the drugs were bactericidal against the enterococci although the amount of kill was not as great as against the staphylococci. However, at 24 h the amount of kill obtained with all three drugs was similar to that obtained for staphylococci exposed to these drugs. Ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and DR-3355 were not active against E. faecalis ATCC19433 in phosphate buffered saline and therefore require cell division for their bactericidal activity against this species.
TI  - Shuttle vectors containing a multiple cloning site and a lacZ alpha gene for conjugal transfer of DNA from Escherichia coli to gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The mobilizable shuttle cloning vectors, pAT18 and pAT19, are composed of: (i) the replication origins of pUC and of the broad-host-range enterococcal plasmid pAM beta 1; (ii) an erythromycin-resistance-encoding gene expressed in Gram- and Gram+ bacteria; (iii) the transfer origin of the IncP plasmid RK2; and (iv) the multiple cloning site and the lacZ alpha reporter gene of pUC18 (pAT18) and pUC19 (pAT19). These 6.6-kb plasmids contain ten unique cloning sites that allow screening of derivatives containing DNA inserts by alpha-complementation in Escherichia coli carrying the lacZ delta M15 deletion, and can be efficiently mobilized by self-transferable IncP plasmids co-resident in the E. coli donors. Plasmids pAT18, pAT19 and recombinant derivatives have been successfully transferred by conjugation from E. coli to Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, and Staphylococcus aureus at frequencies ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-9). The presence of a restriction system in the recipient dramatically affects (by three orders of magnitude) the efficiency of conjugal transfer of these vectors from E. coli to Gram+ bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of the gentamicin resistance transposon Tn5281 from Enterococcus faecalis and comparison to staphylococcal transposons Tn4001 and Tn4031.
AB  - In Enterococcus faecalis, the genetic determinant encoding gentamicin resistance  (Gmr) on the conjugative plasmid pBEM10 previously has been shown to be on a mobile element. In the current study, this element, termed Tn5281, was shown to relocate in the absence of homologous recombination in E. faecalis UV202. On the basis of restriction endonuclease analysis and DNA-DNA hybridization studies, Tn5281 was shown to be similar, if not identical, to the Gmr transposons Tn4001 found in Australian isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Tn4031 found in U.S. isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, since all three of these transposons have symmetrically located HindIII (2.5 kb apart), ClaI (slightly more than 2.5 kb apart), and HaeIII (3.9 kb apart) sites. Restriction endonuclease digestion patterns of Tn5281 generated with HincII, ScaI, and AluI were also consistent with Tn4001 and Tn4031. By using a probe specific for the external portion of the terminal inverted repeat of Tn4031, it was determined that each terminus of Tn5281 contained a 0.35-kb HaeIII fragment and a 0.7-kb HindIII-HaeIII fragment. The sizes of these fragments are identical to those found in the staphylococcal transposons, which is a further indication that inverted repeats like IS256 are present in Tn5281. A 1-kb HaeIII fragment in pBEM10 also hybridized with this probe, which indicates that Tn5281 in pBEM10 contains a double copy of the inverted repeat at one end.
TI  - Susceptibility of female pelvic pathogens to oral antibiotic agents in patients who develop postpartum endometritis.
AB  - Fifteen hundred patients were enrolled in a prospective, randomized study on the  effect of antibiotic prophylaxis during cesarean section. Two hundred thirty-one patients developed postpartum endometritis, and the isolates obtained from the endometrium were tested for sensitivity to ampicillin, cefuroxime, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and clindamycin. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of 50% and 90% of ampicillin, cefuroxime, and clindamycin were similar to previously reported values; however, slight differences were noted in the activity of the two quinolones to common pelvic isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 90% of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin to 119 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis were 4.0 and 2.0, to 17 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus 1.0 and 0.5, to 39 isolates of Escherichia coli 0.5 and 1.0, to 46 isolates of Bacteroides bivius 4.0 and 8.0, to 57 isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis 1.0 and 2.0, to 71 isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis 0.5 and 0.5, to 16 isolates of Proteus mirabilis 0.25 and 0.12, and to 50 isolates of Lactobacillus species 32.0 and 8.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. In summary, the quinolones have activity comparable with a variety of other oral agents versus female pelvic pathogens, with the quinolones ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin having better activity against most of the gram-negative isolates. Anaerobic activities were comparable with the beta-lactams, but inferior to clindamycin and metronidazole as expected.
TI  - In vitro activities of sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and fleroxacin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of sparfloxacin was compared with those of tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and fleroxacin against 730 bacterial isolates representing 49 different species. Sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin had similar spectra of activity, but sparfloxacin was less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and more active against many gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria. Tosufloxacin MICs were generally 8- to 16-fold lower than those for sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. All four fluoroquinolones were active against nalidixic acid-susceptible strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae (MIC for 90% of the isolates [MIC90], less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml) but nalidixic acid-resistant strains were less susceptible (MIC90, greater than or equal to 4.0 micrograms/ml). Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, MIC90s were 1.0 micrograms/ml for tosufloxacin, 2.0 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin, and 4.0 micrograms/ml for sparfloxacin. Against Enterococcus faecalis, sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin MIC90s were 1.0 and 2.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. MIC90s for ciprofloxacin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus were 0.016 micrograms/ml for tosufloxacin, 0.06 micrograms/ml for sparfloxacin, and 0.5 micrograms/ml for both ciprofloxacin and fleroxacin. With four species of gram-negative bacilli, mutants resistant to two to four times the sparfloxacin MIC occurred spontaneously at frequencies of 10(-7) to 10(-9): single-step high-level resistance was not observed. In vitro-selected sparfloxacin-resistant mutants displayed cross-resistance to other quinolones, as did clinical isolates of ciprofloxacin-resistant S. aureus. Tosufloxacin MICs with broth microdilution methods were four- to eightfold greater than those obtained with agar dilution methods. The two procedures gave comparable results when sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin was being tested.
TI  - Penetration into tissues of various drugs active against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Gram-positive bacteria are the most important pathogens causing hospital- and community-acquired infections. We therefore reviewed the penetration of various antibiotics active against Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus into tissues, where staphylococcal infections are common. Rifampicin reaches heart valve concentrations of 65% of the simultaneous serum levels. At 8 h after administration blood and tissues concentrations of rifampicin exceeded the MIC90 values for S. aureus as well as for S. epidermidis. After a 2-g intravenous bolus injection of flucloxacillin heart valve concentrations exceeded MIC values for staphylococci for more than 8 h whereas subcutaneous and muscle concentrations declined within the same time to undetectable levels. The MIC90 values of vancomycin for S. epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis are 2.0 and 4.0 mg/l respectively and for S. aureus 1.0 mg/l. This concentration is reached in subcutaneous tissue, heart valves and muscle for at least 4-6 h after administration of 15 mg/kg, however the corresponding value for Enterococcus faecalis in heart valve is maintained only for 3-4 h. After two and three dose regimens of teicoplanin serum and bone levels were significantly higher than fat levels, exceeding the MIC90 values for S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. faecalis. The ratio of tissue concentration of teicoplanin to serum concentrations was 11% for fat and 65% for bone.
TI  - Teicoplanin monotherapy of serious infections caused by gram-positive bacteria: a re-evaluation of patients with endocarditis or Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia from a European open trial.
AB  - We have examined case records for patients who received teicoplanin alone for endocarditis or Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia. All patients with streptococcal endocarditis were cured (viridans group 14/14; Group D 4/4). Cure rates for other organisms were: Enterococcus faecalis 3/5; S. aureus 5/10 and coagulase negative staphylococci 2/3. Doses for six patients who failed because of poor response were 3.3-4.2 mg/kg. Teicoplanin treatment cured 41/48 patients with S. aureus bacteraemia; treatment failed in two patients because of adverse events. Doses in the remaining treatment failures were 2.1-5.0 mg/kg. In comparison, 48 patients in Dundee hospitals received ten different drugs in 20 combinations for S. aureus bacteraemia; 29 patients received cloxacillin or flucloxacillin but initial doses varied from 0.25-2.0 g. We conclude that the European database does provide evidence that teicoplanin monotherapy is effective for serious infection with Gram-positive bacteria. Doses for staphylococcal infection should probably be at least 6 mg/kg. The upper limit of the teicoplanin dosage range remains to be determined but there is evidently considerable confusion about appropriate regimens for 'standard' therapy.
TI  - [Therapeutic efficacy of imipenem/cilastatin sodium on respiratory tract infections in lung cancer patients].
AB  - Imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) was used to treat respiratory tract infections (RTI) in 54 patients with lung cancer. Out of the 54 patients studied, 53 were evaluable for the utility of IPM/CS; 42 had pneumonia, 9 had obstructive pneumonia, 1 had a lung abscess and 1 had acute bronchitis. The efficacy rate was 71.7%. Seventeen causative organisms were isolated from 14 patients. They included Staphylococcus aureus 5 strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis 4 strains, Staphylococcus sp. 2 strains, Enterococcus faecalis 1 strain, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 strains, Pseudomonas fluorescens 2 strains, Acinetobacter sp. 1 strain, and the eradication rate was 81.8%. Clinical adverse effects (nausea and vomiting) were observed in 1 patient. Abnormalities in laboratory test results were observed in 3 patients. They disappeared or returned to normal values after completion of therapy or discontinuation of IPM/CS administration. IPM/CS appears to be a useful antibiotic for RTI in patients with lung cancer.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of E-4497, a new 3-amine-3-methyl-azetidinyl tricyclic fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new tricyclic fluoroquinolone, E-4497 [S(-)-9-fluoro-3-methyl-10-(3-amine-3-methyl-azetidin-1-yl)-7-oxo- 2,3-dihydro- 7H-pyrido-(1,2,3-de)-1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid], were evaluated in comparison with those of DR-3355 [S-(-)-ofloxacin], norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. E-4497 was more potent than norfloxacin and as potent as or more potent than DR-3355 and ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., and Enterococcus faecalis. With the exception of Providencia spp., E-4497 inhibited 90% of the Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. Against enteric bacteria, E-4497 was similar in potency to norfloxacin but less potent than DR-3355 and ciprofloxacin. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MICs of E-4497, DR-3355, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin for 90% of strains were 2, 2, 4, and 0.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis, E-4497 (MICs for 90% of strains, 2 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively) was two- to fourfold more active than norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. E-4497 activity decreased moderately in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+. Urine at pH 5.5 caused a significant decrease in activity compared with urine at pH 7.2. However, the presence of serum either had no effect or increased the activity of E-4497. In general, E-4497 was bactericidal at the MIC. In systemic infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice, the protective effect of E-4497 was generally greater than that of norfloxacin and comparable to those of DR-3355 and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - In vitro activity of RP 59500, a semisynthetic injectable pristinamycin, against  staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci.
AB  - The in vitro activity of RP 59500, a semisynthetic pristinamycin, was compared with the activities of vancomycin, oxacillin, ampicillin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and rifampin against five Staphylococcus species, five Streptococcus species, and four Enterococcus species. For staphylococci, MICs were 0.13 to 1 microgram/ml and the MICs for 90% of the strains tested (MIC90s) were 0.13 to 0.5 microgram/ml; there were no differences between oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant strains. For streptococci, MICs were 0.03 to 4 micrograms/ml and MIC90s were 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml; viridans group streptococci were the least susceptible streptococci. For enterococci, MICs were 0.25 to 32 micrograms/ml and MIC90s were 2 to 4 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecalis was the least susceptible. Vancomycin was the only comparative drug with consistent activity against all species of gram-positive cocci. With RP 59500, raising the inoculum 100-fold, lowering the pH of cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth to 5.5, or omitting cation supplementation had little effect on MICs, but 50% serum increased MICs 2 to 4 dilution steps. The differences between MBCs and MICs were greater for staphylococci and enterococci than for streptococci. Time-kill studies with 24 strains indicated that RP 59500 concentrations 2-, 4-, and 16-fold greater than the MICs usually killed bacteria of each species at similar rates; reductions in CFU per milliliter were less than those observed with oxacillin or vancomycin against staphylococci and less than those observed with ampicillin against enterococci. RP 59500 antagonized the bactericidal activities of oxacillin and gentamicin against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and that of ampicillin against E. faecalis ATCC 29212. Against the latter, combination with gentamicin was indifferent. RP 59500 has a broad spectrum of in vitro activity against gram-positive cocci; combining it with other drugs is not advantageous.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (CPFX), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of CPFX against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. The clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. Interpreting MIC level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. When activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, CPFX expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (OFLX) and norfloxacin (NFLX) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of CPFX against Bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of OFLX, and CPFX had similar activity against Staphylococcus aureus to OFLX. 2. In comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, CPFX was inferior to amoxicillin (AMPC) against E. faecalis and inferior to AMPC and cefaclor (CCL) against Peptostreptococcus spp. Against all other bacterial species, however, CPFX expressed superior antibacterial potency to AMPC and CCL. 3. Scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to CPFX were observed among the S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. faecium, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of E. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.
TI  - Effect of hydrogen peroxide on growth of Candida, Cryptococcus, and other yeasts  in simulated blood culture bottles.
AB  - The addition of hydrogen peroxide to blood contained in liquid culture medium increased the dissolved-O2 partial pressure in direct proportion to the volume injected. The effect of hydrogen peroxide on the growth of subcultured clinical isolates of Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Torulopsis glabrata, and other yeasts and on the growth of blood culture isolates of representative pathogenic bacteria was compared with its effect on their growth in vented and unvented stationary bottles. C. albicans and C. neoformans grew significantly better in bottles to which hydrogen peroxide had been added than in vented or unvented bottles. The advantage of hydrogen peroxide over venting was most marked with several slowly growing strains. Similar results were obtained in shaker cultures with strains of C. albicans which were inoculated directly from positive blood cultures. The effect of hydrogen peroxide tended to diminish during serial passage. T. glabrata grew less well when hydrogen peroxide was added, perhaps because of the absence of oxidase. The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis was not significantly inhibited or augmented by the addition of hydrogen peroxide. The growth of Escherichia coli was inhibited slightly. The value of the addition of hydrogen peroxide to blood cultures to improve the isolation of yeasts needs to be established by a clinical trial which would compare this method with established methods.
TI  - Comparison of silver sulfadiazine 1% with chlorhexidine digluconate 0.2% to silver sulfadiazine 1% alone in the prophylactic topical antibacterial treatment of burns.
AB  - Wound bacterial colonization in 118 patients treated with chlorhexidine digluconate 0.2% in silver sulfadiazine 1% applied daily to the burn wounds was compared to that of 135 comparable patients similarly treated with silver sulfadiazine 1%. With chlorhexidine digluconate 0.2% in silver sulfadiazine 1%, colonization by Staphylococcus aureus was less frequent (38%) than with silver sulfadiazine (54%, p = 0.016). No statistical difference was found for colonization by Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Enterobacter cloacae. Washing of the wounds of 65 patients with chlorhexidine gluconate 4% during daily dressing changes was associated with reduced wound colonization by S. aureus (35% versus 51%, p = 0.03) and P. aeruginosa (8% versus 16%, p = 0.08) when compared to the 188 washed with nonantibacterial soap. Chlorhexidine, whether added to the topical agent silver sulfadiazine (chlorhexidine digluconate 0.2%) or in the bath soap (chlorhexidine gluconate 4%), decreased colonization by S. aureus.
TI  - Endophthalmitis from contaminated donor corneas following penetrating keratoplasty.
AB  - We encountered six (0.2%) cases of endophthalmitis resulting from contaminated donor corneas between January 1983 and July 1990 following a total of 3000 consecutive penetrating keratoplasties. Causative organisms in the three cases of fungal endophthalmitis were Torulopsis glabrata, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus flavus; the three cases of bacterial endophthalmitis were due to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. All organisms were resistant to gentamicin in the preservation media. A significantly higher incidence of endophthalmitis was noted in patients receiving corneas from a Sri Lankan eye bank (1.25%) than in those receiving US eye bank tissue (0.14%). Donor rim cultures are important to identify those patients at increased risk of developing endophthalmitis, enabling earlier diagnosis and more specific treatment should endophthalmitis occur.
TI  - Inactivation of metronidazole by Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The in-vitro inactivation of metronidazole by different clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis was investigated by means of association experiments in which Ent. faecalis strains and Bacteroides fragilis group strains were cultured in the same liquid medium. All of the tested Ent. faecalis strains (20 isolates) were able to protect the B. fragilis group strains against the killing effect of metronidazole at a concentration four or eight times higher than the normal MIC. Different strains of Streptococcus (14), Staphylococcus aureus (10), Staph, epidermidis (10) and Escherichia coli (8) failed to exhibit the same effect. When Ent. faecalis strains were cultured anaerobically for 24 h in the presence of 4 mg metronidazole/l, either alone or together with different B. fragilis group strains, no metronidazole could be detected subsequently in the culture supernatants by HPLC. Concomitantly an increase of four or five logs in the viable counts of the co-cultured Bacteroides strains was observed compared with Bacteroides strains cultured alone. Sonicated cell extracts of Ent. faecalis cultured either aerobically or anaerobically were found to inactivate metronidazole to the same extent, whereas the culture supernatants had no such effect.
TI  - Fleroxacin combined with rifampin.
AB  - We determined the effect of the combination of rifampin and fleroxacin against Enterobacteriaceae and streptococcal species. None of the 65 isolates tested by checkerboard assay demonstrated synergy, 12% of isolates showed an additive effect; 86.7% were indifferent, and only 1 isolate showed antagonism. The mean FIC was 1.2. When using 2 and 8 micrograms/ml of rifampin, fleroxacin MICs of 285 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, staphylococci, streptococci, Bacteroides, and Clostridium were not increased, but synergy was not demonstrated. Time-kill studies against Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis failed to show increased killing when the two agents were present at one-half the MBC. The fleroxacin-rifampin interaction is one of indifference but provides coverage for species not adequately inhibited by fleroxacin.
TI  - [Evaluation of the effectiveness of ofloxacin in the treatment of respiratory tract].
AB  - Ofloxacine (Tarivid-Hoechst) was used in 30 patients with infections of the respiratory system, including 12 with pneumonias, 18 with chronic bronchitis. The agent was given in oral form, in a 200 mg tablet every 12 hours for 7 to 10 days. Therapeutical and tolerance was analyzed being on clinical radiological, biochemical and bacteriological findings. Complete remission was found in 21 patients, in 7 more a significant clinical and radiological improvement was found. Altogether in 93.3% of the treated patients the therapeutical efficacy of the agent was found to be excellent. During treatment side effects were not observed. The results if this study demonstrate a high therapeutical efficacy and safety of the agent.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin administered intravenously in a pharmacodynamic in vitro model.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was evaluated in an in vitro model by simulating its pharmacokinetics following a single 100 or 200 mg administration intravenously. The one compartment open model described by Grasso and coworkers was used for these experiments. Ciprofloxacin concentrations in the model were reproduced by calculations based on the concentration-time curve in human volunteers as reported by Wise and others. The maximum reduction of viable cell count for Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus was from two-to three-orders of magnitude; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae from four to seven orders. A rapid killing was recorded both for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, but the initial killing was more prolonged and more pronounced for the higher dosage. The last did not interfere with regrowth that occurred for all strains after eight hours.
TI  - In vitro activity of flomoxef and cefazolin in combination with vancomycin.
AB  - 207 clinical isolates from strains of patients from the University Children's Hospital of Kiel were investigated for their in vitro activity with the agar dilution method against flomoxef and cefazolin (alone and partially in combination with vancomycin). Staphylococci were also tested with other cephalosporins (cefoxitin, cefamandole, cefotaxime, cefotetan and latamoxef). Flomoxef and cefazolin always acted more vigorously on staphylococci than the other cephalosporins. Resistance of Staphylococcus aureus strains against flomoxef and cefazolin did not occur but was found in 15 and 5 of 98 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, respectively. Enterococcus faecalis strains were always resistant against both drugs; Streptococcus faecium strains were only moderately sensitive. Combined testing of flomoxef or cefazolin with vancomycin showed synergism in almost all staphylococcal strains. Synergism was stronger when S. epidermidis strains were only weakly sensitive to or resistant against flomoxef and cefazolin in comparison to highly sensitive strains. Flomoxef (or cefazolin) acted synergistically in combination with vancomycin on E. faecalis and S. faecium with the exception of two strains of E. faecalis which showed an additive effect of both drugs.
TI  - Interpretive criteria of antimicrobial disk susceptibility tests with flomoxef.
AB  - 320 recently isolated pathogens, 20 strains from each of 16 species, were investigated using Mueller-Hinton agar and DIN as well as NCCLS standards. The geometric mean of the agar dilution MICs of flomoxef were 0.44 mg/l for Staphylococcus aureus, 0.05 mg/l (Klebsiella oxytoca) to 12.6 mg/l (Enterobacter spp.) for enterobacteriaceae, 33.1 mg/l for Acinetobacter anitratus, 64 mg/l for Enterococcus faecalis, and more than 256 mg/l for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For disk susceptibility testing of flomoxef a 30 micrograms disk loading and the following interpretation of inhibition zones using the DIN method were recommended: resistant-up to 22 mm (corresponding to MICs of 8 mg/l or more), moderately susceptible-23 to 29 mm (corresponding to MICs from 1 to 4 mg/l), and susceptible-30 mm or more (corresponding to MICs of 0.5 mg/l or less). The respective values for the NCCLS method using the American high MIC breakpoints are: resistant--up to 14 mm (corresponding to MICs of 32 mg/l or more), moderately susceptible--15 to 17 mm (corresponding to MICs of 16 mg/l), and susceptible--18 mm or more (corresponding to MICs of 8 mg/l or less).
TI  - [Kinetics of bacterial wash-out in the Haemonetics Cell Saver III].
AB  - Autologous, outdated blood units were inoculated with four types of bacteria--Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus--in two concentrations (10e4, 10e6) to test the effect of the washing procedure (Cell Saver III Haemonetics) on the elimination of bacteria. The elimination rate ranged from 17% (Streptococcus faec. 10e4) to 96% (Pseudomonas aer. 10e6). These results confirm the routine use of wash centrifuge systems (type Cell Saver) to process shed wound blood as well as drainage blood for autologous transfusions.
TI  - In vitro activity of sparfloxacin and six reference antibiotics against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of sparfloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was assessed against 234 gram-positive bacterial isolates by agar dilution (10(4) CFU/spot). Sparfloxacin activity was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and five other antibiotics. Sparfloxacin was the most active drug tested against methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC90, 0.125-0.25 mg/l). Sparfloxacin was also the most active drug tested against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 1 mg/l) and showed equal activity against gentamicin-susceptible and gentamicin-resistant (MIC greater than 2,000 mg/l) enterococci. Sparfloxacin was the most active quinolone tested against Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes (MIC90, 1 mg/l). Most Corynebacterium jeikeium showed exquisite susceptibility to sparfloxacin (MIC, 0.06-0.25 mg/l). For MRSA, time-kill curves showed sparfloxacin to be rapidly bactericidal at the MIC of the organism. Sparfloxacin showed greater and more sustained bactericidal activity than ciprofloxacin and vancomycin at 1x and 2x the MIC. Reduction in the activity of sparfloxacin occurred with decreased agar pH (from 7.0 to 6.0) and increased bacterial inoculum. Sparfloxacin showed superior activity compared to reference drugs against most gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Comparative in vitro and in vivo activities of six new monofluoroquinolone and difluoroquinolone 3-carboxylic acids with a 7-azetidin ring substituent.
AB  - E-4502, E-4501, E-4500, E-4480, E-4474, and E-4441 are new monofluorinated or difluorinated quinolone agents that are chemically characterized by the presence of an azetidin ring, with different C'-3 substituents, at position 7 of the molecular structure. The MICs of the difluorinated compounds E-4501, E-4474, and E-4441 for 90% of isolates were 0.06 to 1, 0.06 to 1, and 0.12 to 1 microgram/ml, respectively, against gram-positive organisms (staphylococci, streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis); 0.0015 to 0.12, 0.015 to 0.12, and 0.03 to 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively, against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae except Providencia spp.; and 1, 1, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. E-4501, E-4474, and E-4441 inhibited all anaerobic bacteria at concentrations of 1, 2, and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. Difluorinated compounds were significantly more active than the corresponding monofluorinated analogs E-4502, E-4500, and E-4480 against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms, as well as against anaerobes. Considering monofluorinated and difluorinated compounds, activity in moderate ascending order was observed in quinolones containing an amine and a methyl group (E-4441 and E-4480), an amine group (E-4474 and E-4500), and a methylamine group (E-4501 and E-4502) in the C'-3 position of the azetidin ring. E-4501, E-4474, and E-4441 were more active than norfloxacin and DR-3355 [S-(-)-ofloxacin], had activities comparable to or slightly lower than that of ciprofloxacin against gram-negative bacteria, and were more active than all the reference quinolones against gram-positive organisms and anaerobes. E-4502 and E-4501, which were used to determine the effect of pH, were less active in acidic medium. In general, E-4502, E-4501, E-4500, E-4480, E-4474, and E-4441 activities were not affected or increased in medium containing serum but decreased in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+ or in human urine at pH 5.5. The protective effect of E-4501, E-4474, and E-4441 after oral administration against systemic infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice was greater than that of ciprofloxacin.
TI  - [Survey on clinical isolates from 13 hospitals in Akita Prefecture--changes in frequency and susceptibility of isolates by scale of hospital. Survey Group for Clinical Isolates, Chemotherapy Research Committee of Akita Prefecture].
AB  - Isolates from various clinical materials in 13 hospitals in Akita prefecture and  their drug susceptibility were investigated by the Chemotherapy Research Committee of Akita Prefecture during the period from Dec., 1987 to Feb., 1988. The results were as follows: 1. The total number of isolates was 8,387, including Staphylococcus aureus (18.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.9%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.3%) and Enterococcus faecalis (6.6%). S, aureus and P. aeruginosa were detected more frequently in the larger hospitals. 2. The detection frequency of S. aureus from the sputum, throat swab and pus exudate was also very high. There was a diversity in isolates from the urine and the frequency of Escherichia coli was low. More than half of the isolates from the blood were S. epidermidis and S. aureus. Many kinds of bacteria were detected from pleural fluid and ascites, but the isolate showed no particular tendency. 3. The susceptibility of S. aureus to oxacillin were variable in hospitals, and the susceptibility to cefazolin were even lower. Low susceptibility were also seen with norfloxacin. S. aureus showed the highest susceptibility to minocycline. The susceptibility was lower for inpatients than for outpatients. P. aeruginosa showed low susceptibility to cefsulodin. The number of ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae isolates tended to decrease. Enterobacter cloacae showed a low susceptibility for cephems. Serratia marcescens showed low susceptibility to many drugs. Based on the above results, we concluded that attention should be paid to S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and Enterobacter in clinical practice.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinically isolated bacterial strains to imipenem/cilastatin sodium].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of imipenem/cilastatin sodium (imipenem) and other beta-lactams against clinically isolated 353 bacterial strains were investigated. The results obtained in this study are summarized as follows: 1. Imipenem (IPM) showed potent antibacterial activities against Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae. 2. IPM had inferior or equivalent antibacterial activities to beta-lactams against clinically isolated Enterobacteriaceae, that is, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus spp. 3. IPM showed potent antibacterial activities against clinically isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratus but not against Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Intravenous ofloxacin in severe infections.
AB  - The efficacy and tolerance of intravenous ofloxacin was studied in 70 patients suffering from soft tissue infections (n = 33), intra-abdominal abscesses (n = 14), septicaemia (n = 12), pneumonia (n = 9) and brucellosis (n = 2). The average daily dose was 6 mg/kg divided into two doses. Pathogens treated included Enterobacter cloacae (n = 14), Escherichia coli (n = 12), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 13), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 11), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 10), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 8) and Streptococcus spp. (n = 5). Most patients had several underlying diseases. Most of the patients had received other antibiotic therapy without success. Clinically, 41% were considered cured, 19% improved and 30% failed to respond. Bacteriologically, pathogens were eradicated in 52.5% and persisted in 22.5%. Adverse reactions included an anaphylactoid reaction, abnormal liver function (n = 13) and insomnia (n = 2). This study suggests that higher doses of ofloxacin may be needed in deep seated infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY264826, a new glycopeptide antibiotic, against gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients with cancer.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LY264826, a novel glycopeptide antibiotic produced by Amycolatopsis orientalis, was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and oxacillin against 311 gram-positive clinical isolates from patients with cancer, LY264826 had lower MICs for 90% of isolates (MIC90) than vancomycin for all species tested. It was active against oxacillin-resistant isolates including Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (MIC90, 2.0 micrograms/ml), Enterococcus spp. (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), Bacillus cereus (MIC90, 0.25 micrograms/ml), and Corynebacterium jeikeium (MIC90, 0.12 micrograms/ml). For S. aureus, including oxacillin-resistant isolates, the MICs of LY264826 were similar to those of teicoplanin. For coagulase-negative staphylococci, however, LY264826 had MICs that were 4- to 32-fold lower than those of teicoplanin. Against most streptococcal species the activities of LY264826 and teicoplanin were similar. Bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus spp. and most Streptococcus pyogenes isolates was less than or equal to 1 dilution of the MIC. One isolate of S. pyogenes and all Enterococcus faecalis strains tested were tolerant of LY264826, with MBCs greater than or equal to 32-fold greater than the MICs. The addition of 50% human serum resulted in a significant increase in activity only against Staphylococcus epidermidis. Variations in pH from 6.4 to 8.4 and in inoculum from 10(3) to 10(7) CFU/ml did not significantly affect the activity of LY264826.
TI  - An investigation of indirect conductimetry for detection of some food-borne bacteria.
AB  - Indirect conductimetry using a rapid automated bacterial impedance technique was  investigated. Strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila and Salmonella spp. grown in Whitley Impedance broth all elicited indirect conductimetric changes. These indirect conductance responses were improved by the addition of 2 g/l glucose to the medium and resulted in maximum changes of 2340-4300 microS with associated maximum rates of change of 520-1210 microS/h. Furthermore, the indirect conductimetric assay detected growth of staphylococci, listeria and salmonella in media containing high concentrations of salts used as selective agents in culture media for the isolation of these organisms.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 against 229 aerobic and 330 anaerobic clinical isolates was determined using the agar dilution technique. For comparison, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefuroxime, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, co-trimoxazole, doxycycline, erythromycin and metronidazole (only anaerobic bacteria) were tested. Bay v 3522 was found to have high activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, anaerobic cocci, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens and fusobacteria. When tested against a higher inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of Bay v 3522 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to inhibitory activity in most bacterial groups. Bay v 3522 may be useful in the treatment of skin, soft tissue and respiratory tract infections. Clinical studies are thus warranted.
TI  - Effect of pefloxacin on microorganism: host cell interaction.
AB  - Recent evidence indicates that certain antibiotics affect bacterial adherence and phagocyte-micro-organism interactions. These interactions are important in the early stages of bacterial pathogenesis, that is, attachment to mucosal surfaces and invasion. Among the antibiotics of interest in this field are the fluoroquinolones. Sub-MICs of pefloxacin can alter the ability of Gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli) to adhere to different eukaryotic cells (uroepithelial and buccal cells) and to fibrin-platelet matrices. The mechanism by which pefloxacin reduces adhesion is not completely understood. However in the case of Esch. coli, the inhibition of haemagglutination and adherence corresponds to: (1) a decrease in production of fimbriae; (2) changes in the composition of outer membrane proteins; and (3) an effect on partition coefficient (carried out with the PEG/dextran system) which can be attributed to changes in electric and/or hydrophobic properties of the Esch. coli surface. The first step of phagocytosis is represented by adherence of opsonized bacteria to the membrane receptors of phagocytes. Consequently, the action of pefloxacin on phagocytosis is also of importance. Pretreatment of bacteria (Staph. aureus, Ent. faecalis, Esch. coli and Legionella pneumophila) with 1/4 the MIC of pefloxacin leads to an increase in uptake of the different strains by phagocytes (polymorphonuclear leucocytes and macrophages). Exposure of the phagocytes to 10 mg/l of pefloxacin enhances phagocytosis of strains that have not been pretreated. Finally, entry of antibiotics into phagocytic cells is a prerequisite for activity against intracellular organisms. The concentration of pefloxacin by polymorphs and macrophages is high (intracellular concentration/extracellular concentration = 5-10). Such findings correlate well with the intracellular activity of pefloxacin, demonstrated with guinea pig macrophages and different bacteria (Staph. aureus, L. pneumophila).
TI  - Growth inhibition of selected food-borne bacteria, particularly Listeria monocytogenes, by plant extracts.
AB  - Six extracts from Chinese medicinal plants: Tin Men Chu, Sey Lau Pai, Siu Mao Heung, Bak Tao Yung, Kam Chin Chiu and Liao Ya, were tested for their inhibitory effect on selected food-borne bacteria by the well assay technique. Among them, Tin Men Chu, Siu Mao Heung and Sey Lau Pai inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella paratyphi, Salm. enteritidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, and three strains of Listeria monocytogenes. Two of these three extracts, Tin Men Chu and Siu Mao Heung, suppressed the growth of L. monocytogenes Scott A in cabbage juice. This inhibition was prevented by the addition of protein but not sodium chloride. Plant extracts show potential to control the growth of food-borne bacteria.
TI  - Conjugal transfer of plasmid pWBG637 from Staphylococcus aureus to Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Plasmids pWBG636 (GmR) and pWBG642 (EmR) derived from the conjugative plasmid pWBG637 were tested for ability to transfer conjugatively to Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli. Both plasmids transferred to S. epidermidis and Strept. faecalis but not to B. subtilis and E. coli. Once in S. epidermis and Strept. faecalis they were transferred back to S. aureus. Restriction endonuclease analysis showed that the plasmids were stably maintained in S epidermidis and Strept. faecalis.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Antimicrobial actions of calcium binding leucocyte L1 protein, calprotectin.
AB  - The calcium binding L1 protein was found to inhibit growth of blood culture isolates of Candida spp and cerebrospinal fluid isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were 4-128 mg/l, and concentrations 2-4 times the MIC were fungicidal. Blood culture isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis had MIC values of 64-256 mg/l. Antibacterial activity was strongly influenced by the nature of the culture medium. In view of the biological activity of L1, the name calprotectin is proposed to describe this antimicrobial protein with calcium binding properties.
TI  - The role of Escherichia coli haemolysin in the pathogenic synergy of colonic bacteria in subcutaneous abscess formation in mice.
AB  - The growth of nine species of colonic bacteria--Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides ovatus, Fusobacterium varium, Clostridium perfringens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus and Bifidobacterium adolescentis--was examined after concomitant injection to form experimental subcutaneous abscesses in mice. Injection of a mixture of c. 10(5) cfu of each of the first five strains (E. coli, Ent. faecalis, B. ovatis, F. varium and C. perfringens) resulted in abscess formation in all mice tested when the E. coli strain was haemolytic. E. coli and B. ovatus multiplied and reached a maximum population of c. 10(8) cfu/abscess. When non-haemolytic E. coli was used, injection of greater than or equal to 10(7) cfu was required for abscess formation. The inclusion of partially purified E. coli haemolysin (125 HU50) with c. 10(5) cfu of bacteria including non-haemolytic E. coli resulted in abscess formation in most mice tested. These results indicate that E. coli haemolysin is one factor that may potentiate pathogenic synergy among colonic bacteria especially between E. coli and B. ovatus, during abscess formation.
TI  - In vitro activity of dirithromycin (LY 237216) compared with activities of other  macrolide antibiotics.
AB  - Dirithromycin inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other hemolytic streptococci at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.03 to 0.12 micrograms/ml, with 90% inhibition at 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is comparable to results using erythromycin. Group A streptococci, listeriae, and enterococci resistant to erythromycin were resistant to dirithromycin. Erythromycin-susceptible staphylococci were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, but for erythromycin-resistant isolates MICs were greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. For Haemophilus influenzae, MICs were greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, two- to fourfold greater than for erythromycin. The activity of dirithromycin against staphylococci and streptococci was not decreased by the addition of human serum.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of faeriefungin, a new broad-spectrum polyene macrolide antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro activity of faeriefungin, a new pentaene macrolide lactone antibiotic produced by Streptomyces griseus var. autotrophicus, against 263 clinical bacterial isolates was examined. In contrast to the related fungicidal antibiotics nystatin and amphotericin B, which show no activity against bacteria, faeriefungin showed bactericidal activity against all species of gram-positive bacteria examined. MICs for these species ranged from 8 to 64 micrograms/ml, and the MIC for 90% of the isolates tested was 32 micrograms/ml. Isolates of some fastidious gram-negative species, including Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae, were slightly susceptible to faeriefungin, with MICs ranging from 16 to 128 micrograms/ml, but all members of the families Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonadaceae, with the exception of Pseudomonas cepacia, were completely resistant to faeriefungin at the concentrations tested. Faeriefungin is also active against fungi, nematodes, and mosquito larvae. The mode of action of faeriefungin against both bacteria and fungi is under investigation.
TI  - Antibacterials. Synthesis and structure-activity studies of 3-aryl-2-oxooxazolidines. 2. The "A" group.
AB  - The synthesis and structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of the effect of  varying the "A" group in a series of 5-(acetamidomethyl)oxazolidonone antibacterials (2) are described. Compounds 2 were principally prepared either by the six-step synthesis described previously (J. Med. Chem. 1989, 32, 1673) or by elaboration of the synthetic intermediate 2 (A = H) via electrophilic aromatic substitution or elaboration of the intermediate 2 (A = I) by transition metal catalyzed carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions. Antibacterial evaluation of compounds 2 with A = alkyl, ethenyl, ethynyl, hydroxyalkyl, aldo and keto, oximinoakyl, carboalkoxy, nitro, amino, halo and psi-halo, alkylthio, alkylsulfinyl, and alkysulfonyl against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis led to the identification of several SAR trends. In several series of homologues (alkyl, ketyl, aximinoalkyl, amino, halo and psi-halo, and alkythio), antibacterial activity increased with increasing lipophilicity. But in series with where A is a substituent with a trior tetrasubstituted (substituent larger than H) quaternary atom attached directly to the aromatic ring (hydroxyalkyl, alkylsulfinyl, alkylsufonyl), the activity peaked at the member of the series with the "tert-butyl" connectivity pattern. Conjugated electron-withdrawing substituents also had increased activity relative to nonconjugated analogues of comparable lipophilicity.
TI  - In-vitro comparison of the post-antibiotic effect of vancomycin and teicoplanin.
AB  - The post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of teicoplanin was compared with that of vancomycin for five selected Gram-positive cocci. Two concentrations of each antibiotic were investigated, with the test organisms being exposed to each for both 1 and 2 h. At a concentration of 25 mg/l, teicoplanin had a greater PAE than vancomycin for the methicillin resistant staphylococci and Enterococcus faecalis strains tested. At a concentration of 5 mg/l, teicoplanin gave equal effects to those of vancomycin except for the strain of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) tested. The variation in the antibiotic exposure time gave only small changes in the PAE, except for the MRSA tested.
TI  - The bactericidal activity of a deuteroporphyrin-hemin mixture on gram-positive bacteria. A microbiological and spectroscopic study.
AB  - The combined antibacterial activity of various porphyrins with hemin on Gram-positive bacteria was studied. Protoporphyrin, hematoporphyrin derivative and deuteroporphyrin show only a marginal inhibitory effect in the dark. However, hemin has a strong cytotoxic effect which is independent of illumination and is equally strong in the dark. The disadvantage of hemin treatment is that it is temporary. In this study, we have demonstrated that a combination of deuteroporphyrin and hemin has a unique cytotoxic activity on Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus. The effect of the combined compound is stronger than that of the separate constituents, and is as strong in the dark as in the light. Only 0.005% of the initial S. aureus population survive after a 2 h treatment. Absorption and fluorescence spectra of hemin-deuteroporphyrin mixtures in water and liposomes suggest the formation of a species with spectroscopic properties which are different from those of the two constituents.
TI  - Nosocomial infections in general surgery: surveillance report from a German university clinic.
AB  - At the general surgery clinics, University of Giessen, we developed our own system for surveillance of nosocomial infections according to the guidelines of the Centers of Disease Control. Atlanta, USA, and according to the results of the SENIC Project. We wanted to receive information about the overall infection rate, the procedure specific infection rate, site specific infection rate, distribution of nosocomial infections by pathogen and resistance pattern of antibiotics at the general surgery clinics. The overall infection rate of operations, classified as clean, clean--contaminated, and contaminated and dirty, was 13%. The surgical wound infection rate of 3% after clean operations was mainly caused by an elevated infection rate of 13% after clean operations of a prolonged duration and hyperthermic perfusion of the extremities in patients with melanoma. There is also a difference in nosocomial infection rates at the general surgery ward (11%) and at the intensive care unit (29%). At the intensive care unit candida and coagulase negative staphylococci are mainly isolated whereas Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis dominated the general surgery ward. Different operations show different distributions of isolates; operations on the pancreas are prone to have infections with coagulase negative staphylococci, candida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antibiotic susceptibility tests for the most commonly used antibiotics revealed no resistance problems for E. coli, E. faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, common pathogens at the general surgery ward, but did for coagulase-negative staphylococci where we can consider only a few antibiotics like amikacin in obvious infections at the intensive care unit.
TI  - [Optimal control of the microflora environment in suppurative foci].
AB  - The informative capacity of various statistic parameters characterizing the ecology of pathogens of purulent processes was studied. Many-years' results of the routine bacteriological tests of the materials from purulent wounds in patients from surgical, traumatological and burn departments served as the study subjects. The frequency, persistence and contamination capacity of the pathogens were investigated. Data on the changes in the frequency parameter with respect to the main pathogens of wound infections in various contingents of patients were collected. In relation to the observation period and contingent of the patients, various microorganisms were found to be permanent, supplementary and casual. The use of the ecological parameters was shown to provide integrated information on the etiological role of the pathogens in the development of purulent processes. The information characterized the microbial properties which should be considered in planning the use of antibacterial drugs and estimating the efficacy of the epidemiological control.
TI  - In vitro susceptibilities of oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus to dapsone and sulfamethoxazole alone and in combination with trimethoprim.
AB  - The in vitro activity of trimethoprim plus dapsone against oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was comparable to that of trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole. Because of its different pharmacologic properties, dapsone may be a useful agent in combination with trimethoprim for the treatment of patients colonized with oxacillin-resistant S. aureus.
TI  - WIN 57273, a new fluoroquinolone with enhanced in vitro activity versus gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - WIN 57273 is a new fluoroquinolone with excellent in vitro activity versus gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and gentamicin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecalis. We compared the microdilution MICs and MBCs of this compound to those of other antimicrobial agents for more than 30 clinical isolates of each of these groups of organisms and found that with few exceptions, it was at least 10 times more active than all other drugs tested. Selection for resistance to ciprofloxacin (greater than or equal to 5 micrograms/ml) or WIN 57273 (greater than or equal to 0.16 microgram/ml) by the gradient plate method produced mutants with diminished susceptibility to the other fluoroquinolone; however, the MICs and MBCs of WIN 57273 for such strains were still quite low and remained below the preliminary susceptibility breakpoint (less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml). Spontaneous mutations conferring resistance to two and five times the WIN 57273 MIC were detectable at low frequencies for S. aureus and S. epidermidis; such mutations were virtually undetectable for E. faecalis. Further testing is necessary to establish if the effectiveness of WIN 57273 is maintained in vivo, first in animals and then in humans with infections caused by methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of S. aureus and S. epidermidis or gentamicin-susceptible and -resistant strains of E. faecalis.
TI  - Transferable plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistance in Listeria monocytogenes.
AB  - A strain of Listeria monocytogenes, isolated from a patient with meningoencephalitis, was resistant to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, streptomycin, and tetracycline. The genes conferring resistance to these antibiotics were carried by a 37-kb plasmid, pIP811, that was self-transferable to other L monocytogenes cells, to enterococci-streptococci, and to Staphylococcus aureus. The efficacy of transfer and the stability of pIP811 were higher in enterococci-streptococci than in the other gram-positive bacteria. As indicated by nucleic acid hybridisation, the genes in pIP811 conferring resistance to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and streptomycin were closely related to plasmid-borne determinants that are common in enterococci-streptococci. Plasmid pIP811 shared extensive sequence homology with pAM beta 1, the prototype broad host range resistance plasmid in these two groups of gram-positive cocci. These results suggest that emergence of multiple antibiotic resistance in Listeria spp is due to acquisition of a replicon originating in enterococci-streptococci. The dissemination of resistance to other strains of L monocytogenes is likely.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1987). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - Since 1979, Ikemoto et al. have been retrospectively surveying the sensitivity of major species of bacteria isolated from patients with urinary tract infections to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics. Their findings for the past year are reported below. A total of 825 clinical strains of bacteria was investigated. Of this total, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 28.0% (231 strains) and Gram-negative bacteria for 72.0% (594 strains). Taxonomically, Escherichia coli accounted for 34.7% (286 strains), Enterococcus faecalis for 14.3% (118), Pseudomonas aeruginosa for 11.0% (91), Klebsiella pneumoniae for 7.8% (64), and coagulase-negative staphylococci for 7.3% (60). Sensitivity spectra of these major bacteria to various drugs were as follows. 1. E. faecalis was sensitive to parenteral imipenem (IPM) and ampicillin and oral vancomycin. It was also sensitive to ofloxacin (OFLX) and ciprofloxacin (CPFX), which are new quinolones. Some strains were only slightly sensitive to second and third generation cephems cefmenoxime (CMX) and cefuzonam (CZON) aminoglycosides amikacin (AMK) and arbekacin (HBK), and erythromycin which is a macrolide. 2. Staphylococcus aureus was sensitive to dicloxacillin (MDIPC) which is a penicillin drug, cefotiam (CTM) which is a cephem, IPM, minocycline (MINO), and HBK. A fairly large number of strains were only slightly sensitive to cefazolin (CEZ), OFLX and CPFX. 3. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were sensitive to MDIPC which is a penicillin derivative, cephems CTM and CZON, IPM, HBK, clindamycin (CLDM) and MINO. Some strains, however, were only slightly sensitive to a majority of these drugs. 4. E. coli was sensitive to CTM, CMX, latamoxef (LMOX), ceftazidime (CAZ), CZON, and flomoxef (FMOX), all of which are second or third generation cephems. It was also sensitive to IPM, a carbapenem, carumonam (CRMN), a monobactam, and new quinolones, OFLX and CPFX. 5. K. pneumoniae was sensitive to cephems, viz. CTM, CAZ, CZON, FMOX and cefixime, CRMN which is a monobactam, IPM, a carbapenem and new quinolones, OFLX and CPFX. Some strains were only slightly sensitive to CTM, cefmetazole cefoperazone (CPZ), and FMOX. 6. Citrobacter freundii was sensitive to CRMN which is a monobactam, and new quinolones, OFLX and CPFX. Many strains were only slightly sensitive to cephems, viz. CEZ, CTM, CPZ and CAZ. 7. Enterobacter cloacae was sensitive to gentamicin and AMK which are aminoglycosides, but showed a bimodal pattern of sensitivity to CPZ, CAZ and CZON, all of which are cephems, and to quinolones, OFLX and CPFX.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Evidence for a staphylococcal-like mercury resistance gene in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - We investigated mercury resistance (Hgr) in 52 clinical isolates of Enterococcus  faecalis from two different geographical regions. Eleven of the 52 strains were resistant to HgCl2, and plasmids from these enterococci hybridized with a staphylococcal mercury resistance gene probe. Hgr from 5 of the 11 transferred at frequencies ranging from approximately 2 X 10(-7) to 2 X 10(-3).
TI  - Antibacterial activity of lomefloxacin in a pharmacokinetic in vitro model.
AB  - An in vitro model simulating two-compartment pharmacokinetics was used to study the antibacterial activity of lomefloxacin after single oral doses of 200 and 400 mg. Lomefloxacin produced reliable bactericidal activity against gram-negative aerobic bacteria and staphylococci. Bacterial strains for which MICs were less than 0.5 microgram/ml were inhibited with both dosing schedules. Doubling the dose from 200 to 400 mg increased the bactericidal activity only against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Enterococcus faecalis lomefloxacin showed no effect. Selection of resistant variants during the simulation of treatment was observed with Staphylococcus aureus and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Effect of human serum on the bactericidal activity of daptomycin and vancomycin against staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates as determined by time-kill kinetic studies.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of daptomycin and vancomycin alone in cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broth and in human serum against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis was evaluated by exposing replicating microorganisms to concentrations ranging from 2 to 128 micrograms/ml for 24 hr. In addition, the possibility of emergence of resistance, the stability of each agent in the respective medium, and the percent of protein binding by human serum for each agent was evaluated. We found that a concentration of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml of daptomycin was sufficient to achieve bactericidal activity (greater than or equal to 99.9% killing of the inoculum) in cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broth for all staphylococcal isolates tested; a concentration of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml of daptomycin was required for bactericidal activity in cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broth for enterococcal isolates. In human serum, comparable bactericidal activity with daptomycin was achieved only with concentrations 8-16 times higher. A similar but less pronounced effect in human serum was seen for vancomycin. Neither daptomycin nor vancomycin was appreciably degraded in human serum over a 24-hr period. It is likely that the clinical efficacy of daptomycin in humans would be enhanced by higher dosing than has been studied to date.
TI  - Biological characterization of a new radioactive labeling reagent for bacterial penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  - Radiolabeled penicillin G is widely used as the imaging agent in penicillin-binding protein (PBP) assays. The disadvantages of most forms of labeled penicillin G are instability on storage and the long exposure times usually required for autoradiography or fluorography of electrophoretic gels. We investigated the utility of radioiodinated penicillin V as an alternative reagent. Radioiodination of p-(trimethylstannyl)penicillin V with [125I]Na, using a modification of the chloramine-T method, is simple, high yielding, and site specific. We demonstrated the general equivalence of commercially obtained [3H]penicillin G and locally synthesized [125I]penicillin V (IPV) in their recognition of bacterial PBPs. Profiles of PBPs in membranes from Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Providencia rettgeri, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium labeled with IPV or [3H]penicillin G were virtually identical. Use of IPV as the imaging agent in competition experiments for determination of the affinities of various beta-lactam antibiotics for the PBPs of E. coli yielded results similar to those obtained in experiments with [3H]penicillin G. Dried electrophoretic gels from typical PBP experiments, using IPV at 37.3 Ci/mmol and 30 micrograms/ml, exposed X-ray film in 8 to 24 h. The stability of IPV on storage at 4 degrees C was inversely proportional to specific activity. At 37.3 Ci/mmol and 60 micrograms/ml, IPV retained useful activity for at least 60 days at 4 degrees C. IPV represents a practical and stable reagent for rapid PBP assays.
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin-metronidazole combinations against mixed bacterial cultures: reduced activity of metronidazole against Bacteroides species in the presence of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin-metronidazole combinations against mixed cultures of gram-positive facultative cocci and strains of the Bacteroides fragilis group was investigated. Metronidazole did not influence the high activity of daptomycin against strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis in the absence or presence of the co-cultured Bacteroides strains. In contrast, the Enterococcus faecalis isolates protected the co-cultured Bacteroides strains against the killing effect of metronidazole, even at a concentration four- or eightfold the MIC of metronidazole. Killing curve experiments confirmed this protective effect of different isolates of Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - Treatment of bone and soft tissue infections with teicoplanin.
AB  - The use of teicoplanin was evaluated in a group of 33 patients, which included 18 prosthetic infections, seven with osteomyelitis, five skin and soft tissue infections, and three cases of septic arthritis. The bacterial pathogens isolated were 27 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin sensitive 18; methicillin resistant 9), Staph. hominis (2), Staph. epidermidis (1), Staph. haemolyticus (2), Enterococcus faecalis (1), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), Peptococcus spp. (1). Eleven patients had polymicrobial infections (Gram-positive plus Gram-negative and/or anaerobic bacteria). In ten cases (nine polymicrobial infections) teicoplanin was used in combination with other antibiotics. Teicoplanin was administered intravenously 400 mg every 24 h in 26 cases, 200 mg every 24 h in six cases and 600 mg every 24 h in one case. The duration of the treatment ranged from 9 to 73 days with a mean of 27.3. Efficacy was evaluable in 30 patients, because in three patients treatment was stopped because of adverse reactions. Cure or improvement was noted in 28 patients (93%). Bacteriological cure occurred in 25 patients (83.3%).
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, a dual-action cephalosporin, compared with activities of other antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, which is desacetyl-cefotaxime linked to fleroxacin, was compared with the activities of cefotaxime, desacetyl-cefotaxime, fleroxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. It inhibited the majority of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, except for some Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter cloacae strains, at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml and had an MIC for 90% of strains tested (MIC90) of 8 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most group A, B, C, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. Ninety percent of the staphylococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml, except for some methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates. The MIC90S of Ro 23-9424 for Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Ninety percent of Clostridium perfringens isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, whereas Bacteroides fragilis had an MIC90 of 32 micrograms/ml. There was a minimal inoculum size effect. The MICs and MBCs were either identical or within a twofold dilution. The MICs of Ro 23-9424 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus increased 16- to 128-fold after 2 weeks of transfer in the presence of Ro 23-9424, showing that the presence of two agents does not prevent resistance.
TI  - [Changes in phagocytosis of aerobic bacteria by neutrophils after exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of aztreonam and ciprofloxacin].
AB  - In the present research work we are performing a study on the effect of the antibiotic concentrations low minimal inhibitory concentration of aztreonam and ciprofloxacin on phagocytosis of aerobic bacteria by neutrophils (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Both antibiotics induced an increased of phagocytosis by similar mechanisms. In our assay aztreonam and ciprofloxacin would not act directly on granulocyte but they would affect the bacteria increasing the opsonization and phagocytosis.
TI  - In vitro activity of PD127,391, a new quinolone against bacterial isolates from cancer patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of PD127,391, a new 4-quinolone, was compared to that of ciprofloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates from patients with cancer. PD127,391 was found to have a broad antimicrobial spectrum with excellent activity against gram-positive isolates (including multidrug-resistant organism such as Corynebacterium jeikeium, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp.). It was also extremely active against gram-negative bacilli including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against organisms such as Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Acinetobacter spp. and Xanthomonas maltophilia, which are frequently resistant to a variety of antimicrobial agents, PD127,391 exhibited good activity, inhibiting all such isolates at a concentration of 0.5 micrograms/ml. Overall, PD127,391 was far more potent than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive isolates and slightly more active against gram-negative isolates. No bacterium that we examined needed more than 2 micrograms/ml of PD127,391 for inhibition.
TI  - Therapeutic effects of cefpirome, a new cephalosporin, on various models of infections in mice and rats.
AB  - Cefpirome (HR 810) is a new cephalosporin with a 2,3-cyclopentenopyridine group in the 3-position side chain. It was compared with other cephem antibiotics in protective and therapeutic effects on various experimental infections, systemic and local, in mice and rats. HR 810 had more potent protective effect than ceftazidime (CAZ), cefoperazone (CPZ), and cefotaxime (CTX) on systemic infections induced by Escherichia coli Ec-31, Staphylococcus aureus SMITH, and Serratia marcescens Sm-6 in mice. Against systemic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa HR 810 was as effective as CAZ. Mice with leukopenia induced by cyclophosphamide were systemically infected with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Enterococcus faecalis. HR 810 was superior to cefuzonam (CZON) and cefmetazole against MRSA and MSSA and was much more active than any other antibiotics tested against E. cloacae and A. calcoaceticus. In the activity against E. faecalis, HR 810 was inferior to ampicillin but superior to CZON. In mice with pyelonephritis caused by E. coli Ec-7, the rank order of activities was HR 810 greater than CAZ greater than CTX greater than CPZ. HR 810 was more effective than latamoxef, CAZ, CTX, and CPZ in improving lung infections induced by Streptococcus pneumoniae HL 438 and Klebsiella pneumoniae Kp-51 in mice. HR 810 was superior to CTX and CPZ and comparable to cefazolin in therapeutic effects on intrauterine infections with E. coli Ec-89 and S. aureus SMITH in rats.
TI  - Comparison of enterococcal and staphylococcal beta-lactamase plasmids.
AB  - In Staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactamase (Bla) is typically associated with transducible plasmids that also encode metal resistance or with the more recently described conjugative, gentamicin resistance plasmids. The beta-lactamase gene of Enterococcus faecalis, which has been shown to be highly homologous to bla from the S. aureus plasmid p1258, is also encoded on conjugative, gentamicin resistance plasmids. To determine if the enterococcal Bla-encoding plasmids are similar to those from staphylococci, Bla-encoding plasmids from both species were compared by restriction endonuclease digestion followed by hybridization to Bla and gentamicin resistance gene probes and to one of the enterococcal Bla-encoding plasmids. Although similarities were noted in the restriction endonuclease digestion patterns among the transducible staphylococcal plasmids (pI524, pI258, and pII147) and among the conjugative Gmr staphylococcal plasmids, neither of these restriction patterns was similar to those of the enterococcal plasmids. Although the enterococcal plasmids showed extensive similarities by hybridization, the staphylococcal plasmids showed little or no similarity to the enterococcal plasmids except for bla and the gentamicin resistance genes. Whether enterococci acquired a different type of Bla-encoding plasmid or whether bla was acquired by transposition or by homologous recombination into enterococcal plasmids is unknown.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of econazole and miconazole sulfosalicylate.
AB  - The in vitro activities of new sulfosalicylic salts of econazole (E.SSA) and miconazole (M.SSA) have been investigated in comparison with the respective nitrate (NIT) salts and sulfosalicylic acid (SSA) alone. The results reveal good antimicrobial activity of M.SSA and E.SSA against different strains of Candida, dermatophytes, moulds, Gram-positive bacteria and Trichomonas vaginalis. The MIC values demonstrate that M.SSA is more active than M.NIT on Candida and T. vaginalis. E.SSA was also more active than E.NIT on T.vaginalis. Both SSA and sodium sulfosalicylate (NaSSA) were practically without activity by themselves. Finally, the pH variations did not significantly modify the activity of the SSA salts, suggesting that their greater activity could be due to better lipophilic activity of these compounds with respect to the nitrate salts.
TI  - Studies on the synthesis, characterisation and antimicrobial activity of new Co(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) complexes of Schiff base derived from ninhydrin and glycine.
AB  - For the first time, Co(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) complexes have been synthesized involving an intermediate Schiff base, indane-1,3-dione-2-imine-N-acetic acid the condensed product of ninhydrin and glycine. These coloured complexes were characterised by elemental analysis, molar conductivity, thermogravimetric analyses/differential thermal analysis, infrared, magnetic susceptibility, NMR and electronic spectral studies. Mechanisms for their formation have been proposed. The experimental studies reveal that the complexes possess octahedral stereochemistry whereas the Schiff base behaves as a monobasic tridentate ligand. A molecular structure for the metal complexes is also proposed. A comparative study of the antimicrobial activity of ninhydrin and the corresponding metal complexes against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis has been undertaken and the results are discussed.
TI  - [The in vitro activity of veterinary antiseptics].
AB  - The in vitro activity of 28 veterinary antiseptic drugs was studied on 4 bacterial strains either with or without calf serum. Eight preparations (VT Dose, Dulcidrine, Collyre Clement, Cronic, Detecaine, Lotion Maudor, Tano-Patt, Aurikan), half of which were eye-lotions, were found to be non antiseptic according to AFNOR standards. In the presence of calf serum, 4 other preparations (Albacetine, Nybocaine, Pediplasme, Pedifort) did not meet the standard NF T 72.171 criteria.
TI  - Mutation rates to 4-quinolone resistance.
AB  - The sensitivity of Staph. aureus, Staph. warneri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Strep.  pneumoneae and Strep. faecalis to eleven 4-quinolone antibacterials was compared by determining their minimum inhibitory concentrations on nutrient agar. In all cases where the minimum inhibitory concentration was less than 10 micrograms/ml then the frequency at which 4-quinolone-resistant mutants arose was estimated using each drug at 5, 10 and 20 times its minimum inhibitory concentration. It was found with all five bacterial species tested that ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were the most potent antibacterial and that no mutants could be detected in 10(12) bacteria for either drug with Staph. warneri, Strep. pneumoneae and Strep. faecalis. On the other hand, mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to both 5 and 10 times (but not 20 times) the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were detected at similar frequencies in the 10(12) bacteria tested. With Staph. aureus, mutants resisting 5 times (but not 10 or 20 times) the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were detected in the 10(12) bacteria tested at similar frequencies. However, all mutants resistant to ciprofloxacin retained the ability to produce coagulase while the majority of ofloxacin-resistant mutants had lost their ability to produce coagulase. Hence clear evidence for pathogenicity loss was observed with ofloxacin but not with ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Interactions between antibiotics and antineoplastic drugs on antibacterial activity in vitro.
AB  - The effects of various combinations of antibacterial (ampicillin, cephadroxil, doxycycline, imipenem, trimethoprimsulfadiazine) and antineoplastic (cisplatin, epirubicin, mitoxantrone) drugs were evaluated in vitro with regard to antibacterial activity on five clinical isolates from cancer patients of respectively Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. With one exception no significant effects on the bacterial growth were observed in the presence of the antitumor drug alone. In contrast, all five strains of Strept. faecalis grew better when mitoxantrone was included in a concentration of 0.1 mg/l. A synergistic action between imipenem and mitoxantrone was seen for single strains of Staph. aureus and E. coli. Furthermore, a dose-effect related inhibition by cisplatin on the growth of Strept. faecalis in the presence of sub MIC levels of trimethoprimsulfadiazine was observed. The study indicates that interaction between antibacterial and antineoplastic drugs is an erratic phenomenon, which has to be dealt with separately for each combination of drugs as well as for each bacterial strain.
TI  - New screening test to determine the acceptability of 0.45-micron membrane filters for analysis of water.
AB  - During routine membrane filter (MF) quality control testing, irregularities such  as partial or complete inhibition of microbial growth at grid lines, abnormal spreading of colonies, growth in or along the grid lines, nonwetting areas, poor colony sheen and metallic sheen on the MF surface with mEndo agar, brittleness, decreased recovery, and severe wrinkling were observed with several lots of filters. To study these effects and to develop a more sensitive screening test for MF quality, we compared five different MFs with various types and degrees of defects by using five stock coliform cultures and five different media. Results showed that the Enterobacter aerogenes-tryptic soy agar test system detected more MF defects than any other combination did and was superior to the Escherichia coli-mFC agar American Society for Testing and Materials method for grid line inhibition. Filtered natural samples grown on the same media showed the same effects as were observed with the pure cultures. Poor colony sheen and sheen on the MF surface were best detected with Enterobacter aerogenes on mEndo agar. The use of tryptic soy agar and mEndo agar with this organism permitted the maximum detection of MF irregularities. Of the 142 MF lots tested by this method, 30% were acceptable, 10% were marginally acceptable, and 61% were unacceptable. This method provides a valuable screening test for determining the acceptability of 0.45-microm-pore-size MFs used for coliform and heterotroph analysis and may also be useful in conjunction with other methods.
TI  - Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of new 7-[3-(fluoromethyl)piperazinyl]- and -(fluorohomopiperazinyl)quinolone antibacterials.
AB  - Some novel 6-fluoro-7-substituted-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acids have been prepared. At the N-1 position "standard" substitution was employed with the ethyl, cyclopropyl, and p-fluorophenyl groups being used. At C-7 the introduction of some novel piperazines was made. Most notably, 2-(fluoromethyl)piperazine (10) and hexahydro-6-fluoro-1H-1,4-diazepine (16, fluorohomopiperazine) at the quinolone C-7 position produced products with similar in vitro antibacterial activity as the ciprofloxacin reference. The in vivo efficacy of 1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-7-[3-(fluoromethyl)piperazinyl]-1,4-dihydro-4- oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (20) was excellent with better oral absorption than ciprofloxacin (2).
TI  - Conjugal mobilization of streptococcal plasmid pMV158 between strains of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis.
AB  - pMV158, a non-self-transmissible plasmid encoding tetracycline resistance, was conjugally transferred from Enterococcus faecalis JH203 to Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis IL1403. This transfer appeared to be dependent on the cotransfer of the conjugative plasmids pAM beta 1 or pIP501. Intraspecies conjugal transfer of pMV158 also occurred in strain IL1403. In contrast to the transfer from E. faecalis, transfer in IL1403 did not require the presence of a conjugative plasmid in the donor strain but, rather, appeared to be dependent on putative chromosomal functions in strain IL1403. The transfer of pMV158 from strain IL1403 required the presence of an active pMV158-encoded protein, which showed homology to the Pre (plasmid recombination enzyme) proteins encoded by several small plasmids extracted from Staphylococcus aureus, such as pT181.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefmenoxime in infections of neonates].
AB  - Cefmenoxime (CMX) was evaluated for its absorption and excretion as well as for therapeutic effectiveness in neonates and premature infants. The following results were obtained. 1. Serum concentrations of the drug were examined in 3 premature infants 1 to 11 days old upon intravenous administration of about 10 mg/kg body weight (1st group), in 2 premature infants 18 and 32 days old and 1 neonate 17 days old upon intravenous administration of about 20 mg/kg (2nd group), and in 1 neonate 15 days old with meningitis upon intravenous administration of 45.2 mg/kg. Concentrations of CMX at 30 minutes after administration were 43, 29 and 27 micrograms/ml, respectively, in the 1st group, 46, 37 and 44 micrograms/ml, respectively, in the 2nd group and 208 micrograms/ml in the other neonate, and appeared to be dose-dependent. Concentrations of CMX at 6 hours after administration were 18.2, 6.6 and 8.1 micrograms/ml, respectively, in the 1st group, 9.6, 11 and 1.35 micrograms/ml, respectively, in the 2nd group and 5.2 micrograms/ml in the other subject. Serum half-lives were, respectively, 4.59, 2.85 and 3.48 hours in the 1st group, 2.52, 2.73 and 1.14 hours in the 2nd group and 1.0 hour in the other subject. Urinary recovery rates during the first 6 hours after administration were 45.8, 87.0, 50.2 and more than 100% in 4 cases examined. Two of these cases, in which recovery rates were 45.8 and 50.2%, were premature infants of low birth weight. Spinal fluid concentrations of the drug at 80 to 90 minutes after dosing to 1 neonate with purulent meningitis (causative organism presumed: Escherichia coli) given 48.3 mg/kg tended to decline gradually with the recovery of the disease, 3.8, 1.72 and 1.32 micrograms/ml on the 2nd, 6th and 8th day, respectively. 2. The drug was given to 9 neonates 0 to 24 days old. The therapeutic effectiveness on bacterial infections was evaluated in 7 cases (10 diseases) including 1 disease of purulent meningitis presumably caused by E. coli, 4 of septicemia caused by E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae (1, 2 and 1, respectively), 3 of urinary tract infection caused by E. coli, Serratia and Enterococcus faecalis (1 each), 1 of purulent parotitis caused by S. aureus and 1 of pneumonia (causative organism was unknown). Therapeutic efficacies were assessed as "Excellent" in all of meningitis, septicemia and urinary tract infection cases, and "Good" in 1 each of purulent parotitis and pneumonia cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - The bactericidal effect of isoascorbic acid combined with mild heat.
AB  - The thermal inactivation of Salmonella thompson, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Candida zeylanoides, Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis was accelerated by the addition of sodium isoascorbate (1 mmol/l) to phosphate-buffer heating medium but not to complex food mixtures. The lethal effect of isoascorbate was nullified by heating under anaerobic conditions or by the addition of catalase. The scavengers of hydroxyl radicals, mannitol and formate were not protective whereas histidine was. Histidine may have protected by slowing the rate of isoascorbate autoxidation, a property common to other amino acids tested. Superoxide dismutase was not protective. Dehydroascorbic acid also enhanced heat killing and its action was also reversed by catalase. The bactericidal effects of mild heat plus isoascorbate or dehydroascorbic acid both apparently depend on oxidative processes but their relative effectiveness was not related to their respective rates of oxygen consumption or peroxide production. We speculate that site-specific redox reactions, involving amino-carbonyl intermediates are involved in the inactivation mechanism.
TI  - Comparative study of visual inspections and microbiological sampling in premises  manufacturing and selling high-risk foods.
AB  - The possible relationship between the results of a microbiological sampling programme and visual inspections carried out in local food-manufacturing premises was examined. Using five main parameters - overall appearance, personal hygiene, risk of contamination, temperature control, and training and education - a visual inspection rating score was established for each of the premises. A variety of high-risk processed foods, and specimens from hands, wiping cloths and environmental swabs were examined. The results from two study periods indicated that there was an overall poor agreement between microbiological results and inspection ratings. On its own, neither sampling nor visual assessment reliably monitored the performance of the premises. A combined approach, using selective microbiological examination to support a system of standardized inspections, is suggested for monitoring food hygiene standards in premises selling high-risk foods.
TI  - Nisin inhibits several gram-positive, mastitis-causing pathogens.
AB  - Organisms known to cause bovine mastitis, Enterococcus faecalis ssp. liquefaciens ATCC 27959, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29740, Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 27956, Streptococcus equinus ATCC 27960, Streptococcus dysgalactiae ATCC 27957, Streptococcus uberis ATCC 27958, and the neotype Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990 were examined for their susceptibility to the small peptide antibiotic, nisin. Using a disc assay, minimum inhibitory concentrations of nisin ranged from 10 to 250 micrograms/ml among the strains. Examination of the antimicrobial effect of 50 micrograms/ml nisin in milk showed nisin inhibited all gram-positive pathogens tested.
TI  - Antibacterial and plasmid curing activity of lomefloxacin in vitro.
AB  - The in vitro activity of lomefloxacin in comparison to other recently developed quinolones was evaluated by determination of MICs for 89 test strains. Organisms tested included clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria susceptible or resistant to quinolones, resistant mutants of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis obtained in vitro, and the wild type strain Escherichia coli K12 with its mutants na1A, nalB, nalC and nalB. The activity of lomefloxacin was similar to that of pefloxacin against gram-positive cocci and similar to that of norfloxacin against gram-negative bacteria. There was cross-resistance to all quinolones tested in pefloxacin resistant clinical isolates and in laboratory mutants. The activity of lomefloxacin was decreased against the Escherichia coli K12 mutants nalA and nalD but not nalB, whereas the nalC mutant showed increased susceptibility. Susceptible and mutant strains (n = 115) were used to establish the least-squares lines of regression with 5-micrograms and 10-micrograms lomefloxacin disks. Tests of the in vitro plasmid curing activity of lomefloxacin compared to other agents showed no statistically significant plasmid loss after treatment with lomefloxacin.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin in patients with bacteremic infections. The Spanish Group for the Study of Ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of 68 episodes of bacteremia were studied. Patients were treated intravenously (30 cases), orally (13 cases), or with sequential intravenous/oral therapy (25 cases). Intravenous doses ranged from 200 to 400 mg per day and oral doses ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day. According to the criteria of McCabe and Jackson, 39 cases had nonfatal and 29 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases. The clinical condition of patients at the start of therapy was critical or poor in 40 cases and fair or good in 28. Sixty-four of the 68 episodes of bacteremia were monomicrobial and the remaining four were polymicrobial. The causative micro-organisms were: Escherichia coli (18 episodes), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 episodes), Acinetobacter sp. (10 episodes), Salmonella sp. (seven episodes), Enterobacter sp. (six episodes), Proteus sp. (four episodes), Serratia sp. (four episodes), Haemophilus influenzae (three episodes), Klebsiella sp. (three episodes), Staphylococcus aureus (2 episodes), and Morganella morganii (two episodes). Overall clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin was 94 percent (64 of 68 patients). Bacteremia persisted in four patients (failure rate of 6 percent). Five organisms persisted: Acinetobacter sp. (two patients), P. aeruginosa (one patient), Enterobacter sp. (one patient), and Serratia sp. (one patient). Side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). Superinfecting organisms and sites were as follows: Enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); Candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); Acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); Staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and Clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). Ciprofloxacin administered either intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.
TI  - Intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin versus ceftazidime in the treatment of serious infections.
AB  - Seventy-one adult patients with 72 infections were treated, by random selection,  with intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin or intravenously administered ceftazidime. Twenty-seven additional patients with 29 infections who were not appropriate for random assignment were treated in an open study with intravenously administered ciprofloxacin only; the latter infections were generally more serious or were caused by ceftazidime-resistant organisms. The most common doses were ciprofloxacin, 200 mg intravenously and 500 mg orally every 12 hours and ceftazidime, 1 to 2 g intravenously every eight to 12 hours. Forty-seven ciprofloxacin-treated infections and 31 ceftazidime-treated infections were evaluable for determination of efficacy. Infections included lower respiratory tract (21 infections), urinary (37 infections), skin/soft tissue (14 infections), bacteremia/endocarditis (four infections), colitis (one infection), and mastoiditis (one infection). Median minimal inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were, respectively: for Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis, no more than 0.06 and no more than 0.25 micrograms/ml; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml; for Enterococcus faecalis, 1 and more than 32 micrograms/ml; and for Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 and 8 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin, 200 mg intravenously, yielded mean serum concentrations 0.5 and eight hours post-intravenous infusion of 2.3 and 0.7 micrograms/ml, respectively. Satisfactory clinical responses were achieved in 17 (81 percent) of 21 patients with intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin, 22 (71 percent) of 31 patients with ceftazidime, and 20 (77 percent) of 26 patients with intravenous ciprofloxacin. The most common treatment failures occurred in complicated skin/soft-tissue infections treated with intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin, complicated urinary tract infections treated with ceftazidime, and necrotizing P. aeruginosa pneumonia treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin; the pneumonia patients all had respiratory failure and had been previously unresponsive to treatment with other appropriate drugs. Serious adverse reactions were observed in three patients, seizures with intravenous ciprofloxacin in two patients, and Clostridium difficile diarrhea with ceftazidime in one patient. We conclude that sequential intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were comparable in efficacy and safety; the ability to change from intravenous to oral therapy is a major convenience. Intravenous ciprofloxacin was useful for more serious infections, often caused by ceftazidime-resistant organisms.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to estimating the effective administration dose of  imipenem/cilastatin. Evaluation of the disk susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  - In vitro activities of imipenem/cilastatin (IPM/CS) against 413 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of MICs and the results of disk susceptibility tests. The MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. The MIC80s of imipenem (IPM) against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 25 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing a bimodal MIC distribution. However, the distribution of MICs against other bacteria studied was of monomodal pattern. Group A Streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by IPM at dose levels less than 0.025 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. IPM inhibited Escherichia coli at 0.20 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae at 0.39 microgram/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one strain showed a MIC of 25 micrograms/ml, Serratia spp. at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one with MIC greater than 100 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii at 0.78 microgram/ml and Enterobacter spp. at 0.39 microgram/ml. Indole (-) Proteus and indole (+) Proteus were inhibited by this drug at levels of 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. The reliability of the IPM disk diffusion susceptibility test in quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter Showa disks containing 30 micrograms antibiotic and also disks containing 1-30 micrograms prepared in this laboratory. For the interpretation of the Showa disk susceptibility test, a 4 category system was used. In the 4 category system for Showa IPM disk the following classification of inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed; ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. The results of the test using Showa 30 micrograms disk against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups, showing false positive 8 out of 304 strains (2.6%) and false negative 1 of 304 strains (0.3%). With Showa 30 micrograms disks subclassification of strains with MIC less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. In this study, however, the differentiation of strains with MICs less than 1 microgram/ml was made with disks containing 5-10 micrograms, which afforded to set MIC break points at 1 and 3 micrograms/ml. According to current concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including the penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. Only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except in the hepato-biliary system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of KB-5246, a new tetracyclic quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of KB-5246, a tetracyclic quinolone, were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin. KB-5246 demonstrated a broad antibacterial spectrum. The in vitro activity of KB-5246 against gram-negative bacteria was higher than that of ofloxacin or norfloxacin and was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. KB-5246 demonstrated the greatest activity against gram-positive bacteria of the four agents tested. Among Streptococcus pyogenes strains resistant to 1.56 micrograms of norfloxacin per ml, there were 26 strains susceptible to 0.2 micrograms of KB-5246 per ml. Similarly, among the Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains resistant to 3.13 micrograms of norfloxacin per ml, there were 23 S. aureus and 11 S. epidermidis strains susceptible to 0.39 micrograms of KB-5246 per ml. Among the Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis strains resistant to 12.5 micrograms of norfloxacin per ml, there were 5 S. pneumoniae and 10 E. faecalis strains susceptible to 0.39 micrograms of KB-5246 per ml. KB-5246 had bactericidal activity at the MIC. KB-5246 demonstrated excellent antibacterial activity against various systemic infections in mice. After oral administration, KB-5246 was as active as ofloxacin and about two times more active than norfloxacin.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1986). II. Background of patients].
AB  - From July to October in 1986, hospital data on 717 isolates of causative microorganism from patients with urinary tract infections and background information on 562 patients were collected. The urinary tract infections were divided into 3 groups; simple infections and complicated infections with or without the use of indwelling catheter. We investigated such factors as the patients' sex, age, and drug treatments, and the isolates obtained from the infections. From 1981 to 1986, about 25% of the patients with simple infections were males and about 60 to 70% among those with complicated infections were males each year. During these 6 years, no noticeable changes occurred in sex and age distributions of patients with any type of the infections, but the species of isolates changed remarkably. In 1982 and 1983, the isolation rates of Enterococcus faecalis (Streptococcus spp. or Streptococcus faecalis) obtained from the patients were about 8% in both of male and female patients. In 1984, the rate in females increased to 17.9%. In 1985, the rates in males and females were 14.9% and 7.6%, respectively. Similar rates were also observed in 1986: 16.1 and 7.4%. The isolation rate of Staphylococcus aureus in 1982 was 0.7%, as was in 1983. In however, increased to 1.7% in 1984 and to 3.2% in 1985. It was 2.5% in 1986. The isolation rate of Gram-positive bacteria was 11.1% in 1982; it increased to 18.9% in 1983 and to over 20% between 1984 to 1986. Among Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa form patients with complicated urinary tract infections with a catheter was high and over 20% in both 1985 and 1986. When antibacterial agents were administrated for 3 days, changes in number of species of isolates tended to be more pronounced in complicated infections with or without the use of catheter than in simple infections. According to date obtained in 1986, when antibiotic agents were administered for 8 or more days, the changes were definitely more drastic in complicated infections than in simple ones. An upmost care in the selection of antibiotic drugs according to their antibacterial spectra and activities, therefore, appears necessary, and an attention should be paid on future changes in species of bacteria isolated from infections.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1986). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - Susceptibilities to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents of bacterial strains isolated from urinary tract infections at 8 hospitals in Japan from July to October in 1986 are summarized as follows. 1. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (ST) and imipenem (IPM) with MIC90s of 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml. Minocycline had the strongest activity against Staphylococcus aureus; the MICs for all strains tested were lower than 0.39 microgram/ml. The MIC80s of dicloxacillin, and arbekacin (HBK) were 0.20 and 0.78 microgram/ml, respectively. Among the cephems, the MIC80 of flomoxef was 25 micrograms/ml, whereas those of cefmenoxime (CMX) and cefotiam (CTM) were 50 micrograms/ml. 2. Escherichia coli was most susceptible to ofloxacin (OFLX) among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents tested. OFLX showed the minimum inhibitory concentration against 90% (MIC90) of the 274 strains of E. coli tested to be lower than 0.10 microgram/ml. The antibacterial activities of the third generation cephems such as CMX and latamoxef (LMOX) were the strongest among the injectable antibiotics tested. The MIC90s of CMX and LMOX were lower than 0.10 and 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. CTM and cefmetazole, the second generation cephems, were also highly active against E. coli with MIC90s of 0.39 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. Among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents tested, OFLX was the most active against Klebsiella pneumoniae. Its MIC90 was 0.78 microgram/ml. Among the injectable antibiotics tested, CMX was the strongest with an MIC90 of 0.20 microgram/ml; MIC90 of CTM and LMOX were 0.39 microgram/ml. 4. The tested antibacterial and antibiotic agents were generally less active against Citrobacter freundii than against other bacteria. The MIC80 of OFLX was 0.39 microgram/ml. Gentamicin (GM) and ST were slightly active against C. freundii. Among the cephems, CMX had the MIC80 of 25 micrograms/ml. 5. Enterobacter cloacae was less susceptible to the cephems tested. OFLX, GM, and mecillinam were active against this bacteria with MIC80s of 0.78, 0.78 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. 6. Among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents and penicillins examined, piperacillin (PIPC) was the most active against Proteus mirabilis. Its MIC90 was 0.39 microgram/ml. Those of sulbenicillin, cefaclor, ampicillin, OFLX, and ST were 0.78, 0.78, 1.56, 3.13 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. CMX was highly active against P. mirabilis with an MIC90 of less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml; LMOX followed with an MIC90 of 0.20 microgram/ml among the injectable antibiotics tested. CTM was also active against this bacterium; the MIC90 was 0.39 microgram/ml. 7. The antibacterial and antibiotic agents were generally only slightly active against Proteus vulgaris.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FK482, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin with a C-3 vinyl group. Its activity was compared with those of cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. FK482 inhibited 90% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates at 1 micrograms/ml and 90% of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at less than or equal to 0.012 micrograms/ml, superior to cephalexin and cefuroxime and similar to cefixime. It did not inhibit oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. FK482 inhibited 90% of Enterococcus faecalis isolates at 8 micrograms/ml. Although 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, and Shigella species isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, FK482 was less active than cefixime against Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella, Serratia, and Providencia species, with MICs for many isolates of greater than 8 micrograms/ml. FK482 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations comparable to that of cefixime and superior to those of cephalexin and cfaclor. Bacteroides and Pseudomonas species were resistant. FK482 was not hydrolyzed by the TEM-1 and TEM-2 beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the Proteus vulgaris enzyme. It had a high affinity for chromosomal beta-lactamases.
TI  - Ex vivo study of serum bactericidal titers and killing rates of daptomycin (LY146032) combined or not combined with amikacin compared with those of vancomycin.
AB  - Twelve volunteers, in two groups of six, received daptomycin at a dose of 1 or 2  mg/kg. In addition, they received in a randomly allocated order amikacin (500 mg), daptomycin-amikacin, and vancomycin (500 mg). Thirty-five clinical isolates, including Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Corynebacterium sp. group JK, and Enterococcus faecalis, were tested in vitro for the measure of the serum bactericidal titers and killing rates. The mean peak concentrations of daptomycin in serum 1 h after the administration of 1 and 2 mg/kg were 11 and 20 micrograms/ml, respectively. At 24 h after the administration of 2 mg/kg, the mean level in serum was 1.9 micrograms/ml, which is higher than the MICs for susceptible pathogens. Daptomycin and amikacin provided identical concentrations in serum whether given alone or in combination. Among the six regimens tested, those including daptomycin provided the highest and the most prolonged serum bactericidal titers against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and E. faecalis. The killing rates measured by the killing curves were correlated with the concentration/MIC and concentration/MBC ratios of daptomycin for all strains tested. Significant killing occurred once the concentration of daptomycin in the serum 4- to 6-fold the MIC or 1- to 1.2-fold the MBC. The combination of daptomycin and amikacin had no effect on either the serum bactericidal titers or the rates of killing. Only vancomycin provided significant killing of the strains of Corynebacterium sp. group JK.
TI  - Postantibiotic effects of imipenem, norfloxacin, and amikacin in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - The postantibiotic effects (PAEs) of imipenem and norfloxacin were tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Amikacin was tested against the same bacteria except Streptococcus faecalis. For in vitro tests, a viable count-washing method was used, and for in vivo tests, the thread technique in normal mice was used. All three drugs produced PAEs of 1.1 to 3.8 h in vitro and 1.4 to 4.3 h in vivo against the pathogens tested. In vitro and in vivo results correlated well. The PAE had a significantly (P less than 0.01 to 0.001) longer duration in vivo than in vitro, but the PAE of imipenem on Staphylococcus aureus was longer in vitro. The PAE was not due to residual antibiotics at the site of infection, and no PAE was obtained if at any time the antibiotic concentration at the infection site reached the MIC for the pathogen tested. The results indicate that the presence of a PAE may enable antibiotics to be given more intermittently without a loss of efficacy and that the PAE can only be induced if the level of the antibiotic exceeds the MIC for the pathogen in question for at least several minutes.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cephalothin. Reevaluation of MIC break points in 4 category system of disc susceptibility test].
AB  - The reliability of the cephalothin (CET) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 248 strains and using Showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of CET) and Difco discs (6 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of CET). Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the CET disc tests, which is widely used in Japan, was reevaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. The results obtained with the disc methods were compared with MICs determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. The results of the CET disc susceptibility test were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of MICs. Break points in MIC values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. With the Showa disc susceptibility test, 15 out of the 248 strains (6.0%) tested showed false positive results and 6 strains (2.4%) showed false negative results. With the Difco disc test, 18 out of the 248 strains (7.3%) tested showed false positive results and 6 (2.4%) showed false negative results. Excluding Enterococcus faecalis from the test, results because better in the quantitative estimation of MICs, resulting false positive rates of 3.2% (Showa), and 4.4% (Difco). A 3 category system of the interpretation of disc test is generally used in the USA and Europe. MIC break points proposed for the classification of the CET test are sensitive, MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, and resistance, MIC greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. With the Showa disc susceptibility test, 14 out of the 248 strains (5.6%) tested showed false positive results and 6 strains (2.4%) showed false negative results. With the Difco disc test 7 out of the 248 strains (2.8%) showed false positive results and 21 strains (8.5%) showed false negative results. In this study, MIC70S of CET against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 1.56 and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. CET was not so effective against Gram-negative rods except Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. MIC70S against K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, and E. coli were 6.25, 3.13, and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively.
TI  - Development of a meropenem susceptibility disc: drug content, preliminary interpretive and quality control criteria and potency bioassay.
AB  - Laboratory studies were conducted to develop an appropriate susceptibility disc for meropenem. Laboratory-prepared paper discs containing 5, 10, and 20 micrograms of meropenem were investigated. Agar dilution MICs and agar disc diffusion tests were performed with 367 rapidly growing clinical isolates by methods recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Agar disc diffusion tests with 10 micrograms meropenem discs acceptably defined organisms as susceptible or resistant. The preliminary interpretive zone size criteria for 10 micrograms meropenem discs were: susceptible, greater than or equal to 14 mm, and resistant, less than or equal to 10 mm, by application of the NCCLS imipenem MIC interpretive susceptible and resistant breakpoints to the meropenem data. A total of 270 agar disc diffusion assays were performed with each of four ATCC reference strains, using prototype discs (Becton Dickinson (BBL] containing 10 micrograms meropenem. The preliminary quality control limits for agar disc diffusion tests with these discs are: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 28-32 mm; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, 26-31 mm; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, 33-39 mm; and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, 19-23 mm. Further studies are necessary to re-evaluate both the preliminary interpretive and quality control criteria before definitive limits can be established. A reproducible, large plate bioassay with Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 was developed to monitor meropenem disc potency.
TI  - Activity of meropenem, against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - A new carbapenem antibiotic, meropenem, was shown to be active against a large number of Gram-positive bacteria. The drug inhibited penicillinase-positive and -negative, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci equally well. Among the comparative antimicrobials examined, only N-formimidoyl-thienamycin (imipenem) was two to four times more active than meropenem. Compared with vancomycin or methicillin, meropenem was 10-20 times more active. Strains of 11 species of streptococci were highly susceptible to meropenem; the geometric mean MICs of the drug for these species ranged from 0.01 to 0.04 mg/l. The agent, however, only had moderate activity against Enterococcus faecalis (mean MIC 5 mg/l) and Ent. faecium (mean MIC 11.6 mg/l). Among Corynebacterium jeikeium, strains were encountered that showed susceptibility to meropenem but resistance to imipenem and other beta-lactams. Strains of other corynebacteria, Rhodococcus equi, Erysopelothrix rhusiopathiae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Bacillus spp. all were highly susceptible to meropenem (mean MICs 0.04-0.17 mg/l). Although methicillin-resistant staphylococci were inhibited by concentrations of 1-2 mg/l of meropenem in agar dilution tests, such strains showed heteroresistance in population studies, as is typical for all beta-lactam antibiotics. In addition, the biochemical correlate of methicillin-resistance, penicillin-binding protein 2', showed low affinity for meropenem, similar to that for imipenem. Meropenem was as bactericidal as imipenem and comparative bactericidal antimicrobials in killing-curve experiments. Strains of Ent. faecium, C. jeikeium, and L. monocytogenes were killed at a slower rate than streptococci or staphylococci.
TI  - Daptomycin (LY146032) for prevention and treatment of experimental aortic valve endocarditis in rabbits.
AB  - The efficacy of daptomycin (LY146032), a vancomycinlike lipopeptide antibiotic, was compared with that of antibiotics commonly in use for prevention and treatment of experimental aortic valve endocarditis in rabbits. Strains of Staphylococcus aureus. S. epidermidis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Enterococcus faecalis were used to establish endocarditis. A single 10-mg/kg dose of daptomycin and a single 25-mg/kg dose of vancomycin were both effective in prevention of endocarditis produced by strains of S. aureus and S. sanguis. Daptomycin was more effective than vancomycin for prevention of endocarditis caused by the strain of S. epidermidis. A single dose of daptomycin also was more effective in prevention of staphylococcal and enterococcal endocarditis than were single-dose regimens of cefazolin (100 mg/kg) and the combination of ampicillin (30 mg/kg) plus gentamicin (3 mg/kg), respectively. For treatment of endocarditis, daptomycin (10 mg/kg) as a single daily dose was as effective as regimens of either vancomycin or beta-lactam antibiotics for staphylococcal and enterococcal endocarditis. Daptomycin, however, was not as effective as a single daily dose of 600,000 U of procaine penicillin for endocarditis caused by the strain of S. sanguis.
TI  - Scanning electronmicroscopy of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis exposed to daptomycin.
AB  - The novel lipopeptide antibiotic, daptomycin, at a concentration of 8 mg/L, caused gross morphological changes in both a methicillin-sensitive and a methicillin-resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus and in a strain of Enterococcus faecalis. The earliest (after 1 h) surface lesion observed was the appearance of boss-like processes randomly distributed on the cell surface. Later, grossly deformed bacteria were seen and in two of the three bacteria prolonged exposure led to degeneration of the cells into an amorphous syncytial mass. Omission of calcium (which is known to potentiate the activity of daptomycin) from the culture medium did not affect the morphological response to an inhibitory concentration of the antibiotic.
TI  - Growth of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in platelet concentrates.
AB  - In 1986 the allowable platelet storage time was reduced from 7 to 5 days because  of a recent increase in septic deaths associated with platelet transfusion. In this study, the growth curves of two gram-positive and two gram-negative organisms in platelets stored for 7 days in CLX and PL-732 bags were evaluated. Platelets in CLX bags were inoculated with 10(1), 10(2), and 10(3) organisms and 10(2) organisms were introduced into PL-732 bags. Test organisms were inoculated into trypticase soy broth as a control. All four bacteria grew rapidly in trypticase soy broth, reaching 10(9) organisms per mL within 48 hours. In both CLX and PL-732 bags, the growth pattern of gram-positive organisms was generally logarithmic during the first few days of storage. A concentration of 10(8) organisms per mL was present by Day 3 or 4, after which further proliferation was inhibited by the high density of bacteria in the platelets. In PL-732 bags, the proliferation of gram-negative organisms followed a pattern similar to that of the gram-positive bacteria. However, gram-negative organisms grew less well in CLX bags.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of piperacillin-tazobactam and ticarcillin-clavulanate.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ticarcillin, piperacillin, clavulanic acid, tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, and piperacillin-tazobactam against 819 bacterial isolates were compared. The two beta-lactamase inhibitors, clavulanic acid and tazobactam, had little useful antibacterial activity but enhanced the activities of the penicillins against beta-lactamase-producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus; all strains were susceptible to both combinations. Both enzyme inhibitors also enhanced the activities of the penicillins against most strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter diversus, Proteus spp., Providencia spp., and Bacteroides spp. and against occasional strains of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., and Serratia marcescens. Clavulanic acid frequently enhanced the activity of ticarcillin against Xanthomonas maltophilia, and tazobactam frequently enhanced the activity of piperacillin against Morganella morganii. Enhancement was observed primarily with strains relatively resistant to the penicillins. In general, clavulanic acid was more effective than tazobactam in enhancing penicillin activity against Klebsiella spp., C. diversus, X. maltophilia, and Bacteroides spp., whereas tazobactam was more effective against Escherichia coli and Proteeae. There was little or no enhancement of activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, or Acinetobacter anitratus. Clavulanic acid occasionally antagonized the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, but those strains were still considered susceptible to the combination. Tazobactam never antagonized the activity of piperacillin. In a direct comparison of the activities of ticarcillin-clavulanate and piperacillin-tazobactam, the two were equally active against H. influenzae, B. catarrhalis, and S. aureus; the latter was more active against E. faecalis. For relatively susceptible strains of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, neither combination was predictably more active than the other, but relatively resistant strains were generally more susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam was more active than ticarcillin-clavulanate against A. hydrophila, P. aeruginosa, and P. cepacia, similar in activity against A. anitratus, and less active against X. maltophilia and Bacteroides spp.
TI  - In vitro postantibiotic effect of daptomycin (LY146032) against Enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains.
AB  - The suppression of bacterial growth that persists after brief exposure to antimicrobial agents has been termed the postantibiotic effect (PAE). This pharmacodynamic interaction varies for each microorganism-antimicrobial agent combination. Daptomycin (LY146032) is a new lipopeptide antibiotic with activity against gram-positive organisms. We studied the in vitro bactericidal activities and PAEs of the following drugs: daptomycin compared with penicillin G and vancomycin, without and with gentamicin against Enterococcus faecalis strains; daptomycin compared with nafcillin and vancomycin against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains; and daptomycin compared with vancomycin against methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains. Daptomycin, alone and when used in combination with gentamicin, exhibited greater bactericidal activity and in general produced a longer PAE than standard effective regimens against the organism strains studied.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of daptomycin (LY146032) and vancomycin against gram-positive cocci determined using a pharmacokinetic model.
AB  - The activity of daptomycin (LY146032) and vancomycin was compared for methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strains of Staphylococcus aureus and for Enterococcus faecalis, using a semi-automated model that allows examination of time-kill curves with diminishing drug concentrations, thus reflecting in vivo pharmacokinetics. Exposure to daptomycin resulted in rapid killing of all strains of staphylococci and Enterococcus faecalis tested. Methicillin-sensitive staphylococcal strains appeared marginally more susceptible than MRSA. By contrast, the activity of vancomycin appeared much reduced. For all strains, greater than 90% kill was not observed within 24 h. Enterococcus faecalis was uniformly less susceptible to both agents than were staphylococci. The results suggest that despite similar values for MICs, the activity of daptomycin against strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis is comparable to and may exceed that of vancomycin, although the significance of such differences is uncertain.
TI  - Reduced adherence to traumatized rat heart valves by a low-fibronectin-binding mutant of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Isogenic strains of Staphylococcus aureus, differing in fibronectin binding, were constructed for studies of the contribution of fibronectin binding to the in vivo pathogenesis of staphylococcal disease. Mutagenesis of S. aureus 879R4S was accomplished by mating with Enterococcus faecalis FA378 that carried the transposon Tn918. Four low-fibronectin-binding mutants were identified that bound 24- to 35-fold less fibronectin than the parent strain did. A spectinomycin-resistant strain, R4SSp, was transduced by a bacteriophage (80 alpha) lysate propagated on a low-binding mutant of 879R4S to produce R4SSp/1536, which bound less fibronectin, contained a single copy of the transposon, and grew on spectinomycin-containing medium. Using a rat model of endocarditis, we determined the distribution of S. aureus R4SSp and its transductant in normal and cardiac catheterized rats. Cultures of heart tissue showed that catheterized rats challenged with the fibronectin-binding parent strain had over 250-fold more organisms in the left heart than did rats challenged with the low-binding transductant. The ability to bind fibronectin had no effect on the number of S. aureus cells cultured from other tissues. These data suggest that the ability of S. aureus to bind fibronectin is an important factor in establishing adherence to damaged heart valves in vivo.
TI  - Teicoplanin in the treatment of gram-positive-bacterial endocarditis.
AB  - Intravenous teicoplanin has been used to treat 23 cases of gram-positive-bacterial endocarditis, usually with 3 to 7 mg/kg every 12 h on the first day, followed by 3 to 7 mg/kg every 24 h. For some cases (staphylococcal and enterococcal endocarditis), the dosage was 8 to 14.4 mg/kg per day and/or other antibiotics were given. The mean duration was 48.2 days (range, 23 to 130 days). Of 23 patients, 21 (91.3%) had negative cultures or were cured. A total of 18 patients were treated with teicoplanin alone; of these, 4 had surgery, and all (except 2 who relapsed) were cured. Teicoplanin was combined with one or more antibiotics in five cases; in all cases appropriate cultures were negative, but three patients died during therapy or follow-up. Mild renal impairment was seen in two patients; both were receiving teicoplanin in combination with an aminoglycoside. We conclude that intravenous teicoplanin administered once a day at doses of 7 to 14 mg/kg per day is well tolerated, easy to administer, and may represent an efficacious therapy for gram-positive-bacterial endocarditis.
TI  - Antibacterials. Synthesis and structure-activity studies of 3-aryl-2-oxooxazolidines. 1. The "B" group.
AB  - The synthesis and structure/activity studies of the effect of varying the "B" group in a series of oxazolidinone antibacterials (I) are described. Two synthetic routes were used: (1) alkylation of aniline with glycidol followed by dialkyl carbonate heterocyclization to afford I (A = H, B = OH), whose arene ring was further elaborated by using electrophilic aromatic substitution methodology; (2) cycloaddition of substituted aryl isocyanates with epoxides to give A and B with a variety of values. I with B = OH or Br were converted to other "B" functionalities by using SN2 methodology. Antibacterial evaluation of compounds I with A = acetyl, isopropyl, methylthio, methylsulfinyl, methylsulfonyl, and sulfonamido and a variety of different "B" groups against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis concluded that the compounds with B = aminoacyl, and particularly acetamido, were the most active of those examined in each A series, possessing MICs in the range of 0.5-4 micrograms/mL for the most active compounds described.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of piperacillin and gentamicin using a dynamic system simulating in vivo pharmacokinetics.
AB  
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new quinolone, AM-1091.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new quinolone, AM-1091 [7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-8-chloro-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro- 4-oxo- 3-quinoline carboxylic acid hydrochloride], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, beta-lactams, and gentamicin. AM-1091 inhibited 90% of the isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml. For many species AM-1091 was 2-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 2- to 32-fold more active than ofloxacin. It inhibited Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Klebsiella species resistant to ceftazidime and gentamicin. Ninety percent of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, so for this species AM-1091 was twofold less active than ciprofloxacin. AM-1091 was more active against Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia, inhibiting isolates resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. Most Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml. The MICs for 90% of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis isolates were 0.06, 0.06, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. AM-1091 inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.25 micrograms/ml and was more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against gram-positive species. AM-1091 inhibited 90% of the Bacteroides species at 0.5 micrograms/ml. The frequency of spontaneous resistance was less than 10(-10) for most organisms, but resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculturing. Although AM-1091 had lower in vitro activity at pH 5.5 and in the presence of high concentrations of Mg2+, it still inhibited most organisms at </= 0.5 micrograms/ml under these conditions. AM-1091 rapidly killed Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa and had a prolonged postantibiotic suppressive effect on these bacteria.
TI  - [Clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil dry syrup in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807) dry syrup was administered orally to 31 patients with various infections at daily dose levels between 5.4 and 10.9 mg/kg divided into three doses. 1. The subjects were 3 patients with urinary tract infections, 25 with tonsillitis and 1 patient each with bronchitis, pneumonia, and cervical lymphadenitis. Clinical effects were excellent in 16 cases, good in 14, and fair in 1 (tonsillitis), with an overall efficacy rate of 96.8%. 2. Organisms suspected as pathogens were 32 strains (6 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 of Streptococcus pyogenes, 1 of Enterococcus faecalis, 15 of Haemophilus influenzae, 5 of Haemophilus parainfluenzae and 3 of Escherichia coli). Bacteriologically, eradication of pathogens were observed in 30 strains, decrease in one (H. parainfluenzae), and no change in another (E. faecalis), thus the eradication rate was 93.8%. 3. Side effect was observed in 1 case (slight eruption) but it was possible continue the treatment. Abnormal laboratory test values were observed in 1 case of a slight prolongation of prothrombin time and eosinophilia, but they were not serious. Diarrhea was not observed in any patients. 4. All the medication was done on schedule. No refusal of the drug occurred due to its taste or odor.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil in the pediatric field].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807), a new oral cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Antibacterial activities of R-3746 (Na-salt of cefpodoxime (CPDX] against clinically isolated strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae were compared with those of cefaclor, cephalexin and cefadroxil. R-3746 is superior to other antibiotics against S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, B. catarrhalis and Gram-negative rods. 2. Serum concentrations of CPDX after administration of CPDX-PR at doses of 3 mg/kg (fasting), 6 mg/kg (non-fasting) and 6 mg/kg (fasting) were determined. Mean AUC (area under curve)'s of CPDX obtained were 9.60, 31.35 and 17.89 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively for the 3 dosages. The mean half-lives of CPDX were 3.35, 1.88 and 1.76 hours, respectively. The mean urinary recovery rate within 8 hours after administration of CPDX-PR at a dose of 3 mg/kg (fasting) was 39.2%. 3. CPDX-PR was administered to 37 pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (pyelonephritis 9, cystitis 4, pneumonia 7, acute bronchitis 3, otitis media 2, tonsillitis 10, subcutaneous abscess 1 and purulent lymphadenitis 1). The overall clinical efficacy rate was 91.9% and the overall bacteriological eradication rate was also 91.9%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed. Abnormal laboratory findings were moderate, eosinophilia in 2 and slight elevation of GOT and GPT in 1. The taste and the odor of the CPDX-PR preparation was sufficiently tolerable. From the above results we have concluded that CPDX-PR is a useful oral antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - Quality control parameters and interpretive criteria for in vitro susceptibility  tests with the macrolide azithromycin. Collaborative Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing Group.
AB  - Quality control parameters for broth microdilution and disk diffusion susceptibility tests were defined and the interpretive criteria for disk diffusion tests reviewed. For interpretation of tests with 15 micrograms azithromycin disks, the following criteria are recommended: greater than or equal to 19 mm for the susceptible category (MIC less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml) and less than or equal to 15 mm for the resistant category (MIC greater than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml). Using these criteria, there was 97% overall agreement between broth dilution and disk diffusion tests; Haemophilus influenzae isolates were susceptible to azithromycin by both methods. The quality control strain Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 gave zones of 21 to 26 mm in diameter in a six-laboratory collaborative study. In azithromycin broth microdilution tests the following MIC control limits are recommended: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 2.0-8.0 micrograms/ml; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, 0.25-1.0 micrograms/ml; and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, 1.0-4.0 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Evaluation of teicoplanin for treatment of endocarditis caused by gram-positive cocci in 20 patients.
AB  - Teicoplanin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic similar to vancomycin, was evaluated for the treatment of bacterial endocarditis in an open multicenter study from May 1985 to August 1987. A total of 20 patients with positive blood culture endocarditis received teicoplanin once daily as a mean intravenous injection of 7.3 mg/kg of body weight (range, 4.8 to 10.6 mg/kg); in 17 patients, teicoplanin was combined with another antibiotic, usually an aminoglycoside. The mean duration of therapy was 28 days (range, 7 to 66 days). The diagnosis of endocarditis was confirmed by echocardiography or anatomical findings in 15 patients and established on the basis of clinical manifestations plus positive blood cultures in 5 patients. The tricuspid valve was involved in 11 of the 20 patients. Isolates from blood were 12 Staphylococcus aureus, 1 Staphylococcus hominis, 1 Micrococcus sedentarius, 1 Enterococcus faecalis, 3 Streptococcus bovis, and 2 nongroupable Streptococcus sp. At the end of therapy, bacterial eradication was achieved in 17 of 20 patients (85%), and a favorable clinical outcome had occurred in 14 of 17 evaluable patients (82%). Of these 14 patients, one relapsed 4 months after the end of treatment. Thus, teicoplanin was effective in 13 of 17 patients (76%). Mean peak levels of teicoplanin in serum were lower, 23.1 +/- 2.9 micrograms/ml, in patients who failed than in those who were cured (45.8 +/- 8.4 micrograms/ml). Side effects occurred in 7 of 20 patients (35%), and required premature discontinuation of teicoplanin in 3 patients. These side effects were fever in three patients, rash in three patients, hearing loss in two patients, and increased serum transaminase levels in two patients. This study demonstrates the efficacy of teicoplanin in the treatment of endocarditis and the need for achieving peak levels in serum close to 40 micrograms/ml. Teicoplanin should now be further evaluated in endocarditis caused by gram-positive cocci means of controlled comparative study with standard therapy.
TI  - Comparison of the agar dilution, tube dilution, and broth microdilution susceptibility tests for determination of teicoplanin MICs.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards agar dilution, tube dilution, and broth microdilution susceptibility tests for the measurement of teicoplanin MICs. The three standardized tests gave equivalent (within a twofold dilution) results with 98.8 to 99.0% of the 508 gram-positive clinical isolates tested, indicating that either method may be used for teicoplanin MIC determination.
TI  - Intraperitoneal penetration of cefpirome.
AB  - Twenty-six patients undergoing elective gastrointestinal surgery received a 1 g intravenous dose of cefpirome before operation. Serum and peritoneal fluid samples, obtained 0.5-7.6 h following administration, were assayed for cefpirome by a microbiological assay. The serum half-life of cefpirome was 2.1 h. The mean concentration of cefpirome in peritoneal fluid 0-2 h after administration was 44.4 micrograms/ml. The half-life of cefpirome in peritoneal fluid was 2 h, with mean concentrations of less than 10 micrograms/ml measured 6 h after administration. The mean percentage of intraperitoneal penetration of cefpirome over the study period was 97.7%. The therapeutic implications are discussed.
TI  - 19-Deformyl-4'-deoxydesmycosin (TMC-016): synthesis and biological properties of  a unique 16-membered macrolide antibiotic.
AB  - 19-Deformyl-4'-deoxydesmycosin was synthesized by the following synthetic route:  19-Deformylation of desmycosin, 3,2',4''-tri-O-trimethylsilylation, 4'-O-sulfonylation, 4'-iodination, reductive deiodination and 3,2',4''-tri-O-detrimethylsilylation. Deformylation of the aldehyde group at the C-19 position was achieved by two different methods: A) A simple one-step deformylation using Wilkinson's catalyst ((Ph3P)3RhCl). B) Reductive decarboxylation of the 19-carboxyl derivative following NaClO2 oxidation of the aldehyde. 19-Deformyl-4'-deoxydesmycosin showed very strong antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Synthesis of novel 5-fluoro analogues of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin.
AB  - A series of polyfluoro-3-quinolonecarboxylic acids have been synthesized and their in vitro antibacterial activity evaluated. The desired 7-(substituted amino) derivatives were prepared from the 5,6,7,8-tetrafluoroquinolone acids. Conversely, amine displacement occurred primarily at the 5-position when the ester was used. Structure-activity studies indicated that the antibacterial activity was greatest when the N-1 substituent was cyclopropyl and the 7-substituent was 4-methyl-1-piperazinyl. All 5-(substituted amino) derivatives showed poor in vitro activity.
TI  - In vitro activity of lomefloxacin (NY-198 or SC 47111).
AB  - The activity of lomefloxacin was compared to that of four other quinolones. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were similar to those of enoxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin against the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus spp. and Enterococcus faecalis. The activity of lomefloxacin was antagonized in urine at pH 5.4, but not in urine at pH 7.0. Higher inocula required higher lomefloxacin concentrations for inhibition. Lomefloxacin was more active at alkaline pH. At concentrations equal to or 2-fold the MIC, it was rapidly bactericidal against Gram-negative organisms and required a longer time for the reduction of inoculum by 99% and 99.9%. An "Eagle effect" was seen against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus but not against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  - Lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. In this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated antimicrobials. Lomefloxacin was very active against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). In common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of Neisseria spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Legionella spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Vibrio spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 1 microgram/ml). Lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of Bacteroides spp. (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml) or Clostridium difficile MIC90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of Clostridium perfringens (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), Peptostreptococcus spp. (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Chlamydia trachomatis (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Mycoplasma hominis (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), and Urea-plasma urealyticum (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the MIC with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of Escherichia coli and S. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the MIC. These results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by S. aureus.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of lomefloxacin SC 47111 (NY-198) and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens.
AB  - The bacterial activity of lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens was compared using kill-kinetic methods to assess inhibitory (1 x MIC) and suprainhibitory (4 x MIC) concentrations. Five strains each of the following microorganisms were studied: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that lomefloxacin was 8- to 16-fold less active than ciprofloxacin as measured by MICs. However, the bactericidal activities of both lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin were comparable when concentrations 1 x MIC and 4 x MIC were tested. For many of the isolates tested, such concentrations would be achieved clinically. The low MICs seen for the Gram-negative bacilli did not correlate with killing ability for either drug: concentrations 8-16 x MIC were needed for 99.9% killing of the final inoculum. Although higher concentrations of lomefloxacin are needed for inhibitory and bactericidal activity, the improved pharmacokinetics of lomefloxacin may result in this agent being comparable to ciprofloxacin.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [The effect of roxithromycin on the aerobic fecal flora in children].
AB  - To evaluate the effect of roxithromycin on aerobic flora in 14 children treated orally (5 mg/kg/day during 5 to 7 days) quantitative stool cultures were performed using selective media. Enterobacteriaceae (EB), streptococci D (STR D), Staphylococcus aureus, Candida were counted at days 0, 2 and 5 days, and 2 days after treatment. The MIC of each strain was determined for roxithromycin, erythromycin and spiramycin. Ten infants in a nursery had already received antibiotics. A moderate albeit significant (p less than 0.01) decrease was observed for EB, falling from 7.2 log 10 (range 5-9) to 4.9 (range 2-8) per gram of stools, rising to 5.8 after treatment. There was no significant effect for STR D. The MIC of roxithromycin for EB increased from 244 mg/l (range 0.03-512) to 340 (range 0.03-512). For STR. D, it increased from 138 (range 1-1024) to 427 (range 1-1024). The bacteria with low MIC (less than or equal to 64 mg/l for EB and less than or equal to 4 mg/l for STR. D) are Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecium. The MIC increased for the three macrolides tested.
TI  - Sensibility assay for topical agents. A new method.
AB  - We present a new laboratory method to test the sensibility of clinically isolated strains to topical agents. It is a method of dilution of the whole cream in a solid medium. The cream is weighted, suspended in sterile water, and maintained at 45 degrees C. Then a volume of that suspension is added to the agar, maintained at 45 degrees C also. The mixture is agitated and plated. Afterwards 25 strains are inoculated by a Multinoculator (Cetin, Bs. As., Argentina). After incubation (18 hours at 37 degrees C), the results are obtained by observing the presence or absence of bacterial development. The minimal inhibitory concentration is calculated as the lowest concentration that inhibited growth. It is a simple, economical, and reproducible method.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cervical mucus in pregnant or non-pregnant women].
AB  - Antibacterial activities of human cervical mucus obtained from non-pregnant and pregnant women were tested using standard blood agar plates. The combined effect of cervical mucus with cefmetazole (CMZ) was also investigated. Obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. Cervical mucus specimens obtained from 6 subjects at 9 to 36 weeks of pregnancy showed antibacterial activity to only one strain of Bacillus subtilis among organisms tested. The cervical mucus enhanced the activity of CMZ against 1 strain of Streptococcus pyogenes and 2 strains of Micrococcus luteus, but no effect was observed against other organisms tested. 2. Cervical mucus specimens obtained from non-pregnant women showed antibacterial activities to 8 of 11 strains (72.7%) of B. subtilis tested. The cervical mucus enhanced the activities of CMZ against 1 strain of S. pyogenes and 3 strains of B. subtilis. The tested organisms included Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, S. pyogenes, B. subtilis, M. luteus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans, but, as described above, cervical mucus samples showed antimicrobial activities only against B. subtilis (9/17, 52.9%), and specimens obtained only from non-pregnant women or pregnant women with less than 11 weeks of pregnancy showed any antimicrobial activities.
TI  - [Effects of sulbactam on the activity of cefoperazone against various clinical isolates].
AB  - Sulbactam/Cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) have been used in clinical infusion at ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 in Japan and U.S.A., respectively. After an administration of these drugs as a 1:1 parenteral formulation, the ratio of levels of CPZ and SBT in blood was 1:1/4 to 1:1/5 for 1 to 2 hours, whereas the ratio of free, unbound drug levels was 1:1.4 to 1:1.5. In urine these drugs were excreted at a ratio between 1:1 and 1:4 during 6 hours after the infusion. Antimicrobial interaction studies using various combinations of CPZ and SBT were performed to obtain information with respect to the effect of SBT on the antimicrobial activity of CPZ in vivo and the most appropriate ratio of these drugs for the in vitro test system. Antimicrobial activities were determined using the agar dilution method and the disk diffusion susceptibility test. SBT increased the activity of CPZ against various clinical isolates tested except Enterococcus faecalis. CPZ-SBT at a fixed ratio of 1:1/5 significantly increased the antimicrobial activity of CPZ, resulting in decreases in MIC values and increases in disk inhibitory zone diameters. These drugs at ratios 1:1 to 1:3 maximized the synergistic enhancement of the activity. Therefore, a fixed ratio between 1:1/5 and 1:1 would be appropriate for the in vitro antimicrobial test system using either the agar dilution method or the disk susceptibility test. Based on pharmacokinetic data for CPZ and SBT, results of the present study on antimicrobial activity would support that the parenteral formulation of CPZ-SBT at the fixed ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 for the intravenous infusion used in Japan and U.S.A., respectively, are appropriate. The effect of SBT on the activity of CPZ was more marked against clinical isolates with greater production abilities of beta-lactamase than against those with less production abilities. SBT/CPZ, however, exerted a synergistic effect against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus without beta-lactamase production. The MIC80 of SBT/CPZ (1:1) against various clinical isolates with 10(6) CFU/ml inoculum size were as follows: S. aureus 12.5 micrograms/ml, Staphylococcus epidermis 3.13 micrograms/ml, and E. faecalis 50 micrograms/ml. Those of Gram-negative bacilli were: Escherichia coli 0.20 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae 0.20 micrograms/ml, Proteus mirabilis 0.78 microgram/ml, Proteus vulgaris 0.78 microgram/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 12.5 micrograms/ml, Serratia marcescens 25 micrograms/ml, Enterobacter spp. 3.13 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter spp. 12.5 micrograms/ml and Acinetobacter spp. 0.78 microgram/ml.
TI  - Genetic basis of antibiotic resistance in Aerococcus viridans.
AB  - Resistance to at least one of the following antibiotics was found in eight wild-type strains of Aerococcus viridans: erythromycin (six strains), tetracycline and minocycline (five strains), chloramphenicol (one strain), and high levels of streptomycin (one strain). None of the strains transferred any of their antibiotic resistance markers into streptococcal, enterococcal, or A. viridans recipients by conjugation. By DNA-DNA hybridization experiments, the ermB gene of transposon Tn917, of Enterococcus faecalis origin, was detected in five of the six strains resistant to erythromycin and was localized for one strain on the chromosome and for four strains on nonconjugative small (4.7- to 4.9-kilobase) plasmids. The tetM gene of the conjugative transposon Tn916, of E. faecalis origin, was localized on the chromosome of four of the five strains resistant to tetracycline and minocycline; in three of these strains a structure similar to that of Tn916 was found. Homology to the tetO gene of pUA466, of Campylobacter jejuni origin, was detected on the chromosome of the fifth strain. No sequence homology was detected in any strain with probes corresponding to the tetL gene of group B Streptococcus origin, to the ermA gene of the transposon Tn554 of Staphylococcus aureus origin, or to the cat genes of either pC194 or pC221 of S. aureus origin.
TI  - The enterococci: evidence of species-specific clinical and microbiologic heterogeneity.
AB  - Investigations of the clinical role of enterococci have been limited largely to enterococcal bacteremia and endocarditis and have not distinguished between the various species of enterococci. To characterize the full spectrum of enterococcal disease and to determine whether clinically important differences exist among infections and/or instances of colonization (infections/colonizations) by the various enterococcal species, cases of enterococcal infection/colonization diagnosed at the Dallas Veterans Administration Medical Center (DVAMC) in 1986 were reviewed. During this period, 220 Enterococcus faecalis, 21 Enterococcus faecium, 12 Enterococcus avium, and no Enterococcus durans isolates were identified in clinical specimens (other than stool) submitted to the DVAMC microbiology laboratory. Clinical characteristics of cases of infection/colonization by the three species of enterococci were similar and did not vary significantly when blood stream invasion occurred. Nevertheless, mortality data and therapeutic response rates suggested differences in virulence of the three enterococcal species. Enterococcal infections/colonizations (including bacteremia) frequently were polymicrobial. Although Enterobacteriaceae were the most common copathogens identified overall, Staphylococcus aureus was the most common copathogen in bloodstream infections. E. avium was more resistant than E. faecalis or E. faecium to penicillin G and ampicillin and less resistant to most other antimicrobial agents. The results of this investigation suggest that enterococci are a heterogeneous group of bacteria that should not be treated as a single entity in clinical investigations.
TI  - [Reactivity of human lymphocytes to yeast-like and mold fungi].
AB  - The capacity of the allergens of mold fungi (Rhizopus nigricans, Mucor pusillus,  Alternaria tenuis, Cladosporum herbarum, Fusarium oxysporum) and yeast-like fungi (Candida albicans) to induce the production of lymphokins by human lymphocytes was studied. All these preparations were active in reactions with lymphocytes obtained from adult donors, but did not activate lymphocytes of newborns (obtained from umbilical blood). In equal doses (10 micrograms/ml) C. albicans allergen was more active than the preparations of mold fungi. The capacity of bacterial allergens to stimulate human lymphocytes was found to be either more pronounced (in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes) than that of the preparation of C. albicans or equal to it (in Streptococcus faecalis). The results thus obtained may be regarded as the manifestation of immunological contacts with the antigens of different microorganisms, as well as the evidence of the immunological nature of lymphocytic reactions to preparations intended for use in clinical allergology.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of sulbactam/ampicillin in the pediatric field].
AB  - The usefulness of sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) in the treatment of pediatric infections was evaluated. 1. Twenty pediatric patients with infection were treated with SBT/ABPC and an intravenous dosage of 27.8-47.4 mg/kg, 3 to 4 times a day. Clinical efficacies in 18 patients excluding 2 patients of Mycoplasma pneumonia (9 cases of pneumonia, 6 urinary tract infection, 1 tonsillitis, 1 maxillary sinusitis and 1 osteomyelitis) were judged to be excellent in 13 patients and good in 5. There was no case of failure. 2. Bacteriological efficacies against 16 strains (1 Staphylococcus aureus, 3 Enterococcus faecalis, 4 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 5 Escherichia coli and 1 Serratia sp.) isolated from 13 of the 18 patients were rated as "eradicated" for 13 strains, "decreased" for 1 and "unchanged" for 2 with an eradication rate of 81.3%. Of 13 strains eradicated, 3 were those with high beta-lactamase productivity. 3. Rash as a side effect developed in 1 patient and eosinophilia and elevated GOT and GPT were observed in 7 patients but none of them were serious. 4. Blood levels of the drug following an intravenous dose of 30 mg/kg were determined in 2 pediatric patients. Blood levels of SBT and ABPC at 30 minutes after intravenous administration were 19.0 and 29.2 micrograms/ml in one patient and 21.0 and 31.6 micrograms/ml in another, respectively, and those at 4 hours were 0.48 and 0.62 microgram/ml in one patient and 0.59 and 0.89 microgram/ml in another, respectively. The half-lives of SBT were 0.67 and 0.70 hour and those of ABPC were 0.64 and 0.69 hour in the 2 patients, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical experience of chemotherapy with cefmetazole for severe infections accompanying malignant hematological disorders].
AB  - We made an attempt to treat with cefmetazole (CMZ) 25 patients who developed severe infectious diseases while suffering with granulocytopenia associated with the treatment of malignant hematological disorders. 1. Determination of bacteriological efficacy While 20 strains were isolated and identified from 15 patients, no significant bacteria were detected in 9 patients. Isolates obtained were: 5 strains of Enterococcus faecalis, 3 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 2 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 strains of Klebsiella oxytoca, 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and 1 strain each of Neisseria sp., Pseudomonas maltophilia, Enterobacter sp., alpha-Streptococcus, beta-Streptococcus and Gram-positive cocci. Causative organisms were eradicated or markedly in 7 of the 15 patients from whom bacteria were isolated. Clinical findings, including fever, revealed that none of the patients, in whom bacteriological efficacy was determined to be poor, exhibited sufficient clinical response. E. faecalis was isolated from 4 of 6 patients bacteriologically determined to have no response. 2. As for 23 patients, who were found to be evaluable among the 25 patients, 8 (34.8%), 4 (17.4%), 4 (17.4%), and 7 (30.4%) demonstrated excellent, good, fair and poor responses, respectively, showing a 69.6% efficacy rate which indicates a sum of percentages of patients with excellent, good and fair responses. 3. While an efficacy rate of 100% was obtained for 3 patients with number of peripheral neutrophils less than 500/mm3 before the beginning of CMZ administration, only an efficacy rate of 66.7% was obtained for 15 patients with neutrophils more than 500/mm3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo activity of cefpirome (HR 810) against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - With cefpirome (HR 810) the MICs for both methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and for Streptococcus faecalis were 8.0 mg/l. At 4 x MIC, cefpirome killed MRSA as rapidly as did vancomycin while for enterococci, cefpirome, vancomycin or ampicillin alone were not bactericidal. However, all agents were bactericidal when combined with 2 mg/l of gentamicin, although gentamicin combined with cefpirome showed a smaller decrease in cfu/ml than the combination with ampicillin or vancomycin. A mouse thigh infection model was developed in which the thigh muscle was infected with bacteria and either no therapy or concurrent antibiotic therapy was initiated. On the subsequent day, the entire thigh muscle was quantitatively cultured. In this model, the numbers of enterococci at the infection site at 24 h were reduced by 2.1 logs with no treatment, 2.6 with cefpirome (25 mg/kg/day), 2.8 with ampicillin (150 mg/kg/day), and 2.7 with vancomycin (25 mg/kg/day). For MRSA the reductions were 1.1 logs with no therapy, 2.8 with vancomycin, and 3.0 with cefpirome. The apparent enhanced in-vivo activity of cefpirome for MRSA argues for further evaluation of this antibiotic for treatment of MRSA and other Gram-positive cocci, including enterococci.
TI  - Modification of homogeneous resistance in a methicillin-resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus by acquisition of a beta-lactamase encoding plasmid.
AB  - Nearly all clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are heterogeneously resistant and produce beta-lactamases which generally are plasmid mediated. In order to study the role of beta-lactamase plasmids in the expression of methicillin resistance, a beta-lactamase plasmid from Enterococcus faecalis HH22 (pBEM10) was transferred into a homogeneously resistant, beta-lactamase-negative strain of MRSA (MUSC284). By single disc diffusion testing at 42 degrees C, beta-lactamase producing transconjugants (SA-MM1) were found to be more susceptible than the parent strain to methicillin, imipenem, SCH 34343 and cloxacillin, but more resistant to piperacillin. The heterogeneity observed in transconjugants was not affected by the addition of clavulanic acid, indicating that beta-lactamase itself was not responsible for this effect. By population analysis over 50% of MUSC284 colonies and less than 1% of SA-MM1 colonies remained viable after incubation at 42 degrees C in agar plates containing 25 mg/l of cloxacillin. Cured derivatives of SA-MM1 reverted to homogeneous resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics as observed in the initial parenteral strain MUSC284. Thus, the introduction of a beta-lactamase coding plasmid into a homogeneously resistant MRSA yielded transconjugants which resembled heterogeneously resistant strains of MRSA. These results suggest that regulatory genes, capable of altering the expression of methicillin resistance, may be located on beta-lactamase plasmids commonly found in these organisms.
TI  - Intra-abdominal sepsis after hepatic resection.
AB  - One hundred and thirty hepatic resections performed over an 8-year period were reviewed for evidence of postoperative intra-abdominal sepsis. Of 126 patients who survived for more than 24 hours after operation, 36 developed culture positive intra-abdominal collections (28.6%). Significant independent variables associated with the development of intra-abdominal sepsis were diagnoses of trauma or cholangiocarcinoma, and the need for reoperation to control hemorrhage during the postoperative period. Before 1984, infected fluid collections were treated predominantly by operative drainage, but this has largely been replaced by percutaneous methods, which have proven effective in most cases. Eighteen (50%) of the infections were caused by a mixed bacterial culture, with Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli being the most common isolates. Six patients with clinical signs of sepsis had a sterile fluid collection drained with complete relief of symptoms. This review suggests that intra-abdominal sepsis is a frequent complication after hepatic resection, and can often be managed successfully by nonoperative percutaneous drainage.
TI  - Susceptibility and bactericidal activity studies of four beta-lactamase-producing enterococci.
AB  - beta-Lactamase-producing (Bla+) enterococci are rare but have been reported from  several areas. We report another Bla+ enterococcus with high-level gentamicin resistance. Susceptibility and bactericidal activity studies of four Bla+ enterococci against potential alternative antibiotics, including ampicillin-sulbactam, daptomycin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin, are presented.
TI  - New approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of infective endocarditis: review of 100 consecutive cases.
AB  - To assess the effect of our new, more aggressive approach to treating infective endocarditis, we retrospectively reviewed our recent experience with this disease. Between 1983 and 1989, we treated 100 patients with endocarditis, in 94 of whom the diagnosis was confirmed. Fifty-four (57%) of the 94 patients had native valve endocarditis, and the other 40 patients (43%) had prosthetic valve endocarditis. The patients' mean ages were 50 years for native valve disease and 58 years for prosthetic valve disease (p < 0.05). The male-to-female ratio was 4:1. Among the patients with confirmed endocarditis, 87 (93%) had significant underlying risk factors for endocarditis. Upon physical examination of the 94 patients, 16 (17%) were afebrile, 15 (16%) had negative blood cultures, and 26 (28%) had no cardiovascular symptoms or immunologic findings. Echocardiography was of limited value: its sensitivity was 56% for native valve endocarditis and 33% for prosthetic valve endocarditis. The ratio of affected valves was 5 aortic:4 mitral: 1 tricuspid in both forms of the disease. Viridans streptococcus was isolated in 23 (25%) of the confirmed cases, Enterococcus faecalis in 17 (18%), Staphylococcus aureus in 13 (14%), and coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 14 (15%). Gram-negative, anaerobic, and fungal organisms accounted for only 13 (14%) of the confirmed cases. The mean duration of intravenous therapy was 29 days. Twenty (37%) of the native valve patients and 16 (40%) of the prosthetic valve patients received antibiotics on an outpatient basis. Vancomycin was used in 44 (47%) of the cases, nafcillin or ampicillin in 40 (44%), and other beta-lactam agents in 9 (10%). The mean hospital stay was significantly longer for prosthetic valve endocarditis patients than for those with native valve disease (29 versus 23 days; p < 0.01). Cardiac catheterization was performed in 9 native valve patients (17%) and 6 prosthetic valve patients (15%). Valve surgery was performed in 33 native valve patients (61%) and 22 prosthetic valve patients (55%). Failure, defined as in-hospital death or recurrent endocarditis, accounted for 14 (28%) of the native valve cases (17% death and 11% relapse) and 8 (20%) of the prosthetic valve cases (10% death and 10% relapse), for an overall failure rate of 24%. The rate of failure was independent of the infecting pathogen or the type of antimicrobial therapy applied. Our experience verified that, in many patients with significant underlying risk factors, the diagnosis of endocarditis may be made on an empiric basis.
TI  - Transferable vancomycin and teicoplanin resistance in Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Enterococcus faecium BM4165 and BM4178, isolated from immunocompromised patients, one treated with vancomycin, were inducibly resistant to high levels of the glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin but susceptible to the new lipopeptide daptomycin (LY146032). Strain BM4165 was also resistant to macrolidelincosamide-streptogramin B-type (MLS) antibiotics. The genes conferring resistance to glycopeptides and to MLS antibiotics in strain BM4165 were carried on plasmids pIP819 and pIP821, respectively; pIP819 also carried genes that encoded resistance to MLS antibiotics. The two plasmids, which were distinct although related, were self-transferable to other E. faecium strains. Plasmid pIP819 could also conjugate to E. faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, S. pyogenes, S. lactis, and Listeria monocytogenes, in which it conferred inducible glycopeptide resistance, but not to S. aureus. Glycopeptide-inactivating activity was not detected, and the biochemical mechanism of resistance remains unknown. Based on this first report of transferable resistance to glycopeptides, we anticipate dissemination of resistance to these antibiotics in gram-positive cocci and bacilli in which it can be phenotypically expressed.
TI  - Incidence of several pathogens and staphylococcal enterotoxins in Kariesh cheese.
AB  - One hundred samples of Kariesh cheese were randomly collected from Fayoum markets and examined for the incidence of enterococci, coliform organisms, staphylococci, Salmonella and detection of staphylococcal enterotoxins A, B, C, and D. The average total count was 16.4 x 10(7) c.f.u./gm. Coliform bacteria were present in the all the examined, samples with an average of 18.9 x 10(3) c.f.u./gm. However, all samples were free from salmonella. Faecal streptococci and staphylococci were also found in average numbers of (16 x 10(5) c.f.u./gm and 92 x 10(3) c.f.u./gm). Enterotoxins A, B, C and D were not detected in any of the samples tested.
TI  - [In-vitro activity of enoxacin: a multicenter study].
AB  - The in vitro activity of enoxacin was tested in 14 German microbiological centers shortly after the introduction of the drug in Germany. 2748 unselected clinical isolates including 15 bacterial species were analysed using microtiter plates. The MIC90-values were as follows: Staphylococcus aureus 4 mg/l, Enterococcus faecalis 16 mg/l, Enterobacteriaceae 0.5 mg/l, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 8 mg/l. There is good correlation between these results and those of former investigations. It is known that quinolones are only moderately active against enterococci. 8.5% of S. aureus, and 1.4% of Enterobacteriaceae were found to be resistant (MIC greater than 4 mg/l). As to P. aeruginosa, the study revealed that despite a generally low rate of resistance in specific clinical settings, specific problems can arise: in one institution, the MIC90 of P. aeruginosa was 32 mg/l, with a resistance rate of 56.1% (n = 57). In the other centers the MIC90 was 2 mg/l and the resistance rate 5.0% (n = 302). In the first center, many of the isolates were from paraplegic patients or patients with cystic fibrosis pretreated with quinolones. This study will be repeated in two years' time in order to determine an eventual change in resistance.
TI  - Partial nucleotide sequence of the pts operon in Salmonella typhimurium: comparative analyses in five bacterial genera.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a Salmonella typhimurium DNA segment of 549 base pairs which encompasses the operator-promoter of the pts operon, the entirety of the ptsH gene, encoding HPr of the phosphotransferase system (PTS), the first 29 nucleotides of the ptsI gene, encoding Enzyme I of the PTS, and the intercistronic region between the ptsH and ptsI genes was determined and compared with the corresponding sequence from Escherichia coli (De Reuse et al., 1985). The two sequences showed 91% overall identity, with some regions showing sequence conservation and others exhibiting relative divergence. Two open reading frames were identified in both species: one encoded HPr on the 'sense' strand (255 nucleotides; 12 nucleotide differences, no amino acid differences); the other, on the anti-sense strand, consisted of 291 nucleotides (13 nucleotide differences, 13 amino acid differences). While HPr bears a net negative charge, the putative protein encoded by the open reading frame on the anti-sense strand is strongly basic. Computer analyses of HPr proteins from five different bacterial genera revealed four regions which show strong sequence identity and therefore are presumed to be critical for maintenance of biological activity. Two of these regions were specific to Gram-positive bacteria. Proposed functions for each of these regions are discussed. Relative evolutionary distances between the HPr proteins were also computed.
TI  - Phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system of Bacillus subtilis: nucleotide sequence of ptsX, ptsH and the 5'-end of ptsI and evidence for a ptsHI operon.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 1689bp fragment of the Bacillus subtilis locus containing ptsX (a crr-like gene), ptsH (coding for HPr), and the 5'-end of ptsI (coding for Enzyme I) was determined. The deduced amino acid sequences of ptsH and the N-terminal part of ptsI were compared to those of Streptococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. Transcription fusion demonstrated that ptsHI constitutes an operon. An open reading frame overlapping the main part of ptsH in the opposite sense was shown to be expressed in vivo, using protein fusions with beta-galactosidase. The deduced amino acid sequence of ptsX showed significant homology with that of Salmonella typhimurium glucose-specific Enzyme III. ptsX was preceded by an open reading frame whose amino acid sequence showed strong homology with the C-terminal part of E. coli Enzyme IIGlc.
TI  - Ofloxacin susceptibility testing quality control parameters for microdilution and disk diffusion, and confirmation of disk diffusion interpretive criteria.
AB  - The susceptibilities of 221 clinical isolates to ofloxacin were tested simultaneously by broth microdilution and disk diffusion methods with commercially prepared 5-micrograms ofloxacin disks. The acceptability of the following previously proposed zone diameter breakpoints was confirmed: greater than or equal to 16 mm, susceptible; 13 to 15 mm, intermediate; less than or equal to 12 mm, resistant. On the basis of a multilaboratory collaborative study, the following are proposed as acceptable ofloxacin MIC ranges for quality control organisms: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 0.03 to 0.06 micrograms/ml; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, 0.12 to 0.5 micrograms/ml; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, 1.0 to 4.0 micrograms/ml. Ofloxacin quality control zone diameter ranges for the disk diffusion test are tentatively proposed, but variations in the performance of different lots of Mueller-Hinton agar may prove to be a serious problem for users.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. It displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (CFIX), cefaclor (CCL) or cephalexin (CEX) against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci including Staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the Streptococcus group. Moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, FK482 had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of CFIX but superior to that of CCL or CEX. However, it was clearly inferior to CFIX in activity against Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strains of S. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to FK482. All tested strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to CCL and CEX were susceptible to FK482, as were all the strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (AMPC). FK482, like CFIX, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except Bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of CCL or CEX. The antibacterial activity of FK482 against CSH2 strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. FK482 showed higher affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (3, 2 and 1) of S. aureus than did CFIX, CCL and CEX. FK482 also showed very high affinity for the PBPs (2 and 3) of E. faecalis and PBPs (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of E. coli. The bactericidal activity of FK482 against S. aureus was almost as strong as that of AMPC and superior to that of CCL or CEX. Against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis, FK482 was similar to CFIX and superior to CCL and CEX in bactericidal activity.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The therapeutic activities of orally administered FK482 were compared with those  of reference antibiotics against systemic and local infections with a variety of bacteria in mice and rabbits. In systemic infections in mice, oral FK482 was almost as effective as oral cefaclor (CCL) and more effective than oral cephalexin (CEX) against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis infections. However, FK482 afforded superior protective activity when given subcutaneously against E. coli infection in mice, and this activity was more potent than that of subcutaneously given CCL. In comparison with CCL, the reason that the in vivo activity of orally given FK482 against mouse systemic infections was weaker than had been anticipated from its potent in vitro activity was due to its poor oral absorption in mice. In local infections in rabbits, a species in which FK482 was better absorbed than in mice, FK482 was more effective than CCL, CEX or amoxicillin (AMPC). Against pneumonia induced by S. aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, FK482 was as effective as AMPC and more effective than CCL in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs of infected rabbits. In the oral treatment of experimental ascending pyelonephritis in rabbits, FK482 was superior to CCL and AMPC against methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection, as effective as AMPC and more effective than CCL against Enterococcus faecalis infection, and as effective as cefixime (CFIX) and more effective than CCL and AMPC against E. coli infection in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the kidneys and urine.
TI  - In vitro activity of FCE 22101, imipenem, and ceftazidime against over 6,000 bacterial isolates and MIC quality control limits of FCE 22101.
AB  - Six geographically separate laboratories within the USA tested 6,198 bacterial isolates against FCE 22101 (a penem), imipenem (a carbapenem) and ceftazidime (a third-generation cephalosporin). Ninety-three percent of 2,749 Enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by FCE 22101, while 95% were susceptible to ceftazidime and 99% were susceptible to imipenem. FCE 22101 had little activity against Pseudomonas spp. but was active against most gram-positive pathogens, including enterococci. FCE 22101 MICs for standard quality control strains were defined as 0.5-2.0 micrograms/ml for Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 2-8 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and 0.06-0.25 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance and production of inhibitory substances among bacterial strains isolated from the oral cavities of BALB/c mice.
AB  - In the oral cavities of BALB/c mice, microbial population levels are regulated by multifactorial processes. Factors include the production of inhibitory substances and the exchange of genetic material. In this work, 371 isolates from different sites (saliva, tongue, teeth, and mucosa) of the oral cavities of BALB/c mice were screened for resistance to antibiotics and antimicrobial activity. Antibiotic-resistant strains represented 25% of the total flora. Among the predominant species, all the S. faecalis isolates showed multiresistance, and 23% of the Lactobacillus murinus isolates and 15% of the Staphylococcus aureus were resistant to at least one antibiotic. Resistance to aminoglycosides (neomycin, streptomycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin) was most frequently encountered. In S. faecalis, high levels of resistance were recorded to neomycin and streptomycin but not to gentamicin or kanamycin. Macrolides (M), lincosamides (L), streptogramin B (S), tetracycline (Tc), and chloramphenicol (Cm) resistance was also present in multiresistance patterns, especially among S. faecalis isolates. Hemolytic (Hly+) streptococci were less resistant to MLS, Tc, and Cm than were non-hemolytic (Hly-) isolates. Resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics was detected only among staphylococci and with a low prevalence (4%). The frequencies of strains producing antimicrobial substances against the indicator strains (S. mutans LG-1, S. sanguis Ny 101, and A. viscosus Ny 1) were high for L. murinus (76%) and S. faecalis (57% for Hly- and 90% for Hly+), but low for S. aureus (7%). These results indicate that the indigenous oral flora could interfere with colonization by allochthonous micro-organisms and that resistance patterns should be taken into account for the elimination of the oral indigenous flora by antibiotic treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Turbidimetric response of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis to daptomycin.
AB  - The response to daptomycin of three strains of Staphylococcus aureus (one of which was methicillin-resistant) and a strain of Enterococcus faecalis was investigated by continuous turbidimetric monitoring. Daptomycin caused partial inhibition of bacterial growth at concentrations well below those suppressing growth overnight. The activity of the drug was more than 200-fold greater in the presence of a physiological concentration of calcium (2.5 mmol/l) than in its absence. Variants present in cultures inhibited by daptomycin were shown to exhibit decreased susceptibility to the drug and the susceptibility declined further on repeat exposure; however, there was a slow but incomplete reversion to susceptibility on sequential subculture in drug-free broth. Resistance was difficult to induce when the concentration of calcium in the broth exceeded 2.5 mmol/l.
TI  - [Evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in neonatal infections].
AB  - Ten patients with infections (8 neonates and 2 infants) were treated with 10.2 mg/10.2 mg/kg-37.7 mg/37.7 mg/kg of imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) b.i.d. or t.i.d. by a 1-hour intravenous drip infusion. The plasma concentrations of IPM/CS were determined in 5 of the 10 patients and in the cerebrospinal fluid of 1 patient of the 5. 1. The patients studied included 5 with pneumonia and 1 each with urinary tract infection, omphalitis, suspected meningitis, periproctal abscess and suspected septicemia. Clinical efficacy was evaluated in 9 patients: the patient with suspected meningitis was excluded from the clinical evaluation because the infection was doubtfully due to bacteria. Responses were excellent in 4 and good in 5 patients. No patient with a poor response was observed. All of the 6 etiological isolates obtained from 5 patients (2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 1 each of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Bacteroides fragilis) were eradicated. 2. As for side effects, rash was observed in 1 patient and petechiae accompanied by decreases in platelets and reticulocytes and increases in GOT and GPT were observed in another. Other abnormal laboratory test values in addition to the above abnormalities consisted of an increase in GPT in 1 patient and increases in GOT and GPT in another. These side effects and abnormalities in laboratory test values were mild and normalized after discontinuation or completion of IPM/CS administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Survival of some non-starter bacteria in naturally ripened and enzyme-accelerated Cheddar cheese.
AB  - Effects of the addition of a proteinase (Neutrase 1-5S) and a peptidase (aminopeptidase DP-102) as agents for accelerating the ripening of Cheddar cheese on the survival of some non-starter bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and a Salmonella sp.) were studied throughout a 4-month ripening period. The enzymes were found to have no significant effect on the survival of the Gram-positive bacteria but some significant effects were observed, at some stages of the ripening period, with the Gram-negative bacteria in that lower levels were recovered from cheeses treated with the enzyme system.
TI  - A further insight into the mechanism of action of anthracycline antibiotics.
AB  - The uptake of Adriamycin (ADM) by eucaryotic and procaryotic cells and the interaction of the antibiotic with structurally organized DNA were investigated. The aim of this work was to understand why ADM is endowed with very low antibiotic activity in spite of being highly cytotoxic for mammalian cells, and to get a further insight into the mechanism of action of this compound. Spectrophotometric, fluorometric, chiroptical, and electron microscopic techniques were used. The drug was shown to concentrate in mammalian cells but failed to do so in bacteria and penetrated rather poorly in Candida albicans. The chromatin binding affinity of ADM appeared to be substantially reduced with respect to the affinity for free DNA. Complex stereochemistry was also influenced by the presence of nucleosomal arrangements in the polynucleotide. In addition, evidence was obtained that the antibiotic tended to accumulate at specific (linker) chromatin regions and to cause extensive compaction of organized DNA. The observed phenomena may play a relevant role in the mode of drug action in eucaryotic cells and help to explain the lack of antibacterial activity by ADM in spite of the apparent attainment of great enough intracellular levels to affect DNA template function.
TI  - Laboratory evaluation of disposable and reusable disinfectant cloths for cleaning food contact surfaces.
AB  - A comparison of five methods of cleaning Formica surfaces contaminated with bacteria dried in milk has been carried out. A standardized procedure was developed, and impression plates were found to be at least as sensitive as a swab-rinse method for detecting bacteria on the surfaces. The most satisfactory results were obtained with one type of disposable alcohol-impregnated wipe and with a detergent/hypochlorite solution applied with paper. A reusable cloth impregnated with disinfectant initially performed well against all test organisms, but was less reliable against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis, after the cloth had been used and rinsed several times. The importance of introducing methods to reduce the high risk of cross-contamination presently associated with the use of wiping cloths in catering premises is stressed.
TI  - An in vitro evaluation of HRE 664, a novel penem antibiotic.
AB  - HRE 664 is a novel parenteral penem with a broad antimicrobial spectrum. In this  study, HRE 664 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml, oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci at less than or equal to 0.13 microgram/ml, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, enterococci at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, and streptococci at less than or equal to 0.13 microgram/ml. All strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant (MICs were greater than 32 micrograms/ml). HRE 664 exhibited a minimal inoculum effect and good bactericidal activity with all organisms tested except an oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. With the latter, there was a marked inoculum effect and no on-scale bactericidal endpoints. No measurable hydrolysis of HRE 664 occurred with any of the five Gram-negative bacterial beta-lactamases tested. When stored at -20 degrees C, HRE 664 showed no significant loss of activity for up to 6 wk, but detectable deterioration occurred thereafter. At -60 degrees C, no loss in HRE 664 potency was observed for up to 12 wk. Proposed HRE 664 MIC quality control parameters are: 0.03-0.13 microgram/ml for S. aureus ATCC 29213, 0.25-1.0 micrograms/ml for Escherichia coli 25922, and 2.0-8.0 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212.
TI  - Structural relationships between senfolomycins and paulomycins.
AB  - Senfolomycins A and B (Antimicrob. Agents Chemother.-1965: 828-831, 1966) are two antibacterial agents with physico-chemical and biological properties similar to those of paulomycin. Recent studies indicate that senfolomycin A (C29H36N2O16S, MW 700) has molecular composition and fast atom bombardment MS fragmentation pattern identical to those of paulomycin E. Extensive NMR work indicates that the two antibiotics, which have been separated by HPLC and TLC, differ only in the stereochemistry of the OCH3 group present in their respective sugar moieties. Indirect evident suggests that senfolomycin B is dihydrosenfolomycin A (C29H38N2O16S, MW 702) and in this respect it is related to paulomycin F. The proposed structures for senfolomycins A and B are discussed.
TI  - Development of resistance to nalidixic acid and the fluoroquinolones after the introduction of norfloxacin and ofloxacin.
AB  - Since 1975, the group Resistenz of the Paul-Ehrlich-Gesellschaft fur Chemotherapie has monitored the development of resistance in isolates of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis in the Federal Republic of Germany, West Berlin, Austria, and Switzerland. Despite a marked increase in the use of 4-quinolones, there was no increase in the percentages of nalidixic acid-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae between 1975 and 1986. However, different bacterial species showed considerable variation, and there were also considerable differences in the percentages of nalidixic acid-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae from different centers. The frequency of resistance to fluoroquinolones was unchanged from 1983 to 1986 and was less than 4% in all species except P. aeruginosa. In this species, there was an increase from about 3 to 10% from 1983 to 1986 for strains for which the MIC was fourfold above the mode MIC of ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, and ofloxacin.
TI  - Antimicrobial and anticancer activity of tetrahedral, chelated, diphosphine silver(I) complexes: comparison with copper and gold.
AB  - Tetrahedral, bischelated Ag(I) diphosphine complexes [Ag(P-P)2]NO3, where P-P is  Ph2P(CH2)2PPh2 (dppe), Et2P(CH2)2PPh2 (depe), and cis-Ph2P(CH = CH)PPh2 (dppey), are potently cytotoxic to B16 melanoma cells in vitro (IC50 4 microM) and exhibit good activity against ip P388 leukemia in mice. The complex [Ag(dppe)2]NO3 is active against M5076 reticulum cell sarcoma. The antibacterial and antifungal activities of Ag(I) diphosphine and related Cu(I) and Au(I) complexes were assessed. The complexes [Au(dppey)2]Cl, [Au(dppp)2]Cl and (CuCl)2(dppe)3 show modest activity against three of the 12 bacterial strains tested, but all complexes exhibit antifungal activity against three strains of C. albicans in a "defined" medium, [Ag(depe)2]NO3 and [Au(dppp)2]Cl having comparable activity to fungizone. Antifungal activity of the complexes is reduced in Sabouraud's broth medium, and lost altogether for the Ag(I) complexes. Reactions of some of the Ag(I) complexes with glutathione and blood plasma were studied by 31P NMR.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin in combination with metronidazole.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin has a reduced activity against anaerobic pathogens. Therefore, a combination of ciprofloxacin with an antimicrobial agent active against anaerobes, such as metronidazole, seems to be interesting for the treatment of mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections. High metronidazole concentrations (10 mg/l or 40 mg/l) neither affected the bactericidal efficacy of ciprofloxacin on aerobic pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis, nor on the anaerobic pathogens Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile, as demonstrated by kill-kinetic curves. The same high concentrations, as well as lower therapeutically achievable concentration (2 mg/l or 5 mg/l) of metronidazole in combination with ciprofloxacin were slightly more potent for the tested clostridia than ciprofloxacin or metronidazole alone.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of a new 3-azinomethyl-rifamycin.
AB  - The new 3-azinomethyl-rifamycin, SPA-S-565, was shown to exert an effective antibacterial activity in vitro comparable to that of rifampicin. In fact, the antibacterial activity of SPA-S-565 against numerous Gram-positive cocci belonging to Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species as well as against 20 strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, was similar to that of rifampicin. In Swiss albino mice intraperitoneally infected with Staphylococcus aureus Oxford strain or Streptococcus pyogenes, the protective activity of SPA-S-565 and rifampicin was quite remarkable, and no significant difference was noted between the two antibiotics. In M. tuberculosis-infected mice treated with the antibacterial agents every seven days, the protection exerted by SPA-S-565 was significantly greater than that exerted by rifampicin.
TI  - Synergy between spiramycin and metronidazole in the treatment of polymicrobial infections.
AB  - The in-vitro and in-vivo activity of metronidazole and spiramycin, singly or in combination, was tested in the eradication of infection caused by Bacteroides spp. alone and in combination with Neisseria gonorrhoea, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes or Str. faecalis. The in-vitro tests consisted of determinations of the MICs with or without the addition of a constant amount of the other antimicrobials. The MICs of metronidazole for B. melaninogenicus, B. fragilis and B. bivius were significantly reduced by the addition of 0.125 mg/l spiramycin. The in-vivo tests were carried out in mice and consisted of measurements of the effects of the antimicrobial agents on the bacterial contents of abscesses induced by subcutaneous injection of bacterial suspension. Combined therapy of mixed infections showed further significant reduction of the numbers of Bacteroides spp. in seven of 12 combinations and of the aerobic and facultative bacteria in four of 12 combinations. Furthermore, a reduction in the number of facultative anaerobes was noted in mixed infections with Bacteroides spp. which were treated with metronidazole alone. The synergy in vitro and in vivo between metronidazole and spiramycin may have important clinical implications in the treatment of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infections.
TI  - Suitability of a propanolic PVP-iodophor preparation as preoperative skin disinfectant: germicidal activity and chemical stability.
AB  - The preparation Solutio Betadini propanolica 3% w/w, used as a pre-operative skin disinfectant was examined for its germicidal activity and its chemical stability. The additive activity of iodine and propanol resulted in a wide range of antimicrobial activity against bacteria, including bacterial spores, and fungi, with a rapid onset and sustained duration of action. The solution is easily manufactured and analyzed, its stability is guaranteed for 6 months. Because of its staining property, there is no need of coloured additives to mark the disinfected area. In addition, no skin irritations by the disinfectant were observed so far. Thus, the preparation fulfills the essential requirements for preoperative skin disinfectants and is suitable for the preparation and the compounding in hospital pharmacies.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach in estimating the effective dosage of cefamandole].
AB  - Reliability of the cefamandole (CMD) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 246 strains with Showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of CMD). Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the CMD disc tests, which is normally used in Japan, was also evaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of a proper dose of administration. The results obtained with the disc method were compared with MICs determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. The results of the CMD disc susceptibility test were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of MICs. Break points in MIC values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are () MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. Only 4 (1.6%) out the 246 strains tested showed false positive results and 11 (4.5%) showed false negative results, showing the excellent reliability of this test. In this study, approximately 90% of strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis isolated from clinical materials randomly were inhibited by CMD at concentrations less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes were sensitive to CMD at 67 and 69% of strains, respectively, at concentrations below 6.25 micrograms/ml. CMD was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Enterococcus faecalis. About 90% of Staphylococcus aureus were inhibited at dose levels smaller than 6.25 micrograms/ml and 70% of the strains at levels less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. Susceptibilities to 15 micrograms/ml CMD of highly methicillin-resistant strains (MIC greater than 30 micrograms/ml) of S. aureus were examined. Ten of 12 strains examined were found susceptible to CMD, but only 6 of the 12 to cefmetazole. Imipenem/cilastatin was effective to 5 of the 12 strains at levels lower than 3 micrograms/ml and to one at a level less than 15 micrograms/ml. Minocycline was effective against 11 strains at concentrations below 2 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of cefpirome in combination with 4 aminoglycosides and 2 fluoroquinolones].
AB  - Combinations of cefpirome with aminoglycosides (gentamicin, tobramycin, netilmicin, amikacin) and of cefpirome with fluorinated quinolones (pefloxacin, ofloxacin) were tested against 20 Enterobacteriaceae, 6 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6 Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, 6 group D Streptococci and 6 Staphylococcus aureus strains, susceptible, intermediate or resistant with a low level to these different compounds. Activity of combinations was evaluated using a broth microdilution checkerboard method and FIC indices determination. Combinations of cefpirome with aminoglycosides demonstrated a synergistic effect in 79.5% of cases, but a strong synergy (FIC less than or equal to 0.62) was observed in only 46% of cases. The higher rate of strong synergy concerned Enterobacteriaceae (50% of cases) and group D Streptococci (58.3%). Combination of cefpirome with gentamicin was the most active against Enterobacteriaceae and with a lower degree against P. aeruginosa, A. calcoaceticus and S. aureus. Combination of cefpirome with netilmicin was the best association against group D Streptococci. Combinations of cefpirome with fluorinated quinolones demonstrated frequently and additive (40.9%) or indifferent (36.3%) effect. When a synergistic effect was proved, it was always weak (FIC = 0.75). Combinations of two fluorinated quinolones with cefpirome gave similar results. No combination was antagonist. This study is a primary estimation of activity of cefpirome combined with other agents. It will be necessary to confirm these results against strains resistant with high level, especially against cefpirome, strains not discovered in clinical isolates at present.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new fluorinated 4-quinolone, T-3262 (A-60969).
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new quinolone, T-3262 [A-60969; DL-7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1-, 4-dihydro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid monohydrate], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, ceftazidime, imipenem, and gentamicin. T-3262 inhibited 90% of isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. It was two to four times more active than ofloxacin and similarly or slightly less active than ciprofloxacin. Ninety percent of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited at 0.5 micrograms/ml. It was 4- to 8-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 8- to 16-fold more active than ofloxacin against Pseudomonas cepacia and Pseudomonas maltophilia, which were resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. Most Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml. The MIC for 90% of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, was 0.12 micrograms/ml; that for Staphylococcus epidermidis was 0.5 micrograms/ml, as was that for Enterococcus faecalis. It inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis isolates at 2 micrograms/ml, considerably more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. The frequency of spontaneous point mutational resistance was less than 10(-10) for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. Resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculture. Similar to other quinolones, its activity could be affected by culture conditions. T-3262 showed a postantibiotic suppressive effect on Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus.
TI  - [Demonstration of an inoculum effect on the estimation of the minimal inhibitory  concentration of LY 146032].
AB  - This work has been performed to study the inoculum effect on the in vitro activity of LY 146032, a new lipopeptide antibiotic. A statistical analysis (X2 and t test) of the data concerning the MIC of different bacterial groups has been carried out to appreciate the phenomenon. The activity of vancomycin has been compared. A major inoculum effect has been detected for LY 146032. It must be taken into account to evaluate the activity of this new antibiotic.
TI  - Resistance patterns of important gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci are among the most important Gram-positive organisms responsible for serious infections in hospitals as well as in the community. We report here the resistance patterns encountered in these species at St Joseph and Broussais Hospitals in Paris.
TI  - Microbial spoilage of pre-cooked potato-topped pies.
AB  - The ecological succession of bacteria which developed in pre-cooked potato-topped pies stored at two different temperatures was examined. Bacillus, Streptococcus and Staphylococcus-Micrococcus spp. were the predominant organisms isolated from freshly prepared pies and those stored at 4 degrees and 37 degrees C. None of these groups of bacteria caused significant biodeterioration of pies held at 4 degrees C, but all groups grew well in pies stored at 37 degrees C and achieved counts of ca 10(8)/g of sample. Bacillus spp. were the first group to grow, followed by Streptococcus and Staphylococcus-Micrococcus spp. Growth which occurred at 37 degrees C did so at the expense of glucose, lactate accumulated and the pH of pie components decreased. Amylase activity detected in all pie components during storage was associated with the growth of Bacillus spp. and probably supplemented glucose already present in pies, by hydrolytic cleavage of potato, flour or binder starches. Spoilage caused by growth and activity of the bacteria isolated was not associated with visual signs of biodeterioration, nor production of 'off' odour usually associated with spoilage of meats. These results suggest that pre-cooked potato-topped pies held at inappropriate temperatures represent a potential public health risk.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin.
AB  - We have studied the in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin against 1,006 clinical isolates comprising streptococci, staphylococci, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae and anaerobes. In-vitro studies show pristinamycin to inhibit staphylococci and streptococci, including erythromycin highly-resistant organisms, at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. Although pristinamycin's mean MIC for streptococci is higher than that of erythromycin, pristinamycin is bactericidal, whereas erythromycin is bacteristatic against Streptococcus agalactiae and oral streptococci. Enterococci were less uniformly susceptible to pristinamycin: 58 of the 94 Enterococcus faecalis tested were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 3.12 mg/l). 14 of the 15 isolates of Enterococcus faecium were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.56 mg/l pristinamycin. Pristinamycin showed poor activity against Haemophilus influenzae (mode MIC 1.56 and MIC90 of 3.12 mg/l) but all except two of the 100 Neisseria gonorrhoeae tested were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l pristinamycin. Pristinamycin inhibited all nine Clostridium spp. at less than or equal to 0.39 mg/l and 38 of 40 strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci at less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. It was less effective against the Bacteroides fragilis group: (MIC90 3.12 mg/l). Pristinamycin had poor bactericidal activity against the anaerobes tested.

TI  - Comparison of 1% silver sulfadiazine with and without 1% chlorhexidine digluconate for topical antibacterial effect in the burnt infected rat.
AB  - The addition of 1% chlorhexidine digluconate to 1% silver sulfadiazine cream (CDSS) was compared with 1% silver sulfadiazine (SS) alone to assess the antibacterial effect of a once-daily application of the therapies on an experimental rat model with a 20% full-thickness burn wound seeded with 10(8) microorganisms originally isolated from infected wounds of burn patients. Separate series evaluated Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Streptococcus faecalis. The mean concentration of all four organisms recovered after one week from biopsy specimens of full-thickness eschar was less in the CDSS-treated animals compared with the SS-treated animals. Microbial invasion into subjacent muscle was less frequent in animals seeded with S faecalis, while the mean concentration of bacteria recovered from muscle of animals seeded with S aureus and E cloacae was less in animals treated with CDSS compared with those treated with SS (P less than 0.05). The addition of 1% chlorhexidine digluconate to 1% silver sulfadiazine increased the antibacterial effectiveness of the latter agent.
TI  - Open study of teicoplanin in gram-positive infections.
AB  - Eighteen patients with documented Gram-positive infections which included osteomyelitis, prosthetic infections, endocarditis, skin and soft tissue, and urinary tract infections were treated with teicoplanin. The organisms involved included Staphylococcus aureus (15 isolates of which six were methicillin-resistant-MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis (two), Streptococcus faecalis (one) and Streptococcus milleri (one). Clinical success occurred in all seven patients with skin and soft tissue Streptococcus milleri (one). Clinical success occurred in all seven patients with skin and soft tissue infections (with bacterial persistence in three out of the seven), in three patients with bacteraemia endocarditis, and in one of the three patients with chronic osteomyelitis. In four patients with prosthetic bone and joint infections, clinical improvement followed removal of prostheses. Adverse effects occurred in two patients and these included one patient with a rise in serum aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin and one patient with a rise in blood urea, both of which returned to within normal limits on discontinuing the drug. The study showed that teicoplanin is a safe and effective antistaphylococcal agent.
TI  - Use of a glycopeptide antibiotic, teicoplanin, in the treatment of septicaemia caused by gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Teicoplanin, a recently introduced glycopeptide antibiotic, has been used, in combination with other antibiotics, to treat 31 episodes of septicaemia caused by Gram-positive organisms. Teicoplanin has double the activity of vancomycin against many Gram-positive bacteria, but allergic reactions and toxicity appear to be infrequent. A single daily dose is sufficient to maintain therapeutic levels, which is an advantage in conditions requiring long-term treatment. Of the 31 episodes treated, 16 were associated with infective endocarditis, 11 with Hickman catheter infection, two with bone and joint infection, and two with infection of other indwelling prosthetic devices. Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 18 infections, of which seven treatment courses were unsuccessful. One death occurred from an uncontrolled infection, three deaths from underlying disease (one of which had relapsed twice), and one after withdrawal of treatment following febrile reaction. Eleven episodes were cured. Six episodes of Staphylococcus aureus septicaemia were treated, of which two failed to respond, two relapsed, one improved and one was cured. The remaining seven episodes were caused by streptococci (including Streptococcus faecalis), and in all of them cure was achieved despite the lack of consistent serum bactericidal activity in vitro.
TI  - In vitro selection of bacteria resistant to LY146032, a new cyclic lipopeptide.
AB  - Isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and coagulase-positive and -negative staphylococci were investigated for their abilities, in vitro, to develop resistance to LY146032. Exposure of the organisms to incremental concentrations of LY146032 resulted in MICs 8- to 32-fold higher than those for the original isolates. After three passages on antibiotic-free medium, the high MICs were maintained for the coagulase-negative staphylococci and pneumococci, with a twofold decrease observed for the enterococci and a fourfold decrease observed for Staphylococcus aureus. The frequency of spontaneous emergence of resistance was highest with S. pneumoniae (1.2 X 10(-6) at 16 times the original MIC) and lowest with S. aureus (7.0 X 10(-10) at 8 times the original MIC). For bacteria For bacteria surviving time-kill studies MICs were also higher than were those for the original isolates. Exposure to LY146032 in vitro selected for strains with decreased susceptibilities to the antimicrobial agent. However, the emergence of resistance in vivo is unpredictable and can be evaluated only after prolonged clinical use of the drug.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1985). II. Background of patients].
AB  - We have investigated relationships between patients' backgrounds and isolates from urinary tract infections in reference to various conditions, such as sexes, age distribution by sex, species of causative organisms by sex, age distribution according to species and types of infections, species and infections before and after treatment with antibacterial agents, and species and detected places. As for the relationship between sexes and types of infections, although simple urinary tract infections were consistently found at about 20% in men and at about 80% in women between 1981 and 1983, these infections were seen at 24.4% in men and at 75.6% in women in 1984, and at 26.6% and at 73.4% in 1985, indicating slight decreases in the ratio of women. By contrast, complex urinary tract infections were found in men at about 60-70% from 1981 up to 1985, regardless of the presence or absence of indwelling catheter. There were no noticeable changes according to age during this 5-year period in incidences of infections including simple urinary tract infection and complex urinary tract infection with or without indwelling catheter. Thus, backgrounds of patients with urinary tract infections, including sex, age and simple or complex infections, were fairly consistent throughout this period, while there were relatively large changes in species of isolates. Enterococcus faecalis was isolated at about 8% of both men and women in 1982 and 1983, but its isolation rates were increased to 22.5% of men and 17.9% of women in 1984. In 1985 this species was isolated in 14.9% of men and 7.6% of women, and in 11.2% of all patients. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. were detected at rates of 3.2%, 8.1%, 0.7% and 1.0%, respectively, and 24.2% of isolated strains were Gram-positive organisms. When species of isolates before treatment with antibacterial agents and their isolation rates were analyzed, it was found that the isolation rate of E. faecalis increased dramatically in 1983, and that this tendency was still seen in 1984. The isolation rate of Gram-positive organisms was 25% in 1984 and 24.3% in 1985. Escherichia coli was consistently isolated at about 40%, but, as far as simple urinary tract infections are concerned, its isolation rate decreased by about 10% in 1985, compared to 1982 and 1983. These results suggested that causative organisms for simple urinary tract infections became similar to those for complex urinary tract infections. In other words, isolates obtained from complex urinary tract infections before treatment were similar to those of simple infections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Detection of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria from female patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis].
AB  - A total of 122 bacterial strains isolated from urine specimens of 113 female patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis were used for the study of beta-lactamase production and their susceptibility to various antimicrobial agents was determined. Beta-Lactamase activity was qualitatively determined by a paper strip acidimetric method with benzylpenicillin as substrate and by chromogenic cephalosporin methods using pyridine-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline cephalosporin or nitrocefin as substrate. Susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, including ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, cephalothin, gentamicin, minocycline, fosfomycin, pipemidic acid and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim was examined by a disc method. The beta-lactamase-producing strains detected by at least one of the three tests were found in 18 of 105 Escherichia coli isolates and in the single strain of Enterobacter cloacae dermidis, 3 Enterococcus faecalis and 1 Staphylococcus aureus produced beta-lactamase. The isolation rate of strains resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin and cephalothin in the beta-lactamase-producing strains was significantly higher than that in the non-beta-lactamase-producing strains (p less than 0.01). These results suggest that beta-lactamase plays an important role in developing resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infection as well as complicated infection.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating the effective administrative dose of latamoxef. Significance of a 4-category system interpretation of the latamoxef disc susceptibility test].
AB  - In vitro activities of latamoxef (LMOX) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. LMOX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and Proteus vulgaris with MIC values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. It was also active against Enterobacter aerogenes with MIC80 of 1.56 micrograms/ml. LMOX was less active against Serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. It was also less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, showing MIC80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. LMOX was not active against Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The reliability of the LMOX disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (Difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of LMOX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the LMOX disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of LMOX. For the interpretation of LMOX disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of Showa discs used on Staphylococcus were relatively large compared to MICs determined, probably due to decarboxylation of LMOX sodium salt in the discs. However, those of Difco discs were not, because Difco discs use LMOX ammonium salt. Both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters compared to MICs determined against P. aeruginosa. Using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for Staphylococcus and P. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate MICs. A 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in USA and Europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in Japan. The 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to MIC values as follows: Resistant (R) MIC greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (I) MIC 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (S) MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. The 4 category system uses break points as follows: MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Disk diffusion susceptibility testing and broth microdilution quality control guidelines for BMY-28100, a new orally administered cephalosporin.
AB  - The BMY-28100 30-micrograms-disk test was evaluated by using 615 clinical isolates. Regression analyses and error rates were determined, leading to the recommendation of greater than or equal to 18-mm zone diameters (MIC correlate, greater than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) for susceptibility and less than or equal to 14-mm zone diameters (MIC correlate, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) for resistance. Nearly all false-susceptible disk test results were among the Providencia spp. and the beta-lactamase-positive Haemophilus influenzae strains. Susceptibility disk test results for these species should be interpreted with caution. The following broth microdilution MIC quality control guidelines were determined from results of a multilaboratory trial: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 1.0 to 4.0 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, 4.0 to 16 micrograms/ml; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, 0.25 to 1.0 microgram/ml; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, greater than 32 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Production of staphylococcal enterotoxin in mixed cultures.
AB  - Two Staphylococcus aureus strains were grown in brain-heart infusion (BHI) broth  and a meat medium with Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both S. aureus strains grew well and produced enterotoxin in the presence of S. faecalis in BHI broth; however, enterotoxin production was observable in the meat medium only when the S. aureus inoculum was greater than the S. faecalis inoculum. S. aureus FRI-100 grown with B. cereus produced enterotoxin in both media only when the S. aureus inoculum was much higher than the B. cereus inoculum (10 versus 10(4) CFU), whereas S. aureus FRI-196E produced enterotoxin in both media at all inoculum combinations except in the meat medium, when the inocula of the two organisms were the same. S. aureus grown with E. coli in BHI broth produced enterotoxin at all inoculum combinations except when the E. coli inoculum was greater than the S. aureus inoculum; however, in the meat medium, enterotoxin was produced only when the S. aureus inoculum was much greater than the E. coli inoculum (10 versus 10(4) CFU), S. aureus FRI-100 grown with P. aeruginosa in either medium produced enterotoxin only when the S. aureus inoculum was much greater than the P. aeruginosa inoculum (10 versus 10(3) or 10(4) CFU). It can be concluded from these results that enterotoxin production is unlikely in mixed cultures unless the staphylococci outnumber the other contaminating organisms.
TI  - Quality control limits for teicoplanin susceptibility tests and confirmation of disk diffusion interpretive criteria.
AB  - For monitoring the performance of teicoplanin susceptibility tests, the following quality control limits are recommended: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, MIC of 0.12 to 0.5 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, MIC of 0.06 to 0.25 micrograms/ml; and S. aureus ATCC 25923, zones 15 to 19 mm in diameter (30-micrograms disks). However, some lots of Mueller-Hinton agar provided unusually large zones of inhibition with both vancomycin and teicoplanin disks, and these lots should be excluded before routine use. Teicoplanin and vancomycin differed only in their activity against oxacillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, which had decreased susceptibility to teicoplanin but were fully susceptible to vancomycin. For tests with 30-micrograms teicoplanin disks, zones less than or equal to 10 and greater than or equal to 14 mm in diameter represent resistant and susceptible breakpoints, respectively.
TI  - Patterns of wound colonisation in patients with peripheral vascular disease.
AB  - The bacterial colonisation of ulcers related to vascular disease, amputation sites and sites of surgical vascular repair was studied in 122 patients with vascular disorders. Wounds were graded clinically on the basis of inflammation, oedema and exudate. They were sampled at weekly intervals in order to determine the duration of colonisation. The significance of potential pathogens was assessed. Vascular ulcers were of low mean wound grade (1.87), short duration (1.58 weeks) and potential pathogens were isolated from 82% of 38 wounds. Amputation sites were of a higher mean wound grade (2.48) and longer duration (2.52 weeks) when compared to vascular ulcers. Potential pathogens were isolated from 69% of 42 amputation sites. Sites of surgical vascular repair were similar to amputation sites with respect to mean wound grade (2.33) but of a mean duration (1.69 weeks) similar to that of vascular ulcers. Potential pathogens were isolated from 50% of 42 surgical vascular repair sites but they were not evenly distributed among limb (33%), groin (55%) and abdominal wounds (71%). Coliforms were isolated from similar numbers of all wounds. Pseudomonas spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis were evenly distributed with respect to the site of isolation. Pseudomonas spp. and S. aureus were associated more commonly with vascular ulcers and S. faecalis with sites of surgical vascular repair. The use of topical antiseptics and/or systemic antimicrobial agents had a minimal effect in reducing colonisation/infection in the wounds studied.
TI  - Serum bactericidal activity and postantibiotic effect in serum of patients with urinary tract infection receiving high-dose amikacin.
AB  - Ten patients received a 30-min infusion of amikacin (30 mg/kg) on day 1 and 15 mg/kg on day 2. Mean serum creatinine was 1.1 +/- 0.3 (standard deviation) mg/dl before and 1.0 +/- 0.3 mg/dl 3 days after the second infusion. Mean serum amikacin concentrations before, at the end of infusion, and 1, 6, 12, and 24 h after 30 and 15 mg/kg were 0, 157, 79, 31, 16, 5, 5, 85, 51, 19, 12, and 5 mg/liter, respectively. Five strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible and resistant to oxacillin, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis, corynebacterium sp. strain JK, Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium fortuitum (three strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested. Serum bactericidal activities (SBAs) were greater than or equal to 1:8 in greater than or equal to 80% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 30 mg/kg and in greater than or equal to 60% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 15 mg/kg against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible to oxacillin, A. calcoaceticus, and K. pneumoniae. L. monocytogenes, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa had lower SBAs. Very low or no activity was observed against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and Streptococcus faecalis. The study of the killing rate in serum confirmed these results. Postantibiotic effect was studied by incubating a strain from each species in serum samples obtained 1 and 6 h after both regimens for 0.5, 1, or 2 h. The duration of postantibiotic effect depended on the duration of contact and the concentration of amikacin for the following organisms: oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci, L. monocytogenes, P. aeruginosa, A. calcoaceticus, K. pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens. M. fortuitum was killed after 30 min of contact. No postantibiotic effect was observed with Streptococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium sp. strain JK, or oxacillin-resistant staphylococci. Amikacin at 30 mg/kg provided high levels and SBAs against susceptible pathogens. Prolonged postantibiotic effects were observed. No signs of nephrotoxicity occurred.
TI  - Penetration of bacteria and spermatozoa into bovine cervical mucus.
AB  - It has been reported that bacteria may attach to motile spermatozoa, be carried through the cervix and uterus to the fallopian tubes, and cause acute salpingitis. In an attempt to mimic these conditions in vitro, we incubated Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus with motile spermatozoa which then were allowed to migrate through a capillary filled with bovine cervical mucus. After satisfactory sperm migration through the mucus, the capillaries were broken and cultured at different distances from the original insemination site. Mucus fractions in proximity to bacterial inocula grew varying amounts of the pathogens. More distal fractions of mucus columns were generally culture-negative even though they contained motile sperm which had been exposed to bacteria. Migration of spermatozoa exposed to bacteria through bovine cervical mucus did not result in enhanced bacterial penetration.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpirome, a new cephalosporin with a broad antimicrobial spectrum.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefpirome (HR 810), a new cephalosporin antibiotic having a 2,3-cyclopentenopyridine group in the 3-position side chain, was compared with in vitro activities of 5 other cephalosporins. HR 810 showed a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria when tested using 71 standard strains and 876 clinical isolates. HR 810 inhibited 70% of the clinically isolated Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains when used at 0.59-0.84 microgram/ml, 2- to 25-fold lower than values of reference antibiotics, and the compound was also highly effective against Enterococcus faecalis which is relatively resistant to most of the existing cephem antibiotics. The activity of HR 810 against Enterobacteriaceae members (11 species), based on its minimal inhibitory concentrations inhibiting 90% of bacterial growth (MIC90S), was the highest among the cephalosporins used. Especially against Enterobacter species and Citrobacter freundii, the MIC90S of the compound were 4- to 64-fold lower than the values of the other antibiotics. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, HR 810 was as active as cefoperazone, an antipseudomonal agent. The minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of HR 810 were equal to or only 2-fold greater than the MICs for most of 12 standard strains tested. The compound markedly decreased viable bacterial counts at its MICs, thus showing strong bactericidal activities. The in vitro activity of HR 810 was not affected by pH or human serum content of agar media, but the activity against Gram-negative bacteria was lowered as the inoculum size increased.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the kanamycin resistance determinant of the pneumococcal transposon Tn1545: evolutionary relationships and transcriptional analysis of aphA-3 genes.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the kanamycin resistance determinant aphA-3 encoded by transposon Tn1545 from Streptococcus pneumoniae was determined and compared to those of plasmids pJH1 and pIP1433 from Streptococcus faecalis and Campylobacter coli, respectively. The three sequences were found to be identical and differed by two substitutions and the deletion of a codon from that of plasmid pSH2 from Staphylococcus aureus. Comparison of the 5' noncoding sequences indicated that the regions containing the aphA-3 gene in pJH1 and in Tn1545 evolved independently by deletion from a sequence similar to that found in pIP1433. In the latter plasmid, aphA-3 is transcribed from a promoter, P1, which is flanked by two 12-base pair direct repeats. The rearrangement observed in pJH1 removed one of these recombinogenic sites and altered the -10 and 3' flanking sequences of P1. The promoter thus generated. P1', allows expression of similar level of kanamycin resistance as P1. However, fusion experiments carried out with a promotorless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene indicated that the canonical promoter P1 is significantly less efficient than P1'. From analysis of the thermodynamic properties of these promoters, we conclude that this difference in strength reflects the melting properties of the -10 sequences. The transition from pIP1433 to pJH1 may correspond to the progression of a molecule structurally unstable to a more stable one combined with the need to maintain an efficient promoter upstream of the aphA-3 gene. The deletion event in Tn1545, which occurred between the two 12-base pair directly repeated sequences, removed P1 in its entirety.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Transfer of the conjugal tetracycline resistance transposon Tn916 from Streptococcus faecalis to Staphylococcus aureus and identification of some insertion sites in the staphylococcal chromosome.
AB  - The Streptococcus faecalis pheromone-dependent conjugative plasmid pAD1::Tn916 and the membrane filter-dependent conjugative plasmid pPD5::Tn916 were used to introduce Tn916 into Staphylococcus aureus by intergeneric protoplast fusions and intergeneric membrane-filter matings. In recombinants obtained by protoplast fusion where no plasmid DNA could be detected, tetracycline resistance resulted from transposition of Tn916 from pAD1 to the S. aureus chromosome. Transformation analyses showed that S. aureus Tn916 chromosomal insertions occurred near pig, ilv, uraA, tyrB, fus, ala, and the trp operon. DNA hybridization analyses of EcoRI- and HindIII-digested chromosomal DNAs confirmed the diversity of chromosomal sites involved and demonstrated that the inserts were Tn916 insertions rather than integrations of all or part of pAD1::Tn916. Both pAD1::Tn916 and pPD5::Tn916 were transferred to S. aureus by membrane-filter matings. These plasmids remained intact and expressed tetracycline resistance in S. aureus. S. aureus strains carrying pAD1::Tn916, but not a chromosomal insert of Tn916, and any one of several conjugal gentamicin-resistance plasmids lost their ability to serve as conjugal donors of the gentamicin-resistance plasmids.
TI  - [Recent trend of childhood bacterial meningitis in Japan (1979-1984). Part 4. A classification of prognosis and antibiotic treatment based on causative agents].
AB  - Nine hundred seventy cases of childhood bacterial meningitis treated at 107 institutions in Japan from 1979 through 1984 were studied using questionnaire. The number of cases that underwent antimicrobial monotherapy remained nearly constant during the study period, but cases of therapies with beta-lactam combined with aminoglycosides (AGs) decreased in number and a gradual increase in the use of beta-lactam combined with non-AGs antibiotics including beta-lactam (Non AGs) was observed. A trend showing decrease in case fatality rate (CFR) was observed except that CFR for Gram-positive bacterial infections treated with beta-lactam + AGs remained at a same level. Cases treated with antibiotics were classified into 3 groups according to major etiological pathogens. Cases with Staphylococcus aureus gave a poor prognosis, among 27 total cases, CFR was 28.6% (2/7) with monotherapy, 50.0% (6/12) with beta-lactam + AGs and 37.5% (3/8) with beta-lactam + Non AGs (P less than 0.1). Among 100 cases of group B Streptococcus (GBS), CFR was 20.0% as a whole, 17.3% (9/52) for monotherapy and 34.5% (10/29) for beta-lactam + AGs (P less than 0.1). Among 198 cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae, CFR was 12.1% as a whole, and was 12.3% (18/146) with monotherapy. CFR for the cases treated with beta-lactam + AGs was 20.8% (5/24) and with beta-lactam + Non AGs was 3.6% (1/28) (P less than 0.1). CFR for 292 cases of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis was fairly low, and was 6.1% (9/148) with monotherapy, 7.4% (5/68) with beta-lactam + AGs and 3.9% (3/76) with beta-lactam + Non AGs, thus very slight differences were observed among the 3 groups of treatment. Among 111 cases of Escherichia coli, monotherapy and beta-lactam + Non AGs gave 6.5% (2/31) CFR, and 5.6% (1/18) CFR, respectively, whereas beta-lactam + AGs showed CFR of 19.4% (12/62), demonstrating a significant difference tendency (P less than 0.1). Similar tendencies were observed in the cases of Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. Contrary to the high CFR observed with the beta-lactam + AGs treatment, significantly low CFR was frequently obtained in cases treated with a combination of penicillins with cephalosporins including latamoxef or beta-lactam with chloramphenicol. Infections with GBS, E. coli, and P. mirabilis occurred largely in the age between 0 to 6 months and CFR was especially high in the very young.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Evaluation of cefuzonam in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefuzonam (L-105, CZON) was studied in pediatric infections. A summary of the results it as follows: For recently isolated Staphylococcus aureus strains, Peak MICs of CZON were distributed between 0.39 and 0.78 micrograms/ml showing a greater susceptibility of S. aureus to CZON than to cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX), and cefmenoxime (CMX). Peak MICs of CZON for Escherichia coli were 0.10-0.20 micrograms/ml, similar to those of CPZ, LMOX, and CMX. Ampicillin (ABPC)-resistant strains were also susceptible to CZON. MICs for Salmonella were similar to those for E. coli. Peak MICs of CZON for Vibrio parahaemolyticus were 0.20-0.39 micrograms/ml. The susceptibility of the bacteria to CZON was far greater than to ABPC, and was similar to CPZ, LMOX, and CMX. With 20 mg/kg drip infusion, serum concentrations reached their peaks at the end of administration with values of 20.6-68.7 micrograms/ml, which decreased to 0.43-1.70 micrograms/ml after 2 hours. Half-lives of CZON in serum were 0.68-1.2 hours. With 50 mg/kg drip infusion, serum concentrations reached their peaks at the end of administration with levels of 69.0-82.0 micrograms/ml, and at after 2 hours 1.85-3.45 micrograms/ml. Thus, an apparent dose response was observed. Half-lives of CZON in serum were 0.63-0.99 hours. Urinary recovery rates in 6 hours were 39.9-80.5%. A total of 44 cases of 10 different types of acute pediatric infections was treated by CZON intravenous drip infusion as the main therapeutic procedure. The efficacy rate was 93.2%, and the compound was effective on purulent infections, acute urinary tract infection, etc. with pathogens such as ABPC-resistant S. aureus, E. coli, and Enterococcus faecalis. Dosage levels per day were 50 to 80 mg/kg in most cases. In infections with S. aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (3 strains), E. faecalis (1 strain), Haemophilus parahaemolyticus (1 strain), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (2 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (11 strains), Bordetella pertussis (1 strain), E. coli (3 strains), a total of 30 strains, bacterial elimination was noted with an exception of 1 strain of S. aureus. The compound was used for 4 to 15 days, but side effects observed clinically were only 1 case of diarrhea and 1 case of thrombocytosis.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefuzonam in children].
AB  - Cefuzonam (L-105, CZON), a new parenteral cephalosporin, was evaluated for its efficacy and safety in 22 children with bacterial infections (Table 1). The results obtained are summarized below. MICs of CZON to 26 strains of isolated organisms are shown in Table 2. MICs to all 14 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 6 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae were less than 0.05 microgram/ml. The MIC to 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus was 0.39 microgram/ml and that to another was 0.78 microgram/ml. Two strains of Escherichia coli showed MICs of less than 0.05 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. The MIC to 1 strain of Enterococcus faecalis was 6.25 micrograms/ml. The CZON was administered in 3 or 4 divided doses at a daily dosage ranging from 58.5 to 85.7 mg/kg by 30-minute drip infusion or intravenous injection to 22 patients (9 cases of pneumonia, 9 cases of tonsillitis, 2 cases of bronchitis, 1 case each of suppurative parotitis and acute pyelonephritis) and the following clinical results were obtained; excellent: 12 cases; good: 7 cases; fair: 3 cases. The overall efficacy rate was 86% (Table 4). Diarrhea was observed in four patients, and was resolved with or without discontinuation of the medication within a week. Anemia was noted in 2 cases. Leucopenia and neutropenia was observed in 1 case. There were a moderate rises in S-GOT and S-GPT activities in 1 patient (Table 4), and they necessitated the cessation of the CZON therapy. The S-GOT and S-GPT activities became normal after the drug treatment was stopped.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of ceftizoxime. Observation from MIC and ceftizoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  - In vitro activities of ceftizoxime (CZX) against 328 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. CZX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Proteus vulgaris with MIC values below 0.20 microgram/ml. It was also active against Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes with MIC85 of 3.13 micrograms/ml. CZX was less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, showing inhibitory activities against only 47 and 78% of these clinical isolates, respectively, at a dose level of 12.5 micrograms/ml. CZX was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. The reliability of CZX disc diffusion susceptibility tests for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (Eiken), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of CZX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the CZX disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of CZX, except against P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis. For the interpretation of CZX disc tests, a 3 category system has been used in USA and Europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in Japan. The 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to MIC values as follows: resistant (R) MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (MS) MIC 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (S) MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of LY146032 (daptomycin) against gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LY146032 was compared with those of seven other antimicrobial agents against gram-positive cocci. MICs of LY146032 were lowest for Streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (0.25 mg/l). For methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus the MICs were 1 mg/l, for Enterococcus faecalis 2 mg/l and for Enterococcus faecium 4 mg/l. The activity of LY146032 was in general higher than that of vancomycin. Time-kill studies showed LY146032 had higher bactericidal activity than vancomycin against a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain, and bactericidal activity against Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY146032 (daptomycin) against selected aerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new lipopeptide antibiotic LY146032 was generally four-fold greater (MIC 90 less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml) than that of vancomycin against methicillin-susceptible or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative species of Staphylococcus. Enterococci, Streptococcus bovis, group B and viridans streptococci, and Corynebacterium group J-K isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml of LY146032, which represented activity equivalent to or greater than that of vancomycin. Unlike vancomycin, LY146032 was bactericidal for Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Listeria monocytogenes. Due to its bactericidal properties LY146032 appeared to represent an improvement over vancomycin and teicoplanin.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1984)].
AB  - Bacterial isolates from patients with pulmonary infections have been collected over the last 4 years in collaboration with investigators at 14 hospitals in various parts of Japan to study isolation frequency of pathogens from patients and drug susceptibilities of these isolates. Possible causative pathogens mainly isolated from sputum of patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected during a period from September 1984 to March 1985. We first determined types of respiratory diseases and found that, between 1981 and 1983, 57.9 approximately 64.5% of the examined diseases were chronic respiratory infections such as chronic bronchitis, chronic bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis, and that these infections including diffuse panbronchiolitis accounted for 63.1% in 1984. Bacterial pneumonia was found to be 24.8% in 1981, but it was 11.0% in 1983 and 15.1% in 1984. These results seemed to reflect decreases in the occurrence of bacterial pneumonia in young population. We then investigated the correlations between these infections and isolates and found that distributions of causative organisms of chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis during the 4 years were similar while the detection rate of Staphylococcus aureus from bacterial pneumonia increased in 1982 and 1983, and that of Gram-positive organisms such as Enterococcus faecalis rose in 1984. Branhamella catarrhalis was considered to be a non-pathogenic organism normally harbored in the upper respiratory tract. Recently, however, respiratory infections caused by this organism have been reported by some investigators. In our research also, this Gram-negative diplococcus was isolated as a causative organism of respiratory infections as 6 strains were found in 1983 and 29 strains in 1984, hence an increase was observed.
TI  - [Resistance pattern of clinical bacterial isolates. Results of a super-regional multicenter study of the Resistance Study Committee of the Paul Ehrlich Society of Chemotherapy].
AB  - In a multicentre study conducted by the Paul-Ehrlich-Gesellschaft we tested about 3,584 clinical isolates from 25 laboratories towards different chemotherapeutics. Using a microdilution test Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis strains regarded as causative pathogens were studied. The data were evaluated for the number, frequency and qualitative characteristics of multiple resistance patterns. None of the strains under test was resistant to all antibiotics tested. Amikacin showed the lowest prevalence of resistance. The significance of such data in the epidemiological control of resistance to chemotherapeutics is discussed.
TI  - Enumeration of pathogenic bacteria from sewage sludge in Kuwait.
AB  - Domestic sewage in Kuwait is mainly treated by an activated sludge process. Sewage sludges at different treatment stages and the digested sludge were studied for their content of pathogenic bacteria. Two Gram-positive cocci and eight Gram-negative bacilli were isolated and enumerated in the sewage sludges and in raw sewage. During March, Aeromonas hydrophila was the dominant bacterium isolated. Serratia liquefaciens in raw sewage and sludge-2, and Salmonella species in digested sludge were dominant during April. Enterobacter aerogenes was dominant in sewage samples in May. Various types of bacteria isolated were tested for their sensitivity to a wide range of antibiotics.
TI  - The effect of transferrin and lysozyme on antibacterial activity of amniotic fluid.
AB  - Amniotic fluid obtained from normal full term gestation inhibited the growth of E. coli, Staph. aureus and B. subtilis, while Ps. aeruginosa, Str. faecalis and Str. agalactiae proliferated readily in amniotic fluid. But when amniotic fluid was heated at 100 degrees C for 5 minutes, its antibacterial activity was completely lost. The levels of transferrin and lysozyme in amniotic fluid at term were determined to be 29.1 +/- 17.6 mg/100 ml (n = 90) and 19.1 +/- 8.3 micrograms/ml (n = 145), respectively. Antibacterial activity against E. coli was restored by adding transferrin into heat-treated amniotic fluid at a concentration of 250 mg/100 ml or higher, but simultaneous addition of transferrin and sufficient concentration of iron to form a transferrin-iron complex resulted in the loss of antibacterial activities. When lysozyme was added to the amniotic fluid, which had lost its antibacterial activity through exposure to heat, the antibacterial effect on B. subtilis was restored. The growth of Staph. aureus in heat-treated amniotic fluid was inhibited by the concomitant addition of lysozyme and aminobenzyl penicillin.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of gram-positive cocci to paldimycin.
AB  - Paldimycin (U-70138F) is a new antimicrobial agent with activity against gram-positive cocci. Clinical isolates of staphylococci and streptococci were tested. MICs were higher in Mueller-Hinton broth than in nutrient broth. Change in pH had minimal effect on the MICs in either broth. When inoculum size was varied, an inoculum effect was observed. The gram-positive cocci tested were generally more susceptible to paldimycin than to vancomycin.
TI  - Quality control limits for microdilution susceptibility tests with norfloxacin.
AB  - A multilaboratory study was designed to define quality control limits for microdilution susceptibility tests with norfloxacin. The following limits were proposed: for Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 0.03 to 0.125 micrograms/ml; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, 1.0 to 4.0 micrograms/ml; for Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, 0.5 to 2.0 micrograms/ml; and for Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, 2.0 to 8.0 micrograms/ml. The latter represents a change in the previously recommended control limits.

TI  - Suppurative thrombophlebitis: correlation between pathogen and underlying disease.
AB  - We identified 29 episodes of suppurative thrombophlebitis in 27 patients admitted to a large general hospital between May 1980 and May 1984. In 25 patients, the intravenous cannulae had been in place for more than 3 days. Streptococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or one of the Enterobacteriaceae were implicated in 14 patients. All these patients had recently undergone abdominal surgery or had a major intra-abdominal inflammatory process at the time they developed thrombophlebitis. The remaining 13 patients were infected with Staphylococcus aureus, other gram-positive cocci or Candida species. Only two of these had an active abdominal process at the time of their infection (chi 2 = 16.08, P less than 0.001). There is an apparent association between phlebitis caused by enteric organisms and active intra-abdominal pathology. There were two deaths related to delayed or deferred surgery. Suppurative thrombophlebitis is a lethal, preventable nosocomial infection that requires urgent surgical intervention.
TI  - Dispersal of a plasmid-borne chloramphenicol resistance gene in streptococcal and enterococcal plasmids.
AB  - Plasmids coding for chloramphenicol resistance, five isolated from streptococci of groups A, B, and G, ten from enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium), and two from staphylococci, were tested for sequence homology with the chloramphenicol resistance gene of pIP501, a 30-kb plasmid originally isolated from a group B Streptococcus. The 6.3-kb HindIII fragment of pIP501, known to carry the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was cloned into pBR322. A 1.6-kb portion of the cloned fragment, which included most of the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was used as probe in DNA-DNA hybridization experiments. Sequence homology was detected between the probe and four of the streptococcal, seven of the enterococcal, and one of the staphylococcal plasmids. The absence of hybridization between this probe and one plasmid isolated from a group B Streptococcus, as well as three isolated from E. faecalis, indicated that there are at least two different plasmid-borne chloramphenicol resistance determinants in the streptococci and in the enterococci.
TI  - Pseudallescheriasis in northern Britain.
AB  - Five cases of Pseudallescheria boydii infection are reported from the northern part of the United Kingdom. None of the patients had travelled abroad. Three cases of otitis in which P. boydii was associated with bacterial infections were diagnosed within a 6-month period. A lady who had diabetes mellitus presented with a pulmonary fungus ball in a pre-existent cavity caused by a previous bacterial infection. After minor trauma at the site of an old skin graft, a farmer's wife developed an ulcer on the dorsum of the right ankle. Precipitating antibodies were demonstrated except in two of the cases of ear infection. The management of the individual cases is discussed.
TI  - Comparison of pharmacokinetics and bactericidal activity of teicoplanin and vancomycin.
AB  - Teicoplanin (0.2 g) or vancomycin (1 g) were infused over 3 and 50 min respectively to six male volunteers in a cross-over study. Each drug was administered twice at a 14 h interval. The pharmacokinetics of both drugs were accurately described using a two-compartment model. Vancomycin had a shorter half-life (5.8 +/- 1.8 h) compared to teicoplainin (33.2 +/- 5.1 h; P less than 0.001). One hour serum was tested for serum bactericidal activity against ten strains each of Staphylococcus aureus (median serum bactericidal activity 1:16 for teicoplanin; 1:32 for vancomycin), Staph. epidermidis (1:32 for teicoplanin and for vancomycin) and Streptococcus faecalis (1:2 for both drugs). Serum killing rate studies showed a slower rate of killing of Staph. aureus with teicoplanin (less than 1 log10 cfu/ml over 6 h) than with vancomycin (4 log10 cfu/ml over 6 h).
TI  - Isolation and structure of the Streptococcus faecalis sex pheromone, cAM373.
AB  - The Streptococcus faecalis sex pheromone, cAM373, which induces a mating response of donor cells harboring plasmid pAM373 and is also produced by Staphylococcus aureus, was isolated and its structure determined. Supernatant from an overnight culture of a recipient strain was subjected to successive purification procedures, and 4.4 micrograms cAM373 was obtained. The isolated pheromone showed activity at a concentration as low as 5 X 10(-11) M. Sequence analysis indicated that cAM373 was a heptapeptide, H-Ala-Ile-Phe-Ile-Leu-Ala-Ser-OH, and that its Mr was 733. A synthetic replicate of the peptide showed the same biological activity and chromatographic behavior as the native cAM373.
TI  - Potent antagonism of Escherichia coli, Bacteroides ovatus, Fusobacterium varium,  and Enterococcus faecalis, alone or in combination, for enteropathogens in anaerobic continuous flow cultures.
AB  - Interactions between representative strains of four predominant resident bacteria of the human colon, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides ovatus, and Fusobacterium varium, and strains of seven enteropathogens, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, V. cholerae serogroup non O1, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium perfringens, were examined in studies with an anaerobic continuous flow culture system and medium resembling the content of the mouse caecum (MCM). Potent unilateral antagonism attributable to synergic activities of the resident bacteria against the enteropathogens was evident. The four resident bacteria persisted at levels of c. 10(6) cfu/ml or more in single and in any mixed cultures of the resident species. The seven enteropathogens also persisted in single cultures. In contrast, Y. enterocolitica was excluded in several days in mixed cultures with each of the four resident bacteria. Sh. Flexneri and Staph. aureus were excluded in the presence of E. coli alone. C. perfringens, V. parahaemolyticus and V. cholerae serogroup non O1 were excluded in the presence of E. coli with B. ovatus and, in some cases, with additional species. S. typhimurium was the most resistant; only c. 10(2)-fold reduction of the population level was observed in mixed culture with all four of the resident species. When the amounts of some components in the medium, such as peptone and yeast extract, were increased, C. perfringens grew and persisted even in the presence of the four resident bacteria. Sh. flexneri, in contrast decreased steadily, even in enriched media.
TI  - Sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14C-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
AB  - Bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. In order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14C-taurocholate (TC) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. The results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. Supernatants from Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14C-TC uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. Streptococcus faecalis (Enterococcus), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from Proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). Bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- SEM) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14C-TC uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). The results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - An evaluation of various working practices in shops selling raw and cooked meats.
AB  - Three groups of premises (butchers' shops, supermarkets and general dealers) which sell raw and cooked meats were compared. Salmonellas were not detected, but Escherichia coli, and to a lesser degree Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis, were widely distributed in all three groups of premises. Contamination of hands, towels and nail brushes was related to poor working practices. The presence of E. coli or Str. faecalis on slicing machines was associated with contamination of meat samples. A number of wiping cloths were heavily contaminated with E. coli, and many also contained Clostridium perfringens. Fewer premises provided written cleaning plans, and in many cases staff did not receive an adequate training in food hygiene. The use of disinfectants as part of the cleaning process did not necessarily reduce the level of bacterial contamination. In general there was poor correlation between microbiological results and a visual inspection made by an environmental health officer. The possible reasons for this finding are discussed.
TI  - Comparison of bacteria in the tympanic cavity and the mastoid antrum in chronic otitis media.
AB  - Materials collected from the tympanic cavity before operation and from the mastoid antrum during operation of 58 discharging ears of patients with chronic otitis media were cultured, and the bacteria in these two cavities were compared. Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest organism in the tympanic cavity, and S epidermidis in the mastoid antrum. Anaerobic bacteria were found only in the mastoid antrum of patient with cholesteatoma. In 32 (55 per cent) of the 58 ears examined, bacteria were detected in both the tympanic and mastoid cavities. In 17 ears (53 per cent), the bacterial strains in the two cavities differed. The results indicate the necessity of bacteriologic examination of the mastoid cavity during operation to select antibiotics for postoperative treatment.
TI  - Elucidation of Strongyloides stercoralis by bacterial-colony displacement.
AB  - Two cases of unsuspected Strongyloides stercoralis infection were elucidated by the displacement of bacterial colonies on primary plating media. Observation of primary plates inoculated for the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia or gastroenteritis revealed that normal flora colonies had been moved and were aligned in a pathway, or track. This unusual colony alignment prompted us to request a stool for the examination of parasites, and S. stercoralis was found. It was concluded that the parasite is capable of motility on agar surfaces, resulting in the displacement of bacterial colonies that make up the normal flora.
TI  - Selection of a reference lot of Mueller-Hinton agar.
AB  - A collaborative study was undertaken to evaluate the performance of currently marketed Mueller-Hinton agars from seven manufacturers by replicate disk diffusion tests with standard quality control strains. Identification of the manufacturers was concealed, and the resulting data were evaluated for the selection of a physical reagent standard against which the performance of future production lots would be tested and made to conform. A medium was selected which was sufficiently close to existing National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards quality control limits that current interpretive criteria would require minimum modification. Two of the seven lots were eliminated from further consideration because the final pHs were outside acceptable limits. The remaining four lots had 96% of mean zone diameters less than or equal to 2 mm from those of the chosen lot and 65% of the means were less than or equal to 1 mm from those of the chosen lot for all 28 antimicrobial agent-organism combinations. Manufacturers then attempted to produce new lots of Mueller-Hinton agar which performed within the prescribed limits of the chosen lot. One lot performed in close conformity with the selected standard, but the overall performance of the media was essentially the same as that of the randomly chosen lots in the initial study. It was concluded that one of the original seven lots demonstrated properties which made it a tentative candidate for a physical reagent standard and that the use of a physical reagent standard in evaluating production lots might aid in stabilizing the performance of Mueller-Hinton agar.
TI  - The oral immune system: dynamics of salivary immunoglobulin production in the inbred mouse.
AB  - In the oral cavity, salivary immunoglobulins (Igs) are the principal mediators of specific immunity. Using carbachol to stimulate saliva flow, we investigated, in a kinetic study, individual variations in salivary Ig concentrations in 23 adult BALB/c mice using an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). It appeared that salivary Ig concentrations are highly variable in individual mice (IgA: 3-81 micrograms/mL; IgG: 0-2.9 micrograms/mL; IgM: 0.002-0.14 microgram/mL). In individual mice stimulated at different times over a 3 week period there are considerable variations both in salivary Ig concentrations and in their respective ratio. Broad variations were also found in the levels of specific IgA and IgG antibodies to three indigenous oral murine bacteria. Present data thus indicate that among genetically identical mice of the same age and sex, sharing identical diet, there is considerable heterogeneity in salivary Igs. As this heterogeneity was mimicked at the cellular level in major and minor salivary gland-associated B-cells, it appears that antibody dynamics in the oral cavity could reflect the adaptive capacity of the oral immune system to local antigenic challenge.
TI  - Phthalocyanines as photosensitizers in biological systems and for the photodynamic therapy of tumors.
AB  
TI  - Immunocompromised animal models for the study of antibiotic combinations.
AB  - Studies of various models of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in neutropenic animals have demonstrated the superiority of the combination of beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics when compared with a single drug alone. A limited number of studies carried out in models of Klebsiella pneumoniae infections in neutropenic animals have shown similar results. The efficacy of double beta-lactam combinations for the treatment of gram-negative bacillary infections has not been studied as extensively; the few available reports did not show any benefit over a single beta-lactam treatment. Most studies of combined therapy in gram-positive infections have been performed in the experimental endocarditis model. Experiments in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, and Streptococcus faecalis endocarditis have shown a clear-cut advantage for combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment over single beta-lactam therapy, as predicted by in vitro tests. The enhanced efficacy of combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment in both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections appears to result in most studies in increased and faster killing of the bacteria. With P. aeruginosa infections, however, experiments in neutropenic mice suggest that in addition to increased killing, the beta-lactam arm of the combined treatment prevents the emergence of the small colony variants that lead to treatment failures during therapy with aminoglycoside alone. For both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections, in vitro tests that demonstrated synergism for the combined antibiotics generally predicted enhanced therapeutic efficacy in vivo. Conversely, when no synergism was demonstrated in vitro, there was generally no increased efficacy of combined treatment in vivo. Animal models add a dimension to our understanding of the efficacy of antibiotics, both singly and in combination, that is not always apparent from the results of in vitro tests alone. These in vivo tests can be of value when planning clinical trials.
TI  - Timentin in combination with tobramycin as empirical therapy in febrile neutropenic patients with haematological malignancies.
AB  - Timentin (5.2 g tds) and tobramycin (40 mg tds) were administered to 51 patients  (22 male, 29 female, age range 17-72, mean age 40.4) with acute leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia in blastic crisis, severe aplastic anaemia and acute agranulocytopenia. All patients had neutropenia (PMN less than 1000/mm3) and fever (greater than 38 degrees C). Febrile episodes consisted of 22 proved septicaemias due to Gram-positive organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, enterococcus) in 11 cases and to Gram-negative organisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Alkaligenes faecalis, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae) in 10 cases. One patient had a polymicrobial infection (P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, non-haemolytic streptococcus). Twenty-nine infections were diagnosed only clinically. The mean duration of treatment was 11.1 days (range 4-20 days). Eighty-seven per cent of evaluable febrile episodes improved. Among 11 infections due to Gram-positive cocci, eight (72%) resolved, and in nine (90%) of ten cases due to Gram-negative bacilli success was obtained. The polymicrobial infection also resolved. In only four patients were mild side effects seen, e.g. exanthema, pruritus, phlebitis: renal toxicity was not observed. These data suggest that the combination of Timentin and tobramycin is an effective and safe empirical antibiotic regimen in febrile neutropenic patients.
TI  - [Air-borne microbes in the vicinity of sewage treatment plants].
AB  - Measurements of air-borne germs were conducted over one year at several sewage treatment plants with different loads and sewage treatment methods. The investigations were intended to show possible air-borne loads in the sewage treatment plants and their immediate vicinity, taking into account different climatic conditions. The results lead to the conclusion that neighboring residential areas or factories in the vicinity of sewage treatment plants are not exposed to air-borne hazards.
TI  - The diffusion of pefloxacin into bone and the treatment of osteomyelitis.
AB  - Pefloxacin was evaluated in the treatment of bone infections. A clinical trial was performed in 15 patients with chronic osteitis (5 Staphylococcus aureus, 5 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 3 Serratia sp., 1 Proteus mirabilis, and a mixed infection with a Streptococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli). Patients were given pefloxacin 400 mg 12-hourly iv for 48 h followed by oral treatment. Bone biopsies from the iliac crest were carried out after at least seven days treatment, 2 h after the last dose. Serum levels were estimated at the same time. In 13 patients the pefloxacin levels were between 2 and 10 mg per g of bone and always greater than, or equal to, the MIC for the infecting organism. In 11 patients treated for six months and followed up for up to 14 months after the completion of treatment, the therapy was successful. In another two patients, the results were excellent with closure of fistulae, but there was only limited follow-up. There were two failures: in one (post-radiation osteitis) the infection persisted and in the other there was intolerance of the antimicrobial. In both cases there was no increase in the MIC of pefloxacin against the organisms. Three patients underwent operations for orthopaedic indications, after at least two months of treatment. Bone cultures from the initial focus remained sterile. Side-effects were mild.
TI  - In-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to other antibiotics.
AB  - Pefloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. A comparison was made of the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin and that of nine other antibiotics (ampicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin and norfloxacin). The MIC90 of pefloxacin against 500 strains of Enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.25 mg/l (Escherichia coli, indole + Proteus spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp.) to 1 mg/l (Klebsiella pneumoniae). Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of 52 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 2.5 mg/l (range 0.25 mg/l-4 mg/l). The MIC90 of pefloxacin against 100 Staphylococcus aureus strains (78 oxacillin resistant strains) was 0.4 mg/l (range 0.12-0.5 mg/l). It was markedly less active against Streptococcus faecalis and Str. pneumoniae (37 strains of each species) the MIC90 being 4 mg/l against both species. Overall, pefloxacin was at least as active as the third-generation cephalosporins against Enterobacteriaceae and was more active than any other antibiotic tested against P. aeruginosa, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus. Against E. coli, pefloxacin had a more rapid anti-bacterial activity than piperacillin. A paradoxical effect was observed with pefloxacin. An optimal killing rate was observed at concentrations of pefloxacin compatible with those one can expect in blood of patients treated with this drug.
TI  - [A study on the antibacterial activity of amniotic fluid--the significance of intraamniotic transferrin].
AB  - In order to study the antimicrobial activity of amniotic fluid, attempts were made to evaluate the in vivo growth of bacteria in amniotic fluid and the role of transferrin in antibacterial activity. The bacteria chosen for these experiments were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis, respectively. The results obtained were as follows: Amniotic fluid was shown have an antibacterial effect on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis proliferated readily in amniotic fluid. Individual difference in each sample appeared to be responsible for the inconsistent potency of the inhibitory effect observed. When amniotic fluid was heated at 100 degrees C for 5 minutes, the antibacterial activity was lost. The level of transferrin in amniotic fluid obtained at term was determined to be 29.1 +/- 17.6mg/dl (N = 90). The value correlated with neither those measured in cord sera nor maternal sera. The antimicrobial activity was restored by adding transferrin into heat-treated amniotic fluid at a concentration of 250mg/dl or higher. Simultaneous addition of transferrin and a sufficient concentration of iron made it possible to form a transferrin-iron complex. A subsequent decrease in unbound transferrin resulted in the loss of antibacterial properties.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of Hemasite access devices.
AB  - Vascular access ports (Hemasites) were recovered from patients in whom they had become foci of infection and were examined according to microbiologic and morphologic techniques. All were covered on their extraluminal surfaces by well-developed biofilms consisting of host material and bacteria and their extracellular products. One Hemasite from which Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis were cultured was covered by a biofilm that consisted of coccoid bacterial cells and occasional fungal cells. Another Hemasite from which Proteus mirabilis was cultured was covered by a polymicrobial biofilm consisting of at least six morphologically distinct bacterial types and their extracellular products. This direct observation of the biofilm mode of bacterial growth on these devices suggests that the colonizing organisms will not be completely recovered by routine microbiologic techniques and that bacteria in the biofilm will tend to resist both host clearance mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. Removal of the device, with its accretion of bacterial biofilm, should allow the resolution of the associated infection.
TI  - Antigenic composition of an endocarditis-associated isolate of Streptococcus faecalis and identification of its glycoprotein antigens by ligand blotting with lectins.
AB  - The antigenic composition of an endocarditis-associated isolate of Streptococcus  faecalis was studied by immunoblotting of whole cells and cell walls from sodium-dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gels on to nitrocellulose and detection with serum from patients and hyperimmune rabbit serum. A major envelope protein antigen of mol. wt 53 X 10(3) detected with patient's serum was also present in three urinary strains of Str. faecalis and a laboratory strain of Str. faecalis ss. zymogenes but not in Staphylococcus aureus. Other common antigens of Str. faecalis were of mol. wt (10(3)) 65, 63, 56, 49.5, 30 and 21. Two other protein antigens (43 and 37 X 10(3) mol. wt) reacted strongly with asparagus pea lectin-peroxidase conjugate indicating the presence of fucosyl residues. Other lectin-peroxidase conjugates were used to demonstrate the presence of various glycosyl residues on envelope proteins. Growth of Str. faecalis in serum to mimic in-vivo growth conditions in endocarditis infections dramatically altered the antigenic patterns. Only two major antigens of mol. wt (10(3)) 56 and 53 reacted with sera from endocarditis patients. These antigens may, therefore, be of diagnostic or protective potential.
TI  - Comparative adhesion of seven species of streptococci isolated from the blood of  patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro.
AB  - The adhesion to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro of 21 strains of streptococci isolated from the blood of patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis (SABE) was measured. The species, in order of greatest adhesion, were Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus milleri, Streptococcus sanguis, dextran-positive Streptococcus mitior, dextran-negative Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus salivarius. Individual strains within species, however, cannot be assumed to be representative of their species and may exhibit unusually high or low adhesion. Adhesion depended upon both bacterial concentration and period of contact. There was no simple relationship between ability to adhere and liability to cause endocarditis. Formation of dextran did not increase adhesion. The streptococci were more adhesive than strains of Escherichia coli and Neisseria sicca and less adhesive than strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - Imipenem: the first thienamycin antibiotic.
AB  - Imipenem is a new beta-lactam which differs chemically from penicillins and cephalosporins but has a similar mode of action. It is a potent antibacterial agent with a broad spectrum of activity encompassing both aerobes and anaerobes. However, in vitro, it does not appear to offer a great improvement over other available agents for the treatment of infections caused by problem organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci. The results of clinical trials suggest that imipenem is efficacious and toxic side effects do not appear to be a problem.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of primycin against multiple strains of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Crystalline primycin was found to be very active in broth dilution assay against  Staphylococcus aureus (50 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (77 strains), Streptococcus faecalis (76 strains) and one strain of Listeria monocytogenes with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 0.12-0.5 microgram/ml. The activity was influenced by the pH of the liquid medium with greater activity (lower MICs) at pH 8 against the majority of strains, than at pH 6 or 7.3. In disc agar diffusion assay Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 proved more sensitive than staphylococcus strains.
TI  - [Aerobic bacterial flora of the nasal cavity of rabbits].
AB  - On the basis of bacteriological examinations carried out in April 1984 on 60 intranasal swabs, aerobic respiratory microbes were studied in rabbits. Differences in flora between animals with and without respiratory diseases were studied. Fourteen bacterial species were identified with no difference due to the pathological status. They were: Bordetella bronchiseptica, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp., Branhamella catarrhalis, Micrococcus sp., Enterobacter agglomerans, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas paucimobilis, Pseudomonas diminuta, Alcaligenes faecalis and Escherichia coli. However, young weaned rabbits were more often Pasteurella carriers than adult females in maternity. The usefulness of performing only Pasteurella and Bordetella cultures in rabbits is questionable as is use of vaccines in order to prevent bacterial respiratory syndrome. It is emphasised that myxomatosis should be pursued in the investigation of respiratory infections in rabbit.
TI  - [Dependence of the bactericidal activity and mutant selection of 4-quinolones on  their serum concentration levels].
AB  - In an in vitro system, bacterial cultures were exposed to concentrations following the kinetics of 4-quinolones in human serum. Both killing kinetics of staphylococci and enterococci and selection of resistant mutants were shown to be influenced by the pharmacokinetik parameters of the individual substances.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of 2-acetylpyridine-1-oxide thiosemicarbazones.
AB  - We have investigated the in vitro antibacterial activity of 13 2-acetylpyridine-1-oxide thiosemicarbazones and 5 thiosemicarbazides against 80 clinically significant bacterial cultures, including 13 isolates with known antibiotic resistance. Of the thiosemicarbazones tested, 5 had minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.25 microgram/ml for Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates; 1 of these had an MIC range of 0.25-0.5 microgram/ml for the Neisseria meningitidis cultures, and 2 had MICs of 2 and 2-4 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis isolates, respectively. Two of the thiosemicarbazides had MICs of 0.25 microgram/ml for N. gonorrhoeae, whereas 2 others had MICs of 2-4 and 4-8 micrograms/ml for S. aureus and S. faecalis isolates, respectively. The test compounds were ineffective against the gram-negative enteric cultures and the Pseudomonas isolates.
TI  - In vitro studies of plasmid-mediated penicillinase from Streptococcus faecalis suggest a staphylococcal origin.
AB  - A strain of Streptococcus faecalis with plasmid-mediated penicillinase production was studied further. Partially purified penicillinase from the S. faecalis strain hydrolyzed penicillin, ampicillin, and ureido-penicillins but not penicillinase-resistant semisynthetic penicillins, cephalosporins, or imipenem; hydrolysis was inhibited by clavulanic acid. Hydrolysis of a given antibiotic correlated with a marked increase in the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of that drug when a high inoculum was used. As with most enterococci, the MICs of cephalosporins and penicillinase-resistant semisynthetic penicillins were too high for clinical usefulness, although these agents did not show an inoculum effect. Based upon hybridization under stringent conditions of plasmid DNA from the S. faecalis strain to cloned penicillinase genes from Staphylococcus aureus, it appears that these resistance determinants are highly homologous and suggests that this enzyme was introduced into streptococci from staphylococci.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of seminalplasmin, a basic protein from bovine seminal plasma.
AB  - Seminalplasmin, a 6,000 dalton antimicrobial protein present in bovine seminal plasma, is shown to inhibit growth and/or RNA synthesis in several bacterial species. In only one strain out of twenty one belonging to fourteen species, did both RNA synthesis and growth appear to be resistant to seminalplasmin. The antibacterial activity of seminalplasmin, in the case of E. coli, was also studied as a function of its concentration and of time; the minimal concentration of the protein required for 100% bactericidal activity was only about twice that required for 100% bacteriostatic activity. The killing of E. coli cells proceeded in two phases, a slow phase and then a rapid one, and required several hours for completion. Several bacterial species tested secreted proteases into the medium that destroyed seminalplasmin.
TI  - Bacteriological study of renal calculi.
AB  - The pre-operative urine, pelvic urine, removed calculi and calculus washings were examined bacteriologically in 24 patients undergoing removal of intrarenal calculi. Four of seven patients with struvite calculi had an infected pre-operative midstream urine specimen and six of the seven removed calculi demonstrated significant bacterial growth. Proteus mirabilis was the commonest organism isolated. Of 17 patients with oxalate calculi only one had an infected pre-operative urine culture, but in four cases the removed stones were infected. Quantitative bacteriological culture of the stones and their washings demonstrated that infection is within the stone itself. Pre-operative urine culture failed to predict infection within the stone in 60% of patients with infected stones. The results suggest that the presence of infected urine together with the presence of renal calculus is indication for removal of the calculus.
TI  - Antimicrobial cream susceptibility testing.
AB  - Utilizing a recently described rapid needle extrusion method for determining the  sensitivities of burn wound isolates, we have compiled data on the resistance patterns of over 250 isolates from our burn unit. Major isolate groups were Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, various Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococci. Excellent correlation was exhibited between the inhibitory zone sizes and the minimal inhibitory concentration for 120 organisms tested. Utilizing the needle extrusion sensitivities to facilitate the selection of the burn creams, a significant reduction in the microbiologic flora of the burn wound was noted. The utilization of this technique in the selection of burn creams deserves controlled trials to assess whether changes in topical therapy might alter clinical outcome.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of aridicins, novel glycopeptide antibiotics with high and prolonged levels in blood.
AB  - Three new glycopeptide antibiotics, aridicins A, B, and C, produced by Kibdelosporangium aridum have a spectrum of antimicrobial activity in vitro which is similar to that of vancomycin. The antimicrobial activities of these glycopeptides against clinical bacterial isolates were compared with those of vancomycin and other related glycopeptide antibiotics in vitro by agar dilution and microtiter broth dilution tests and in vivo in mouse protection studies. In vitro they were somewhat less effective than vancomycin against strains of Staphylococcus aureus and less active against coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. However, they were more active than vancomycin against strains of Streptococcus faecalis and markedly superior to vancomycin and other glycopeptide antibiotics against strains of Clostridium difficile. In experimental infections, aridicin A was effective against strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes, although its 50% effective doses were higher than those of vancomycin when administered after infection. After subcutaneous administration, aridicin A had a higher peak level in serum and a longer half-life than vancomycin or teicoplanin. The aridicins were markedly superior to vancomycin when administered prior to infection in mouse protection tests, indicating long-acting potential.
TI  - Infection control during parenteral nutrition therapy.
AB  - Parenteral nutrition therapy can achieve an anabolic state in patients who are unable to maintain normal nitrogen balance; however, it may be associated with infectious complications. Infections may be related to contamination of the cannula and the cannula wound, of the infusate, or of other parts of the parenteral nutrition system. A variety of microorganisms has been associated with these infections. The exact mechanisms that initiate cannula-related infection are poorly understood. Susceptibility of the host, the method and site of cannula insertion, colonization of parenteral nutrition cannulas, use of parenteral nutrition systems for multiple purposes, cannula material, and other factors may all play some role. Controlling infections depend on many factors, including quality control processes to ensure sterility of parenteral nutrition solutions, attention to aseptic technique during cannula insertion, procedures to prevent in-use contamination, proper care of the cannula insertion site, and proper management of other parts of the parenteral nutrition system. In addition, infectious complications appear to be reduced by an organized team that follows infection control protocols. Many facets of parenteral nutrition therapy are based on data from uncontrolled clinical investigations. Well-designed, controlled clinical trials may provide data that will further minimize the risks associated with parenteral nutrition therapy.
TI  - Streptococcal phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system: purification  and characterization of a phosphoprotein phosphatase which hydrolyzes the phosphoryl bond in seryl-phosphorylated histidine-containing protein.
AB  - Histidine-containing protein (HPr) of gram-positive bacteria was found to be phosphorylated at a seryl residue (P-ser-HPr) in an ATP-dependent reaction catalyzed by a protein kinase (J. Deutscher and M. H. Saier, Jr., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80:6790-6794, 1983). Here we describe the purification and characterization of a soluble enzyme of Streptococcus faecalis which splits the phosphoryl bond in P-ser-HPr. The enzyme has a molecular weight of ca. 7.5 X 10(4), as determined by its migration behavior on a Sephacryl S-200 column. On native polyacrylamide gels the purified enzyme produced only one protein band. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels we found one major protein band of molecular weight 2.9 X 10(4) and two minor protein bands of molecular weights 2.3 X 10(4) and 7 X 10(4). Fructose 1,6-diphosphate, which stimulated the ATP-dependent, protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of HPr, had no effect on the phosphatase activity. Other glycolytic intermediates also had no effect. However, inorganic phosphate, which inhibited the ATP-dependent HPr kinase, stimulated the P-ser-HPr phosphatase. EDTA at a concentration of 0.1 mM completely inhibited the phosphatase. Divalent cations like Mg2+, Mn2+, and Co2+ overcame the inhibition by EDTA. Fe2+, Zn2+, and Cu2+ had no effect, whereas Ca2+ slightly inhibited the phosphatase. ATP was also found to inhibit the phosphatase. Under conditions in which ATP severely inhibited the phosphatase, ADP was found to have no effect on the enzyme activity. Besides P-ser-HPr of S. faecalis, the phosphatase was also able to hydrolyze the phosphoryl bond in P-ser-HPr of Streptococcus lactis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Lactobacillus casei. Phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside phosphorylation, catalyzed by the S. aureus phosphoenolpyruvate:lactose phosphotransferase system, was about 150-fold decreased in the presence of P-ser-HPr of S. aureus, as compared with HPr. However, when P-ser-HPr was first incubated with P-ser-HPr phosphatase to allow complete hydrolysis of the phosphoryl bond, it had the same activity as HPr. Besides this cytoplasmic phosphoprotein phosphatase, we detected a membrane-bound phosphatase which also hydrolyzed the phosphoryl bond in P-ser-HPr.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin in serum and urine against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Ten volunteers received three doses of 500 mg ciprofloxacin, orally every 12 hours. After the last dose, mean serum levels were (mg/l +/- SD) 2.4 +/- 0.83 at 1 h; 0.91 +/- 0.30 at 4 h and 0.18 +/- 0.04 at 12 h. At 1 h the median serum bactericidal activity was satisfactory only against the Escherichia coli (1:256) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1:128). In urine collected from 0 to 4 h and 8 to 12 h after the last dose, the mean ciprofloxacin level was respectively 482.5 +/- 324.7 and 80.9 +/- 48.2 mg/l +/- SD. Bactericidal activity in urine was high even against the least susceptible species tested: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. A post antibiotic effect was demonstrated in 22 out of the 29 strains tested, ranging mainly from 1 to 3 h. Ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice a day is a bactericidal regimen against a wide range of urinary pathogens but has a limited systemic activity.
TI  - Phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. 1H NMR studies on chemically modified HPr proteins.
AB  - The low-pK tyrosyl residue present in the heat-stable proteins (HPr) of all Gram-positive bacteria studied until now has been labeled by tetranitromethane in the HPr of Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus faecalis. The nitrotyrosyl derivatives obtained are fully active in the complementation assay. The labeled tyrosyl residues could be identified as Tyr-37 in both proteins. Reinvestigation of the low-pK tyrosyl residue in HPr of Staphylococcus aureus resulted in the same assignment. In all three proteins an interaction between nitrotyrosine-37 and the active center His-15 could be observed, leading to an increase in the pK of His-15 and a change of its chemical shift parameters. The 1H NMR lines of the complete aromatic spin system of HPr of B. subtilis could be assigned by the nitration studies. Labeling of Arg-17 in HPr of S. aureus and S. faecalis by 1,2-cyclohexanedione in the presence of borate ions causes an almost complete inhibition of its enzymatic activity. In the NMR spectrum the labeling of the arginyl residue influences the resonance lines of His-15: two new resonance lines for the C-2 protons of equal intensity are observed, a fact that could be explained by two different conformations in slow exchange. The pK value of His-15 was not changed by the labeling, excluding Arg-17 as responsible for the low pK of His-15.
TI  - A prospective study of adverse reactions associated with vancomycin therapy.
AB  - A prospective evaluation of the efficacy and safety of vancomycin was conducted in 54 consecutive patients over a 16-month period. Vancomycin was curative in 95% of 43 patients with proven infection. Drugs were ceased in six patients because of adverse reactions; in three of these vancomycin was considered the likely cause. Reactions included thrombophlebitis (20 of 54 patients), rash (4 of 54), nephrotoxicity (4 of 50), proteinuria (1 of 50) and ototoxicity (1 of 11 patients tested by audiometry). Thrombophlebitis occurred only with infusion through peripheral cannulae; nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity were confined to patients receiving an aminoglycoside plus vancomycin. We conclude that vancomycin, administered appropriately, constitutes safe, effective therapy for infections caused by susceptible bacteria.
TI  - Evaluation of Malthus 128H microbiological growth analyser for detecting significant bacteriuria.
AB  - In a pilot study a prototype Malthus 128H microbiological growth analyser was used to study the growth of six commonly encountered urinary pathogens in a range of five different laboratory media. No single medium had been able to show acceptable conductance changes for all bacteria within five hours. Subsequently, the Malthus system, with fastidious anaerobe broth as the culture medium, was used to screen 500 consecutive clinical specimens of urine for significant bacteriuria. After two and a half hours the Malthus system detected 32 out of the 40 true positives and eight of the 44 contaminated urines. Increasing the detection time to five hours permitted the recognition of 39 true positives and 37 contaminated urines.
TI  - Comparative in vitro inhibitory and killing activity of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and cefotaxime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant and tolerant and nontolerant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - With a macrotube dilution method, MICs and MBCs were determined for three aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, cefpirome (HR 810), ceftazidime, and cefotaxime, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant, -susceptible, and -tolerant strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Comparatively, cefpirome was the most active agent against all gram-positive cocci, including enterococci and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and was as active as ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa. MBCs of cefpirome were within two dilutions of the MICs for 91% of P. aeruginosa and 90% of gram-positive cocci strains tested, except methicillin-resistant S. aureus, for which the MBCs were within three dilutions for 90% of strains.
TI  - The bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. Isolation  of active site peptides by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and determination of their primary structure.
AB  - Using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) it was possible to isolate 32P-labelled active-site regions of various proteins from the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. The purified peptides obtained by proteolytic cleavage with Lys-C protease and trypsin were sequenced by the gas phase method. The fragments derived from enzyme I (MW 70 000) of two streptococcal species show 100% homology. The analogous peptide of Staphylococcus aureus Enzyme I differs in the N-terminal region. A labelled peptide from the glucose-specific enzyme III protein of Escherichia coli obtained by cleavage with alkaline protease was isolated and sequenced. It could be fitted into the primary structure of this protein, which was derived from DNA sequence data. The active-site histidine residue of this protein is therefore localized at position 91. The HPLC separation method described is suitable for the isolation of peptides derived from active sites containing labile amino acid derivatives such as phosphohistidines.
TI  - [Influence of chlorhexidine on the flora of burns].
AB  - The effect of chlorhexidine baths on surface and in-depth colonization of burns was studied in 12 severely burned patients. 202 swabs and 202 biopsy specimens were cultured. Each patient was sampled before and after a daily chlorhexidine bath on several days. Subsequent to bathing, 41% of swabs became sterile and a 1.41 log10 reduction in the number of germs in biopsy specimens was observed. However, deep flora was unchanged in almost half of cases (43.3%) and was reduced by only 1 to 2 log10 in one-third of cases (35.3%). Chlorhexidine added to baths inhibited surface bacterial growth but had an inconsistent and limited effect on in-depth colonization.
TI  - [Measure of the activity of a quaternary aldehyde-ammonia complex against reference bacteria strains and 50 hospital strains].
AB  - Concentrations of a disinfectant complex effective against hospital strains were  determined using the dilution-neutralization method (AFNOR T72 150). Results were compared to those obtained with reference bacterial strains. A 99.999% reduction in viable bacteria requires significantly higher concentrations for hospital isolates than for reference strains.
TI  - [Computerized analysis of activity profiles of beta-lactams].
AB  - This study was designed to compare the in vitro activities of recent cephalosporins and other beta-lactams. One of our objectives was to determine whether the microbiologist could use a single cephalosporin for routine antibiotic sensitivity testing. All the strains studied were recovered from outpatients. Sensitivity and/or resistance were evaluated by MIC determination, according to a program developed in our laboratory, using a personal computer. Using special programs, patterns of activities of beta-lactams were determined quantitatively and graphically for each bacterial strain tested. For most strains ceftriaxone, and to a lesser extent moxalactam and cefoperazone, exhibited greater antibacterial activity than the other beta-lactams, except against group D streptococci. For Enterobacteriaceae, cefadroxil is satisfactory in screening for in vitro activity of cephalosporins.
TI  - [HR 810 (cefpirome). Experimental evaluation of the in vitro and in vivo antibiotic activity of a new amino-2-thiazole methoxy- imino cephalosporin].
AB  - HR 810 or cefpirome is a new amino thiazole cephalosporin whose specific characteristic is a cyclopentenopyridinium group in position 3 of the cephem nucleus. This structure is responsible for a broad spectrum of activity, covering Enterobacteriaceae, including cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and group D Streptococci.
TI  - [Cefpirome (HR 810). A new broad spectrum cephalosporin].
AB  - HR 810 or cefpirome is a new 2-amino-thiazol cephalosporin whose salient characteristic is a bicyclic nucleus, namely cyclopenteno-pyridinium, in position 3. This nucleus imparts a broad spectrum of activity that includes Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria, non-D Streptococcus and Haemophilus. Cefpirome is also active, although to a lesser extent, against Streptococcus faecalis and Acinetobacter.
TI  - In-vitro activity of Sch 34343 against nosocomial pathogens: methicillin-resistant staphylococci, gentamicin-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus faecalis, Clostridium difficile and Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of Sch 34343, a new beta-lactam antimicrobial, was studied  in vitro by quantitative broth dilution methods. It was found to have good antibacterial activity against four emerging problem pathogens: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis isolates showing high level resistance to gentamicin (and other aminoglycosides), Clostridium difficile (the cause of pseudomembranous colitis), and Bacteroides fragilis. On the basis of these promising results, Sch 34343 merits further in-vitro and in-vivo study to define its potential usefulness in treatment of infections with these pathogens in humans.
TI  - Neonatal septicaemia.
AB  - A total of 410 proved cases of neonatal septicaemia from seven Finnish hospitals  seen between 1976 and 1980 were reviewed. The annual incidence of neonatal septicaemia was 3 per 1000 births, and overall mortality was 23%. Onset was early in most patients. Symptoms of septicaemia occurred within the first 24 hours of life in 44% and within the first week of life in 90%. In the very early onset disease (within 24 hours) mortality was 30%, compared with 17% in all other cases. Group B streptococcus was the leading cause in very early onset disease (52%) but mortality from infection with this organism was similar to that in other very early onset cases. It is concluded that very early onset neonatal septicaemia, probably of intrauterine origin and caused by group B streptococcus in one half of the cases, constitutes the major form of neonatal septicaemia in Finland and should receive the highest priority in preventive measures.
TI  - Microbiological effectiveness of a reduced concentration of Buckley's formocresol.
AB  
TI  - UV inactivation of pathogenic and indicator microorganisms.
AB  - Survival was measured as a function of the dose of germicidal UV light for the bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Shigella sonnei, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis spores, the enteric viruses poliovirus type 1 and simian rotavirus SA11, the cysts of the protozoan Acanthamoeba castellanii, as well as for total coliforms and standard plate count microorganisms from secondary effluent. The doses of UV light necessary for a 99.9% inactivation of the cultured vegetative bacteria, total coliforms, and standard plate count microorganisms were comparable. However, the viruses, the bacterial spores, and the amoebic cysts required about 3 to 4 times, 9 times, and 15 times, respectively, the dose required for E. coli. These ratios covered a narrower relative dose range than that previously reported for chlorine disinfection of E. coli, viruses, spores, and cysts.
TI  - Streptococcus faecalis sex pheromone (cAM373) also produced by Staphylococcus aureus and identification of a conjugative transposon (Tn918).
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis RC73 was found to harbor a conjugative plasmid (pAM373) which confers a mating response to a sex pheromone (cAM373) excreted by plasmid-free members of the same species. The pheromone was also detected in culture filtrates of all of 23 Staphylococcus aureus strains but in only 2 of 22 coagulase negative staphylococcus strains. Streptococcus sanguis Challis and G9B also produced the activity, but 10 other Streptococcus sanguis strains did not. The activity was also produced by Streptococcus faecium 9790. A tetracycline resistance (Tc) determinant present in S. faecalis RC73 was not associated with pAM373 but served as a useful marker in efforts to identify pAM373 among other plasmids present in the strain. Analyses of the Tc determinant showed that it was located on a conjugative transposon very similar to Tn916. Designated Tn918, the transposon could insert into pAM373 as well as into two other hemolysin plasmids. Whereas pAM373 derivatives transferred very well between strains of Streptococcus faecalis, the plasmid would not establish in Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus sanguis. However, a derivative of pAM373 carrying Tn918 proved to be a useful delivery vehicle for generating transposon insertions into multiple sites on the staphylococcal chromosome.
TI  - [Sensitivity to cefotiam of 494 hospital bacterial strains. Determination of minimal inhibitory concentration and comparison with other beta-lactams].
AB  - Susceptibility to cefotiam of 494 bacterial strains was studied by MIC determination using an agar dilution assay. Activity of cefotiam was also compared with that of six other beta-lactams (ampicillin, mezlocillin, ticarcillin, cefalotin, cefotaxime, and moxalactam) using an agar diffusion method. Cefotiam showed a wide antibacterial spectrum including more than 70% of Enterobacteriaceae (except Serratia), beta-lactamase-producing and non-beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae, non-enterococcus streptococci, and penicillinase-producing and non-penicillinase-producing staphylococci susceptible to methicillin. Conversely, cefotiam was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratum, Streptococcus faecalis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Comparative in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of flurithromycin by means of the MS-2 Abbott Research System.
AB  - The study reports the results of an in vitro comparative evaluation of flurithromycin by means of MS-2 research system analyzing the growth curve patterns of recently isolated strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. faecalis and H. influenzae. Flurithromycin is provided with superior activity to that of josamycin and practically superimposed on that of erythromycin. Of the 4 bacterial species studied, S. faecalis is the most sensitive, followed by Staphylococci and H. influenzae in decreasing order of sensitivity.
TI  - In vitro activity of enoxacin compared with norfloxacin and amikacin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of enoxacin was tested against 1000 clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms and compared with that of norfloxacin and amikacin. The MIC90 of enoxacin was 1 mg/l for Enterobacteriaceae, 2.6 mg/l for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 6.2 mg/l or Staphylococcus aureus. The inoculum effect was minimal. The MICs and MBCs for Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were significantly affected by the addition of calcium and magnesium ions. Synergy was occasionally observed between enoxacin and the antibiotics tested; antagonism was rare.
TI  - In vitro activity of six antibiotics against multiresistant staphylococci and other gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Sixty-two strains of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci,  21 Streptococcus faecalis and 17 other strains of streptococci isolated from cases of endocarditis were tested for sensitivity against rifampicin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, fusidic acid, erythromycin and novobiocin. Only rifampicin, novobiocin and teicoplanin were found to be active against the great majority of these strains. The microbial properties of these antibiotics suggest the necessity of combinations for effective therapy. The combinations rifampicin + novobiocin and rifampicin + teicoplanin were additive and suppressed the emergence of resistant mutants. Thus according to in vitro tests, either of these two combinations would be suitable for prophylactic use in high-risk patients, especially those scheduled to receive prosthetic implants.
TI  - Clinical experience of cefotaxime in infections caused by gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - We studied the activity of cefotaxime both microbiologically and clinically. 138  blood cultures positive for gram-positive cocci were evaluated (90 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 25 of Streptococcus faecalis, 13 of Streptococcus alpha and ten of Streptococcus mutans). Cefotaxime showed good activity against all strains with the exception of S. mutans, of which only 30% were sensitive. Ten cases of gram-positive infections were studied clinically: six sepsis cases and one endocarditis case due to S. aureus, two sepsis cases caused by Streptococcus alpha and one Enterococcus endocarditis case. Therapy was successful in nine; the S. aureus endocarditis failed. The local and general tolerance of cefotaxime was good.
TI  - Trends in bacterial susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Concern over the development of drug resistance by common pathogens has grown over recent years. In order to discover and describe possible trends at this institution, susceptibility data for 18 organisms and 21 antimicrobial agents for the years 1975 through 1982 at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Oklahoma City were reviewed. Summaries of susceptibility data for 64 major combinations of drugs and organisms are presented. Two gram-positive organisms (enterococcus group D and Staphylococcus aureus) as well as a gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) appear to be decreasing in susceptibility to several drugs. However, some gram-negative bacilli (Proteus, Serratia, and Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella pneumoniae) showed evidence of markedly increasing susceptibility to certain drugs.
TI  - [Current aspects of infectious endocarditis. Review of 101 cases].
AB  - One hundred and one cases of infectious endocarditis were reviewed, from 1966 to  1982. The mean age of the patients was 56.3 +/- 15 years. There was a marked predominance of men (70.2 p. 100); the commonest portal of entry was dental (45.9 p. 100); the number of iatrogenic portals of entry and cases of endocarditis on prosthetic valves has been increasing in recent years. Blood cultures were positive in 83 p. 100 of cases; the commonest responsible organism was the non-D streptococcus (31 p. 100 of cases) followed by the D streptococcus (18.8 p. 100), the staphylococcus aureus (17.8 p. 100), and the staphylococcus epidermidis (2.9 p. 100). Gram-negative bacilli were isolated in 9.9 p. 100 of cases. Rare and slow growing organisms have been isolated since 1977. Echocardiography was then introduced and helped the diagnostic in 70 p. 100 of cases. Circulating immune complexes were measured in 25 patients and were found to be raised in 14 cases (56 p. 100). The commonest complication was cardiac failure (43 p. 100) which led to valve replacement in the acute phase in 14 p. 100 of cases. The occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias was a poor prognostic factor. The other complications were neurological (15 p. 100), renal (10 p. 100), embolic (19 p. 100), and pulmonary (9 p. 100). The mortality rate in the acute phase was 30 p. 100 and the probability of a five year survival was 54 p. 100.
TI  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of ceftriaxone in comparison with nine other  antibiotics.
AB  - The results of a large three centre co-ordinated study into the in vitro susceptibility of bacterial clinical pathogens showed no significant evidence of regional variation within the U.K. towards the 10 antibiotics examined. The newer cephalosporins were highly potent and superior to other antibiotics against the Enterobacteriaceae, with ceftriaxone and cefotaxime the most potent. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, gentamicin was the most active, followed by ceftazidime, piperacillin and ceftriaxone; cefotetan was the least active. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus albus were most susceptible to cefuroxime and gentamicin, though most were also susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and cefoxitin. Streptococcus (Groups A and B), Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria spp. were susceptible to most agents other than gentamicin, but ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were overall the most potent. Ceftriaxone was the most active agent against Haemophilus influenzae. The newer agents were variable and relatively poor against anaerobes and only amoxycillin and piperacillin were significantly active against Streptococcus faecalis. The overall resistance level to the third generation cephalosporins was low.
TI  - Deficiency of neutrophil bactericidal activity in term and preterm infants. A longitudinal study.
AB  - The present longitudinal study of 40 healthy term infants and 20 preterm infants  shows that neutrophil bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis is transiently but significantly impaired in term infants during the 1st week of life. The deficiency is more severe and prolonged in preterm infants, and may contribute to the neonate's increased susceptibility to infections.
TI  - The effects of hypothermia on neutrophil function in vitro.
AB  - Hypothermia may be associated with compromised host defenses and serious bacterial infections in man. We have examined the effects of moderate hypothermia (29 degrees C) on neutrophil function in vitro. At 29 degrees C, neutrophil phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus was impaired. In contrast, neutrophil killing of Streptococcus faecalis was most affected by hypothermia. Phagocytosis, as measured by neutrophil ingestion of opsonized oil-red-O-particles, was reduced at 29 degrees C over the 15 min of observation. Neutrophil metabolism linked to bactericidal pathways dependent on oxidative metabolism was reduced at 29 degrees C. Hexose monophosphate pathway (HMP) activity in neutrophils early after stimulation with latex particles was reduced. After 2 hr HMP activity was similar at 29 degrees C and 37 degrees C. Neotetrazolium dye reduction was reduced early after latex stimulation of neutrophils and after 30 min it was similar to cells at 37 degrees C. Leukocyte migration under agarose to bacterial-derived and formyl-methionyl-phenylalanine chemotactic factors was reduced by 50% and 70%, respectively. Migration to serum-derived chemotactic factor was reduced by only 20%. When cells were cooled to 29 degrees C for 30 to 90 min and rewarmed, neutrophil function was normal. These effects of hypothermia on neutrophil function may explain, in part, the increased incidence of serious and frequently fatal bacterial infections in man.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of recently developed quinolone compounds--with a note on  the frequency of resistant mutants.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of the new quinolone compounds enoxacin, norfloxacin,  ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin was evaluated in 300 Enterobacteriaceae, 50 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 30 Acinetobacter spp., 15 Haemophilus influenzae, 50 Streptococcus faecalis, and 70 Staphylococcus aureus isolates and compared to that of nalidixic acid, gentamicin and various beta-lactam compounds. Moreover, the rate of spontaneous mutants resistant to quinolone compounds was evaluated. In concentrations only insignificantly exceeding the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), mutants could be isolated rather frequently (approx. 10(-6) fold); in concentrations of at least 10 times the MIC resistant mutants were barely detectable. In general, the mutants exhibited a 4- to 8-fold increase of the MIC as compared to the wild strain. In S. faecalis mutants were not detectable, whereas they occurred in low frequency (less than 10(-8) fold) in S. aureus strains. In all mutants there was almost, but not entirely, complete cross-resistance between the quinolone derivatives.
TI  - Sex pheromones and plasmid transfer in Streptococcus faecalis: a pheromone, cAM373, which is also excreted by Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  
TI  - Effect of hyperbaric oxyhelium gas on response of bacteria to antimicrobial agents in vitro.
AB  - Modern diving techniques can require the treatment of infection in an atmosphere  of pressurized oxyhelium gas. The antibiotic susceptibility of 16 species and strains (eight genera) of gram-negative bacilli and 3 species and strains (two genera) of gram-positive cocci to each of 21 antimicrobial agents was assessed in air at atmospheric pressure and in oxyhelium gas at an absolute pressure of 7 bar (ca. 709 kPa). A disk diffusion technique was employed, and significantly different results were obtained in the two atmospheres. The effect of oxyhelium on diameters of growth inhibition varied significantly with the bacterium and with the antibiotic and was particularly marked with certain bacterium-antibiotic combinations. The gram-negative bacilli generally gave reduced zone diameters in oxyhelium, whereas the gram-positive cocci showed a mixture of effects.
TI  - Intraprostatic concentration of ciprofloxacin and its activity against urinary pathogens.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ciprofloxacin against 376 urinary pathogens was determined. The minimal inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the Enterobacteriaceae were 0.03-0.23 mg/l, for Pseudomonas aeruginosa 0.37 mg/l, for Streptococcus faecalis 0.75 mg/l and for Staphylococcus aureus 0.92 mg/l. A 100 mg dose of ciprofloxacin was administered intravenously to 25 patients undergoing prostatectomy. The concentrations in prostate and serum were measured at different intervals. Peak levels in prostate were 3.0 micrograms/g attained 20 min after administration. Peak serum levels were 1.2 mg/l attained 20 min after administration. Serum and prostate elimination was slowly. The overall serum: prostate ratio 1:2.1.
TI  - The effect of cytotoxic therapy on saliva and oral flora.
AB  - Oral complications of cytotoxic therapy result from direct mucosal damage and, indirectly, occur as a consequence of immunosuppression. Such problems are further exacerbated as a result of associated xerostomia and secondary infection. Therefore, the aims of this study were to examine the salivary volume and composition (amylase, IgA, and lysozyme) together with the oral carriage of potential pathogens in patients receiving cytotoxic therapy. A pilot study comparing healthy controls with patients on chemotherapy for malignant conditions indicated that there were differences between the two groups. Therefore, a longitudinal study was initiated and twelve patients were assessed prior to and 4 and 12 weeks after the start of cytotoxic therapy. The 10-minute forced-spitting salivary volume and amylase and IgA levels all declined significantly over the 12-week period. Lysozyme content did not change. A quantitative increase in the oral carriage of Candida species, coliforms, and Staphylococcus aureus was also observed during therapy. Hence, it is concluded that cytotoxic chemotherapy results in a decreased salivary flow, a reduction in salivary amylase and IgA, and an increase in the oral carriage of opportunistic pathogens.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against uropathogenic organisms].
AB  - Ciprofloxacin (Bay 09867) is a new quinoline derivative. Its activity against 537 urinary bacterial isolates was compared with those of ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, nalidixic and oxolinic acids, norfloxacin, trimethoprim, and other antimicrobial agents, when appropriate. It inhibited 90% Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., E, coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., and Serratia spp. at less than or equal to 0.78 microgram/ml. The majority of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including gentamicin-resistant strains, was inhibited by less than or equal to 3.12 micrograms/ml. MICs of Bay 09867 for 90% of Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains, and Streptococcus faecalis were 0.78 micrograms/ml and 1.56 micrograms/ml respectively. Bay 09867 inhibited organisms resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cefazolin, nalidixic and oxolinic acids and trimethoprim.
TI  - [The dilution method in the determination of bacterial sensitivity to antibiotics].
AB  
TI  - A new approach for presumptive identification of clinically important streptococci.
AB  - Several tests, bacitracin, CAMP, pyroglutamic acid-B-naphthylamide test (PYR test), bile aesculin hydrolysis, salt tolerance and pigment production tests were evaluated for their reliability and speed in presumptive identification of streptococci. Bacitracin correctly identified all of the group A streptococci but 5% of other beta haemolytic streptococci were misidentified as group A. The PYR reaction was just as sensitive but more specific for group A streptococci and the results were available within 2-3 h. The PYR reaction also effectively differentiated between enterococcal and non-enterococcal group D streptococci. Both the salt tolerance test and the PYR reaction misidentified bile aesculin positive non-group D streptococci as non-enterococcal group D streptococci. Pigment production by group B streptococci was more reliable than the CAMP test for identifying group B streptococci. The combination of PYR, bile aesculin and pigment production allowed rapid differentiation of several medically important groups of streptococci.
TI  - A microbiological study of various food premises with an assessment of cleaning and disinfection practices.
AB  - A study of cleaning and disinfection methods in a variety of types of catering premises has been carried out. The level of bacterial contamination of the hands and of equipment was related to cleaning methods and to the type of catering establishment. Wiping cloths were frequently contaminated with Escherichia coli, and these may be important reservoirs of bacteria for contamination of the hands of catering staff. Regular and efficient cleaning of food surfaces and equipment was found to be more important than the use of a disinfectant as part of the cleaning process. Methods for reducing the risks of cross-contamination in catering premises are discussed.
TI  - Quality control of susceptibility tests with 5-micrograms trimethoprim disks.
AB  - In 1981 and again in 1984, we performed multi-laboratory studies to develop quality control limits for susceptibility tests with 5-micrograms trimethoprim disks. Zone size limits of 21 to 28 mm are recommended for tests with Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and limits of 19 to 26 mm are recommended for tests with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. For screening Mueller-Hinton agar, tests with Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 33186 or ATCC 29212 are recommended: zones should be fairly clear and greater than or equal to 22 mm (trimethoprim disks) or greater than or equal to 24 mm (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole disks).
TI  - [Bathing caps and germ shedding of human scalp hair].
AB  - With three groups of 30 test subjects each, having short, medium-long and long hair, as well as with a model test using a woman's wig it was possible to show that by wearing bathing caps the transfer of germs from the scalp hairs to the swimming-pool water can be reduced considerably, either by the isolation of the hairs from water when snugly fitting water-tight bathing caps are used, or by a reduction of the germ-carrying hair surface rinsed by the water, which is always the case, even when using water-permeable caps. The effect is the greater, the larger the natural hair surface is. The rule that persons with long hair of either sex should wear bathing caps proves again justified although the prescriptive use of bathing caps by "the long-haired" earlier was based on other concepts. The population of germs settling on bathing caps does not in the least reach the germ counts discharged into the swimming-pool water when no headgear is used. Nevertheless, the issue of disposable bathing caps, which is occasionally practised, must be welcomed for reasons of hygiene. The use of bathing caps not only diminishes the discharge of colony forming units (CFU) but also prevents the indicators of pollution, pathological and occasionally pathological germs being washed into the water from the hair. Reference is also made to the possibility that a snugly fitting bathing cap protects the swimmer against the risk of contracting otitis.
TI  - Role of resistance to starvation in bacterial survival in sewage and lake water.
AB  - A study was conducted to determine the significance of starvation resistance to the ability of a species to survive in sewage and lake water. Tests were conducted for periods of up to 14 days. Rhizobium meliloti and one fluorescent and one nonfluorescent strain of Pseudomonas were resistant to starvation because their population sizes did not fall appreciably in buffer and sterile lake water, and the first two maintained high numbers after being added to sterile sewage. Cell densities of these bacterial species dropped slowly in nonsterile sewage, and more cells of these three organisms than of the other test organisms remained in nonsterile lake water. Rhizobium leguminosarum was moderately resistant to starvation because its numbers fell slowly in buffer and sterile lake water and did not change appreciably in sterile sewage. The abundance of Micrococcus flavus added to buffer and sterile lake water did not change, but the density of M. flavus declined in nonsterile lake water. The abundance of R. leguminosarum fell in nonsterile lake water and nonsterile sewage. Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, an asporogenous strain of Bacillus subtilis, and Streptococcus sp. were susceptible to starvation because their populations were markedly reduced in buffer. Populations of the last three species declined rapidly in nonsterile and sterile samples of lake water and sewage. S. faecalis declined rapidly when added to nonsterile lake water and sewage and sterile lake water but not when added to sterile sewage, the persistence in the last instance probably being associated with the availability of organic nutrients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Evaluation of the automicrobic system for detection of resistance of Staphylococcus aureus to methicillin.
AB  - The AutoMicrobic system (AMS) (Vitek System, Inc., Hazelwood, Mo.) was tested for its ability to determine oxacillin and gentamicin susceptibility of 98 known oxacillin-susceptible and 103 known oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates. AMS and reference oxacillin susceptibility results were in agreement for all 95 (100%) oxacillin-susceptible isolates. In contrast, only 23 (22.3%) of the 103 known oxacillin-resistant isolates were correctly reported. For the known oxacillin-resistant isolates, 65 received AMS reports at 3 to 4 h, with only 9% being correct, whereas 38 were reported at 5 to 6 h, with 47% being correct. The reliability of AMS gentamicin susceptibility results was evaluated by testing the 198 S. aureus isolates in parallel with MIC-2000 broth dilution tests. AMS gentamicin susceptibility results were found to be reliable and essentially identical to MIC-2000 results. The possibility of improving AMS oxacillin resistance detection by using gentamicin resistance as a linked screening marker for oxacillin resistance was evaluated with data from the parallel AMS and MIC-2000 gentamicin susceptibility tests and from data accrued on recent clinical laboratory isolates. By these two approaches, respective sensitivities of 97 and 99.8%, and specificity of 72%, were found for detection of oxacillin-resistant isolates by using gentamicin resistance as a marker.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of teichomycin and vancomycin alone and in combination with rifampin and aminoglycosides against staphylococci and enterococci.
AB  - The activity of teichomycin A2 was compared with that of vancomycin in vitro against clinical isolates of staphylococci and enterococci. Teichomycin A2 was more active than vancomycin active against all isolates tested. Synergistic studies also demonstrated that teichomycin A2 combined with rifampin is more active than vancomycin combined with rifampin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates. Teichomycin A2, either singly or in combination with an aminoglycoside, was more active against Streptococcus faecalis isolates.

AB  - A mixture of amphoteric surfactants with antimicrobial properties, C31G, was evaluated as a teat dip by a modified excised teat model. The model was modified to avoid misinterpretation of results from indigenous bacterial microflora on teats. In three experiments, bacterial numbers recovered from teats dipped in .75, 1.5, and 3.0% solutions of C31G were compared with bacteria recovered from undipped teats (negative controls) and teats dipped with 1.0% iodophor (an effective teat dip). Mean log reductions of teat end concentrations of Staphylococcus, aureus, Streptococcus fecalis, and Escherichia coli were determined in each experiment. Efficacy was greatest for the 3.0% solution of C31G with mean log reductions (Log reduction = Log 10 of controls - Log 10 of dipped teats) 3.53 for Staphylococcus aureus, 2.89 for Streptococcus fecalis, and 3.16 for Escherichia coli. Iodophor (1%) yielded mean log reductions of 3.26 for Staphylococcus aureus, 2.16 for Streptococcus fecalis, and 2.83 for Escherichia coli. For all three organisms, number of viable organisms decreased with increasing concentrations of C31G. The efficacy of C31G should be evaluated in vivo.

AB  - Damage to DNA by bleomycin in vitro is entirely dependent on the presence of an iron salt and molecular oxygen. This same reaction has been used to measure non-protein-bound iron in different bacterial species. Although several of the species examined were insensitive to the toxic effects of bleomycin, they all contained a concentration of non-protein-bound iron which should have been sufficient to allow iron-dependent damage to DNA. Other factors such as permeability or inactivation of the drug must explain their apparent insensitivity.
TI  - Imipenem therapy of experimental Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis endocarditis.
AB  - Imipenem was very active in vitro against 36 Staphylococcus aureus isolates from  cases of infective endocarditis; the MBC90 was 0.06 mg/l (four- to eight-fold more active than nafcillin). The in-vitro activity of imipenem against 22 Streptococcus faecalis isolates from proven endocarditis cases was similar to that of penicillin G (MBC90 = 8 mg/l). Imipenem was compared with nafcillin and with penicillin plus gentamicin in the therapy of experimental endocarditis induced in rabbits by Staph. aureus and Str. faecalis, respectively. The dosages were chosen to simulate closely serum antibiotic concentrations found in humans receiving standard parenteral regimens. Imipenem was more rapidly bactericidal than nafcillin in experimental staphylococcal endocarditis. The mean +/- S.D. Staph. aureus concentrations within aortic valve vegetations (log10 cfu/g) after 5 days of therapy were as follows: imipenem = 1.39 +/- 0.61 versus nafcillin 2.39 +/- 0.36 (P less than 0.02). Both the imipenem and nafcillin regimens resulted in 'sterile' vegetations in congruent to 50% of rabbits with experimental staphylococcal endocarditis after 5 days of therapy (P greater than 0.05). Imipenem was also equivalent to penicillin plus gentamicin in the therapy of experimental enterococcal endocarditis for 5 days, as assessed by the mean cfu/g vegetation and the percentage of vegetations rendered sterile. However, 7 days of therapy cured experimental enterococcal endocarditis in 72% of rabbits receiving penicillin plus gentamicin versus 20% for imipenem alone (P less than 0.05). Imipenem deserves further evaluation in the therapy of infective endocarditis, both in experimental animal models of infection and in humans. This agent may prove useful in the therapy of staphylococcal endocarditis in a variety of difficult clinical situations. Therapy of enterococcal endocarditis with imipenem alone is not advisable, pending further data.
TI  - The chromosomal 3',5"-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase in Streptococcus pneumoniae is closely related to its plasmid-coded homologs in Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The apparently chromosomally encoded 3',5"-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (type III), from the high-level aminoglycoside-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae BM4200, was compared with homologous enzymes coded for by the plasmids pJH1 and pSH2, originally isolated from Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively, and also found in a wild strain of S. aureus, BM4600. The enzymes appeared to be indistinguishable, and we conclude that the gene encoding 3',5"-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (type III) can cross generic barriers within gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of antimicrobial drugs in simulated urine specimens at various temperatures of incubation.
AB  - A total of 23 antimicrobial drugs were examined for bactericidal activity in midstream-urine against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, or Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 at incubation temperatures of 35, 22, and 7 degrees C, respectively. The majority of chemotherapeutic agents significantly reduced bacterial inocula within 2 h at 35 degrees C. At room temperature, most drugs required 4 h for significant killing activity to ensue. At 7 degrees C only nitrofurantoin, polymyxin B, and rifampin were significantly active within 2 to 4 h following exposure. Following prolonged (overnight) incubation at 7 degrees C, however, 10 of 23 drugs (amikacin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, netilmicin, nitrofurantoin, polymyxin B, rifampin, and vancomycin) effected reduction of bacterial colony counts of greater than or equal to 50%. On the basis of these data it is recommended that urine specimens from patients with known antibacterial chemotherapy should not be refrigerated for longer than 2 to 4 h following collection.
TI  - Cefamandole therapy in hand infections.
AB  - Hand lacerations, especially when inadequately treated, may result in infections  caused by aerobic or anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobic infections most commonly result from human bite injuries in which there is contact between hand and mouth. The search continues for an ideal antibiotic to employ when anaerobic organisms are suspected. In this study cefamandole, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, was employed whenever anaerobic hand infections were suspected following trauma. In each patient quantitative cultures for both aerobic and anaerobic organisms were obtained. All organisms isolated were tested by standard susceptibility assays for both aerobes and anaerobes. In the case of anaerobes, minimum inhibitory concentration assays were also performed. After the initial culture was obtained, each patient received approximately 1.5 gm of cefamandole every 6 hours for a period of 5 days. This therapy was changed only if susceptibility studies indicated resistance to cefamandole. In our patients, 58% of the infectious organisms were aerobic and facultative anaerobic and 42% were obligate anaerobes. The predominant organisms isolated were Staphylococcus aureus and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, which accounted for 42% of the infections. In most of the aerobic infections a single organism was isolated, whereas multiple organisms were identified in the anaerobic infections. All but one of the infections responded to cefamandole; the one that didn't was caused by Enterobacter cloacae and required treatment with an aminoglycoside. Because of its broad-spectrum coverage, which includes both aerobes and anaerobes, cefamandole is useful in treating infections, especially those resulting from human bites.
TI  - In vitro activity of HR 810, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - HR 810, 3-[(2,3-cyclopenteno-1-pyridinium)methyl]-7-[2-syn-methoximino-2-(2-aminothiazole -4-yl)-acetamido] ceph-3-em-4-carboxylate, is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin derivative. The in vitro activity of HR 810 was compared with that of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin and gentamicin using 368 strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. HR 810 was highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, being the most active of the cephalosporins against Enterobacter, Serratia and Citrobacter spp.; the MICs ranged from much less than 0.06 to 8 mg/l. The activity of HR 810 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. was almost as good as that of ceftazidime. The new compound was superior to the other cephalosporins against Staphylococcus aureus and inhibited all Streptococcus faecalis strains at a concentration of 16 mg/l.
TI  - Removal of bacteria from water by adhesion to cross-linked poly(vinylpyridinium halide).
AB  - Cross-linked poly(vinylpyridinium halide) was found to have a novel and remarkable ability to remove bacteria from water. For example, when 10 g (wet weight) of cross-linked poly(N-benzyl-4-vinylpyridinium bromide) was contacted with 20 ml of suspensions of Escherichia coli (9.7 X 10(4) to 9.7 X 10(7)/ml), Salmonella typhimurium (8.0 X 10(6) to 1.1 X 10(7)/ml), Streptococcus faecalis (5.0 X 10(7)/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (8.1 X 10(7)/ml), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.2 X 10(5)/ml) under stirring in sterilized physiological saline at 37 degrees C, 99% of the viable cells of these bacteria were removed in 2 to 6 h. When suspensions of these bacteria (10(5) to 10(8) cells per ml) were passed through a column (20 mm by 100 cm) of cross-linked poly(N-benzyl-4-vinylpyridinium bromide) at 37 degrees C with a flow rate of 0.8 to 1.4 bed volumes per h, 97 to 100% of the viable cells were eliminated from the suspensions during the treatment. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that cross-linked poly(vinylpyridinium halide) irreversibly captured these bacteria alive during the treatment. That is, total organic carbon was removed during the treatment, and the bacteria which adhered to the resin proliferated on the bacterial medium. The adhesion capacity was estimated to be 10(10) cells per g (dry weight). Total organic carbon was also removed even when the bacteria were killed by heat treatment before the column studies.
TI  - The bactericidal, fungicidal and sporicidal properties of hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid.
AB  - The antimicrobial properties of aqueous solutions of peracetic acid and hydrogen  peroxide have been compared. Peracetic acid exhibited excellent antimicrobial properties, especially under acidic conditions. Reductions by a factor of 10(6) in the numbers of vegetative bacteria are obtained within 1 min at 25 degrees C using a solution containing 1.3 mmol/l of peracetic acid. Rapid activity against bacterial spores and yeasts also occurs. Hydrogen peroxide is more effective as a sporicide than as a bactericide, with sporicidal action being obtained using a solution containing 0.88 mol/l. Bactericidal action is poor but hydrogen peroxide was bacteriostatic at concentrations above 0.15 mmol/l.
TI  - [Comparative clinical efficacy of cephotaxim and cefuroxime against the pathogens of inflammation in obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  - The use of cephotaxim in the treatment of obstetric and gynecological patients with various infectious complications, as well as in the treatment of newborn infants in the Department of Intensive Therapy showed it to be highly effective in 100 per cent of the cases. The adverse reactions of cephotaxim were observed in 1 out of 43 patients. It should be noted that cephotaxim did not inhibit the host anaerobic indigenous flora. No cases of dysbacteriosis were recorded. Comparative analysis of the data on determination of the MIC of cephotaxim and cephuroxim with respect to various species of opportunistic microorganisms demonstrated that cephuroxim was more active against Staph. aureus, while cephotaxim against Klebsiella. Cephotaxim displayed activity against part of the strains of Ps. aeruginosa and streptococci of group D, which was not common to cephalosporins of the previous generations.
TI  - Norfloxacin (MK-0366, AM-715): in vitro activity and cross-resistance with other  organic acids including quality control limits for disk diffusion testing.
AB  - Norfloxacin is a new organic acid antimicrobic with an expanded spectrum that includes Staphylococcus spp, most Pseudomonas spp, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus ssp anitratus, some streptococci, as well as nearly all enteric bacilli. The drug appears to be bactericidal. Its expanded spectrum suggests that it should be tested separately by disk diffusion or other susceptibility testing methods. Tentative norfloxacin disk test quality control limits were derived from the results of a multi-laboratory study: Escherichia coli, 28-36 mm; S. aureus, 17-28 mm, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 22-29 mm.
TI  - Single-strain regression analysis for determination of interpretive breakpoints for cefoperazone disk diffusion susceptibility testing.
AB  - A novel approach for setting interpretive breakpoints in disk diffusion antibiotic susceptibility testing according to determined minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) limits is described, using the method of single-strain regression analysis. The procedure was tested on reference strains Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Streptococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), using published results from cefoperazone disk diffusion experiments. The correlation between logarithm of the disk content and inhibition zone diameter squared was linear, excluding three endpoint values. When constants A and B in the new regression line equation were calculated for the four strains, all four showed different regression lines. Zone diameters corresponding to various MICs were calculated for a disk content of 75 micrograms. The values obtained for the four strains were 20.1, 20.9, 24.9, and 25.8 mm, respectively, for an MIC of 16 micrograms/ml, and 15.7, 15.7, 22.3, and 17.9 mm, respectively, for an MIC of 64 micrograms/ml. The following zone diameter breakpoints were determined for the "I" (intermediate) category, using a 75-micrograms disk: S. aureus, 18 to 15 mm; S. faecalis, 23 to 13 mm; E. coli, 20 to 17 mm; and P. aeruginosa, 20 to 17 mm.

AB  - To determine the incidence of infectious endophthalmitis in the early postoperative period following penetrating keratoplasty, and the type and origin of the causative organisms, all cases of penetrating keratoplasty performed at the Emory University affiliated hospitals between January 1977 and March 1982 were reviewed. Four (0.2%) of the 1,876 cases developed infectious endophthalmitis. In all four, evidence of infection developed within 72 hours, and in three the donor rim culture grew the same organism as was obtained from the anterior chamber or vitreous. The causative organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, group D Streptococcus-enterococcus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Eyes with positive donor rim cultures had a 22-fold increased incidence of endophthalmitis.
TI  - Enhancement by Candida albicans of Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, and Streptococcus faecalis in the establishment of infection in mice.
AB  - Candida albicans has been shown to stimulate infection in mice by a number of bacteria. Mice inoculated intraperitoneally with as little as 500 colony-forming units of Staphylococcus aureus along with a nonlethal dose of 10(8) colony-forming units of C. albicans (one-third the dose causing 50% mortality in 7 days) developed widespread staphylococcal infection. S. aureus injected alone at that or considerably higher doses did not establish infection. Phage typing methods demonstrated that the staphylococcal infection was due to the bacterial organisms originally injected. A minimum dose of C. albicans between 1.1 X 10(5) and 1.1 X 10(7) colony-forming units was necessary for the amplification of virulence of S. aureus to take place. Serratia marcescens and Streptococcus faecalis inoculated intraperitoneally at small nonlethal doses could also be recovered from blood and tissues 5 days after animals were dually injected with C. albicans but not from animals which were inoculated with the same amounts of these bacteria alone.

AB  - An equation was derived from known formulas to express the size of the inhibition zone diameter in the disk diffusion antibiotic susceptibility test as a function of the disk content of antibiotic. The equation permitted a calculation of regression line constants for the correlation between zone diameter and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) with a single reference strain. Analysis of reference strains Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, as well as 12 clinical isolates belonging to these species, showed a linearity between zone size squared and the logarithm of disk content in tests with 10-, 30-, and 100-micrograms gentamicin disks. All three species, however, gave regression line constants which were characteristic for the individual bacterial species. Calculations of zone diameter breakpoints corresponding to recommended MIC limits with E. coli and P. aeruginosa reference strains gave an accurate prediction of gentamicin susceptibility. Histogram analysis of 48 strains of Streptococcus faecalis from clinical specimens showed a distribution of zone diameter values which would result in false classification of susceptibility with breakpoints calculated for the other bacterial species studied. Single reference strain analysis of S. faecalis ATCC 29212 (gentamicin MIC, 8 micrograms/ml) permitted the calculation of breakpoints which accurately assigned the strains tested to the intermediate category of susceptibility. Single reference strain analysis offers a quality control method for individual laboratories that allows the determination of inhibition zone diameter breakpoints corresponding to recommended MIC limits with no MIC determinations required.

The serum concentrations of CMX following intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg were 25.6, 10.3, 3.0 micrograms/ml at 30, 60, 120 minutes after injection, respectively. CMX was excreted 60.9% in urine within 6 hours after injection. CMX was administered clinically to 22 pediatric patients with various infections (respiratory tract infection 16 including 1 pyothorax, urinary tract infection 4, tonsillitis with sinusitis 2) at the dose of 39 approximately 96 mg/kg/day for 4 approximately 9 days, and the following satisfactory results were obtained; excellent in 11, good in 9, and poor in 2. The rate of satisfactory clinical response was 90.9%. Eosinophilia 2 cases, slight elevation of transaminase 3 cases, slight elevation of BUN 1 case and transient diarrhea 1 case were observed. But no other serious side effects were observed.
TI  - In vitro activity of teichomycin A 2 in comparison with penicillin and vancomycin against gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Teichomycin A2, a glycopeptide antibiotic from Actinoplanes teichomyceticus, was  tested for its in vitro activity against 190 gram-positive cocci under variable test conditions. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were fairly insensitive to both changes of inoculum size and pH, but were higher on agar than in broth. Teichomycin was about as active as vancomycin against Staphylococcus aureus (both methicillin resistant and sensitive strains), slightly inferior to vancomycin against Staphylococcus epidermidis, and distinctly more active against Streptococcus faecalis.

TI  - A comparison of the antibacterial activities of N-formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787) with those of other recently developed beta-lactam derivatives.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787) was evaluated in 335 clinical isolates of ampicillin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, 50 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 28 Acinetobacter spp., 50 Streptococcus faecalis strains, and 7 oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains and was compared with the recently developed beta-lactam antibiotics mezlocillin, cefuroxime, cefazedone, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, and moxalactam. Among the gram-negative bacteria, N-formimidoyl thienamycin was less active than cefotaxime against Klebsiella, Serratia, and Proteus spp. but had comparable activity against Escherichia coli and Enterobacter strains. Activity of the thienamycin derivative was somewhat lower than that of moxalactam against most of the strains and superior to that of mezlocillin, cefuroxime, and cefoperazone. Moreover, N-formimidoyl thienamycin was the most active drug against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. and had activity comparable to that of ampicillin against Streptococcus faecalis. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin was bactericidal at concentrations less than twice the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) in all gram-negative isolates tested. Oxacillin-resistant staphylococci (MIC of oxacillin, greater than 4 micrograms/ml) were inhibited at low concentrations of the thienamycin derivative (90% MIC, 0.25 micrograms/ml); however, N-formimidoyl thienamycin was not bactericidal at the 90% MIC. The antibacterial activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin against all of the gram-negative bacilli was observed to be independent of beta-lactamase production.
TI  - Conjugative transfer of R-plasmids from Streptococcus faecalis to Staphylococcus  aureus.
AB  - R-plasmids originally isolated from Streptococcus pyogenes(pAC1,pAM15346), Streptococcus agalactiae(pIP501), and Streptococcus faecalis(pAM beta 1) were shown to be self-transferable on filter membranes from S. faecalis JH2-2 to Staphylococcus aureus recipients. The nonconjugative plasmid pAM alpha 1 was mobilized into S. aureus by pAM beta 1. Once in S. aureus, conjugative R-plasmids could be transferred to a second S. aureus recipient or back into S. faecalis. Determinants for chloramphenicol, clindamycin, erythromycin, and tetracycline resistances present on these streptococcal plasmids were expressed in S. aureus. Agarose gel electrophoresis, dye-buoyant centrifugation, and restriction endonuclease digestion showed that the plasmids were maintained intact as self-replicating elements in S. aureus recipients.
TI  - Third-generation cephalosporins: comparative antibacterial activity against routine clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of five third-generation cephalosporins (thienamycin, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, moxalactam and cefoperazone) was compared with that of three second-generation cephalosporins (cefoxitin, cefamandole and cefuroxime) against 313 routine clinical isolates. Thienamycin, ceftazidime, cefotaxime and moxalactam had superior activity against coliform bacilli compared to cefoxitin, cefamandole and cefuroxime. Only three cephalosporins (ceftazidime, thienamycin and cefoperazone) had significant activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both third-and second-generation cephalosporins had similar activity against gram-positive cocci, except for thienamycin, which was the most active cephalosporin against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. No single cephalosporin showed overall superiority in antibacterial activity, but thienamycin and ceftazidime were the most active against the range of bacteria tested.
TI  - HPr proteins of different microorganisms studied by hydrogen-1 high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance: similarities of structures and mechanisms.
AB  - The HPr proteins of Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli were studied by 1H NMR at 360 MHz. The "active-center" histidines of all HPr proteins are characterized by a low pK value between 5.6 and 6.1 and similar spectral parameters. Phosphorylation of the histidyl residues leads to an increase of the pK value of 2-3 units and spectral changes characteristic for N-1 phosphorylation of the histidyl ring. The spectra of the HPr proteins of S. lactis, S. Faecalis, B. subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus reveal many similarities, whereas the spectrum of the E. coli protein is different with exception of the active-center histidine. The HPr protein of S. lactis is formylated at its terminal amino group.

TI  - Comparison of recovery of organisms from blood cultures diluted 10% (volume/volume) and 20% (volume/volume).
AB  - We compared blood cultures that were diluted 1:5 (20%, vol/vol) and 1:10 (10%, vol/vol) and contained specimens from patients with suspected septicemia. Streptococcus pneumoniae was recovered significantly more frequently from blood cultures diluted 20%, whereas gram-negative bacilli, group D streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida spp. were recovered significantly sooner and more frequently from blood cultures diluted 10%. Statistically significant differences in isolation rates, however, represented only a small number of patients for whom the positive cultures affected therapy. We conclude that as long as at least two separate sets of blood cultures are obtained per septic episode from each patient, a 1:5 to 1:10 blood/vented (aerobic) medium ratio provides acceptable results. Nevertheless, the results also demonstrate that blood cultures diluted 10% provided greater and faster yields than those provided by blood cultures diluted 20%.

TI  - Contamination of urological wounds by aerobic bacteria. Transvesical prostatectomy used as a model.
AB  - The density of aerobic bacteria in the subcutaneous wound was quantified by the velvet pad rinse technique before (first stage) and after (second stage) opening of the bladder in 13 patients undergoing transvesical prostatectomy. Six patients had bacteria in the urine preoperatively (group A) and the same bacteria were isolated from bladder puncture during the operation and during second stage. Seven patients (group B) had sterile urine preoperatively and the bacteria isolated during first and second stage were commensals of the skin and the upper-respiratory tract. The bacterial density in group B was median 3.1 viable counts (v.c.) x 10(-1)/cm2 during first stage rising to median 4.7 v.c. x 10-1/cm2 during second stage, while group A showed an increase from median 4.3 v.c. x 10(-1)/cm2 during first stage to median 169,5 v.c. x 10(-1)/cm2 during second stage. The results of the study indicate the possibility of using selective antibiotic prophylaxis, with the relevant antibiotic for the bacteria isolated in the urine preoperatively, to reduce postoperative wound infection in urological surgery with opening of the urinary bladder.
TI  - [Hygienic and microbiological influences exerted on natural water biotopes by algae and the growth of water plants. 1. Communication: antibacterial properties of three water algae (Hydrodictyon reticulatum, Chlorella vulgaris, Aphanothece nidulans) in vitro (author's transl)].
AB  - The growth-inhibiting behaviour of abacterial, liquid pure cultures made up of three water algae (Hydrodictyon reticulatum, Chlorella vulgaris, Aphanothece nidulans) which were made to grow profusely in special culture containers under constant exposure to light and ventilation was examined in ten different species of microorganisms during a period of contact of 4 days both in the light and in the dark. Subjected to the test were the 5 pathogenic species Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and Candida albicans as well the 5 bacterial contamination indicators E. coli (faecal indicator), Streptococcus faecalis (enterococci), Enterobacter aerogenes ("coliforms"), Staphylococcus epidermidis (dermic germ) and Bacillus subtilis ("contamination germ"). It was found that --Hydrodictyon reticulatum and Aphanothece nidulans exert a strong antibacterial effect, while Chlorella vulgaris provides no indication of a bacterial growth-inhibiting effect. --this antibiosis is linked with the assimilative activity of the algal cultures, as in the dark no antibacterial action is discernible --the "antibiotic principle" must be liable to transitory or rapid disintegration because the algal cultures are ineffective in the dark and also culture filtrates of 5-days old algal cultures exercise no growth-inhibiting effect. With respect to the sanitation of waters it is important to state that a profuse growth of algae produces a certain, but hardly reliable "biological water disinfection" and renders difficult the assessment of the quality of a water-course as a result of the elimination of the usual contamination indicators. Therefore, additional microbiological quality parameters must be used for assessment of pollution of swimming pools with strong algal growth.

TI  - Experimental Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus faecalis  pyelonephritis in diabetic rats.
AB  - Pyelonephritis was studied after an intravenous injection of Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, or enterococcus in alloxan-diabetic rats and in water-diuresing or non-diuresing nondiabetic rats. The renal microbial populations of C. albicans or S. aureus were found to be greater than 10(5) colony-forming units per g for up to 42 days in diabetic rats, whereas the kidneys tended to become sterile in nondiabetic rats. No significant difference was found in the course of enterococcal pyelonephritis in diabetic versus control rats. The difference in the 50% infective dose for each microorganism between diabetic and control rats was less than or equal to log10. Neither duration of diabetes nor weight loss contributed to the greater and more sustained renal populations of C. albicans and S. aureus in diabetic rats. The inflammatory reaction in kidneys infected with S. aureus or C. albicans was greater in diabetic rats. Fungus balls associated with ureteral obstruction and gross multiple renal abscesses occurred in diabetic, but not in nondiabetic, rats infected with Candida. Growth of C. albicans and S. aureus in vitro in urine from diabetic rats was significantly greater than it was in urine from control rats. Addition of water or glucose to the urine of non-diuresing, nondiabetic rats significantly increased in vitro growth of S. aureus and C. albicans. These studies demonstrate greater severity of infection in the diabetic kidney due to S. aureus and C. albicans, which can be partially explained by decreased inhibitory activity of urine for these organisms in diabetic rats.
TI  - Growth of bacteria and fungi in parenteral nutrition solutions containing albumin.
AB  - The ability of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solutions containing albumin to support bacterial and fungal growth was studied. The following solutions were tested for microbial growth: (A) thioglycolate broth, (B) solution A with preservatives, (C) albumin 6.25 g in 500 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injections, (D) solution C with preservatives, (E) amino acid and dextrose TPN solution with magnesium sulfate and folic acid, (F) solution E with albumin 6.25 g in 500 ml, (G) amino acid and dextrose TPN solution with calcium gluconate and multivitamins, and (H) solution G with albumin 6.25 g in 500 ml. Each solution was inoculated with 1 X 10(5) bacteria/ml or 1 X 10(3) yeast/ml in 12 serial dilutions using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) plates. These were incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 hours, and cultures were visually rated on a scale of 0 (no growth) to 4 (maximal growth). Each culture was repeated for a total of 10 samples. Microbial growth was not affected by the low concentrations of preservatives available from the TPN additives. Undiluted TPN solutions were able to sustain fungal growth only. There was a significant increase in microbial growth in diluted TPN solutions containing albumin for S. aureus, C. albicans, T. glabrata, K. brier, S. marcescans, and E. coli. The presence of vitamins (solution G) impaired the ability of gram-negative bacteria to proliferate, and the addition of albumin (solution H) had no significant effect on the growth characteristics of the organisms in the solution. The presence of albumin had no effect on the growth of S. faecalis or Ps. aeruginosa. The addition of albumin to crystalline amino acid TPN solutions increases the potential of these solutions to support the growth of fungi and bacteria. Hence, it is recommended that albumin be administered separate from amino acid TPN solutions.
TI  - Bacterial endocarditis in the community hospital.
AB  - The clinical records of 66 patients with bacterial endocarditis hospitalized in three community hospitals in Saginaw, Michigan, from 1964 through 1979 were reviewed. Data from these nonreferral hospitals demonstrate that infective endocarditis often does not present to the primary care physician with classical physical findings. The etiological organisms were noted to change from being primarily alpha-hemolytic streptococci during the early part of the study to staphylococci and Streptococcus faecalis during later years. Narcotic addiction was a factor of increasing importance in the development of endocarditis and in the changing microbiology of this clinical syndrome.
TI  - Salt extends the upper temperature limit for growth of food-poisoning bacteria.
AB  - Inclusion of NaCl into the growth medium raised the upper temperature limit of growth of the following organisms: Staphylococcus aureus (two strains), Salmonella senftenberg, S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium sporogenes, C. perfringens (two strains). The magnitude of the response varied with the culture, the largest being 3.5 degrees with B. cereus cells. The spores of B. cereus were not protected by salt but clostridial spores behaved as the vegetative cells (response of 2.5 degrees). The optimal salt concentration for the protective effect varied with the organism ranging from 0.2 M for the Gram-negative organisms to 1.0 M for S. aureus.

AB  - The activity of E. coli, Group B Streptococci, Strept. faecalis, Stap. epidermidis and Staph. aureus in human amniotic fluid was studied. In comparison to Standard I broth an inhibited growth of test organisms was observed. The bacteriostatic effect of amniotic fluid was most significant with Staph. epidermidis. We further investigated the causes for this bacterial growth inhibition with Staph. epidermidis. We showed that it is independent from the initial number of bacteria as well as from zinc and phosphate content, the phosphate-to-zinc ratio and from the protein content in amniotic fluid samples. It could neither be influenced by heating nor by autoclaving, but was immediately lost by adding Standard I both to amniotic fluid samples. In the concentrations we investigated the bacteriostatic effect was independent from the influence of steroid hormones.

AB  - A 26-year-old man presented with progressive pneumonia, and Aspergillus was grown from cultures of lung, cutaneous nodules, and urine. His PMNs had a poor CL response after exposure to phagocytic stimuli (S. aureus, latex, aggregated IgG and IgG-coated latex) (p less than 0.01 vs. controls) and soluble stimuli (PMA, sodium fluoride, and Con A) (p less than 0.05). His PMNs failed to reduce NBT, oxidize 14C-1 glucose (p less than 0.001), or iodinate proteins (p less than 0.001), normally, compared with controls, and his PMNs killed Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus abnormally (p less than 0.05). The patient was anergic; his plasma inhibited responsiveness of his lymphocytes to stimulation with Aspergillus and Candida antigens. His lymphocytes failed to produce the lymphokine LMIF normally. The patient's 10-month-old daughter was demonstrated to have the same defects of PMN metabolism and function. The findings in this patient were similar to those in CGd, but transmission of the defect from father to daughter and the presence of lymphocyte abnormalities make this diagnosis unlikely. Inhalation of Aspergillus by patients with defective PMN oxidative metabolism may be associated with development of significant infection.
TI  - [In vitro studies on the activities of cephalothin against selected bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  - Cephalothin antimicrobial activities were studied against selected bacteria with  special reference to the time of exposure of microbes to the drug assessed in broth medium. The minimal concentration of this drug producing 10(0)-10(1) reduction of colony forming unit (CFU) per ml after given exposure times -an approximation to the theoretical bacteriostatic concentration inhibiting increase or decrease of CFU- was designated as minimally reducing concentration (MRC). The concentration was determined after 6 h, 18 h and 42 h of incubation and designated as 6-h, 18-h and 42-h MRC, respectively. Conventional minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) with 18 h exposure time was also studied. The minimal concentration of the drug yielding 99.9% reduction of CFU after an exposure to the drug was determined and designated as minimal lethal concentration (MLC). The determinations were made at 6 h, 18 h and 42 h of incubation and designated as 6-h, 18-h and 42-h MLC, respectively. The data indicated that the bacteriostatic concentration for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella sp. with brief exposure time (6-h MRC) was 2-4 times lower than the MIC. If the exposure time was prolonged (18-42 h), the bacteriostatic concentration increased and almost agreed with the MIC. A significant effect of inoculum size was observed on the MRC values for the Gram-negatives when the values were determined with the inoculum concentrations at 10(6)-10(7) CFU/ml and 10(3)-10(4) CFU/ml. In contrast to these Gram-negatives, the 6-h MRC for most strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus roughly agreed with the MIC. If the ratio of bacteriostatic to bactericidal concentrations was used as the criterion, the mode of action of cephalothin appeared to be bactericidal for most of the Gram-negatives. This drug was bacteriostatic for a number of the Gram-positive strains, in particular to those of Enterococcus, especially when microbes were exposed to the drug over a brief period of time.

TI  - Combination effect with some aminoglycoside antibiotics.
AB  - Strains of resistant species -- Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis  -- isolated from material of nosocomial infections in the surgical department of a Prague hospital were tested for combined effect with further chemotherapeutics. The same concerned Ps, aeruginosa noted, at present, by a high degree of resistance. In Ps. aeruginosa it was the combination sisomicin-carfecillin that proved a success in 50 p. c. of cases as well as that of sisomicin-doxycyclin. At the same time the authors draw attention to the possibility of antagonistic action of the combination sisomicin-chloramphenicol in a third part of the strains tested. Potentiation of the effect in Staphylococcus aureus strains was observed also in the combination sisomicin-carfecillin in more than one half of the strains tested and in case of sisomicin-doxycyclin in one third of the strains. In Streptococcus faecalis strains sisomicin was combined with amoxycillin, carbenicillin, carfecillin and doxycyclin; synergistic action being observed with all those combinations in more than one half of strains tested. No antagonism was registered in those cases. (Ta.).

TI  - Aspects of the antibacterial action of diphenyliodonium chloride.
AB  - Diphenyliodonium chloride was found to be a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent and its activity was affected by pH and inoculum size. Its uptake by bacterial cells was Langmuirian, and it caused loss of intracellular material. Aerobic glucose metabolism and dehydrogenase activity were inhibited. Low concentrations of the drug affected the membrane-bound ATPase and K transport in Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - Interference of Neisseria gonorrhoeae growth by aerobic bacterial representatives of the urogenital flora.
AB  - Aerobic bacterial isolates obtained from endocervical, vaginal and urethral swabbings were tested for interference of neisseria gonorrhoeae growth on solid medium. Simultaneous antagonism was studied using the lawn spotting method, and delayed antagonism by the basal spot/lawn method. From 58 swabbings we recuperated a total of 181 isolates, 71 of those were found interfering with at least one out of four gonococcal strains (G-1, G-2, G-3 and G-4). Similar percentages of interfering isolates were obtained from each of the isolation sites. The identification of the interfering isolates has revealed that similar numbers of coagulase negative staphylococci and identical numbers of group D streptococci were found for each of those sites. The majority of the interfering isolates and also of the inhibitory coagulase negative staphylococci showed only simultaneous antagonism. To complete the interference spectrum, we have tested all the active urogenital isolates against four other gonococcal strains (G-7, G-9, G-10 and G-11). This spectrum showed clearly that interference is not an all or none phenomenon. While the gonococcal interference spectrum of most of the Gram positive cocci and the Acinetobacter sp. strains is broad, that of all the other isolates is relatively narrow. Gonococcal strains G-7 and G-9 were the most susceptible to inhibition by the interfering urogenital isolates while strain G-3 was the most resistant one.
TI  - Binding of beta-lactam antibiotics to penicillin-binding proteins of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis: relation to antibacterial activity.
AB  - The binding of 14 structurally diverse beta-lactam antibiotics to penicillin-binding proteins of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis was studied, and the results were examined in the context of the antibacterial activity of the compounds. Penicillin-binding proteins 1 (molecular weight, 87,000) and 3 (molecular weight, 75,000) of S. aureus and penicillin-binding proteins 1 (molecular weight, 105,000) and 3 (molecular weight, 79,000) of S. faecalis bound beta-lactam antibiotics at concentrations comparable to minimum inhibitory concentrations and might therefore be essential. The low affinity of S. faecalis penicillin-binding proteins, relative to that of S. aureus penicillin-binding proteins, toward most beta-lactam antibiotics is probably responsible for the resistance of the former organism to most of these compounds.
TI  - Rapid diagnosis of infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria by means of an enzyme radioisotopic assay.
AB  - We developed a sensitive enzyme radioisotopic assay for the measurement of beta-lactamase, an enzyme produced by a number of pathogenic bacteria. This ERIA was 100-fold more sensitive than the commonly used iodometric or spectrophotometric assays for the measurement of beta-lactamase and, unlike these other assays, the ERIA was not significantly influenced by serum proteins or unlabeled penicillin. Clinical specimens consisting of blood, peritoneal, pleural, and cerebrospinal fluids from patients infected with beta-lactamase-producing organisms yielded positive ERIA tests; fluids from uninfected patients were negative. The ERIA takes approximately 90 minutes to perform, and offers great potential for the rapid diagnosis of serious bacterial infections caused by bacteria which produce beta-lactamase.
TI  - The bacteriological quality of minced beef in the U.K.
AB  - Minced (ground) beef from three supermarkets, three intermediate-sized chain butchers and three small family butchers in each of three geographical areas was examined three times in warm weather and three times in cool. The total viable count (37 and 20 degrees C), numbers of Enterobacteriaceae (37 and 17 degrees C), and presumptive coliforms did not differ significantly between shop type or season. Statistically significant differences in numbers of faecal Streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens were too small to be of commercial importance, or diagnostic value.
TI  - Incidence of thymidine-dependent enterococci detected on Mueller-Hinton agar with low thymidine content.
AB  - It was observed that 10% of urine culture isolates of enterococci tested for antimicrobial susceptibility failed to grow on commercially prepared Mueller-Hinton agar with low levels of thymidine and thymine. All strains could utilize exogenous thymidine and thymine and required only low levels (0.4-microgram disk) to support growth. All thymidine-thymine-requiring strains were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
TI  - Bacterial effect of hydrogen peroxide on urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - Bacterial contamination of urinary drainage bags is a frequent source of bladder  bacteriuria in patients with indwelling catheters. Previous work demonstrated that the addition of 30 ml of 3% H2O2 prevented bacterial contamination of urinary drainage bags for up to 8 h in patients with urinary infections (greater than 10(5) colony-forming units per ml). Survival curves of a variety of organisms in filter-sterilized urine with various concentrations of H2O2 (0.6 to 0.01%) were constructed. Organisms with high cellular catalase activity (Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, and Proteus mirabilis) required 30 to 60 min of exposure to 0.6% H2O2 for a reduction of 10(8) to less than 1 colony-forming unit per ml, whereas Escherichia coli, Streptococcus sp., and Pseudomonas sp. required only 15 min of exposure. The efficacy of H2O2 in urine was maintained despite exposure to room temperature for 5 days and reinoculation with bacterial suspensions. H2O2 is inexpensive and relatively nontoxic, and these data suggest that periodic instillation of H2O2 into urinary drainage bags may eliminate a source of bladder bacteriuria and environmental contamination.

TI  - Bacteriolytic activity of human gingival exudate.
AB  - We investigated the bacteriolytic activity of gingival crevicular fluid (CF) on 14C-labeled Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and on whole dental plaque. CF was collected from 100 healthy donors pooled and centrifuged at 200 g. CF supernate and a frozen and thawed extract of the pellet were interacted with the different bacterial strains, while Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus released 60% and 75% of the radioactive label, only 38% of it was solubilized from Streptococcus mutans, following their incubation with the CF supernate. The findings agreed with results obtained by interacting bacteria with a frozen and thawed lysate of human peripheral blood leukocytes. On the other hand, extracts from frozen and thawed CF pellet were inactive. Further, lipoteichoic acid and lipopolysaccharide were released by CF from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. The role of bacteriolytic factors, present in CF, as a result of the interaction between microorganisms and leukocytes at inflammatory sites is discussed.

AB  - The influence of topical antimicrobial agents on bacterial growth was determined  with an agar diffusion technique. 349 isolates were tested with mafenide acetate and silver sulfadiazine, 226 isolates were tested with povidone iodine. None of these agents was likewise effective against all organisms of the same bacterial strain. The inhibition of growth by mafenide acetate and silver sulfadiazine demonstrated dose-response. 26 to 40% of the tested grampositive cocci were inhibited by mafenide acetate, whereas the growth of about 26 to 90% of gramnegative rods was effected by silver sulfadiazine, with the exception of proteus species (9%). Both agents influenced the growth of pseudomonas (40 to 65%). The results obtained with povidone iodine led to the consideration that the agar diffusion method might not be suitable for testing this drug.
TI  - [Airborne microflora found in some stations of the metro in the Hungarian capital of Budapest (author's transl)].
AB  - Both the microflora and some physical parameters of the air in three underground  railway (metro) stations were analysed. The air samples taken in the first two stations contained considerably more microbes, namely three times as many, than the sample from station No. 3. In the samples from the first two stations both the pathogenic and anthropogenic germs occured more frequently than in the samples from the third station. The normal flora consisted of gram-positive cocci/Streptococci, Micrococci, Sarcina. Roughly 10 per cent of the microbes proved to be spore-formers. Selective investigations led to the detection of Staph. aureus, Enterococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichiae, Klebsiella and Proteus bacteria. The reason why the stations of line 2 were found to be contaminated to a greater degree is probably because of the higher passenger traffic, the smaller space, as well as the stronger airflow due to the artificial ventilation and the piston effect of the trains. The effect of the artificial environmental conditions on the staff of the metro company still needs further investigation. The effect on the passengers is considered to be less pronounced.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of dilute formocresol and eugenol and propylene glycol.
AB  - Formocresol and eugenol are the two nonspecific intracanal medicaments commonly used in endodontic practice. Both have high tissue irritation potential when used in conventional strength. Propylene glycol is an alcohol that is injectable and itself possesses significant antibacterial action. It is a popular vehicle and hence was used to modify the two drugs. Standard bacteriologic methods were employed to test the antibacterial action of these lower concentrations of the two drugs against four test organisms. The investigations indicate that formocresol at as low as 10 to 20% and eugenol at 75% are bactericidal in action and hence may be useful at these concentrations for clinical use. Evaluation of these lower concentrations is warranted for possible clinical use. Propylene glycol, which possesses antibacterial action and is remarkably innocuous to tissues, appears to be a suitable vehicle for dilution of formocresol and eugenol.

At different concentrations of penicillin various morphological forms were observed. Effect of sucrose, normal horse serum and penicillin on their adaptation and stabilization is discussed.

Piperacillin and gentamicin synergistically inhibited all strains of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus tested. They exerted no synergistic effect against S. faecalis. Piperacillin and gentamicin synergism may be clinically tested in the treatment of serious pseudomonas and staphylococcal infections but not against infections caused by S. faecalis.
TI  - In vitro activity of a new semisynthetic cephalosporin: cefoperazone.
AB  - Cefoperazone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with excellent antibacterial activity. This study included more than 1,500 clinical isolates whose susceptibility to cefoperazone was determined by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC). Cefoperazone was highly active against Enterobacteriaceae including indolepositive Proteus, Serratia and Enterobacter sp. Particularly noteworthy was the high activity of cefoperazone against Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter strains, which are usually resistant to first- and second-generation cephalosporins. The activity of cefoperazone against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, group D streptococci and Haemophilus was also determined. In general, the differences between MIC and MBC were minimal. Additional studies were carried out to determine the effect of inoculum size on cefoperazone activity.

The behaviour of 3 different initial colony counts in each case was examined. Colony forming units (CFU) were evaluated at the beginning and after 1, 2, 4, 6 and 24 h. CFU were reduced at Staph. aureus and E. coli in aqua bidest and tap water not earlier than after 4 h, but mostly after 24 h. In Strept. faecalis CFU were reduced in aqua bidest at 40 degrees C after 24 h, in tap water at 40 degrees C after 4 h, but there were no changes of CFU in both media at 20 degrees C or 30 degrees C. Ser. marcescens strains were growing in aqua bidest and tap water after 24 h at 20 degrees C. P. aeruginosa strains were reduced in aqua bidest at all temperatures but they were growing in tap water after 24 h. Reduction or growth of all strains did not depend on initial colony count during examination time, changing of CFU turned out to be quicker at 40 degrees C than at 20 degrees C. It is the conclusion that in humidifiers and nebulizers CFU will be different from initial colony count not earlier than after 6 h. Growth will be seen after 6 until 24 h if there are no particular nutritive organic compounds.

The results are based on a double-blind trial, using tinidazole (Fasigyn; Pfizer) and placebo. Although no postoperative infections other than urinary tract infections were observed in our series, this study shows conclusively that the isolation of anerobic bacteria from the vagina decreased markedly in the tinidazole group compared with the placebo group.

TI  - Effect of leukocyte hydrolases on bacteria. XIV. Bacteriolytic effects of human sera, synovial fluids, and purulent exudates on Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis: modulation by Cohn's fraction II and by polyelectrolytes.
AB  - Normal sera and plasma, derived from humans, calves, rats, rabbits, horses, human synovial fluids, inflammatory exudates, and leukocyte extracts, when sufficiently diluted are highly bacteriolytic for Staph, aureus, Strep. faecalis, B. sutilis and to a variety of gram-negative rods. On the other hand, concentrated serum or the other body fluids are usually not bacteriolytic for these bacterial species. While the lysis of Staph, aureus and B. subtilis by diluted serum is not lysozyme dependent, lysis of Strep. faecalis is absolutely dependent on the concentration of lysozyme. The lytic factor in human serum is present in Cohn's fractions III, IV, and V. It is nondialyzable, resistant to heating for 75 degrees C and 20 min, and acts optimally at pH 5.0. Like leukocyte extracts, synovial fluids, and inflammatory exudates, it lyses only young staphylococci. The inability of concentrated serum to lyse Staph. aureus and Strep. faecalis is due to the presence in the gamma globulin fraction of a potent inhibitor, which can be partly removed by dilution of by adsorption upon the homologous bacteria. Lysis of the bacteria is also strongly inhibited by Cohn's fraction II (gamma globulin) by high-molecular-weight DNA, heparin, liquoid, and histone. The possible role played by serum globulin in the protection of bacteria against degradation by leukocyte is discussed.

TI  - [Examinations on the behaviour of grampositive and gramnegative bacteria on aluminium foil (author's transl)].
AB  - The survival times of Staph. aureus, Strept. faecalis, E. coli, Klebs. pneumoniae, Ser. marcescens and P. aeruginosa were found out on aluminium foil. It was examined whether there exists a dependence on the initial colony count and in mixed cultures a mutual influence of the several species of bacteria. The longest survival times were found among the grampositive cocci. Ser. marcescens and Klebs. pneumoniae could no more be indicated after 19 days in case of initial colony count of log 7.0/cm2; E. coli could no more be shown after 14 days. P. aeruginosa had the shortest survival time. The dependence on the initial colony count was ascertained in 3 different concentrations of bacteria. The highest concentrations showed the smallest reduction of cocci and the longest survival times of Enterobacteriaceae respectively. The middle and lowest initial colony counts showed quicker reduction or shorter survival times. Ser. marcescens was more resistant to drying than Klebs. pneumoniae. The quickest dying rates showed P. aeruginosa without any dependence on initial colony count. In mixed cultures with Staph. aureus or Strept. faecalis survival times of Enterobacteriaceae were longer; the same result gave Klebs. pneumoniae in culture together with Ser. marcescens. The following explanation might be possible: because of the drying resistance of grampositive cocci the total bacteria number in these mixed cultures after several days is higher than in monocultures of E. coli, Klebs. pneumoniae or Ser. marcescens. This protects the Enterobacteriaceae against external influences for a longer time. Therefore it is understandable that the effect increases with the length of duration. The same interpretation could apply to the mixed cultures of Klebs. pneumoniae/Ser. marcescens.
TI  - Theoretic and experimental analysis of the ability of a commercially prepared system to detect mixtures of bacteria.
AB  - The validity of the biochemical identification of bacteria presumes that the inoculum consists of a pure growth of bacteria. The detection of mixtures of bacteria with the Analytab Enteric (API 20E) system was tested. Using a computer to predict the response of the API 20E system to mixed cultures, the presence of a mixture was not detected in 15% of all pairwise combinations of 324 common organisms of the Enterobacteriaceae family and in 19% of all pairwise combinations of Enterobacteriaceae with four gram-positive cocci. These theoretic predictions were confirmed experimentally for selected mixtures in which the bacteria were combined in equal concentrations. These results indicate that a purity subculture plate must be used to insure the detection of mixtures of bacteria, because the API 20E system fails to detect a large number of mixtures and may erroneously identify the organisms in such mixtures.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefazedon on patients with urinary tract infections (author's transl)].
AB  - The efficacy and tolerance of Cefazedon, a new antibiotic, was investigated clinically on 90 patients with urinary tract infections who also required surgical treatment. Good clinical results were achieved in over 90% of patients after 6 to 7 days of treatment. The bacteriological examination revealed complete elimination of the initially identified pathogens in 89 cases. No difference in treatment results could be established when applying the dose 2 or 3 times daily. On the third day of treatment skin reactions were observed in one case which necessitated discontinuation of treatment. Laboratory blood values as well as control of liver and kidney function before treatment, after and one week past treatment showed no negative influence due to the drug. In approximately 27% a new colonisation mainly with Pseudomonas could not be prevented.

TI  - Minimal antibiotic concentrations of aminoglycosides and beta-lactam antibiotics  for some gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The minimal antibiotic concentration (MAC) is the lowest concentration of an antibacterial agent that produces a decrease of 1 log in the number of organisms/ml as compared with a control culture in drug-free medium. Various gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci were grown in the presence of amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, oxacillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and cefamandole at concentrations varying from eight times the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) to 1/128 of the MIC. Colony forming units (cfu) were counted, the MIC was determined, and the MIC:MAC ratio, which indicates the magnitude of the effective range, was calculated. The MIC:MAC ratio appears to be characteristic for a given species and antibiotic. There is no relation between the MICs and the MIC:MAC ratios. The highest ratios were given by Proteus mirabilis with aminoglycosides (MIC:MAC mean, 29.2 with tobramycin), and the lowest ratios were given with beta-lactam antibiotics by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis (MIC:MAC means, 2.1 with carbenicillin and cefamandole, respectively).
TI  - The Chediak-Higashi syndrome: quantitation of a deficiency in maximal bactericidal capacity.
AB  - The maximum bactericidal capacity of neutrophils from a patient with the Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) was measured by a quantitative assay in which the neutrophils were challenged with increasing multiples of Staphylococcus aureus, 502A. At various bacterial challenges from 0.5 to 65 bacteria per neutrophil, the CHS cells killed normal numbers of bacteria in 60 minutes. However, at higher ratios with a mean of 118 bacteria per neutrophil, the percentage of bacteria killed in 60 minutes by CHS neutrophils (8.1 +/- 2.3%) was significantly less (P < 0.001) than that killed by normal neutrophils (44 +/- 2.3%). The CHS neutrophils lagged in their ability to kill low challenges of bacteria (0.5 or 1.2 bacteria per neutrophil) only at 20 minutes. A hydrogen-peroxide-producing strain of Streptococcus faecalis was killed normally by the CHS neutrophils at 60 minutes, with all ratios of challenge up to 114 to 1. Electron microscopic examination of 60-minute specimens from high ratios of challenge that were stained for myeloperoxidase activity revealed a failure of many bacteria-laden phagosomes to display this marker of degranulation. The results of this study indicate that the maximal bactericidal capacity of CHS neutrophils is saturated by a significantly lower challenge of bacteria than is required to saturate normal cells. This appears to be the result of sequestration of a significant portion of these cells' bactericidal resources in the giant granules that do not participate appreciably in degranulation.
TI  - Comparative in vivo nitrogen-15 nuclear magnetic resonance study of the cell wall components of five Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The proton-decoupled 9.12 MHz 15N NMR spectra of 15N-labeled Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Staphylococcus auresu, Streptococcus faecalis, and Micrococcus lysodeikticus intact cells, isolated cells walls, and cell wall digests have been examined. The general characteristics of Gram-positive bacteria 15N NMR spectra and described and spectral assignments are provided, which allow in vivo 15N NMR to be applied to a wide range of problems in bacterial cell wall research. The qualitative similarity of the intact cell and cell wall spectra found in each bacteria allowed the 15 N resonances observed in the proton broad-band noise-decoupled 15N NMR spectra of intact cells to be assigned to cell wall components. Each of the five Gram-positive bacteria displayed a unique set of cell wall 15N resonances, which reflected variations in the primary structure of peptidoglycans and the amounts of teichoic acid and teichuronic acid in the cell wall, as well as the dynamic properties of the cell wall polymers. Spectral assignments of cell wall 15 N resonances assigned to teichoic D-Ala residues, teichuronic acid and acetamido groups, and peptidoglycan acetamido, amide, peptide, and free amino groups have been made on the basis of specific isotopic labeling and dilution experiments, comparison of chemical shifts to literature values, determination of pH titration shifts, cell wall fractionation experiments, and comparative analysis of the cell wall lysozyme digest spectra in terms of the known primary sequences of peptide chains. All the peptidoglycan 15N peptide resonances observed in the intact cells and isolated cell walls could be accounted for by residues in the bridge or crossbar regions of the peptide chains, which indicated that only the cross-linking groups had a high degree of motional freedom. Thermal- and pH-induced conformational changes around the cross-linking D-Ala residues were detected in the B. licheniformis cell wall lysozyme digest products. Comparison of the proton broad-band noise-decoupled and gated decoupled intact cell and cell wall 15N spectra indicated that broad-band proton decoupling resulted in nulling of cytoplasmic resonances and enhancement of the cell wall resonances by the 15N [1H5 nuclear Overhauser effect.

Varying doses of the lipid preparation were administered before infection. Mortality of the animals and rate of elimination of the bacteria from the organs and blood circulation were recorded. In appropriate doses, the lipids markedly enhanced resistance to the aforementioned bacteria. Mortality was substantially reduced, and elimination of the infectious agent from tissues and blood was significantly accelerated.

TI  - Effect of active and passive antibacterial immunization on skin allograft survival in rabbits.
AB  - The effect of active and passive antibacterial immunization on transplantation immunity was investigated in rabbits. Immunization with dead bacterial vaccines prepared from E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudmonas aeruginosa had no effect on skin allograft survival, whereas immunization with vaccines prepared from streptococcal and staphylococcal strains shortened allograft survival. Similar results were obtained with specific antisera against individual microbial species. Skin allografts survived in rabbits treated with antisera against E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the same manner as in untreated controls, whereas allograft survival was shortened with antisera against streptococci or staphylococci. The possible mechanism of the stimulatory effect of Gram-positive cocci on transplantation immunity is discussed and the possibilities of using active and passive antibacterial immunication in clinical transplantation are considered.
TI  - Localization of membrane-derived oligosaccharides in the outer envelope of Escherichia coli and their occurrence in other Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The glucose-containing, membrane-derived oligosaccharides of Escherichia coli are localized in the external envelope of that organism, most probably in the periplasmic space. The membrane-derived oligosaccharides appear to be generally occurring cell constituents of gram-negative (but not gram-positive) bacteria.
TI  - Effect of serum on gram-positive cocci grown in the presence of penicillin.
AB  - Strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus bovis, and a strain of Streptococcus that produces filaments were grown on agar containing penicillin at concentrations of one-half to 1/10th the minimal inhibitory concentration. These penicillin-exposed organisms as well as untreated control organisms were incubated with human serum of plasma. Both serum and plasma produced a remarkable bactericidal effect on the filament-forming Streptococcus grown in the presence of penicillin, whereas the untreated control was only slightly affected. This response resembled that of gram-negative bacilli rather than that of gram-positive cocci. The growth of staphylococci exposed to penicillin was slightly inhibited in the presence of serum, whereas the growth of untreated staphylococci was stimulated. The streptococci, regardless of whether they were treated with penicillin or whether they were untreated, showed no change in growth pattern in the presence of serum.
TI  - [Routine test for sensitivity (author's transl)].
AB  - The agar diffusion test is a simple but in most instances reliable method for the determination of the sensitivity of pathogenic bacteria, if it is performed under controlled standardised conditions and evaluated by defined criteria. The accuracy of the test results can be achieved by a permanent control of the test with control strains during routine testing.
TI  - [The antibacterial activity of diphenhydramine (author's transl)].
AB  - Diphenhydramine (N,N-dimethyl-2-diphenyl-methoxy-ethylamine) [N,N-dimethyl-2-(diphenylmethoxy)-ethylamin] (DPH) is a well-known local anaesthetic and an antagonist of both acetylcholine and histamine. We tested its antibacterial efficacy by means of three different investigation methods, i.e. microcalorimetry, continuous density measurement and the microdilution test to find out the MIC of this compound against various bacteria. DPH inhibits the growth of E. coli and Klebsiella strains at a concentration of 0.18% of Staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus at 0.37%, of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 0.75% and Streptococcus faecalis strains at 1.5%. The results of microcalorimetry and continous density measurements showed that the addition of 0.2% DPH to a broth with growing bacteria interferes very quickly with cell metabolism and stops further reproduction. The microcalorimetric findings were carried out with Staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus strain No. 13,665 an- the E. coli strain No. 3579.
TI  - Treatment of bacterial endocarditis with vancomycin.
AB  - Five patients with bacterial endocarditis who were allergic to penicillin were treated successfully with vancomycin. The causative microorganisms were Streptococcus bovis, S faecalis, S agalactiae, S intermedius, and Staphylococcus aureus. Except for the strain of S faecalis, vancomycin was bactericidal against these organisms at easily achievable serum concentrations. To insure a bactericidal serum titer of 1:8 or greater, streptomycin was added in the therapy of the case caused by S faecalis. There was no toxicity from vancomycin therapy in our patients except for mild phlebitis at the infusion site. Vancomycin appears to be an effective alternative to penicillin in individuals with endocarditis due to susceptible organisms. Vancomycin in combination with an aminoglycoside may be appropriate therapy for enterococcal endocarditis.

TI  - Folate antagonists. 12. Antimalarial and antibacterial effects of 2,4-diamino-6-[(aralkyl and alicyclid)thio-, sulfinyl-, and sulfonyl]quinazolines.
AB  - A series of 2,4-diamino-6-[(aralkyl and alicyclic)thio-, sulfinyl-, and sulfonyl]quinazolines was prepared via condensation of 5-chloro-2-nitrobenzonitrile or 5,6-dichloro-2-nitrobenzonitrile with the appropriate aralkyl or alicyclic thiopseudourea, reduction of the resulting 2-nitro-5-[(aralkyl or alicyclic)thio]benzonitrile with stannous chloride to the amine, and cyclization with chloroformamidine hydrochloride. Oxidation was effected with hydrogen peroxide or the bromine complex of 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. These analogues when examined for suppressive activity against drug-sensitive lines of Plasmodium berghei in mice were not as active as 2,4-diamino-6-[3,4-dichlorobenzyl)amino]quinazoline (Ia).
TI  - Interactions of helium, oxygen, and nitrous oxide affecting bacterial growth.
AB  - Helium at pressures of 20 to 70 atm in the presence of air found to stimulate growth of Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus, mainly by increasing the rate of exponential growth. However, at these same pressures, helium potentiated the growth-inhibitory actions of oxygen and nitrous oxide (N2O). Oxygen was found to act essentially as an anesthetic gas in inhibiting growth of S. faecalis; its potency was approximately the same as that of N2O, and it acted additively in combination with N2O to inhibit the streptococcus. Oxygen proved to be more potent than N2O in inhibiting the growth of E. coli and S. aureus, and each gas potentiated the action of the other. Oxygen sensitivity was correlated with N2O sensitivity. Overall, our findings indicate that bacterial growth inhibition by anesthetic gases does not accurately reflect narcotic action.
TI  - Rat model of experimental endocarditis.
AB  - A simple model of infective endocarditis was produced in rats. With the aid of a  guide wire, polyethylene catheters were passed into the left ventricle through the right carotid artery of Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 300 to 350 g. A volume of 1 ml of an overnight culture of Streptococcus mitis, Staphylococcus aureus, or Streptococcus faecalis was intravenously injected 1 to 2 days after catheterization. Bacterial titers of Streptococcus mitis in vegetations were about 10(4)-fold greater than in other tissues. Blood cultures were always positive after 6 h. Mortality was 19% at 1 week and 82% at 2 weeks. Catheters were pulled 24 h after infection, and vegetation titers of greater than 7.0 log10 colony-forming units per g were sustained at 5 days. In intravenously infected rats without catheters, blood and tissues were sterile after 3 to 5 days. With Staphylococcus aureus, vegetations had greater than 9.0 log10 colony-forming units and with Streptococcus faecalis 8.8 +/- 0.3 log10 colony-forming units per g at 2 days. The rat model of infective endocarditis should prove to be suitable for further pathological and therapeutic studies.

TI  - Iron requirement and chelator production of staphylococci, Streptococcus faecalis and enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The effect of iron deprivation on growth of 101 aerobic strains of gram-positive  and gram-negative bacteria was studied on agar media in the presence of various concentrations of the synthetic iron chelator ethylene diamine diorthohydroxyphenyl acetic acid (EDDA) and the iron binding protein transferrin. Growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis was inhibited by 15 mM EDDA and 1.5 mM transferrin. Staphylococcus aureus was only inhibited by 44 mM EDDA and not by transferrin. None of the strains of S. faecalis was inhibited. The majority of the enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, Salmonella spp, Klebsiella spp) was inhibited by 44 mM EDDA and 1.5 mM transferrin. The relation between susceptibility and concentration of EDDA and transferrin was expressed as S-value for each species. Iron supply with various iron compounds could restore the effects of inhibition. In all species except in S. faecalis iron chelator production could be demonstrated, using indicator plates of media containing EDDA and flooded with 10(4)--10(5) colony forming units of indicator organisms. The iron chelator of both S. epidermidis and S. aureus could stimulate growth of S. epidermidis, but not that of enterobacteriaceae. Iron chelators from all gram-negative bacteria were functionally interchangeable, but did not stimulate growth of gram-positive bacteria.

AB  - The preceding test results appear to favour the impression method used for the testing of surface disinfection procedures. Further investigations were concerned with the selection of a suitable germ carrier. The high recovery rate of the bacteria and the invariably uniform quality of the germ carrier are the decisive criteria. Since a dependence on the type of germ was also to be expected, we checked Staph. aureus, Str. faecalis, E. coli, Kl. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa for their behaviour on PVC, varnished wooden surfaces, V 2A, rough and smooth glass, resopal, ceramic tiles with dull and glazing finish as well as on plywood. The germ carriers were contaminated quantitatively, dried, sprayed with distilled water to stimulate disinfection and examined after they were allowed to react for a period of 6 hours. A set of 10 germ carriers was examined simultaneously with 10 Rodac impressions. The data were checked by variance analytical methods and evaluated on the mean (or median) values. It was found that while the initial germ number was kept equal OP tiles and V 2A steel produced the highest germ yield. Plywood proved largely unsuitable. Among the test germs, E. coli and Kl. pneumoniae had the lowest adhesion; it was inferior to that of staphylococci and pseudomonads. However, for these 4 germ types 3 impressions per germ carrier suffice for a reliable assessment based on computations. The yield amounts to more than 90 per cent. 94 per cent of the Streptococci were also recovered with 3 impressions, but the absolute germ quantity was low. The use of this type of germ can be recommended only with reservation.
TI  - Antimicrobial lipids: natural and synthetic fatty acids and monoglycerides.
AB  - Over 40 natural or synthetic lipophilic compounds were screened for antimicrobial activity. Gram (+) bacteria and yeasts but not Gram (-) bacteria were affected by these agents. Epimino and selena fatty acids are more active than their corresponding straight chain unsubstituted fatty acids. The position of selenium influenced the antimicrobial activity of the fatty acids. The presence and position of a double or triple bond, usually an important factor in long chain fatty acids (greater than C14) had little or no effect in C11 fatty acids. Optimum antimicrobial activity was found for fatty acids and their corresponding monoglycerides when the chain lenght was C12. The dilaurin derivative was not active.
TI  - Heterogeneity of nonimmune immunoglobulin Fc reactivity among gram-positive cocci: description of three major types of receptors for human immunoglobulin G.
AB  - Two hundred and thirty strains of various gram-positive cocci were tested for quantitative, nonimmune binding of radiolabeled human polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG). The majority of coagulase-positive staphylococci and streptococci belonging to serogroups C and G showed a high uptake of IgG. The binding of immunoglobulin to group A streptococci was considerably less, with a number of strains completely negative. None of the pneumococcal or the group B or D streptococcal strains displayed any binding capacity. Heterogeneity of the IgG reactivity of various reactive strains was studied in an inhibition assay using 10 different animal serum pools. Three different inhibition patterns were seen, each of them revealing a striking degree of homogeneity within single bacterial species. Staphylococcus aureus and group A streptococci, respectively, constituted two homogeneous groups which differed markedly from each other and from C and G streptococci. No differences were observed between group C and G streptococci. Based on the profound differences between these homogeneous groups, three major types of Fc receptors could be defined. Type I and II Fc receptors were found on S. aureus and on group A streptococci, respectively. Fc receptor type III represented the immunoglobulin-binding structure of both group C and G streptococci.
TI  - Quantitative measurement of the bactericidal capability of neutrophils from patients and carriers of chronic granulomatous disease.
AB  - Previous studies examined the ability of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) from  patients and carriers of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) to kill small numbers of bacteria in vitro. The purpose of the present study was to accurately measure the number of microorganisms killed by CGD PMN when the initial number of bacteria per neutrophil was increased. Bactericidal capacities of PMN from seven patients and five proven carriers of CGD were examined with five test ratios ranging from 1.25 to 100 bacteria/neutrophil. CGD PMN killed a limited number of catalase-positive S. aureus but the number of bacteria killed increased progressively as the initial test ratio was advanced. At the highest ratio (100:1) patient PMN killed a mean of nine S. aureus per cell (normal 48 +/- 13.2 SD). PMN from patients with CGD killed increasing numbers of catalase-negative S. faecalis with normal efficiency, reaching a mean of 14 S. faecalis killed per cell at 100:1. Individual variation in the ability of CGD PMN to kill S. Aureus was apparent but the degree of PMN bactericidal effectiveness did not correlate with the patient's clinical course. PMN from asymptomatic carriers of proven sex-linked CGD also had a wide spectrum of staphylocidal activity which ranged from normal to levels comparable to CGD patients.

The results confirmed the value of this practice. In a control group, the sepsis-rate was 48% with 1 death attributable to sepsis, compared with a sepsis-rate of 4% in the treated group. The combination of gentamicin and lincomycin was effective against sepsis but pseudomembranous colitis developed in 2 of the 14 patients treated with this combination of drugs. Lincomycin was discontinued, and when metronidazole was substituted the results were equally good and there were no toxic side-effects.
TI  - An investigation of the bacteriological quality of retail vanilla slices.
AB  - One hundred and thiry-three vanilla slices, purchased from shops in the West Yorkshire Metropolitan County, were examined to determine the numbers and types of bacteria present at the time of purchase. The surface colony count at 37 degrees C was greater than 10(3)/g in 67/133 (50%) of the samples examined, Bacillus cereus being found at that concentration in 21.8%, coliform bacilli including E. coli in 5.3%, Staphylococcus aureus in 3-0% and Streptococcus faecalis in 0-8%. Thirty-four strains of B. cereus were serotyped and 11 (32%) of these were typable with the sera available. Preparation of custard mixed in the laboratory suggests that the milk or milk powder used in the mix may be the major source of B. cereus in the final product. Many of the present methods of manufacture, distribution and storage allow organisms present in the custard at manufacture the opportunity to multiply and possibly reach numbers which present a risk of food poisoning.
TI  - Rapid identification and antibiotic sensitivity testing of bacteria isolated from clinical infections.
AB  - A total of 834 bacterial strains isolated from urine were subjected to rapid biochemical and serological identification and rapid antimicrobial sensitivity testing using Autobac 1. For enterobacteria (742 strains) six tests (acetoin-, beta-galactosidase-, hydrogensulphide-, indole-, ornithin-decarboxylase-and urease-production) correctly identified to genus or species level more than 99% of the strains within four hours. Staphylococci and streptococci (92 strains) were identified with full accuracy within two hours using a rapid deoxyribonuclease assay and immunoelectroosmophoresis and coagglutination. The overall accuracy for the automated antibiotic susceptibility testing using Autobac was 93% as compared to the standard plate diffusion method. In terms of rapidity for 91% of the bacterial strains the susceptibility testing was completed within four hours. After five hours 99% of the strains were analysed. Our data indicate that rapid and automated assays can be accurate and furnish the physician with adequate data within 24 hours after receipt of a urinary specimen.

Blood serum also contains heat-labile antibacterial substances, but little heat-stable activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Both blood serum and wound fluid have bacteriostatic activity against S epidermidis, and early growth of Streptococcus fecalis occurs in serum and wound fluids. The concentration or activity of antimicrobial proteins increases during the first week in the fresh wound and then decreases as the wound matures.

All organisms except enterococci and proteus proved to be sensitive to gentamicin at a level exceeding 90% during the study period of two and a half years. A loss of activity of gentamicin worth mentioning was not detected during the studies. So this antibiotic must further be considered as one of the drugs of first choice in the treatment of urinary tract infections.

AB  - We have shown that bacterial contamination of sera can have a marked influence on the results of the rubella hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test. In addition to increasing the levels of nonspecific agglutinins, a number of common bacterial species tested had a significant effect on the HI titers. When sera free from rubella-specific antibodies were contaminated with Bacillus subtilis or Pseudomonas fluorescens, HI titers ranged from 16 to 128 (expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution completely inhibiting hemagglutination) after treatment with heparin/MnCl2. Our observations demonstrate, therefore, that bacterial contamination can be one of the causes of false-positive reactions in this test.

TI  - Selective adsorption of heterophile polyglycerophosphate antigen from antigen extracts of Streptococcus mutans and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Hot saline extracts of Streptococcus mutans have been shown to contain antigenic  substances which occasionally react nonspecifically with some antisera against whole cells of various serological groups and types of streptococci. Chromatography of the extract of S. mutans strain MT703 (serotype e) on a diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex A-25 column gave two principal antigens. One antigen was eluted without adsorption to the resin and was identified as the serotype-specific polysaccharide. The other antigen, which contained a large quantity of phosphorus, was absorbed to and released from the resin by gradient elution. It was reactive against the antisera specific for polyglycerophosphate (PGP) from group A Streptococcus pyogenes and/or S. mutans strain Ingbritt (type c). The PGP antigen was further purified by gel filtration with Sephadex G-75. Two peaks, PGP-1, and PGP-2, were obtained. Each possessed the same antigenic specificity to anti-PGP serum as shown by immunodiffusion. Chemical analyses revealed that the molar ratio of phosphorus to glycerol in both was about 1:1, although the protein content between the two was significantly different. PGP antigen was found to be widely distributed in hot saline extracts from various gram-positive bacteria, with a few exceptions. However, all gram-negative bacteria examined were free of PGP. The PGP in the hot saline extracts of various gram-positive bacteria possessed an essentially identical antigenic specificity. The addition of diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex A-25 resin to hot saline extracts successfully removed the cross-reacting PGP antigen. After adsorption of the extract from S. mutans, the supernatant contained only type-specific polysaccharide antigen, except type b, in which both type b-specific polysaccharide and PGP antigens were absorbed with the resin. This simple procedure should be useful for the removal of the PGP-type teichoic acid from antigen extracts of bacteria that contain uncharged polysaccharides.
TI  - Use of droplet plating method and cystine-lactose-lactng electrolyte-deficient medium in routine quantitative urine culturing procedure.
AB  - Droplet plating of 0.01 ml of 10(-2) dilutions of mixed sonically treated urines  onto cystine-lactose electrolyte-deficient agar permits formation of discrete, easily counted colonies within a small circumscribed area without interference by Proteus overswarm. Each colony is considered as arising from a single viable cell. The single dilution permits precise reproducible quantitation of urine bacteria population within the range 10(4) to 10(6) cells/ml of sample. Droplet-plated counts were found to be consistently (approximately) double those determined by standard pour plate quantitation. The method requires only inexpensive readily available materials and has been performed routinely in a large-volume clinical laboratory for several years.

AB  - The relative affinities of various cations for anionic sites in isolated, bacterial cell walls were assessed by means of a technique involving displacement of one cation by another. The affinity series determined was H+ greater than La3+ greater than Cd2+ greater than Sr2+ greater than Ca2+ greater than Mg2+ greater than K+ greater than Na+ greater than Li+. High affinity was correlated with low mobility of the bound ions in an electric field. The net cation-exchange capacities of walls isolated from a variety of bacteria were estimated by preparing the magnesium forms of the walls, washing them well with deionized water to remove supernumerary ions, and then completely displacing the magnesium with Na+ or H+. Total amounts of magnesium displaced varied from 73 mumol per gram dry weight, for walls of the teichoic acid-deficient 52A5 strain of Staphylococcus aureus to about 520 mumol per gram for Bacillus megaterium KM walls....
TI  - Alkyl streptozotocin analogues with improved biological activities.
AB  - Alkyl 16alpha- and -beta-glycosides of a series of N3-alkyl homologues of streptozotocin were synthesized from glucosamine hydrochloride. These compounds, when tested against ascites Sarcoma 180, Ehrlich ascites carcinoma, or leukemia L1210, exhibited potent antitumor activities, and antibacterial and diabetogenic activities were eliminated. Furthermore, the acute toxicities of these compounds were lower than that of streptozotocin. The methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, and n-butyl glycosides of streptozotocin, whether alpha- or beta-anomers, all showed higher antitumor activities than streptozotocin itself. The most active compound was found to be the methyl beta-streptozotocin.
TI  - Survival of bacteria in seawater using a diffusion chamber apparatus in situ.
AB  - A microbiological survival chamber for in situ environmental studies involving microorganisms of public health significance was developed. The autoclavable chamber was provided with a supportive base for proper flow orientation and a battery-powered stirring mechanism for continuous internal agitation. The performance of the chamber and its ancillary units was evaluated in estuarine waters by diffusion studies and survival tests with eight species of bacteria isolated from environmental sources. Polycarbonate filter membranes were found superior to cellulosic filter membranes. Continuous mixing enhanced diffusion and ensured uniform cell suspension. Salmonella enteritidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibited somewhat greater viability than Escherichia coli under similar conditions. Of three indicator organisms tested, Streptococcus faecalis was the most persistent. In general, the data obtained indicate the usefulness of the chamber in measurements of microbial survival in the natural marine environment.

TI  - Quantitative structure-activity relationships. 2. A mixed approach, based on Hansch and Free-Wilson Analysis.
AB  - Based on the theoretical and numerical equivalence of Hansch's linear multiple regression model and the modified Free-Wilson model a mixed approach is developed. The mixed approach is a combination of both models which makes use of the advantages of each model and widens the applicability of Hansch and Free-Wilson analysis. The Free-Wilson approach now is applicable also in the case of parabolic dependence of biological activity on a particular physical property, e.g., log P or pi. A rational explanation is given for the use of dummy variables in Hansch equations and the derivation of Hansch correlations for de novo group contributions obtained from Free-Wilson analysis. Some examples illustrate the mixed approach and demonstrate its usefulness to establish biologically meaningful structure-activity relationships.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of oxidized regenerated cellulose.
AB  - It has been demonstrated that oxidized regenerated cellulose promptly and markedly reduces the bacterial census of ten different strains of common pathogens when exposed to them in vitro. This was not true of two other hemostatic agents tested, namely, absorbable gelatin sponge and topical thrombin. Wounds in guinea pigs in which oxidized regenerated cellulose was placed and infected with one of three pathogens had healing per primum in 39 of 40 instances. In similar control wounds and incisions in which absorbable gelatin sponge was placed, sepsis of the wound developed in 19 of 20 of the control group and in 39 of 40 guinea pigs in the absorbable gelatin sponge group.
TI  - [Gentamicin-susceptibility of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials].
AB  - We studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing with other antibiotics. Beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. Staph, aureus and Staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin, and no resistant strain to this drug was found. Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and H. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Serratia and five species of Proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. A few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in E. coli, Citrobacerr, Serratia, Pr. morganii and Pr. rettgeri. Pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of Proteus. Antibacterial activity of gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. Gentamicin-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.

AB  - A Michael type addition of an amine to 6-methoxy-2-methyl-2-(4'-biphenylyl)-2H-pyran-3(6H)-one (1) dissolved in ether, benzene, or THF gave 5-amino derivatives of 5,6-dihydro-6-methoxy-2-methyl-2-(4'-biphenylyl)-2H-pyran-3(4H)-one (2). These by subsequent reduction with LiAlH4 were converted to 5-amino derivatives of 6-methoxy-2-methyl-2-(4'-biphenylyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-ol (3). Both isomers A and B of 1 (in regard to the methoxy group at C6) were used for the synthesis of 2 and 3. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the amine adducts 2 was of the same order of magnitude as the starting material. Amine adducts in general, however, were by far more active as coccidiostats than the starting material and retained their activities when they were reduced. 5,6-Dihydro-6-methoxy-2-methyl-2-(4'-biphenylyl)-5-(dimethylamino)-2H-pyran-3(4H) -one hydrochloride (A) and 5,6-dihydro-6-methoxy-2-methyl-2-(4'-biphenylyl)-5-(dimethylamino)-2H-pyran-3(4H) -one hydrochloride (B), prepared from isomer A and B of 1, respectively, were the most active as coccidiostats. These compounds when administered orally to chickens 1 day prior to infection at a concentration 0.05% in their diet gave them total protection against Eimeria tenella.

AB  - In our experiments, peracetic acid -- known in commerce as "Wolfasteril" was tested as a new and efficient disinfectant to disinfect sewage waters from rendering plants. Peracetic acid was used in experiments in concentration of 0.1 to 1.0% for 30 sec. to 60 min. As a comparative agent, 5% chloramine was used. Results obtained in preliminary and main experiments proved that peracetic acid is fully appropriate to disinfect biologically cleaned sewage waters in rendering plants. Sewage waters supplying the main stream has to pass mostly a short section after having left the water clariflier. Consequently, the concentration of 1% peracetic acid acting for 30 sec. is the optimum one. The recommendation of this application norm for peracetic acid in water clarifiers from rendering plants being at least suitable in controlling disasters.

Oxidation, hydrolysis and demethylation of Ib and IVb gave 2,2-dihydroxy-4-methyl-)IIc)-and2,4-dihydroxy-5-methylbenzofuran )Vc). The carboxamides Ie and IVe were obtained from the oximes Ic and IVc via the cyano derivatives Id and IVd. By condensation of the aldehydes If, IVf and VII with primary amines the corresponding Schiff bases (IIIa--c, VI and VIIIa--f) were obtained. The antibacterial activity of the Schiff bases and previously prepared benzofuran derivatives were investigated.

AB  - Thirteen 2-methylbenzofurans were synthesized and their antibacterial activity was investigated. 2-Methyl-3-nitrobenzofuran and analogs containing 7-NO2, 5-NO2, 7-Br, 7-CONH2, and 7-CF3 substituents are bacteriostatic. The spectrum of activity of these compounds is similar to nitrofurazone; however, a strain of E. coli Br which has increased resistance to nitrofurazone did not show increased resistance to 3,7-dinitro-2-methylbenzofuran (1). The 3-nitro-2-methylbenzofurans are labile in solution (T1/2 0.8-3.5 hr at 37 degrees, pH 7.0). The solvolysis product of 1 was identified as alpha,6-dinitro-o-cresol (15). The 3-nitrobenzofurans are more potent in minimal media than in Penassay broth. This greater potency can be abolished by addition of casamino acids and tryptophan to the minimal media.

AB  - A 25-year old patient with chronic granulomatous disease of somewhat unusual history is described. The diagnosis of CGD was based on increased susceptibility to infection, granulomatous appearance of tissues, and diminished bactericidal and metabolic response of leukocytes during phagocytosis: the clinical and cellular features considered phenotypic of CGD. A 16-year-old female sibling had bactericidal and metabolic abnormalities of leukocyte function similar to those of the patient's leukocytes. Leukocytes from another sister, 26 years of age, were intermediate in bactericidal capacity. Two populations of leukocytes were identified by a histochemical test of NBT reduction. Both normal and abnormal polymorphonuclear leukocytes were present in the leukocyte population of the two sisters. Leukocytes from the patient's mother and maternal grandmother were normal by all methods tested. These findings are taken as evidence of a germ-line mutation in the chromosomal gene causing CGD, with transmission of the genetic defect from the mother to the son.

Studies of the prepuce floria in boys known to have had urinary infection and in matched controls suggest that the focus of infection is in the preputial sac or urethra rather than the bowel as in girls. It is suggested that the difference in infecting organisms in boys and in adult males may be related to prostatic secretion.

TI  - Adherence of bacteria to heart valves in vitro.
AB  - The abilities of 14 strains of aerobic gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli to adhere in vitro to human or canine aortic valve leaflets were compared. 2-mm sections of excised valve leaflets were obtained by punch biopsy and were incubated under standardized conditions in suspensions of bacteria. Valve sections were subsequently washed and homogenized, and quantitative techniques were used to determine the proportions of bacteria from the initial suspensions that had adhered to the valve sections. Comparable results were obtained when these adherence ratios were determined by two independent methods based either on measurements of bacterial viability or of radioactivity in 51Cr-labeled bacteria. For each bacterial strain, the adherence ratio was constant over a wide range of concentrations of bacteria in the incubation medium. Strains of enterococci, viridans streptococci, coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (adherence ratios 0.003-0.017) were found to adhere more readily to valve sections than strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (adherence ratios 0.00002-0.00004). The organisms that most frequently cause bacterial endocarditis were found to adhere best to heart valves in vitro, suggesting that the ability to adhere to valvular endothelium may be an important or essential charcteristic of bacteria that cause endocarditis in man.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of human peritoneal fluid.
AB  - Cell free peritoneal fluids from 23 normal women had antimicrobial activity which was directed against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and also against yeasts. The activity was bacteriostatic or bactericidal and seemed to be due to the presence of a variety of factors which varied in their heat stability and dependence on complement. Lysozyme was present in the fluids but was not responsible for all the antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Selective adhesion of microorganisms to the ductular epithelium of the bovine mammary gland.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Corynebacterium bovis were examined for their ability to adhere to the ductular epithelial cells of the bovine udder. S. agalactiae and S. aureus adhered readily and in large numbers, whereas the other organisms adhered poorly or not at all. The organisms showing the ability to adhere are those which frequently cause mastitis. These data suggest that selective adherence to the ductular epithelium may be the first stage in the pathogenesis of streptococcal and staphylococcal mastitis.
TI  - Bacterial growth in seafoood on restaurant premises.
AB  - Operational guidelines for a chain of the newer type of seafood restaurants and take-out stores were derived from plots of bacteriological and trimethylamine changes during the preparation and storage of cod fillets, shrimp, and clams. If fish is to be defrosted at room temperature it should be washed and portioned within 14 h. Subsequent storage at 5 degrees C should not exceed 72 h and once removed from the refrigerator it should be fried within 3 h. New stores should consider improved methods of defrosting. Trimethylamine content was a more sensitive measure of quality loss than bacterial growth. Shrimp quality can be improved by emphasizing the way shells are removed because most of the contamination was external. Shrimp shelled while still frozen had the best potential keeping quality. Clam meat is handled less and is always held at 5 degrees C; but bacterial growth indicated that it should not be held on the premises for more than 3 days including the time necessary for defrosting. Batter prepared fresh daily can be feft at room temperature. Frying can obliterate poor handling procedures, but adequate cooking is essential under any conditions. Clams are a gourmet item but the practice of cooking them lightly at customer request proved inadvisable.

By its activity against clinical strains of Ps. aeruginosa gentamycin was somewhat inferior than polymyxin but much more superior than carbenicillin. An agar-diffusion method using Bac. pumilus NTCC 8241 as the test microbe was developed for determination of gentamycin activity. The gentamycin sulfate complex and the components of gentamycin had the same activity levels, antibacterial spectrum and diffusion capacity.
TI  - Effect of valinomycin on ion transport in bacterial cells and on bacterial growth.
AB  - The antimicrobial action of valinomycin relative to the K+ and Na+ contents of the medium has been investigated in several species of bacteria, particularly in Streptococcus faecalis, which effects energy-linked transport exclusively via degradation of glycolytic ATP, Micrococcus lysodeikticus, effecting active ion transport by respiration and Staphylococcus aureus, the energy-dependent ion transport of which is due to both glycolytic ATP degradation and respiration. It was demonstrated that valinomycin does not act on K+ transport in the glycolysing cells in the same manner as it does on respiring cells under similar conditions. Addition of valinomycin to respiring cells leads to an increase in K+ influx against the concentrational gradient in both growing and resting cells. In contrast to this, antibiotic-treated glycolysing cells experience passive K+ outflow down the concentrational gradient. It was thus concluded that the electrical potential cannot be the driving force for the energy-linked K+ transport in glycolysing cells.
TI  - Relationship of bacterial infection in urine and calculi to canine urolithiasis.
AB  - In 26 dogs treated surgically for urolithiasis, bacteriological examination of the urine and the interior of calculi showed that infection was present in both materials in 14 cases. Infection with phosphate calculi, present in 13 of these 14 dogs, was associated with a variety of bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Staph epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Proteus spp. In a follow-up examination of 16 dogs, organisms different from the original isolates were recovered from some cases. The significance of the persistence of viable bacteria within canine bladder calculi is discussed.
TI  - The inhibition of bacterial growth by ochratoxin A.
AB  - A series of bacterial species was examined for their sensitivity to ochratoxin A. Only grampositive bacteria could be inhibited, generally at a pH lower than 7.0. Bacillus subtilis did not show any reduction of growth rates in presence of ochratoxin A, but had a prolonged lag phase. With Staphylococcus pyogenes var. aureus and Streptococcus faecalis, a prolonged lag phase and a reduction of the growth rate was observed. Most sensitive was Streptococcus faecalis in the exponential-growth phase. The inhibition could be diminished by changing the pH to neutral, or by addition of yeast extract, tetrahydrofolate, or MgSO4. With MgSO4 a complete abolition of the inhibitory effect was achieved, but not with CaCl2. During growth inhibition, protein and RNA synthesis were reduced simultaneously, but not DNA synthesis. Even with the very high concentration of 1 mg/ml, no lethal effect was observed.
TI  - Herd incidence of bovine mastitis in four Danish dairy. districts II. Evaluation  of the effect of the mastitis control scheme.
AB  - Bacteriological and cytological examinations have been carried out on samples from 6,808 cows belonging to 339 herds in four Danish dairy districts. After a discussion of differences between the districts as regards intensivity of mastitis control, public health surveillance, etc., definitions are given of certain terms, such as presence of bacteria, infection, pathogenic versus non-pathogenic (less pathogenic) organisms. The rate of infection with pathogenic organisms varies between districts from 23% to32% on a cow basis, and from 8% to 12% on a quarter basis. A comparison, on a cow basis, of the occurrence of pathogens as recorded in 1955/58 in three Danish surveys comprising 11 dairy districts, with the occurrence as recorded in four districts in 1972, showed a decline in incidence of between 7 and 9 percentage units. Together with the decline in incidence a definite change in the composition of the udder flora has taken place during that period. In particular, there was a pronounced fall in the occurrence of Group B, C, G, and L streptococci, and a relative increase in the occurrence of Staphylococcus aureus. A comparison, on a quarter basis, with the occurrence of pathogens in 30 English herds subjected through three years to intensive mastitis control, including systematic treatment of dry cows, teat dipping, and weekly inspection, showed that by such a programme a slightly lower level of infection was reached than in the 399 Danish herds which had been subjected to collective control for 10-15 years. The annual financial loss per cow suffering from mastitis being estimated at D.kr. 600.-, the reduction noted in the occurrence of bacteria in cows' udders implies an annual national saving of D.kr. 42 million on account of the Danish mastitis control. The total annual expenditure on Danish mastitis control is estimated at D.kr. 9million expenses would rise to some 70 million D.kr. if all registered cows were to be treated on drying-off, and if general teat dipping was to be carried out.
TI  - Phagocytosis in patients and carriers of chronic granulomatous disease.
AB  - The phagocytic capacity of leucocytes from four patients and two carriers of chronic granulomatous disease (C.G.D.) was compared to that of normal leucocytes. Leucocytes from C.G.D. patients phagocytised more Staphylococcus aureus than did normal leucocytes after 5, 10, and 20 minutes of incubation. Phagocytosis by leucocytes from two carriers of C.G.D. was intermediate between that in the patients and in controls. In contrast, phagocytosis of Streptococcus faecalis, an organism readily killed by C.G.D. leucocytes, was similar for control and C.G.D. leucocytes. Enhanced phagocytosis may represent an attempt by leucocytes to compensate for a bactericidal abnormality. In addition, these observations may partly explain why carriers of C.G.D. are not more susceptible to infection despite abnormal leucocyte function. Detection of carriers using the described assay of phagocytosis appears relatively simple compared to previously described methods.
TI  - [Clinical study with Spectacillin on patients with infections of the urogenital system (author's transl)].
AB  - Report is given of clinical experiences gained with the new developed semi-syntheticpenicillin "Spectacillin" on 75 patients suffering from an urological disease. The drug has been applied for therapy of acute and chronic forms of inflammations of the bladder and the urethra, additionally the prostatitis, the epididymitis, but first of all the pyelonephritis (caused bacterially). Within the germ spectrum of these diseases, germs of the coli-type, streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus), staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, proteus, pseudomonas and aerobacter were found. Patients with acute/subacute diseases have been treated 8 to 9 days (3-4 grams per day) on an average; in case of chronic diseases, the patients received initially 1 gram a day and thereupon during 3 to 4 weeks 3 to 4 grams per day. The well-succeeded results have been documentated by means of the clinical course, the germ-elimination and the laboratory findings. The exanthematous quote may be demonstrated as remarkably low, considering the good universal compatibility of the substance. For this reason "Spectacillin" not finally is suitable for treatment of acute and chronic infections of the urogenital systems.

Cd uptake patterns differed significantly among the species tested. The significance of these data with respect to Cd in food chains is discussed.
TI  - [Studies to the in-vitro-effectiveness of Spectacillin (author's transl)].
AB  - In this study the sensibility of important disease germs of a clinical and an ambulatory test material has been investigated to the substances "Epicillin" and "Ampicillin". Thereby could be found that 67% (43%) of the E. coli and 55% (36%) of the proteus type, as well as 96% (96%) of the enterococcus type of the ambulatory (clinical) test material were sensitive to Epicillin and Ampicillin. Staphylococcus not producing penicillinase, were well-sensitive, while staphylococcus producing penicillinase, contrarily showed to be insensitive. Salmonellae proved to be well-sensitive up to 97%, and the rest left was limited sensitive. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) resulted in favourable findings for enterococcus, staphylococcus aureus and salmonellae; at a corresponding sensibility the same is valid for E. coli and the proteus. The investigations carried out in-vitro, reveal an equal effectiveness of Epicillin and Ampicillin.

The difference in bacterial species in bacteriuria between inpatients and outpatients strongly suggests that the origin of infection was quite different. The disappearance of Staph. aureus as a causative agent was also demonstrated.

AB  - The antimicrobial property of human uterine cervical mucus was tested in three groups of women. Healthy women, using no contraception, women using an intrauterine device and women receiving hormonal treatment for contraception. Cervical mucus was taken on the 10th, 14th, 18th and 22nd day of the menstrual cycle. Cervical mucus had a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of Micrococcus lysodeicticus in all three groups. The strength of the inhibitory effect on the other microorganisms were in the following order: Staphylococcus albus, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Streptococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus faecalis. Use of an intrauterine device did not affect the antimicrobial effect of cervical mucus. The use of hormonal contraceptive canceled the antimicrobial effect on the series of microorganisms, with the exception of M. lysodeicticus. The maximum inhibitory effect occurred on the 14th day and declined toward the end of the menstrual cycle.

TI  - Tests of disinfection by heat in a bedpan washing machine.
AB  - Tests of effectiveness of disinfection of metal and polypropylene bedpans were made in a washer fitted with a steam generator. Broth cultures of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, or Streptococcus faecalis (approximately 4 x 10(8) organisms) were sealed in lengths of capillary tubing and attached to the surface of the pans. In other tests, pans were contaminated with an artificial soil containing Str. faecalis (10(8) organisms/ml). In both series of tests, counts of surviving organisms were made at the end of the washing and disinfection cycle. The tests using capillary tubes showed that the Gram-negative bacilli were effectively killed, but not necessarily Gram-positive cocci. However, when incorporated in standard soil, Str. faecalis was killed or removed during the cycle. The results indicate that the disinfection process was effective for metal bedpans, but less so for polypropylene. Possible disadvantages and modification of the machine are suggested.
TI  - Influence of the alternate complement pathway in opsonization of several bacterial species.
AB  - In normal human serum chelated with magnesium (10 mM) and ethylene glycotetraacetic acid (10 mM) (MgEGTA), the classical pathway of complement activation is blocked; however, the alternate pathway of complement activation is intact. Diplococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus albus, Streptococcus viridans, Streptococcus faecalis, and Serratia marcescens were opsonized in normal human serum containing 10 mM MgEGTA. In contrast, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were poorly opsonized in human serum chelated with 10 mM MgEDTA. Therefore certain bacterial species appear to require the classical pathway of complement activation to be opsonized and other bacterial species utilize the alternate pathway of complement activation.
TI  - Two new inhibitory activities in blood of mice with delayed hypersensitivity, after challenge with specific antigen.
AB  - In addition to the activities associated with migration inhibitory factor and type II interferon, two other inhibitory activities have been found in the sera of mice infected intravenously with BCG and 3 weeks later challenged intravenously with old tuberculin. Growth of three bacteria, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one yeast, Candida albicans, was inhibited in vitro by a factor or factors in the serum. Also, hematopoiesis of mouse bone marrow cells in a soft agar medium was suppressed by the serum.
TI  - Cefoxitin, a new semi-synthetic cephamycin: an in-vitro and in-vivo comparison with cephalothin.
AB  - The activity of cefoxitin was compared with that of cephalothin against 229 bacterial strains. Cefoxitin was more active against most Gram-negative strains, notably against indole-producing Proteus spp., which are usually resistant to the cephalosporins. Cefoxitin was not susceptible to any significant extent to degradation by beta-lactamases produced by Gram-negative organisms. Against Gram-positive organisms, however, cefoxitin was considerably less active than cephalothin, but minimum inhibitory concentrations for Staphylococcus aureus were well within therapeutically attainable blood levels.Pharmacokinetic studies in 18 volunteers showed a higher and longer sustained antibiotic activity in serum and urine after injections of cefoxitin than after equal doses of cephalothin. Urinary recovery of cefoxitin activity was also much higher than that of cephalothin. No evidence of toxicity due to cefoxitin was found. Cefoxitin was slightly less painful after intramuscular injection than cephalothin.
TI  - Immersion refractometry of isolated bacterial cell walls.
AB  - Immersion-refractometric and light-scattering measurements were adapted to determinations of average refractive indices and physical compactness of isolated bacterial cell walls. The structures were immersed in solutions containing various concentrations of polymer molecules that cannot penetrate into wall pores, and then an estimate was made of the polymer concentration or the refractive index of the polymer solution in which light scattering was reduced to zero. Because each wall preparation was heterogeneous, the refractive index of the medium for zero light scattering had to be estimated by extrapolation. Refractive indices for walls suspended in bovine serum albumin solutions ranged from 1.348 for walls of the rod form of Arthrobacter crystallopoietes to 1.382 for walls of the teichoic acid deficient, 52A5 strain of Staphylococcus aureus. These indices were used to calculate approximate values for solids content per milliliter, and the calculated values agreed closely with those estimated from a knowledge of dextran-impermeable volumes per gram, dry weight, of the walls. When large molecules such as dextrans or serum albumin were used for immersion refractometry, the refractive indices obtained were for entire walls, including both wall polymers and wall water. When smaller molecules that can penetrate wall pores to various extents were used with Micrococcus lysodeikticus walls, the average, apparent refractive index of the structures increased as the molecular size of probing molecules was decreased. It was possible to obtain an estimate of 1.45 to 1.46 for the refractive index of wall polymers, predominantly peptidoglycans in this case, by extrapolating the curve for refractive index versus molecular radius to a value of 0.2 nm, the approximate radius of a water molecule. This relatively low value for polymer refractive index was interpreted as evidence in favor of the amorphous, elastic model of peptidoglycan structure and against the crystalline, rigid model.
TI  - Ultrastructure of the intermediate stages in the reverting L-phase organisms of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  
TI  - Present significance of resistance to trimethoprim and sulphonamides in coliforms, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The incidence of trimethoprim resistance in coliforms and multiresistant strains  of Staphylococcus aureus isolated in Bristol from 1970 to 1972 is low-2.3 and 1.0% respectively. The resistance is probably intrinsic; there is no evidence that it is R-factor or plasmid mediated. A single mechanism that confers resistance to both trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole has not been detected. Normal growing one-step mutants of S. aureus and Escherichia coli resistant to trimethoprim could not be isolated in vitro. For these reasons cotrimoxazole should retain its usefulness against these bacteria for some years. However, contrimoxazole was found not to be bactericidal against many coliforms. The usefulness of cotrimoxazole against Streptococcus faecalis seems limited because mutants resistant to trimethoprim occurred at high frequency in one step.
TI  - Occurrence of glucosamine residues with free amino groups in cell wall peptidoglycan from bacilli as a factor responsible for resistance to lysozyme.
AB  - Analysis by dinitrophenylation techniques revealed the occurrence of significant  amounts of glucosamine residues with free amino groups in the peptidoglycan component of cell walls isolated from Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus megaterium. A close correlation was demonstrated between the content of N-unacetylated glucosamine residues in the peptidoglycan component and the resistance of the cell walls to lysozyme. These lysozyme-resistant cell walls and peptidoglycan were converted into a lysozyme-sensitive form by means of N-acetylation with acetic anhydride. Thus, the occurrence of the N-unacetylated glucosamine residues in the peptidoglycan component accounts for the resistance of these cell walls to lysozyme. The N-unacetylated glucosamine residues were not found in a significant amount in the cell walls of Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei, or Lactobacillus arabinosus.
TI  - Non-specific agglutination of Mycoplasma gallisepticum by rheumatoid factor-like  antiglobulin in chickens infected with Streptococcus faecalis or Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  
TI  - Serum proteins of gnotobiotic rats.
AB  - Cellulose-acetate and agar gel immunoelectrophoresis were used to study the serum protein patterns of germfree rats before and after monoassociation with a pure culture of Staphylococcus aureus (phage type 80/81), Streptococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bacteroides fragilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Proteus vulgaris. All six bacteria quickly established themselves in the gastrointestinal tract of the germfree rat, and all six increased the animals' total serum proteins. Only S. aureus and P. aeruginosa caused a noticeable rise in gamma globulins. L. acidophilus, S. faecalis, and B. fragilis multiplied readily in the gastrointestinal tract but caused only minimal alterations in the serum proteins. P. vulgaris caused a marked increase in the alpha and beta, but not the gamma globulins.
TI  - Evaluation and standardization of an agglutination test for human listeriosis.
AB  - Human sera from patients with culturally confirmed listeriosis were tested for immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) agglutinating antibodies with trypsinized antigens of Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. The response of humans to listeria infections is mainly IgM rather than IgG as found in animals. The antigens prepared from L. monocytogenes serotypes 1a, 1b, 2, 4b, and 4d were evaluated for specificity with normal sera, sera from patients with various other diseases, and sera from patients with listeriosis. The trypsinized antigens appeared to be specific for listeria antibodies with a cross-reaction rate of from 5.4 to 6%. Cross-reaction with S. aureus can be eliminated by absorption of the serum with S. aureus. This agglutination technique appears to be applicable for diagnostic testing, but, as with all serological procedures, both acute and convalescent sera should be tested.
TI  - Amoxycillin: a new semi-synthetic penicillin.
AB  - Amoxycillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzylpenicillin) is a new semi-synthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity similar to that of ampicillin. Penicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci were sensitive to concentrations of 0.1 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. Strains of Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by a level of 0.5 mug/ml, and most strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella species, and Streptococcus faecalis were sensitive to a concentration of 5 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. Penicillinase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indole-positive Proteus, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter were insensitive to amoxycillin. The new penicillin was bactericidal in activity, as with other penicillins, and its antibacterial activity was not reduced in the presence of serum. After oral administration to volunteer subjects amoxycillin produced serum concentrations twice as high as those obtained with similar doses of ampicillin, and the penicillin was recovered unchanged in high concentrations in the urine. The absorption of amoxycillin was not greatly influenced by food, and administration of probenecid resulted in increased and more prolonged concentrations of amoxycillin in serum.
TI  - The role of hydrogen and potassium ions in the transport of acidic amino acids in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  
TI  - Complete deficiency of leukocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase with defective bactericidal activity.
AB  - A 52 yr old Caucasian female (F. E.) had hemolytic anemia, a leukemoid reaction,  and fatal sepsis due to Escherichia coli. Her leukocytes ingested bacteria normally but did not kill catalase positive Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. An H(2)O(2)-producing bacterium, Streptococcus faecalis, was killed normally. Granule myeloperoxidase, acid and alkaline phosphatase, and beta glucuronidase activities were normal, and these enzymes shifted normally to the phagocyte vacuole (light and electron microscopy). Intravacuolar reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium did not occur. Moreover, only minimal quantities of H(2)O(2) were generated, and the hexose monophosphate shunt (HMPS) was not stimulated during phagocytosis. These observations suggested the diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease. However, in contrast to control and chronic granulomatous disease leukocytes, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was completely absent in F. E. leukocytes whereas NADH oxidase and NADPH oxidase activities were both normal. Unlike chronic granulomatous disease, methylene blue did not stimulate the hexose monophosphate shunt in F. E. cells. Thus, F. E. and chronic granulomatous disease leukocytes appear to share certain metabolic and bactericidal defects, but the metabolic basis of the abnormality differs. Chronic granulomatous disease cells lack oxidase activity which produces H(2)O(2); F. E. cells had normal levels of oxidase activity but failed to produce NADPH due to complete glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. These data indicate that a complete absence of leukocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase with defective hexose monophosphate shunt activity is associated with low H(2)O(2) production and inadequate bactericidal activity, and further suggest an important role for NADPH in the production of H(2)O(2) in human granulocytes.
TI  - Quantitative studies on the salivary flora.
AB  - In a quantitative bacteriological study of the salivary flora from 50 children the following aerobic organisms were identified and enumerated: alpha-haemolytic streptococci, beta-haemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus faecalis, pneumococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. albus and Staph. citreus, Neisseria spp, N. meningitidis, corynebacteria, aerobic lactobacilli, B. subtilis, H. influenzae, coliform organisms, and Candida spp. Many of the known potentially pathogenic members were present in large numbers. It is suggested that knowledge of the relative numbers of the organisms that comprise the salivary flora will lead to a greater understanding of the ecology of the mouth and of the pathogenesis of oral infections.
TI  - Media exchange method for demonstrating killing of L-phase variants in solid media by normal human serum.
AB  - Normal human serum has been shown to kill L-phase variants in a fluid system by the action of antibody plus complement. Previous studies, however, failed to demonstrate such killing in solid media. This failure probably resulted from inhibition of complement by medium components such as agar and NaCl. A method was developed which circumvents the problems of the anticomplementary properties of agar media and the requirement of some L-phase variants for concentrations of salt that inhibit complement. Using this method, we have demonstrated in solid media the killing by normal human serum of the L-phase variants of Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhi. This method provides a relatively simple and graphic means for studying host humoral factors lethal for L-phase variants.
TI  - [Criteria of bacterial count in urine. I. The growth of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus aureus in urine].
AB  
TI  - Injury of bacteria by sanitizers.
AB  - Injury of test cultures was quantitated by differences in colony counts obtained  with a complete medium and those obtained on conventional selective media. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, and several strains of Escherichia coli were injured when exposed to the quaternary ammonium compound methylalkyltrimethyl ammonium chloride. Representative hypochlorite sanitizers also caused injury of E. coli ML30. Sanitizer concentration appeared to be the main factor in the cause of death and injury, a higher concentration being needed to cause death. Increases in temperature did not result in substantial increases in injury; however, the lethal effect was greater at higher temperatures. Varying the cell concentration from 10(7) to 10(9) cells per ml did not change the fraction of cell population killed or injured. The inability or failure of common selective media to detect injured bacteria in food could have serious public health consequences.
TI  - In-vitro comparison of erythromycin, lincomycin, and clindamycin.
AB  - The in-vitro antibacterial activities of erythromycin, lincomycin, and clindamycin, a new derivative of lincomycin, were compared. Clindamycin was always more active than lincomycin, and was either as active as erythromycin or more so against betahaemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus viridans, Str. pneumoniae, and erythromycin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. It was also fully active against most erythromycin-resistant strains of Staph. aureus. On the other hand, it was somewhat less active than erythromycin against Haemophilus influenzae and considerably less active than erythromycin against Str. faecalis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.Clinical trials seem to be justified in infections with sensitive organisms for which erythromycin might have been indicated.
TI  - Cores, microbial organelles possibly specific to group D streptococci.
AB  - A long, thin, approximately cylindrical core spans the interior of cells of 24-hr cultures of all group D streptococci that were examined, five strains of Streptococcus faecalis, single strains of S. faecalis subsp. zymogenes and S. durans, and three strains of Streptococcus spp. In one strain of S. faecalis, serial section electron microscopy showed that most cells possess a core. The core is 0.10 to 0.16 mum thick and consists of a matrix and an axial array of ribosomelike particles. It resembles one of two types of cores present in a stable protoplast form of one of the S. faecalis strains. Cores were not present in single strains of S. pyogenes (beta-hemolytic group A), S. agalactiae (group B), S. dysgalactiae (group C), S. equisimilis (group C), and S. mitis (viridans group) that were examined; nor were cores observed in single strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus megaterium. Cores may be useful, therefore, in identification of group D streptococci. For preservation and rapid recognition of cores, a glutaraldehyde-osmium tetroxide sequence of fixation appears superior to the osmium tetroxide method often employed in processing bacteria for electron microscopy.
TI  - Enhancing effect on alkalinization of the medium on the activity of erythromycin  against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of erythromycin was markedly enhanced by alkalinization of the culture medium or urine within the clinical range (pH 6.0 to 8.2). This effect was demonstrated against recent isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. The urine of normal volunteers was made alkaline by ingestion of sodium bicarbonate or acetazolamide (Diamox) during administration of 1.0 g of erythromycin every 8 hr; such urine was capable of inhibiting E. coli and K. pneumoniae even when diluted up to (in one instance) 128 times with broth of the same pH as the urine. Undiluted urine of the same subjects, without alkalinization, was seldom capable of inhibiting these organisms. The range of pH (6.6 to 8.6) over which the antibacterial effect was enhanced coincided with that over which there was decreasing ionization of a basic group.
TI  - Effect of different media on in vitro studies of antibiotic combinations.
AB  - In an effort to determine the adequacy of a standard broth medium in the evaluation of antibiotic combinations, 20 strains of various bacterial species were studied simultaneously in Mueller-Hinton broth and in freshly drawn human serum from apparently healthy volunteers. Studies of growth dynamics by use of the usual plate dilution technique for quantitating colony-forming units were performed with strains of Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible), Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Aerobacter, Klebsiella, and Proteus mirabilis. A variety of different antibiotics were investigated. With 19 of the 20 strains, interpretations of synergism or antagonism were the same in both media. Therefore, despite minor variations when the same strain was studied in both serum and broth, it is concluded that Mueller-Hinton broth is an adequate medium for use in studies of chemotherapeutic combinations in vitro. A simplified method for studying bactericidal activity is described, which is deemed practical for clinical microbiology laboratories and which led to the same conclusions regarding the combinations as were obtained by the more arduous plate dilution test.
TI  - Rapid and sensitive detection of bacteria by gas chromatography.
AB  - A gas chromatograph fitted with electron capture and flame ionization detectors was employed for the rapid detection of bacteria by analysis for their metabolic products. The presence of Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, S. liquefaciens, Escherichia coli B, Bacillus cereus, and B. popilliae was detected in 2 to 4 hr in media inoculated with less than 10(4) cells per ml, whereas a 7- to 12-hr growth period was required for the detection of products formed in cultures of Serratia marcescens, Aerobacter aerogenes, E. coli K-12, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella typhimurium. Metabolites elaborated by the equivalent of less than a single cell of B. cereus, S. faecalis, P. vulgaris, or E. coli B were sensed by the electron capture detector. The flame ionization detector was generally not as sensitive. Volatile metabolites were identified, and their concentrations were determined.
TI  - In vivo and in vitro action of norethindrone on staphylococci.
AB  - Norethindrone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. Turbidimetric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of norethindrone. The organisms tested included Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus conglomeratus, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhosa, Shigella flexnerii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus vulgaris. Bacteriostatic action was shown only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown anaerobically in Tryptic Soy Broth containing 10 to 50 mug of norethindrone per ml. The bacteriostatic action of norethindrone was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation and it was reduced by the presence of oxygen. Mestranol at a concentration of 1 to 10 mug/ml failed to exert any significant action on S. aureus. However, incorporation of 5 mug of mestranol per ml in the culture medium enhanced the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone on staphylococci. Enhancement of the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone could not be obtained by the addition of a concentration of 5 mug/ml of testosterone, 17alpha-estradiol, and 17beta-estradiol. Progesterone and 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one under similar conditions showed an additive bacteriostatic effect when they were incorporated into the culture medium containing norethindrone. In vivo studies indicated that female, adult New Zealand rabbits, injected subcutaneously with two injections of 10 to 20 mug of norethindrone, 24 hr apart, and challenged intradermally with S. aureus 4 hr after the second injection, had fewer lesions with smaller areas of swelling and erythema as compared to control, nontreated rabbits. The protective effect of norethindrone on the development of staphylococcal lesion seemed related to hormone concentration. Thus, it was demonstrated with doses of 20, 15, and 10 mug, but not with doses of 1 and 5 mug. When the lesions were excised 48 to 92 hr after infection and when viable cell counts were made, rabbits treated with norethindrone showed significantly lower staphylococcal counts than the control rabbits. During the 1st day after infection with S. aureus, leukocytic counts of the norethindrone-treated rabbits remained normal, whereas control animals showed elevated leukocytic counts.
TI  - Broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of a new triazenoimidazole.
AB  - Methyl-5(or 4)-(3,3-dimethyl-1-triazeno)-imidazole-4(or 5)-carboxylate was shown  to have in vitro antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, yeasts, filamentous fungi, and algae. Preliminary studies with mice, experimentally infected with Staphylococcus aureus, have shown that this new antimicrobial agent has in vivo chemotherapeutic activity comparable to that observed with penicillin.
TI  - Effect of lactic acid bacteria on growth of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Cultures of lactic acid bacteria, mostly from foods, were tested for their effect on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus in Trypticase Soy Broth (BBL). Some of the effectors, e.g., Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecium, Lactobacillus lactis, L. brevis, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides, stimulated growth of S. aureus during early hours of growth, especially at higher temperatures of incubation, but most cultures were inhibitory, and some (S. faecium and L. mesenteroides) were even killing by the time of attainment of the maximal phase of growth of the Staphylococcus. Low-temperature meat lactobacilli and Leuconostoc dextranicum inhibited S. aureus at 10, 15, 20, and 25 C throughout its growth. Streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens inhibited at these temperatures and at 30 and 37 C, as well. When the ratio of effectors to staphylococci in the inoculum was 100:1, the three enterococci, the meat Lactobacillus, and L. dextranicum prevented the attainment of 5 x 10(6) staphylococci per milliliter at 15 C, and all but the meat Lactobacillus did so at 22 C. A ratio of 1:1 accomplished similar results at 15 C, except that S. aureus was only delayed for 12 hr by S. faecalis. A ratio of 1:100 usually was ineffective. In general, the more effector bacteria there were in the inoculum, the greater was the overall inhibition (or stimulation) of S. aureus. Inhibition was most effective at 10 or 15 C, less so at 20 or 25 C, and least at 30 or 37 C, whereas stimulation during early growth was greater at the higher temperatures. Results with different strains of the effectors and with two strains of S. aureus were similar, for the most part.
TI  - PLASMA COAGULATION BY ORGANISMS OTHER THAN STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS.
AB  - Bayliss, Berenice G. (Washington State University, Pullman), and Elizabeth R. Hall. Plasma coagulation by organisms other than Staphylococcus aureus. J. Bacteriol. 89:101-105. 1965.-Approximately 200 organisms were investigated for their ability to clot human and rabbit plasma. Various anticoagulants were used in preparing the plasma: acid-citrate-dextrose, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, balanced oxalate, potassium and sodium oxalates, and heparin. Twelve organisms were found which coagulated citrated plasma in less than 8 hr: four strains of Streptococcus faecalis; two strains of S. faecalis var. zymogenes; three strains of S. faecalis var. liquefaciens; and one strain each of S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. Six strains of coagulase-positive Staphylococcus were selected for use as controls. Experiments were performed to determine the mechanism by which these microorganisms coagulated citrated plasma. As this was the only plasma clotted, it was presumed that the citrate was utilized by the microorganisms, thereby releasing the calcium which was then made available so that normal physiological clotting could occur. To test this hypothesis, a chromatographic method was employed to determine the presence or absence of citrate. Coagulation tests, by use of increasing amounts of citrate, showed a linear relationship between the amount of citrate in the plasma and the coagulation time. It was demonstrated that the organisms must be actively metabolizing to clot citrated plasma. Proof for this was obtained by using a cell-free filtrate, to which thimerosal had been added to inhibit growth, instead of whole cultures for the coagulation test. Only the coagulase-positive staphylococci coagulated the citrated plasma under these conditions. From the results obtained, it was concluded that plasma coagulation by these organisms was by citrate utilization.
TI  - HAIR AS A RESERVOIR OF STAPHYLOCOCCI.
AB  - The occurrence of Staphylococcus aureus in the hair of the scalp was investigated in three groups: out-patients, in-patients, and staff of a general hospital. Bacteria were grown from the hair of all the subjects tested and Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest pathogen isolated. It was found more frequently in the hair than in the nose but 20% of hair carriers of Staph. aureus were not nasal carriers. In hospital staff and in-patients, the staphylococci were highly resistant to antibiotics, and phage types usually classified as ;hospital staphylococci' predominated. There were more staphylococcal post-operative wound infections in hair carriers than in non-carriers, and in three cases the Staph. aureus was of the same phage type as that isolated pre-operatively from the hair.
