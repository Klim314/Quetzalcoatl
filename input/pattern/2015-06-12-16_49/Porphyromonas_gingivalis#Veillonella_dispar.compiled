TI  - Microbial dynamics during conversion from supragingival to subgingival biofilms in an in vitro model.
AB  - The development of dental caries and periodontal diseases result from distinct shifts in the microbiota of the tooth-associated biofilm. This in vitro study aimed to investigate changes in biofilm composition and structure, during the shift from a "supragingival" aerobic to a "subgingival" anaerobic profile. Biofilms consisting of Actinomyces oris, Candida albicans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mutans and Veillonella dispar were aerobically grown in saliva-containing medium on hydroxyapatite discs. After 64 h, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia and Streptococcus anginosus were further added along with human serum, while culture conditions were shifted to microaerophilic. After 96 h, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola were finally added and the biofilm was grown anaerobically for another 64 h. At the end of each phase, biofilms were harvested for species-specific quantification and localization. Apart from C. albicans, all other species gradually increased during aerobic and microaerophilic conditions, but remained steady during anaerobic conditions. Biofilm thickness was doubled during the microaerophilic phase, but remained steady throughout the anaerobic phase. Extracellular polysaccharide presence was gradually reduced throughout the growth period. Biofilm viability was reduced during the microaerophilic conversion, but was recovered during the anaerobic phase. This in vitro study has characterized the dynamic structural shifts occurring in an oral biofilm model during the switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, potentially modeling the conversion of supragingival to subgingival biofilms. Within the limitations of this experimental model, the findings may provide novel insights into the ecology of oral biofilms. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
TI  - Establishment of an oral infection model resembling the periodontal pocket in a perfusion bioreactor system.
AB  - Periodontal infection involves a complex interplay between oral biofilms, gingival tissues and cells of the immune system in a dynamic microenvironment. A humanized in vitro model that reduces the need for experimental animal models, while recapitulating key biological events in a periodontal pocket, would constitute a technical advancement in the study of periodontal disease. The aim of this study was to use a dynamic perfusion bioreactor in order to develop a gingival epithelial-fibroblast-monocyte organotypic co-culture on collagen sponges. An 11 species subgingival biofilm was used to challenge the generated tissue in the bioreactor for a period of 24 h. The histological and scanning electron microscopy analysis displayed an epithelial-like layer on the surface of the collagen sponge, supported by the underlying ingrowth of gingival fibroblasts, while monocytic cells were also found within the sponge mass. Bacterial quantification of the biofilm showed that in the presence of the organotypic tissue, the growth of selected biofilm species, especially Campylobacter rectus, Actinomyces oris, Streptococcus anginosus, Veillonella dispar, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, was suppressed, indicating a potential antimicrobial effect by the tissue. Multiplex immunoassay analysis of cytokine secretion showed that interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-2, IL-4, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels in cell culture supernatants were significantly up-regulated in presence of the biofilm, indicating a positive inflammatory response of the organotypic tissue to the biofilm challenge. In conclusion, this novel host-biofilm interaction organotypic model might resemble the periodontal pocket and have an important impact on the study of periodontal infections, by minimizing the need for the use of experimental animal models.
TI  - Colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. This in vitro study investigated the colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola). METHODS: The grown biofilm consisted of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Veillonella dispar, P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, T. forsythia, T. denticola, Actinomyces oris, Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". After 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: Exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected S. oralis, but not other species. The "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. A co-localisation trend was observed between P. gingivalis and T. denticola, as determined by FISH. However, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially S. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both CLSM and SEM. CONCLUSIONS: While the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. This antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.
TI  - In vitro growth characteristics and volatile sulfur compound production of Solobacterium moorei.
AB  - Solobacterium moorei has recently been implicated as a causative agent of halitosis. In vitro experiments to evaluate the role of S. moorei in halitosis have, however, been complicated by a paucity of information on the ideal conditions for culturing this organism. This work aimed to optimize a liquid culture medium for S. moorei, and to determine the growth-curve of the organism. Further, the ability of S. moorei to generate volatile sulfur compounds was investigated and compared quantitatively to other oral anaerobes by an optimized head-space gas chromatography method. Serum-supplementation of standard liquid growth media gave greater growth of S. moorei than non-supplemented broths, with the best medium found to be serum-supplemented tryptone soya broth. S. moorei was able to metabolize cysteine directly to hydrogen sulfide, but was unable to produce methanethiol from methionine. S. moorei produced 2-3 times more hydrogen sulfide (normalized for colony forming units) than Porphyromonas gingivalis and Veillonella dispar, but considerably less than Fusobacterium nucleatum. The study has identified reliable growth conditions for culture of S. moorei, which were employed to show that S. moorei has the requisite biochemistry consistent with a potential role in halitosis.
TI  - Impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. The model included Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus anginosus, Actinomycesoris, Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, Veillonella dispar, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola. Based on literature, we considered Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus anginosus, and Actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. We quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative PCR and further compared the structures using confocal laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. The absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. The biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. However, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. In the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. Moreover, besides a significant increase of P. intermedia and a decrease of P. gingivalis , P. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. A. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. Hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on P. intermedia and P. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. Streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of P. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence P. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.
TI  - Validation of a quantitative real-time PCR assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. Owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. The aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming unit (CFU) counts on selective agar plates. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 10 species included in the in vitro biofilm were Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus anginosus, Veillonella dispar, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, Actinomyces oris, Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia. The numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qPCR, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of CFUs after growth on selective agar plates. RESULTS: All 10 species were successfully quantified using qPCR and FISH or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers of CFUs after growth on selective agar. In early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between methods. In late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qPCR and FISH or immunofluorescence, but not by CFU counts, maintained significant correlation. CFU counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. CONCLUSION: Quantitative PCR and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. However, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. This may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.
TI  - Microbiologic profile of endodontic infections from HIV- and HIV+ patients using  multiple-displacement amplification and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the microbiota of endodontic infections in necrotic pulp from HIV-negative and HIV-positive subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Root canal samples from necrotic pulp were collected from 40 HIV- and 20 HIV+ subjects. Pulps were amplified using multiple displacement amplification (MDA). Then, checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization was employed to assess the levels of 107 microbial taxa. The percentage of DNA probe count and the percentage of teeth colonized by each test species were investigated. Significant differences between groups regarding proportions of taxa and prevalence of the test species were sought using the Mann-Whitney test and the Chi-square analysis, respectively. RESULTS: The most prevalent taxa detected were Dialister pneumosintes, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Streptococcus sobrinus, Corynebacterium diphteriae, and Helicobacter pylori among HIV- subjects and D. pneumosintes, Prevotella tannerae, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella nigrescens, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae among HIV+ individuals. D. pneumosintes, C. diphtheria, and C. albicans were the most abundant species in the HIV- group, whereas the predominant taxa in HIV+ samples were P. tannerae, D. pneumosintes and Olsenella uli. P. tannerae, O. uli, Veilonella dispar, Bacteroides fragilis, and Actinomyces meyeri were significantly more abundant in HIV+ samples. CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences in the prevalence and proportions of specific microbial taxa between HIV- and HIV+ individuals. The root canal microbiota may represent a reservoir of important oral and medical pathogens, mainly in HIV+ individuals.
TI  - Selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. METHODS: A gradient plate technique was used to expose Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Neisseria subflava, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations of triclosan. Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 was included as an organism showing the triclosan resistance development trait. MIC values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. RESULTS: N. subflava, Pr. nigrescens Po. gingivalis and E. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (MIC range 0.1-3.9 mg/L), whereas the lactobacillus and S. mutans were less susceptible (MIC range 15.6-20.8 mg/L). Triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (P < 0.01) for the positive control E. coli, although its MICs towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. Minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (MIC) occurred for Pr. nigrescens and in S. sanguis and S. oralis (MBC). Mean changes in susceptibilities (MIC and MBC) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine MBCs for S. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. CONCLUSIONS: These data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for E. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. Other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than FabI that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.
TI  - Effects of glucose and fluoride on competition and metabolism within in vitro dental bacterial communities and biofilms.
AB  - Antimicrobial effects of fluoride in vivo remain contentious. Previous studies suggested that 1 mM NaF reduced acid production from glucose, and prevented the enrichment of bacteria associated with caries in a chemostat model. The present study examines the effects of a lower fluoride concentration (0.53 mM, 10 ppm NaF) in both biofilm and planktonic microbial communities. Nine oral species were grown at pH 7.0 and pulsed on 10 successive days with glucose; bacterial metabolism was allowed to reduce the pH for 6 h before being returned to neutrality, either in the presence or absence of NaF. In addition, 10-day-old mixed culture biofilms were overlaid with glucose, with or without NaF, and the pH change followed by microelectrode. After 10 days, chemostat pH dropped to ca. pH 4.5 following glucose pulses, and the community was dominated by Streptococcus mutans (rising from 4 to 23% of total CFU) and Veillonella dispar (16 to 73%). In comparison, after 10 days pulsing with glucose + fluoride, the final pH was significantly higher (ca. pH 4.9) (paired t test, p < 0.0001). The culture was predominated by V. dispar (70%) and Actinomyces naeslundii (13%), whereas S. mutans proportions were significantly lower (t test, p = 0.04), remaining <3% of the total flora, compared to the culture without fluoride. Biofilm pH fell to only pH 5.55 1 h after glucose/fluoride overlay, compared to 4.55 with glucose alone (paired t test, p < 0.000001). Analysis of the data suggests that fluoride exerts dual antimicrobial modes of action. Fluoride prevents enrichment of S. mutans by inhibiting critical metabolic processes (direct effect) and, in an inter-related way, by reducing environmental acidification (indirect effect) in biofilms.
TI  - The formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  - A chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). Eleven bacterial species (Streptococcus gordonii, Strep. mitis I, Strep. mutans, Strep. oralis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus casei, Neisseria subflava, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens, Veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. A flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. The biofilm produced from state-1 showed a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 Pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 Pa). The biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. Gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while Gram-negative species were predominant in state-2.
TI  - The effect of chlorhexidine on defined, mixed culture oral biofilms grown in a novel model system.
AB  - In order to develop an improved method to evaluate antimicrobial agents for use in clinical dentistry, a constant-depth film fermenter (CDFF) has been used to generate biofilms of fixed depth comprising nine species of bacteria commonly found in dental plaque in health and disease. These bacteria were grown together initially in a conventional chemostat which was used to inoculate the CDFF over an 8 h period. Medium was then supplied directly to the CDFF and biofilms allowed to develop. The biofilms were then challenged with eight short pulses of two concentrations of chlorhexidine (0.0125 and 0.125% w/v). The lower concentration had a limited effect on the composition of the biofilms while a differential and substantial inhibition was obtained with a higher concentration. Actinomyces naeslundii was lost from the biofilm, and the viable counts of streptococci, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis were inhibited by over three orders of magnitude by 0.125% chlorhexidine, whereas Veillonella dispar was only transiently affected. The findings were consistent with those from clinical studies of dental plaque, suggesting that this model would have a predictive value when evaluating novel antiplaque or antimicrobial inhibitors.
TI  - Microbial alterations in supragingival dental plaque in response to a triclosan-containing dentifrice.
AB  - A total of 325 subjects were entered into a double-blind, stratified 2-treatment  clinical study that examined the effects of a dentifrice containing 0.3% triclosan, 2% Gantrez copolymer and 0.243% sodium fluoride on supragingival dental plaque and gingivitis. A subset of 159 subjects including 72 men and 87 women participated in the microbiological component of this study, which was designed to detect shifts in supragingival bacterial species in response to triclosan. Subjects were divided into two groups: one performed normal oral hygiene with the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice and a control group used a placebo dentifrice without triclosan. At baseline, 3 and 6 months during treatment and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks post-treatment, supragingival dental plaque was collected from the buccal and lingual surfaces of the 4 first molar teeth and assayed for: 1) bacterial morphotypes by phase-contrast microscopy; 2) select bacterial groups and bacterial species by culture; and 3) target periodontal pathogens including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia by immunofluorescence microscopy. There were few statistically significant differences between treatment groups in any of the 90 microbiological parameters measured at the 7 different time points. The control group demonstrated significantly higher levels of cultivable Neisseria and higher proportions at the 3-month treatment period of P. gingivalis-infected subjects and mean cells. After 6 months of treatment, the triclosan group demonstrated higher levels of fusiforms. Analysis of triclosan resistance data failed to detect a shift towards increased proportions of bacteria resistant to triclosan, and both treatment groups demonstrated triclosan-resistant strains, predominantly Veillonella dispar. This study confirms the microbiological safety of triclosan-containing dentifrices and suggests that continued use can be associated with beneficial alterations in the bacterial composition of supragingival dental plaque.
TI  - The effects of triclosan and zinc citrate, alone and in combination, on a community of oral bacteria grown in vitro.
AB  - A mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of Triclosan and zinc citrate. The inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/L Triclosan and 39.8 mumol/L zinc citrate. When dosed, Triclosan inhibited A. viscosus and all five Gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. Similar effects were seen when Triclosan was pulsed, except that S. mutans was the most sensitive Gram-positive species and V. dispar was unaffected. However, when the inhibitors were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against Gram-negative species, although S. gordonii and S. oralis were relatively unaffected. The data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.
