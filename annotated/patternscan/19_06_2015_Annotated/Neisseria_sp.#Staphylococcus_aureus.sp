TI  == microbiological quality of indoor air in university libraries.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the concentration of bacteria and fungi in the indoor environment of jimma university libraries, so as to estimate the health hazard and to create standards for indoor air quality control. methods: the microbial quality of indoor air of eight libraries of jimma university was determined. the  settle plate method using open petri-dishes containing different culture media was employed to collect sample twice daily. isolates were identified according to standard methods. results: the concentrations of bacteria and fungi aerosols in the indoor environment of the university libraries ranged between 367-2595 cfu/m(3). according to the sanitary standards classification of european commission, almost all the libraries indoor air of jimma university was heavily contaminated with bacteria and fungi. in spite of their major source difference,  the average fungi density found in the indoor air of libraries did appear to follow the same trend with bacterial density (p=0.001). the bacteria isolates included micrococcus sp., staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus sp. and neisseria sp. while cladosporium sp., alternaria sp., penicillium sp. and aspergillus sp. were the most isolated fungi. conclusions: the indoor air of all  libraries were in the range above highly contaminated according to european commission classification and the most isolates are considered as potential candidates involved in the establishment of sick building syndromes and often associated with clinical manifestations like allergy, rhinitis, asthma and conjunctivitis. thus, attention must be given to control those environmental factors which favor the growth and multiplication of microbes in indoor environment of libraries to safeguard the health of users and workers.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo profiles of ach-702, an isothiazoloquinolone, against bacterial pathogens.
AB  == ach-702, a novel isothiazoloquinolone (itq), was assessed for antibacterial activity against a panel of gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates and found to possess broad-spectrum activity, especially against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive strains, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). for gram-negative bacteria, ach-702 showed exceptional potency against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and a neisseria sp. but was less active against members of the enterobacteriaceae. good antibacterial activity was also evident against several anaerobes as well as legionella pneumophila and mycoplasma pneumoniae. excellent bactericidal activity was observed for ach-702 against several bacterial pathogens in time-kill assays, and postantibiotic effects (paes) of >1 h were evident with both laboratory and clinical strains of  staphylococci at 10 x mic and similar in most cases to those observed for moxifloxacin at the same mic multiple. in vivo efficacy was demonstrated against  s. aureus with murine sepsis and thigh infection models, with decreases in the number of cfu/thigh equal to or greater than those observed after vancomycin treatment. macromolecular synthesis assays showed specific dose-dependent inhibition of dna replication in staphylococci, and biochemical analyses indicated potent dual inhibition of two essential dna replication enzymes: dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv. additional biological data in support of an effective dual targeting mechanism of action include the following: low mic values (</=0.25 mug/ml) against staphylococcal strains with single mutations in both gyra and grla (parc), retention of good antibacterial activity (mics of </=0.5 mug/ml) against staphylococcal strains with two mutations in both gyra and grla, and low frequencies for the selection of higher-level resistance (<10(-)(1)(0)). these promising initial data support further study of isothiazoloquinolones as potential clinical candidates.

TI  == anti-bacterial activity of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy: comparative in vitro study of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, mefloquine,  and azithromycin.
AB  == background: intermittent preventive treatment of malaria with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) is recommended for the prevention of malaria in pregnancy in sub-saharan africa. increasing drug resistance necessitates the urgent evaluation of alternative drugs. currently, the most promising candidates  in clinical development are mefloquine and azithromycin. besides the anti-malarial activity, sp is also a potent antibiotic and incurs significant anti-microbial activity when given as iptp - though systematic clinical evaluation of this action is still lacking. methods: in this study, the intrinsic anti-bacterial activity of mefloquine and azithromycin was assessed in comparison to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine against bacterial pathogens with clinical importance in pregnancy in a standard microdilution assay. results: sp was highly active against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. all tested gram-positive bacteria, except enterococcus faecalis, were sensitive to azithromycin. additionally, azithromycin was active against neisseria gonorrhoeae. mefloquine showed good activity against pneumococci but lower in vitro action against all other tested pathogens. conclusion: these data indicate  important differences in the spectrum of anti-bacterial activity for the evaluated anti-malarial drugs. given the large scale use of iptp in africa, the need for prospective clinical trials evaluating the impact of antibiotic activity of anti-malarials on maternal and foetal health and on the risk of promoting specific drug resistance of bacterial pathogens is discussed.

TI  == adrenal gland hemorrhage in patients with fatal bacterial infections.
AB  == a wide spectrum of adrenal gland pathology is seen during bacterial infections. hemorrhage is particularly associated with meningococcemia, while abscesses have  been described with several neonatal infections. we studied adrenal gland histopathology of 65 patients with bacterial infections documented in a variety of tissues by using immunohistochemistry. the infections diagnosed included neisseria meningitidies, group a streptococcus, rickettsia rickettsii, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, ehrlichia sp., bacillus anthracis, leptospira sp., clostridium sp., klebsiella sp., legionella sp., yersinia pestis, and treponema pallidum. bacteria were detected in the adrenal of 40 (61%) cases. adrenal hemorrhage was present in 39 (60%) cases. bacteria or bacterial antigens were observed in 31 (79%) of the cases with adrenal hemorrhage including 14 with n. meningitidis, four with r. rickettsii, four with s. pneumoniae, three with group a streptococcus, two with s. aureus, two with b. anthracis, one with t. pallidum, and one with legionella sp. bacterial antigens were observed in nine of 26 non-hemorrhagic adrenal glands that showed inflammatory foci (four cases), edema (two cases), congestion (two cases), or necrosis (one case). hemorrhage is the most frequent adrenal gland pathology observed in fatal bacterial infections. bacteria and bacterial antigens are frequently seen in adrenal glands with hemorrhage and may play a pathogenic role. although n. meningitidis is the most frequent bacteria associated with adrenal gland pathology, a broad collection of bacteria can also cause adrenal lesions.

TI  == acute bacterial meningitis among children, in manhica, a rural area in southern mozambique.
AB  == introduction: acute bacterial meningitis (abm) is one of the most severe diseases in sub-saharan africa. although data for the continent is very limited, more than one million cases are estimated per year, with mortality and life-long sequelae occurring in 50% of these cases. methods: as part of the clinical management of children admitted to the manhica district hospital, information on cases of abm was recorded. we analysed data from june 1998 to november 2003. results: during the study period, 475 cerebrospinal-fluid (csf) samples were collected from 20,173 children <15 years of age admitted to hospital. culture results confirmed  71 (15%) cases of abm. the most prevalent bacterial aetiologies were streptotoccus pneumoniae (pneumococcus, n=31), haemophilus influenzae (n=13) and  neisseria meningitis (n=8). other important bacteria were streptococcus sp. (n=7), salmonella sp. (n=4) and staphylococcus aureus (n=3). crude incidence rates of abm and pneumococcal meningitis were 20/100,000 and 10/100,000 children-year-at-risk, respectively. incidences were more than three times higher in the <1 year age group. overall case fatality rate was 36%, and was highest for h. influenzae and pneumococcal meningitis (55% and 45%, respectively, p=0.044). pneumococcal susceptibility was 81% for oxacillin and 93% for chloramphenicol. for h. influenzae isolates, susceptibility was 54% for ampicillin and 62% for chloramphenicol. conclusions: s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae are the main aetiologies responsible for the high burden of morbidity and mortality associated with abm in rural mozambique. these findings are important to evaluate treatment  guidelines and potential impact of control measures.

TI  == bacterial profile and clinical outcome of childhood meningitis in rural yemen: a  2-year hospital-based study.
AB  == background: childhood acute bacterial meningitis (abm) is an important cause of death and long-term neurological disability in yemen, the only low income-high mortality country in the arabian peninsula. the objective of this study was to document the microbial characteristics, the antibacterial sensitivity pattern, and the outcome for children hospitalized with abm, prior to the introduction of  haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) vaccine in yemen. patients and methods: the study was retrospective, conducted at a rural district hospital, serving the rural population of the northern parts of yemen. all patients aged 1 month-15 years admitted between may 1999 and june 2001, with clinical evidence of meningitis and cerebrospinal fluid (csf) cultured, were included in the study. clinical information from case notes, including csf result and the outcome on discharge, were obtained. analysis of extracted data was performed using epi info software. results: during the 2-year study period, 160 study patients met the inclusion criteria, and 7 (4.4%) were negative for bacterial growth. in the 153 positive cultures there were 46 (30.1%) streptococcus pneumoniae (sp), 23 (15%) h. influenzae (hi), 81 (52.9) neisseria meningitidis (nm), 2 (1.3%) staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), and 1 (0.7%) escherichia coli. sixteen study patients died (overall case fatality rate (cfr) 10%), 7 aged under 12 months, 6 aged 12-60 months, and 3 more than 60 months. ten deaths were due to sp meningitis, 2 hi meningitis, 3 nm meningitis, and 1 had s. aureus. of the 144 survivors, 28 (19.4%) developed permanent neurological complications, 17 aged less than 12 months, 6 aged 12-60 months, and 5 more than 60 months. sp meningitis accounted for 57.1% (16/28), and 6 (21.4%) had hi meningitis. among the 89 aged 1-60 months, 13 died (cfr 14.6%), and 23 (30.3%) of the 76 survivors  developed permanent complications. of those tested 20% and 35% of the 20 hi tested isolates and 9.5% and 14.3% of the 42 sp isolates, were resistant to ampicillin and penicillin g, respectively, and the majority of the 81 nm isolates were sensitive to both. the 3 pathogens were largely resistant to gentamicin, and almost all were susceptible to chloramphenicol and cefotaxime. conclusion: in contrast to the studies from the low-mortality countries of the region, our study showed that the predominant pathogens of childhood abm were sp and nm. sp meningitis was associated with increased mortality and permanent disability.

TI  == moxifloxacin (bay 12-8039): a new methoxy quinolone antibacterial.
AB  == moxifloxacin (bay 12-8039) is a new 8 methoxy quinolone antibacterial. the mic90  values are < or = 0.25 mg/l for streptococcus pneumoniae (irrespective of penicillin susceptibility), haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive or negative), morexella catarrhalis, bordetella pertussis, legionella sp., mycoplasma pneumoniae, clamydia pneumoniae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci (macrolide-sensitive or -resistant), listeria sp., most enterobacteriaceae, salmonella sp., shigella sp., neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. menigitidis, pasteurella  spp., vibrio spp. and yersinia enterocolitica. for mycobacterium intracellularae, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus, citrobacter freundii, providencia sp., serratia sp., p. aeruginosa and other non-fermentive gram-negative rods, mic90s are in the range 0.5-4 mg/l. for anaerobic bacteria species, mic90s are also in the range 0.25-4 mg/l. moxifloxacin is bactericidal at concentrations 2- to 4-fold higher than the mic and is rapidly bactericidal against most common pathogen groups at concentrations achieved in serum with a 400 mg dose that is between 0.5-4 mg/l. there is a post-antibiotic effect against gram-positive and -negative bacteria. resistant mutants are at present difficult to select in the laboratory but in general, moxifloxacin has poorer activity against strains resistant to ciprofloxacin compared to those which are susceptible. animal and laboratory pharmacodynamic models indicate that the mic and area under the serum concentration time curve predict outcome. various animal models mainly of respiratory tract infection indicate equivalent or superior results compared to existing or other developmental agents. human pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers indicate linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range 50-800 mg/day. a single dose of 400 mg produces a maximum serum concentration of 2.5-4.5 mg/l, half-life of 11-15 h,  auc of 25-40 mg x h/l and volume of distribution of 2.5-3.5 l/kg. protein binding is about 50% and two metabolites have been identified (m-1 and m-2). bioavailability is > 85% and a minority of clearance is via the kidneys. no dose  modification is required in renal impairment. extra vascular penetration, where studied, is comparable to that of other quinolones. at present undergoing clinical trials, with a focus on respiratory tract infection, it is likely that moxifloxacin will provide effective therapy for pathogens with mics of < or = 0.25-0.5 mg/l. the safety profile in a large number of human subjects is awaited.

TI  == [investigate of nasopharyngeal flora in infants and children with influenza].
AB  == to clarify the bacteriological interpretation of nasopharyngeal flora from infants and children with influenza (n = 38), nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained. from 38 patients, 83 strains of bacterias were obtained. chief pathogenic bacteria isolated from infants and children with influenza were b. catarrhalis (28 strains), s. pneumoniae (22 strains), h. influenzae (19 strains), s. aureus (6 strains) and chief nonpathogenic bacteria isolated from infants and children with influenza were corynebacterium spp. and alpha-streptococcus (3 strains each) and moraxella sp (2 strains). from infants and children without influenza (n = 34), 83 strains were obtained. the chief pathogenic bacteria isolated from infants and children without influenza were b. catarrhalis (23 strains), h. influenzae (22 strains), s. pneumoniae (18 strains), s. aureus (7 strains) and chief nonpathogenic bacteria isolated from infants and children without influenza were corynebacterium spp. and moraxella sp (5 strains each), alpha-streptococcus  (2 strains) and neisseria sp (1 strain). there was no significant difference in nasopharyngeal flora between infants and children with influenza and infants and  children without influenza. in cases showing detection of multiple bacterial strains, common combinations were one or more of b. catarrhalis, s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, s. aureus and nonpathogenic or weakly pathogenic bacteria. there was also no significant difference in combinations of nasopharyngeal flora between infants and children with influenza and those without influenza. we emphasize that we must study whether a difference in nasopharyngeal flora between infants and children with influenza and infants and children without influenza develops with time. therefore, we must repeatedly obtain nasopharyngeal swabs from infants and children with influenza and infants and children without influenza.

TI  == [etiological profile of bacterial meningitis in a small hospital]
AB  == objective: to determine the etiologic profile of cases of meningitis treated at a small hospital in ribeirao preto, state of sao paulo, and to compare it to those  reported for other communities.methods: a retrospective study was conducted on 103 patients admitted from january 1992 to july 1996 with clinical and laboratory diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. the clinical criteria for diagnosis were based on patient history and physical signs and symptoms, and the laboratory criteria were based on cerebrospinal fluid examination (aspect, cytology, biochemistry, gram staining, culture and countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis) and blood culture.results: the etiologic agent was identified in 81.5% of cases: haemophilus influenzae type b in 32%, neisseria meningitides in 25.2%, streptococcus pneumoniae in 8.7%, staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis in 8.7%,  and others agents in 6.9%. conclusions: the study showed that the cases of bacterial meningitis treated at the santa lydia hospital of ribeirao preto are caused by the same agents detected in other places, with haemophilus influenzae type b being the predominant one. the study also suggests that when many people are involved in the collection of material for laboratory tests, recovery of the  agent may become difficult.

TI  == [overwhelming postsplenectomy infection].
AB  == background: splenectomy performed at any age and for any reason increases the risk for death due to overwhelming infection. aim: to evaluate definition, etiology, incidence, risk factors and prophylaxis of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection, as well as the methods related to splenic tissue preservation when total splenectomy is necessary. method: bibliographic review. results: the etiological agents more frequently found are streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenza and type b, and neisseria meningitidis. other bacteria like escherichia coli, streptococcus b-hemolytic, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas sp represent a significant risk as well. in addition, a great variety of agents including other enteric gram-negative microorganisms and non-bacteria pathogens can also be sporadically identified. the prophylaxis is based on three  main aspects: patient's education, immune prophylaxis and chemical prophylaxis. however these are not enough to prevent the higher risk of developing sepsis. when total splenectomy is unavoidable, heterotopic splenic autotransplantation seems to be the only alternative for splenic tissue preservation. according to clinical and experimental studies, the splenic autotransplanted tissue present a  similar structure to a normal spleen and preserve the splenic immune function. conclusions: the high risk of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection, reduced the indication for total splenectomy, in trauma and several diseases. prophylactic methods have been developed to minimize the effects of the sepsis. several researches have been done to determine the immunocompetence of autogenous splenic grafts in response to bacteria invasion.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacterial flora associated with chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses.
AB  == chronic maxillary sinusitis is a chronic inflammatory condition in which the role of microbial infection remains undefined. bacteria have been isolated from chronically inflamed sinuses; however, their role in the chronicity of inflammation is unknown. the objective of this study was to determine whether bacteria are present in clinical samples from chronic maxillary sinusitis and to  assess the diversity of the flora present. washes and/or tissue samples from endoscopic sinus surgery on 11 patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis were subjected to pcr amplification of bacterial 16s rdna using three universal primer pairs, followed by cloning and sequencing. the samples were also assessed for the presence of bacteria and fungi by conventional culture methods. viable bacteria and/or bacterial 16s rdna were detected from maxillary sinus samples of five of the 11 patients examined (45 %). three sinus samples were positive by both pcr and culture methods, one was positive only by pcr, and one only by culture. thirteen bacterial species were identified: abiotrophia defectiva, enterococcus avium, eubacterium sp., granulicatella elegans, neisseria sp., prevotella sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sp. fungi were not detected. in one  patient streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis, and in another patient pseudomonas aeruginosa, were detected from both the sinus and the oral cavity using species-specific pcr primers. these results suggest that both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria can be detected in nearly half of chronic maxillary sinusitis  cases.

TI  == employment of broad-range 16s rrna pcr to detect aetiological agents of infection from clinical specimens in patients with acute meningitis--rapid separation of 16s rrna pcr amplicons without the need for cloning.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to develop a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page) method for the rapid separation of 16s rrna pcr amplicons from aetiological agents of acute meningitis. methods and results: blood samples from  40 patients with suspected acute meningococcal meningitis were examined for the presence of causal agents, including neisseria meningitidis employing two methods: (i) broad-range 16s rrna pcr in conjunction with page and automated sequencing and (ii) species-specific pcr employing abi taqman technology for n. meningitidis. analysis of clinical specimens employing 16s rrna pcr yielded 33/40 (82.5%) positive for the presence of bacterial dna. species-specific pcr yielded  30/40 (75%) clinical specimens positive for n. meningitidis. prior to separation  by page, only 6/33 (18.2%) amplicons were able to be identified by sequence analysis, the remaining amplicons (n=27) did not yield an identification due to the presence of mixed 16s rrna pcr amplicons. following separation, amplicons were re-amplified and sequenced, yielding 24/27 (88.9%) positive for n. meningitidis and three specimens positive for acinetobacter sp., staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. one specimen was positive for both n. meningitidis and streptococcus spp. and another specimen was positive for n. meningitidis and pseudomonas sp., by broad-range pcr. seven clinical specimens were negative for n. meningitidis and other eubacteria using both detection techniques. conclusions: clinical specimens including blood and cerebrospinal fluid from patients with suspected acute bacterial meningitis, may become contaminated with commensal skin flora, resulting in difficulties in downstream sequencing of pathogen plus contaminant dna. this study allows for the rapid separation of amplified pathogen from contaminant dna. significance and impact of study: this study demonstrated the usefulness of the rapid separation of multiple 16s rrna pcr amplicons using a combination of page and automated sequencing, without the need of cloning. adoption of this technique is therefore proposed when trying to rapidly identify pathogens in clinical specimens employing broad-range 16s rrna pcr.

TI  == 16s rdna-based identification of bacteria from conjunctival swabs by pcr and dgge fingerprinting.
AB  == purpose: establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. methods: from 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and dna was extracted. fragments of 200 bp, spanning the v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rdna, were amplified by polymerase  chain reaction (pcr) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). for phylogenetic identification, dgge bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16s rdna clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened  by dgge. sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the embl database. furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from  conventional cultivation. results: 16s rdna could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. the following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: staphylococcus (n = 8),  corynebacterium (n = 7), propionibacterium (n = 7), streptococcus (n = 6), bacillus (n = 2), acinetobacter (n = 3), pseudomonas (n = 3), proteus (n = 1), and brevundimonas (n = 1). four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. they had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of pantoea and enterobacter (n = 1), kingella and neisseria (n = 1), serratia and aranicola (n = 1), and leuconostoc and weissella (n = 2), respectively. culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), corynebacteria (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), streptococcus sp. (n = 1), proteus sp. (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). in total, 45% of  the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were pcr positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. no sample positive by culture gave negative results by pcr. conclusions: 16s rdna sequence analyses and dgge fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.

TI  == microbiology of the middle meatus: a comparison between normal adults and children.
AB  == middle meatal samples were obtained from 52 carefully selected healthy adults. in 75 per cent of the test subjects bacterial organisms were cultured. however, growth was often poor and the predominant species suggest a commensal flora: coagulase-negative staphylococci were retrieved from 35 per cent, corynebacterium sp. from 23 per cent and staphyloccus aureus from eight per cent of the adults. these data are very different from those previously obtained among children where--even in the absence of obvious ent pathology--the most frequently cultured organisms were typical sinusitis pathogens: haemophilus influenzae present in 40  per cent, moraxella catarrhalis in 34 per cent and streptococcus pneumoniae in 50 per cent of children. furthermore, streptococcus viridans and neisseria sp., both organisms that might be able to inhibit colonization by some of the pathogens and found commonly among children, are virtually absent in healthy adults.

TI  == gram staining with an automatic machine.
AB  == this study was undertaken to develop a new gram-staining machine controlled by a  micro-controller and to investigate the quality of slides that were stained in the machine. the machine was designed and produced by the authors. it uses standard 220 v ac. staining, washing, and drying periods are controlled by a timer built in the micro-controller. a software was made that contains a certain  algorithm and time intervals for the staining mode. one-hundred and forty smears  were prepared from escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, neisseria sp., blood  culture, trypticase soy broth, direct pus and sputum smears for comparison studies. half of the slides in each group were stained with the machine, the other half by hand and then examined by four different microbiologists. machine-stained slides had a higher clarity and less debris than the hand-stained slides (p < 0.05). in hand-stained slides, some gram-positive organisms showed poor gram-positive staining features (p < 0.05). in conclusion, we suggest that gram staining with the automatic machine increases the staining quality and helps to decrease the work load in a busy diagnostic laboratory.

AB  == the leucyl/phenylalanyl-trna-protein transferase (l/f-transferase) from escherichia coli catalyzes a peptidyltransferase reaction that results in the n-terminal aminoacylation of acceptor proteins using leu-, phe-, and met-trnas as amino acid donors. we demonstrated that l/f-transferase homologs are widely distributed throughout the eubacteria, supporting our proposal that the enzyme family is ancient and catalyzes early peptide bond synthesis. however, here we present data suggesting that the l/f-transferase is not a homolog of the peptidyltransferase enzymes involved in cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis in gram-positive species, such as staphylococcus aureus. a sequence comparison of the known l/f-transferase homologs began to identify the essential residues required to catalyze a peptidyltransferase reaction and revealed that <20% of the residues were invariant within the l/f-transferase family. despite this sequence  variation, substrate specificity was broadly conserved, and l/f-transferase homologs from providencia stuartii, vibrio cholerae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. all complemented an e. coli aat mutant (lacking l/f-transferase activity) for the degradation of n-end rule substrates.  in vitro comparison of the most divergent l/f-transferase homologs, from e. coli  and the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp., revealed near-complete conservation of  both substrate specificity and secondary structure. finally, we demonstrated that variants of the e. coli l/f-transferase, lacking either 33 or 78 n-terminal residues, retained measurable peptidyltransferase activity and wild type substrate specificity. overall, our results identified an essential core of an l/f-transferase and revealed that a peptidyltransferase catalyst may be constructed from approximately 120 amino acids.

TI  == microbiologic, radiographic, and anatomic study of the nasolacrimal duct apparatus in the rabbit (oryctolagus cuniculus).
AB  == this study was motivated by the sporadic observation of epiphora in two male rabbits. the epiphora was unilateral and not associated with conjunctivitis or pasteurella infection. to characterize the cause of epiphora, we studied 15 specific-pathogen-free new zealand white rabbits. this study group was composed of the two affected males, four unaffected males, and nine unaffected females. clinical evaluation consisted of bacterial culture of conjunctival specimens, examination of conjunctival scrapings for chlamydial inclusions, culture and cytologic examination of specimens from the nasolacrimal duct, plain and contrast radiography, latex casting, histologic examination, and the schirmer tear test. important differences found in the rabbits with epiphora included an opalescent,  gritty, nasolacrimal duct flush fluid and marked unilateral dilatation of the duct proximal to a dorsal flexure at the caudal limit of the incisor tooth root.  the flush solution from one affected rabbit cleared with ether, suggesting the presence of triglycerides or cholesterol. the organisms most commonly isolated from the conjunctiva were moraxella sp., oligella urethralis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus sp., and streptococcus viridans. the organisms most commonly isolated from the nasolacrimal duct flush fluid were moraxella sp., s. viridans, and neisseria sp. culture of the nasolacrimal duct flush fluid yielded microorganisms more consistently than did culture of the conjunctival specimens. all microorganisms isolated from affected rabbits also were isolated from unaffected rabbits. there was no apparent contribution of microorganisms to the development of epiphora, and schirmer tear test results for affected animals were within the range seen in unaffected animals. occlusion of the nasolacrimal duct was presumed to be attributable to fat droplets. this study augments the existing literature and represents the first report of anomalous nasolacrimal duct anatomic features in the rabbit.

TI  == quantitative bacteriology of tonsils removed from children with tonsillitis hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis with and without hypertrophy.
AB  == the aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species and their numbers were studied in tonsillar specimens from children who had undergone elective tonsillectomy: 6 patients with recurrent tonsillitis (rt), 9 with recurrent tonsillitis with hypertrophy (rth), and 8 with obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy (oth). mixed flora were present in all tonsils, yielding an average of 6.7 isolates (5.6 aerobic or facultative and 1.1 anaerobic bacteria). the highest recovery rate of  organisms per tonsil was in patients with oth (7.7 per tonsil), compared to 6.3 per tonsil in rt and 5.9 per tonsil in rth. the predominant aerobic and facultative organisms were haemophilus influenzae (22 isolates), neisseria sp (16), staphylococcus aureus (14), and eikenella corrodens (14), and the predominant anaerobic bacteria were fusobacterium sp (8), bacteroides sp (7), and prevotella melaninogenica (5). the number of bacteria per gram of tonsillar tissue varied between 10(4) and 10(8). a higher concentration of s aureus and h influenzae was found in hypertrophic tonsils (rth and oth) as compared to rt. these findings suggest the presence of an increased bacterial load and supports an etiologic role for h influenzae and s aureus in hypertrophic tonsils with and  without inflammation (rth and oth). further studies to elucidate the effect of selective antimicrobial therapy directed at these organisms may offer an alternative management of hypertrophic tonsils.

TI  == production and immunochemical characterization of neisseria meningitidis group b  antiserum for the diagnosis of purulent meningitis.
AB  == unlike neisseria meningitidis groups a, c, y and w135, the group b capsular polysaccharide has been shown to be chemically and immunologically identical to the capsular polysaccharide of escherichia coli k1. both components are sialic acid homopolymers and are poorly immunogenic. nevertheless, due to the high incidence of neisseria meningitidis group b meningitis in the population of the state of sao paulo, preparing antiserum to this serogroup for diagnostic purposes has become a matter of high priority. of the many immunization schemes proposed,  intravenous inoculation of whole bacteria previously inactivated with formaldehyde and simultaneous intradermal inoculation with a mixture of the bacterial polysaccharide fraction and whole bacteria in complete freund;s adjuvant have produced the best results. the antiserum was treated with immunoadsorbents prepared with aluminum chloride and protein and/or polysaccharide antigens from each of the following heterologous bacteria: haemophilus influenzae type b, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli other than k1, and staphylococcus aureus, in order to eliminate cross-reactivity. for quality control analysis, the antiserum was assessed by the immunodiffusion, counterimmunoelectrophoresis, dot-elisa, and immuno-blot techniques against homologous antigens. specificity was obtained after treating the antiserum with haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide immunosorbent.

TI  == low surface tension calcium hydroxide solution is an effective antiseptic.
AB  == the antimicrobial effects of a saturated calcium hydroxide solution, and in combination with 10% and 20% detergent, were evaluated on streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, neisseria  sp., diphtheroid, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus sp., staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis and candida albicans. the saturated calcium hydroxide solution was effective against only four of the 11 microorganisms studied over a 60-min exposure time. the calcium hydroxide solutions containing detergent killed all 11 test organisms over a 30-min exposure time. this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.01). no statistically significant difference in antimicrobial action was found between the 10% and 20% detergent calcium hydroxide solutions (p > 0.01). however, the low surface tension (46.5 x  10(-3) nm-1) and high ph (10.8) of the calcium hydroxide solution with 20% detergent establish it as the more effective solution.

TI  == bacteriology, drug stability and exchange of percutaneous delivery systems and antibacterial filters in long-term intrathecal infusion of opioid drugs and bupivacaine in "refractory" pain.
AB  == objective: to provide a basis for recommendations on the exchange of containers (syringes and cassettes) and antibacterial filters, and for choice of administration device in patients with "refractory" pain treated with long-term percutaneous intrathecal (it) infusions of opioid (morphine or buprenorphine) and bupivacaine mixtures. design: prospective, cohort, nonrandomized control trial-case series, with consecutive sample, no standard criterion, and cost-benefit analysis. setting: tertiary care center, institutional practice as well as hospitalized and ambulatory care. patients: eighty-nine (51 women and 38  men); 81 with malignant pain and 8 with benign "refractory" pain. interventions:  (a) the chemical stability of the drugs in the containers during 30 days. (b) the results of bacteriologic culture of the residual volumes of the analgesic mixtures from used and reused (1-16 times) syringes (n = 135) and cassettes (n =  258), and of 5 ml of sterile isotonic saline filtered through the used millipore  filters (n = 149). the bacteriologic samples from the 89 patients were taken after 1-40 (median = 7), 1-86 (median = 20), and 5-78 (median = 31) days of it treatment, respectively. main outcome measures: chemical stability: buprenorphine and bupivacaine concentrations-liquid chromatography; morphine concentrations--gas chromatography. bacteriologic cultures: standard laboratory procedures. the hypothesis (repeated use of the infusion systems and their exchange once a month does not significantly affect drug concentrations or increase the infection risk) was elaborated before data collection began. results: the bupivacaine-opioid mixtures were found to be chemically stable within 3-10% of the original doses up to 30 days. seventeen cultures (from five syringes, six cassettes, and six filters) in 13 patients (having no signs of meningeal infection) were found to be colonized with staphylococcus aureus (n = 4), coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 7), viridans streptococci (n = 3), neisseria sp (n = 4), corynebacterium sp (n = 4), enterobacter sp (n = 2), klebsiella sp (n = 3), gram-negative bacilli (n = 1), and yeasts (n = 2). the place of it treatment, its duration, and patient-related infection risk factors (age; malignancy; diabetes; presence of a colostomy, pyelostomy, or indwelling urinary catheter; and the presence and location of infection foci) were not related to the results of the cultures. however, 9 of the 17 positive cultures came from patients with skin ulcers, a notable incidence. the positive cultures had no connection with the cultured item, its in-use duration, the number of times of reuse, the analgesic drugs used, their concentrations or the presence of preservatives (sodium metabisulfite and sodium edetate), or the antiseptic agent  (70% ethanol or 0.5% chlorhexidine gluconate) used during bacteriologic sampling. the bacterial growth was sparse in 14 and massive in 3 of the 17 positive cultures. one item (filter) from one patient with meningitis was sterile. conclusions: in our population, exchange of the infusion systems when they are empty (within 1 month) and of the antibacterial filters once a month does not appear to affect the concentrations of, or increase the infection risk from, the  opioid-bupivacaine mixtures. the risk of bacterial contamination/colonization of  the syringes from syringe drivers does not seem to be higher than that of cassettes from external portable pumps.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == direct and indirect pathogenicity of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in mixed infections in children.
AB  == the recent emergence of numerous aerobic and anaerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacterial strains has been associated with an increase in the failure rate of penicillins in the therapy of infection caused by these organisms. these include  respiratory tract, skin of soft tissue, female genital tract, intra-abdominal, and other miscellaneous infections. the important aerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) include staphylococcus aureus, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus sp., neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and legionella sp. the anaerobic blpb are all bacteroidiaceae and include bacteroides fragilis group, b. melaninogenicus group, b. oralis, b. oris-buccae, and fusobacterium sp. laboratory, animal, and clinical studies that support the indirect pathogenicity  of these organisms and the distribution of these blpb in various infections are reviewed. blpb may not only have a direct pathogenic role in causing the infection, but also an indirect pathogenic role. the indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin  therapy, but also to protect penicillin-susceptible pathogens from that drug. these direct and indirect virulence characteristics of aerobic and anaerobic blpb require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against  all pathogens in mixed infections.

AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. imipenem proved highly active against enterobacteriaceae, with an mic less than or equal to 0.25  for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. the different groups of enterobacteriaceae exhibited  similar mode mics (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of serratia (0.25-0.5), p. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive proteus (2), and providencia (1). mics of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. imipenem also  exhibited satisfactory activity against p. aeruginosa (mode mic 1-2) and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).

TI  == [in vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. results of a multicenter  study].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. mics were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of enterobacteriaceae, with mode mics  varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for enterobacter. only a few resistant strains were  found, mainly among enterobacter and citrobacter. ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter (mode mics: 16 micrograms/ml). haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic less than 0.008-0.032). ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low mics (0.03-0.25). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes (clostridium: 0.06-2, bacteroides: 0.5-32). our data show that its particularly strong activity against proteus, haemophilus and neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other  third-generation cephalosporins.

TI  == effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
AB  == growth and acid production of glucose-grown gram-positive and gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02  to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. all gram-positive rods, i.e. actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis and corynebacterium diphtheriae, and gram-positive cocci, i.e. streptococcus spp, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. while gram-negative cocci, i.e. veillonella sp and neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. saccharin caused a significant reduction  in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.

TI  == [in vitro activity of ceftizoxime on hospital bacteria. results of a multicenter  study].
AB  == the susceptibility to ceftizoxime of all bacterial strains isolated from seven university-affiliated hospitals over one month was tested with disk-diffusion technique. additionally, the mic of 1937 strains selected at random was evaluated by the agar dilution method. the majority of enterobacteriaceae are inhibited at  a concentration of less than 1 microgram/ml with a mode mic varying from 0.008 to 0.12 among the various groups. a few enterobacter and citrobacter strains are resistant. little activity was demonstrated by ceftizoxime on pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic 32 and 8 micrograms/ml respectively).  haemophilus sp. (mic 0.01-0.03) and neisseria (mic less than 0,008-0,016) are very susceptible to the drug. the mic of methicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococcus aureus varies from 1 to 4 micrograms/ml ; enterococci are less susceptible, whereas other streptococci and pneumococci have low mics (less than  0.008-0.025). the susceptibility of anaerobic pathogens varies widely between species, and within species ; mic ranges from 0.008 to 32 micrograms/ml for clostridium sp. and 0.25 to 128 micrograms/ml for bacteroides sp.

TI  == in vitro activity of enoxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid, compared with those of norfloxacin, new beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  == enoxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. its activity against 740 bacterial isolates was determined. it inhibited 90% escherichia coli, klebsiella  sp., aeromonas sp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus mirabilis, and morganella morganii at less than or equal to 0.8 micrograms/ml. the majority of pseudomonas aeruginosa was inhibited by less than or equal to 3.1 micrograms/ml.  haemophilus spp. and neisseria spp. were inhibited by less than 0.1 micrograms/ml. although most staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml, some streptococcal species had minimal inhibitory concentrations of 6.3 to 12.5 micrograms/ml and bacteroides sp. had minimal inhibitory concentrations greater than or equal to 25 micrograms/ml. activity of enoxacin and norfloxacin was similar. enoxacin inhibited organisms resistant to cefotaxime, moxalactam, gentamicin, and piperacillin. enoxacin was less active in urine at an acid ph than in broth, but serum did not decrease minimal inhibitory  concentrations or minimal bactericidal concentrations. there was no major difference between minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations. resistance frequency development was less than 10(-9) for most bacterial species.

TI  == isolations of aerobic bacteria from wild desert bighorn sheep (ovis canadensis nelsoni and o. c. mexicana) in arizona.
AB  == nasal, pharyngeal, cervical and vaginal swab specimens were obtained from 74 desert bighorn sheep for the purpose of investigating the normal aerobic bacterial flora of wild sheep. a total of 281 isolates was obtained and identified by standard microbiologic tests. one hundred seven of these isolates were gram positive and included bacillus sp. (36%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8%), s. aureus (4%), corynebacterium sp. (diphtheroids, 4%), and streptococcus sp. (48%). gram negative isolates totaled 174 and included neisseria sp. (18%), citrobacter sp. (3%), enterobacter sp. (2%), escherichia coli (2%), proteus sp. (2%) and non-fermentative bacilli (nfb) (73%). of the nfb isolates, pseudomonas sp. (25%), acinetobacter sp. (18%), moraxella sp. (15%) were identified.

TI  == survival of bacteria after freezing of human semen in liquid nitrogen.
AB  == thirty-four semen samples from fertile men were subjected to bacteriologic evaluation before and after freezing to -196 degrees c using 10% glycerol as the  protective medium. cultures of the fresh portions from all ejaculates examined showed the presence of aerobic bacteria. staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium sp., alpha-streptococci, and nonhemolytic streptococci were found so commonly that they were considered commensals. enterococci, escherichia coli,  s. aureus, and beta-hemolytic streptococci group b, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. maltophilia, and p. fluorescens, were also recovered from a few semen samples of these fertile men. practically all bacteria isolated from the fresh ejaculate were also recovered from the portions frozen in liquid nitrogen.

TI  == [laboratory and clinical studies on cefoxitin in pediatric field (author's transl)].
AB  == studies on antimicrobial activity, absorption and excretion and clinical use of cefoxitin in pediatric field were performed. 1. mic of cefoxitin was compared with that of cefazolin and/or ampicillin for clinical isolates of staphylococcus  aureus (36 strains), escherichia coli (35 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (34 strains) and haemophilus influenzae (80 strains). mic of cefoxitin against s. aureus was approximately 1-2 tubes higher than that of cefazolin. many strains of e. coli and k. pneumoniae that showed high mic to cefazolin were sensitive to cefoxitin. it is presumed that the results are due to the strong resistance of cefoxitin to beta-lactamase degradation. mic of cefoxitin against h. influenzae was approximately 1-2 tubes lower than that of cefazolin, but approximately 4 tubes higher than that of ampicillin. 2. serum level and urinary recovery rate of cefoxitin after one shot i.v. injection of 25 mg/kg were examined. the serum mean levels were 33.8 microgram/ml at 1/2 hour, 7.0 microgram/ml at 1 hour and 2.9 microgram/ml at 2 hours after the injection, respectively, and the drug was not detected in serum at 4 and 6 hours after the injection. the mean half-life of serum level was 27.1 minutes. the mean urinary recovery rate within 6 hours after injection was 96.0% and most of the drug were excreted into urine within 2 hours  after the injection. 3. in order to evaluate clinical response, bacteriological response and side effects, cefoxitin was applied to 19 cases, i.e., 12 cases of either acute lobar pneumonia or acute bronchopneumonia, 2 cases of acute pyelitis, 1 case each of acute bronchitis, acute purulent tonsillitis, acute purulent arthritis, acute orbital phlegmon and acute buccal abscess. as for clinical response, the overall efficacy rate (the percentage of cases showed excellent and good efficacy) was 88.9%. as for bacteriological response, among the 13 strains which were determined or supposed to be causative organisms, i.e., 6 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of h. influenzae and 1 strain each of streptococcus pyogenes, alpha-streptococcus, enterococcus, e. coli and neisseria sp., all strains were disappeared except for enterococcus which was reduced by the treatment with cefoxitin. no side effect was observed in any case. abnormalities of laboratory findings were observed in 3 cases, i.e., 1 case each  of reduction of rbc and hb, elevation of got and gpt and elevation of gpt, but all of them returned to normal following completion of the dosage term.

TI  == microbial flora of the lower genital tract of women in labour in zaria, nigeria.
AB  == nine genera of microbes isolated from the lower genital tract of 187 women in labour in zaria have been identified. the work was undertaken to establish the nature of microorganisms in the lower genital tract of women in labour as a basis for further study. the isolates in order of prevalence were: candida albicans (20.9%), klebsiella sp (15.0%), escherichia coli (9.1%), streptococcus faecalis (6.4%), haemolytic streptococci (other than streptococcus pyogenes (2.7%), streptococcus viridans (2.1%), staphylococcus aureus (2.1%), aeromonas hydrophila (2.1%), proteus mirabilis (1.1%), peptostreptococcus putridus (1.1%), streptococcus pyogenes (0.5%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (0.5%). neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus sp, lactobacillus sp, and clostridium sp were sought but not found. chlamydia, viruses, and t-strains of mycoplasma and trichomonas were not sought. it appears from this study that the lower genital tract of most women in zaria at the time of labour is heavily colonised by pathogens. for this reason alone prolonged labour and trauma to the genital tract at the time of delivery should be avoided.

TI  == interference of neisseria gonorrhoeae growth by aerobic bacterial representatives of the urogenital flora.
AB  == aerobic bacterial isolates obtained from endocervical, vaginal and urethral swabbings were tested for interference of neisseria gonorrhoeae growth on solid medium. simultaneous antagonism was studied using the lawn spotting method, and delayed antagonism by the basal spot/lawn method. from 58 swabbings we recuperated a total of 181 isolates, 71 of those were found interfering with at least one out of four gonococcal strains (g-1, g-2, g-3 and g-4). similar percentages of interfering isolates were obtained from each of the isolation sites. the identification of the interfering isolates has revealed that similar numbers of coagulase negative staphylococci and identical numbers of group d streptococci were found for each of those sites. the majority of the interfering  isolates and also of the inhibitory coagulase negative staphylococci showed only  simultaneous antagonism. to complete the interference spectrum, we have tested all the active urogenital isolates against four other gonococcal strains (g-7, g-9, g-10 and g-11). this spectrum showed clearly that interference is not an all or none phenomenon. while the gonococcal interference spectrum of most of the gram positive cocci and the acinetobacter sp. strains is broad, that of all the other isolates is relatively narrow. gonococcal strains g-7 and g-9 were the most susceptible to inhibition by the interfering urogenital isolates while strain g-3 was the most resistant one.

TI  == biological activity of an antibiotic produced by myxococcus coralloides.
AB  == a strain of myxococcus coralloides was isolated which produced an antibiotic active against gram-positive bacteria and also against neisseria sp at high levels of antibiotic. the antibiotic was bactericidal on sensitive growing bacteria. it was inactive on non-growing cells and also on cells whose growth has been stopped by addition of chloramphenicol. strains of s. aureus resistant to several antibiotics, including penicillin and ampicillin, were also sensitive to  this antibiotic.

TI  == aerobic bacterial flora of oral and nasal fluids of canines with reference to bacteria associated with bites.
AB  == oral and nasal fluids of 50 dogs were examined to determine the prevalence of aerobic bacteria frequently associated with animal bite wounds. the most frequently isolated microorganisms included: iij, ef-4, pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, group d streptococci, corynebacterium sp., enterobacteria, neisseria sp., moraxella sp., and bacillus sp. other species and genera were infrequently recovered and may represent transient flora. the high incidence of iij, ef-4, p. multocida, and s. aureus, all known human pathogens, suggests that they should be considered as probably contaminants in bite wounds.
