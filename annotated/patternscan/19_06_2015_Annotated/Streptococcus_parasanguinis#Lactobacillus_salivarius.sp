TI  == immunomodulatory properties of streptococcus and veillonella isolates from the human small intestine microbiota.
AB  == the human small intestine is a key site for interactions between the intestinal microbiota and the mucosal immune system. here we investigated the immunomodulatory properties of representative species of commonly dominant small-intestinal microbial communities, including six streptococcal strains (four streptococcus salivarius, one s. equinus, one s. parasanguinis) one veillonella parvula strain, one enterococcus gallinarum strain, and lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1 as a bench mark strain on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. the different streptococci induced varying levels of the cytokines il-8, tnf-alpha, and il-12p70, while the v. parvula strain showed a strong capacity to induce il-6. e. gallinarum strain was a potent inducer of cytokines and tlr2/6 signalling. as streptococcus and veillonella can potentially interact metabolically and frequently co-occur in ecosystems, immunomodulation by pair-wise combinations of strains were also tested for their combined immunomodulatory properties. strain combinations induced cytokine responses in dendritic cells that differed from what might be expected on the basis of the results obtained with the individual strains. a combination of (some) streptococci with veillonella appeared to negate il-12p70 production, while augmenting il-8, il-6, il-10, and tnf-alpha responses. this suggests that immunomodulation data obtained in vitro with individual strains are unlikely to adequately represent immune responses to mixtures of gut microbiota communities in vivo. nevertheless, analysing the immune responses of strains representing the dominant species in the intestine may help to identify immunomodulatory mechanisms that influence immune homeostasis.

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacterial species associated with childhood caries.
AB  == although substantial epidemiologic evidence links streptococcus mutans to caries, the pathobiology of caries may involve more complex communities of bacterial species. molecular methods for bacterial identification and enumeration now make  it possible to more precisely study the microbiota associated with dental caries. the purpose of this study was to compare the bacteria found in early childhood caries (ecc) to those found in caries-free children by using molecular identification methods. cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16s ribosomal dnas from a healthy subject and a subject with ecc were used for identification of novel species or uncultivated phylotypes and species not previously associated with dental caries. ten novel phylotypes were identified. a number of species or  phylotypes that may play a role in health or disease were identified and warrant  further investigation. in addition, quantitative measurements for 23 previously known bacterial species or species groups were obtained by a reverse capture checkerboard assay for 30 subjects with caries and 30 healthy controls. significant differences were observed for nine species: s. sanguinis was associated with health and, in order of decreasing cell numbers, actinomyces gerencseriae, bifidobacterium, s. mutans, veillonella, s. salivarius, s. constellatus, s. parasanguinis, and lactobacillus fermentum were associated with  caries. these data suggest that a. gerencseriae and other actinomyces species may play an important role in caries initiation and that a novel bifidobacterium may  be a major pathogen in deep caries. further investigation could lead to the identification of targets for biological interventions in the caries process and  thereby contribute to improved prevention of and treatment for this significant public health problem.
