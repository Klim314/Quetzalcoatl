TI  == modulation of connexin signaling by bacterial pathogens and their toxins.
AB  == inherent to their pivotal tasks in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, gap junctions, connexin hemichannels, and pannexin hemichannels are frequently involved in the dysregulation of this critical balance. the present paper specifically focuses on their roles in bacterial infection and disease. in particular, the reported biological outcome of clinically important bacteria including escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, yersinia enterocolitica, helicobacter pylori, bordetella pertussis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter rodentium, clostridium species, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus and their toxic products on connexin- and pannexin-related signaling in host cells is reviewed. particular attention is paid to the underlying molecular mechanisms of these effects as well as to the actual biological relevance of these findings.

TI  == differential roles of interleukin-17a and -17f in host defense against mucoepithelial bacterial infection and allergic responses.
AB  == interleukin-17a (il-17a) is a cytokine produced by t helper 17 (th17) cells and plays important roles in the development of inflammatory diseases. although il-17f is highly homologous to il-17a and binds the same receptor, the functional roles of this molecule remain largely unknown. here, we demonstrated with il17a(-/-), il17f(-/-), and il17a(-/-)il17f(-/-) mice that il-17f played only marginal roles, if at all, in the development of delayed-type and contact hypersensitivities, autoimmune encephalomyelitis, collagen-induced arthritis, and arthritis in il1rn(-/-) mice. in contrast, both il-17f and il-17a were involved in host defense against mucoepithelial infection by staphylococcus aureus and citrobacter rodentium. il-17a was produced mainly in t cells, whereas il-17f was  produced in t cells, innate immune cells, and epithelial cells. although only il-17a efficiently induced cytokines in macrophages, both cytokines activated epithelial innate immune responses. these observations indicate that il-17a and il-17f have overlapping yet distinct roles in host immune and defense mechanisms.
