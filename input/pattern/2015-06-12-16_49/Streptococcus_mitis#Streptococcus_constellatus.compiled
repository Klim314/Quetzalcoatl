TI  - Population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (VGS) isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in the community.
AB  - A study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (VGS) isolated the upper respiratory tract of adult and paediatric patients within the community. VGS are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (AR). Laboratory examination of the colonising VGS species may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the AR reservoir in this population. Freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on Mitis-Salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of VGS. Sequence analyses of the rpnB and 16-23S rRNA ITS genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of VGS and included S. anginosus, S. australis, S. constellatus, S. infantis, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis and S. vestibularis. The most frequent VGS organisms isolated was S. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by S. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), S. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), S. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), S. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), S. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), S. australis (3/363; 0.8%), S. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), S. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and S. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). All patients examined carried at least one VGS organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of VGS species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different VGS species, respectively. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. Overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime, with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). Antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. S. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all VGS species examined (S. vestibularis v S. salivarius p=0.011), followed by S. anginosis. S. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible VGS species examined. Overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. However, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae. In conclusion, these data indicate that VGS colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible S. salivarius.
TI  - The predominant bacteria isolated from radicular cysts.
AB  - PURPOSE: To detect predominant bacteria associated with radicular cysts and discuss in light of the literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical materials were obtained from 35 radicular cysts by aspiration. Cultures were made from clinical materials by modern laboratory techniques, they underwent microbiologic analysis. RESULTS: The following are microorganisms isolated from cultures: Streptococcus milleri Group (SMG) (23.8%) [Streptococcus constellatus (19.1%) and Streptococcus anginosus (4.7%)], Streptococcus sanguis (14.3%), Streptococcus mitis (4.7%), Streptococcus cremoris (4.7%), Peptostreptococcus pevotii (4.7%), Prevotella buccae (4.7%), Prevotella intermedia (4.7%), Actinomyces meyeri (4.7%), Actinomyces viscosus (4.7%), Propionibacterium propionicum (4.7%), Bacteroides capillosus (4.7%), Staphylococcus hominis (4.7%), Rothia denticariosa (4.7%), Gemella haemolysans (4.7%), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (4.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study demonstrated that radicular cysts show a great variety of anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial flora. It was observed that all isolated microorganisms were the types commonly found in oral flora. Although no specific microorganism was found, Streptococcus spp. bacteria (47.5%) - especially SMG (23.8%) - were predominantly found in the microorganisms isolated. Furthermore, radicular cysts might be polymicrobial originated. Although radicular cyst is an inflammatory cyst, some radicular cyst fluids might be sterile.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota in adult Down syndrome periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The subgingival microbiota in Down syndrome and non-Down syndrome adults receiving periodic dental care was examined for 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization and the results were related to clinical periodontal attachment loss. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 44 Down syndrome, 66 non-Down syndrome mentally retarded and 83 mentally normal adults were clinically evaluated. This involved, for each subject, the removal of subgingival specimens from three interproximal sites on different teeth; all subgingival samples per subject were then pooled and assessed for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial species using species-specific whole-genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Significant group differences in species proportions averaged across subjects were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and associations between subgingival species and mean subject attachment loss within Down syndrome and non-Down syndrome subject groups were quantified using Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Down syndrome subjects exhibited greater attachment loss than non-Down syndrome subjects (p=0.05). Most microbial species were present in Down syndrome subjects at levels similar to non-Down syndrome subjects, except for higher proportions of Selenomonas noxia, Propionibacterium acnes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus oralis in Down syndrome subjects compared with non-Down syndrome study subjects, higher proportions of Treponema socranskii in Down syndrome subjects compared with non-Down syndrome mentally retarded subjects, and higher proportions of Streptococcus constellatus in Down syndrome subjects compared with mentally normal subjects. Down syndrome adults classified with periodontitis revealed higher subgingival levels of T. socranskii than Down syndrome subjects with no periodontitis (p=0.02). Higher subgingival proportions of S. constellatus, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, S. noxia and Prevotella nigrescens showed significant positive correlations (r=0.35-0.42) and higher proportions of Actinomyces naeslundii II and Actinomyces odontolyticus showed negative correlations (r=-0.36 to -0.40), with increasing mean subject attachment loss in Down syndrome adults. CONCLUSION: Individuals with Down syndrome show higher levels of some subgingival bacterial species and specific associations between certain subgingival bacterial species and loss of periodontal attachment. These findings are consistent with the notion that certain subgingival bacteria may contribute to the increased level of periodontal disease seen in Down syndrome individuals and raise the question as to the reason for increased colonization in Down syndrome.
TI  - Effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation between oral streptococci and Actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The co-aggregation of oral bacteria leads to their clearance from the oral cavity. Poor oral hygiene and high saliva viscosity are common amongst the elderly; thus, they frequently suffer from pneumonia caused by the aspiration of oral microorganisms. OBJECTIVES: To examine the direct effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen oral streptococcal and a single actinomyces strain were used. Co-aggregation was assessed by a visual assay in phosphate buffer and a spectrophotometric assay in the same buffer containing 0-60% glycerol or whole saliva. RESULTS: Nine oral streptococci co-aggregated with Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC12104 in the visual assay and were subsequently used for the spectrophotometric analysis. All tested strains displayed a decrease in co-aggregation with increasing amounts of glycerol in the buffer. The co-aggregation of Streptococcus oralis with A. naeslundii recovered to baseline level following the removal of glycerol. The per cent co-aggregation of S. oralis with A. naeslundii was significantly correlated with the viscosity in unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva samples (correlation coefficients: -0.52 and -0.48, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that saliva viscosity affects the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces and that bacterial co-aggregation decreases with increasing saliva viscosity.
TI  - Erythromycin and penicillin resistance mechanisms among viridans group streptococci isolated from blood cultures of adult patients with underlying diseases.
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the species distribution, antimicrobial susceptibility and erythromycin-penicillin resistance mechanisms of viridans streptococci (VGS) isolates from blood cultures of adult patients with underlying diseases. Fifty VGS blood culture isolates were screened for their antibiotic susceptibilities against penicillin G, erythromycin and tetracycline by E-test. Clindamycin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, levofloxacin, linezolid and vancomycin susceptibility were performed by broth microdilution method. Erythromycin and penicillin resistance genotypes, ermB and mefA/E, pbp1a, pbp2b and pbp2x are amplified using PCR method. The clinical isolates included Streptococcus mitis (n. 19), S.oralis (n. 13), S.sanguinis, S.parasanguinis (n. 6, each), S.salivarius, S.vestibularis (n. 2, each), S.constellatus, S.sobrinus (n. 1, each). The percentage resistance against erythromycin and penicillin was 36% and 30%, respectively. The genotypic carriage rate of erythromycin resistance genes were: 56% ermB, 28% mefE, 8% ermB+mefE. Penicillin-resistant isolates carried pbp2b (33.3%) and pbp2x (20%) genes. Twenty-four VGS isolates were recovered from patients with cancer. S.mitis and S.oralis predominated among patients with cancer who had erythromycin and penicillin resistance isolates. The importance of classical antimicrobial agents like penicillin and erythromycin warrants the continuous surveillance of invasive VGS isolates and can guide better treatment options especially in patients with underlying diseases.
TI  - Partial recN gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - Partial sequences of the recN gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. The partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. The mean DNA sequence similarity of recN gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be lower than those of the 16S rRNA gene (94.1 %), rpoB (84.6 %), sodA (74.8 %), groEL (78.1 %) and gyrB (73.2 %). Phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: Streptococcus salivarius, S. equinus, S. hyovaginalis/S. pluranimalium/S. thoraltensis, S. pyogenes, S. mutans and S. suis. The 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: Streptococcus sanguinis/S. cristatus/S. sinensis, S. anginosus/S. intermedius/S. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and S. mitis/S. infantis/S. peroris/S. oralis/S. oligofermentans/S. pneumoniae/S. pseudopneumoniae. The partial recN gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. This observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groEL, gyrB, rpoB and sodA). A high percentage of similarity was found between S. intermedius and S. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recN gene. To study the genetic diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recN, groEL, sodA, gyrB and rpoB sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. The results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.
TI  - Oral streptococcal strains isolated from odontogenic infections and their susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  - The aim of this study was to identify at species level and to investigate the antibiotic susceptibility of oral streptococcal strains isolated from 100 pus samples collected from Romanian patients with different odontogenic infections. The isolates were identified at species level using the Rapid ID 32 STREP system and their susceptibility was testing by the Etest, against: penicillin G, ampicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline. For the investigation of erythromycin resistance phenotype the disk diffusion test was used. The isolates belonged to several species, with Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus oralis predominating. Reduced susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics was found only among the isolates belonging to S. mitis and S. sanguinis groups. Resistance to erythromycin was detected among all species, except for: S. constellatus, S. intermedius and S. gordonii, and the M phenotype was established, while resistance to tetracycline was detected within all species but S. gordonii. In contrast, clindamycin was fully active. As most odontogenic infections are mixed infections, often involving strictly anaerobic bacteria, which are frequently beta-lactamase producers, the association of a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor, like Amoxiclav, is recommended when the antimicrobial treatment is necessary.
TI  - Tigecycline (GAR-936) activity against Streptococcus gallolyticus (bovis) and viridans group streptococci.
AB  - Viridans group streptococci including Streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly S. bovis) represent serious invasive pathogens often associated with endocarditis or sepsis among immunocompromised or cancer patients. Tigecycline (GAR-936), the first clinically studied glycylcycline, has a potent gram-positive activity with a potential treatment option for these streptococcal infections. The studied collection (848 strains) included 100 isolates each of Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, and fewer strains of S. gallolyticus (98 strains) and Streptococcus mutans (50 strains). These strains were isolated from patients on 3 continents in the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program and tested for susceptibility and interpreted by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute broth microdilution methods and criteria (< or = 0.25 microg/mL for tigecycline per US Food and Drug Administration). Penicillin susceptibility rates for the entire collection varied from 61% (S. sanguis) to 98% (S. constellatus), and macrolide susceptibility was also compromised (49-88%; average, 69%). Tigecycline was active against all isolates tested, in contrast to tetracycline resistance rates of 8-66%, and highest for S. gallolyticus. In conclusion tigecycline was quite active against bacteremic isolates of viridans group streptococci species and S. gallolyticus with an overall MIC90 at < or = 0.06 microg/mL; the highest MIC was only 0.25 microg/mL.
TI  - Identification of 43 Streptococcus species by pyrosequencing analysis of the rnpB gene.
AB  - Pyrosequencing technology was evaluated for identification of species within the  Streptococcus genus. Two variable regions in the rnpB gene, which encodes the RNA subunit of endonuclease P, were sequenced in two reactions. Of 43 species, all could be identified to the species level except strains of the species pairs Streptococcus anginosus/S. constellatus and S. infantis/S. peroris. A total of 113 blood culture isolates were identified by pyrosequencing analysis of partial rnpB sequences. All but eight isolates could be unambiguously assigned to a specific species when the first 30 nucleotides of the two regions were compared to an rnpB database comprising 107 streptococcal strains. Principal coordinate analysis of sequence variation of strains from viridans group streptococci resulted in species-specific clusters for the mitis and the salivarius groups but not for the anginosus group. The identification capacity of pyrosequencing was compared to the biochemical test systems VITEK 2 and Rapid ID 32 Strep. The concordance between pyrosequencing and VITEK 2 was 75%, and for Rapid ID 32 Strep the corresponding figure was 77%. Isolates with discrepant identifications in the three methods were subjected to entire rnpB DNA sequence analysis that confirmed the identifications by pyrosequencing. In conclusion, pyrosequencing analysis of the rnpB gene can reliably identify Streptococcus species with high resolution.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by an oligonucleotide array.
AB  - Viridans streptococci (VS) are common etiologic agents of subacute infective endocarditis and are capable of causing a variety of pyogenic infections. Many species of VS are difficult to differentiate by phenotypic traits. An oligonucleotide array based on 16S-23S rRNA gene intergenic spacer (ITS) sequences was developed to identify 11 clinically relevant VS. These 11 species were Streptococcus anginosus, S. constellatus, S. gordonii, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis, and S. uberis. The method consisted of PCR amplification of the ITS regions by using a pair of universal primers, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled PCR products to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides immobilized on a nylon membrane. After 120 strains of the 11 species of VG and 91 strains of other bacteria were tested, the sensitivity and specificity of the oligonucleotide array were found to be 100% (120 of 120 strains) and 95.6% (87 of 91 strains), respectively. S. pneumoniae cross-hybridized to the probes used for the identification of S. mitis, and simple biochemical tests such as optochin susceptibility or bile solubility should be used to differentiate S. pneumoniae from S. mitis. In conclusion, identification of species of VS by use of the present oligonucleotide array is accurate and could be used as an alternative reliable method for species identification of strains of VS.
TI  - Alkali-resistant bacteria in root canal systems.
AB  - The aim of this study was to isolate and identify alkali-resistant bacteria from  the dentin of infected root canals. Bacteria from homogenized dentin powder made up from infected root canal walls from human teeth were cultured on buffer-enriched Brain Heart Infusion agar supplemented with 4% sheep blood (BHI-blood agar), adjusted to pH 7.0, 9.0 or 10.0. Incubation took place for 7 days at 37 degrees C in an anaerobic glove box. Bacterial strains selected according to colony and morphology were subcultured in buffer-enriched BHI broth adjusted to pH 9.0, 10.0 or 11.0 to confirm their growth as alkali-resistant bacteria. Polymerase chain reaction amplification using specific primer sets and 16S rDNA sequence analysis was performed for identification of alkali-resistant isolates. In the present study, 37 teeth extracted from 37 patients were used for preparation of the dentin powder samples. Bacteria were detected in 25 samples when standard BHI-blood agars (pH 7.0) were used. Of these, 29 strains from 15 samples were alkali resistant, 25 strains growing at pH 9.0 and 4 at pH 10.0. The alkali-resistant strains included Enterococcus faecium (10 strains) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 strains), Enterobacter cancerogenus (1 strains), Fusobacterium nucleatum (1 strains), Klebsiella ornithinolytica (2 strains), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (2 strains), Streptococcus anginosus (2 strains), Streptococcus constellatus (3 strains), and Streptococcus mitis (2 strains). Three strains were also identified as bacteria of genus Firmicutes or Staphylococcus at the genus level. The present study showed that many bacterial species in infected root canal dentin were alkali-resistant at pH 9.0 and/or pH 10.0, and belonged mainly to the genus Enterococcus.
TI  - Molecular analysis of age-related changes of Streptococcus anginosus group and Streptococcus mitis in saliva.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to survey the prevalence of streptococcal species,  especially Streptococcus anginosus (which has been reported to be associated with cancer in the upper digestive tract), Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus intermedius in the saliva of different age groups. A sequence analysis of 16S rDNA was performed and DNA quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The S. anginosus level increased with age, whereas the levels of S. constellatus and S. intermedius did not change. Streptococcus mitis was the predominant species in the saliva of all the age groups but, unlike the S. anginosus, the proportion of S. mitis in the salivary bacteria decreased with age. The increase in S. anginosus with age should be carefully monitored because of its association with diseases, including cancer.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci by sequence analysis of the 16S-23S ribosomal DNA spacer region.
AB  - The feasibility of sequence analysis of the 16S-23S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) intergenic spacer (ITS) for the identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci (VS) was evaluated. The ITS regions of 29 reference strains (11 species) of VS were amplified by PCR and sequenced. These 11 species were Streptococcus anginosus, S. constellatus, S. gordonii, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis, and S. uberis. The ITS lengths (246 to 391 bp) and sequences were highly conserved among strains within a species. The intraspecies similarity scores for the ITS sequences ranged from 0.98 to 1.0, except for the score for S. gordonii strains. The interspecies similarity scores for the ITS sequences varied from 0.31 to 0.93. Phylogenetic analysis of the ITS regions revealed that evolution of the regions of some species of VS is not parallel to that of the 16S rRNA genes. One hundred six clinical isolates of VS were identified by the Rapid ID 32 STREP system (bioMerieux Vitek, Marcy l'Etoile, France) and by ITS sequencing, and the level of disagreement between the two methods was 18% (19 isolates). Most isolates producing discrepant results could be unambiguously assigned to a specific species by their ITS sequences. The accuracy of using ITS sequencing for identification of VS was verified by 16S rDNA sequencing for all strains except strains of S. oralis and S. mitis, which were difficult to differentiate by their 16S rDNA sequences. In conclusion, identification of species of VS by ITS sequencing is reliable and could be used as an alternative accurate method for identification of VS.
TI  - "Streptococcus milleri" endocarditis caused by Streptococcus anginosus.
AB  - Unlike other viridans streptococci, members of the "Streptococcus milleri group"  are often associated with abscess formation, but are only rare causes of infective endocarditis. Although it has been shown that almost all S. intermedius isolates and most S. constellatus isolates, but only 19% of S. anginosus isolates, were associated with abscess formation, no report has addressed the relative importance of the 3 species of the "S. milleri group" in infective endocarditis. During a 5-year period (April 1997 through March 2002), 6 cases of "S. milleri" endocarditis (out of 377 cases of infective endocarditis), that fulfil the Duke's criteria for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis, were encountered. All 6 "S. milleri" isolates were identified as S. anginosus by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing. Three patients had underlying chronic rheumatic heart disease and 1 was an IV drug abuser. Five had monomicrobial bacteremia, and 1 had polymicrobial (S. anginosus, S. mitis, Granulicatella adiacens, and Slackia exigua) bacteremia. Two patients died. None of the 6 isolates were identified by the Vitek system (GPI) or the API system (20 STREP) at >95% confidence. All 6 isolates were sensitive to penicillin G (MIC 0.008-0.064 microg/mL), cefalothin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. Accurate identification to the species level, by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, in cases of bacteremia caused by members of the "S. milleri group", would have direct implication on the underlying disease process, hence guiding diagnosis and treatment. Infective endocarditis should be actively looked for in cases of monomicrobial S. anginosus bacteremia, especially if the organism is recovered in multiple blood cultures.
TI  - The acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  - The intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. Plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. In addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to pH 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. The results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at pH 5.5 and 1% at pH 5.0, pH values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. At pH 5.0, members of the genus Streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. The other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus gordinii, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius and SStreptococcus sanguis. Analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.
TI  - Distribution of selected bacterial species on intraoral surfaces.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: To examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. METHODS: Microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". Saliva was taken by expectoration. Forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. Samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The percentage of total DNA probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. The significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the Quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. Cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. The proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and ANOVA. RESULTS: Microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects, with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. Proportions of Veillonella parvula and Prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while Streptococcus mitis and S. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. Cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. Cluster 1 comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while Cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. V. parvula, P. melaninogenica, Eikenella corrodens, Neisseria mucosa, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Fusobacterium periodonticum, F. nucleatum ss vincentii and Porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in Cluster 1 and S. mitis, S. oralis and S. noxia were significantly higher in Cluster 2. These findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. The microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the Actinomyces species. Species of different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus Streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. S. oralis, S. mitis and S. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. CONCLUSIONS: Proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. The microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. The microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.
TI  - Streptococci and Actinomyces induce antibodies which cross react with epithelial  antigens in periodontitis.
AB  - Perturbation of epithelial structure is a prominent but poorly understood feature of the immunopathological response to bacterial antigens which characterizes the destructive lesion of periodontitis. Western analysis of sera from 22 patients with periodontitis detected multiple antigens in extracts of epithelial cells whereas sera from 12 periodontally healthy subjects displayed only trace reaction with epithelial antigens. To investigate a possible relationship between the bacterial flora adjacent to diseased sites and the presence of antibodies reactive with epithelium, subgingival plaque samples were taken from deep periodontal pockets and cultured anaerobically. Gram positive bacteria containing antigens cross-reactive with epithelial cells were reproducibly isolated by probing membrane colony-lifts with affinity-isolated (epithelium-specific) antibodies and identified by 16S rDNA sequence homology as streptococci (S. mitis, S. constellatus and two S. intermedius strains) and Actinomyces (A. georgiae, and A. sp. oral clone). Conversely, when serum from patients with periodontitis was absorbed with the captured bacterial species the number of epithelial antigens recognized was specifically reduced. It was concluded that development of cross-reactive antibodies related to these organisms may contribute to perturbation of the epithelial attachment to the tooth and the progression of periodontitis. These autoreactive antibodies could also be a contributing factor in other diseases affecting epithelia.
TI  - groESL sequence determination, phylogenetic analysis, and species differentiation for viridans group streptococci.
AB  - The full-length sequences of the groESL genes (also known as cpn10/60) of Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus sanguis and the near full-length sequence of the groESL genes of Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus salivarius were determined. The lengths of the groES genes from the 10 species listed above ranged from 282 to 288 bp, and the full-length sequences of groEL determined for 4 species (S. anginosus, S. constellatus, S. gordonii, and S. sanguis) revealed that each was 1,623 bp. The intergenic region (spacer) between the groES and groEL genes varies in size (15 to 111 bp) and sequence between species. The variation of the groES sequences among the species tested was greater (62.1 to 95.1% nucleotide sequence identities) than that of the groEL sequences (77.2 to 95.2% nucleotide sequence identities). Phylogenetic analysis of the groES and groEL genes yielded evolutionary trees similar to the tree constructed by use of the 16S rRNA gene. The intraspecies variation of the spacer was minimal for clinical isolates of some species. The groESL sequence data provide an additional parameter for identification of viridans group streptococcal species.
TI  - Study of the intra- and interlaboratory reproducibility of partial single base C-sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and its applicability for the identification of members of the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - The use of Single Base C-Sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16S rRNA-gene (SBCS) combined with capillary electrophoresis was evaluated for the identification of reference strains of 30 different species within the genus Streptococcus. For SBCS, only dd-CTP's are used in the sequencing reactions instead of the four dideoxy bases and the primer is fluorescently labeled. The reproducibility, interlaboratory exchangeability and discriminative power of this method were studied by comparing the patterns obtained in three laboratories under highly standardized conditions. The interlaboratory reproducibility proved to be high, enabling the construction of a common database for the identification of strains belonging to the streptococcal species studied. Most of the examined species generated distinguishable profiles. SBCS did not differentiate between the closely related species S. constellatus and S. intermedius. Also S. thermophilus and S. vestibularis as well as S. mitis and S. pneumoniae showed highly resembling profiles. The previously reported heterogeneity within the species S. equinus was reflected by SBCS. For all other species, strains belonging to the same species generated indistinguishable patterns. In conclusion, Single Base C-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16S rRNA-gene could be a useful and widely applicable method for the identification of bacteria at the species level, with the added advantage of being more rapid and easier to automatize than full sequence determination.
TI  - Streptococcus sinensis sp. nov., a novel species isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis.
AB  - A bacterium was isolated from the blood culture of a patient with infective endocarditis. The cells were facultative anaerobic, nonsporulating, gram-positive cocci arranged in chains. The bacterium grows on sheep blood agar as alpha-hemolytic, gray colonies of 0.5 to 1 mm in diameter after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees C in ambient air. Growth also occurs in 10 or 40% bile and on bile esculin agar but not in 6% NaCl. No enhancement of growth is observed in 5% CO(2). It is nongroupable with Lancefield groups A, B, C, D, F, or G antisera and is resistant to optochin and bacitracin. The organism is aflagellated and is nonmotile at both 25 and 37 degrees C. It is Voges-Proskauer test positive. It produces leucine arylamidase and beta-glucosidase but not catalase, urease, lysine decarboxylase, or ornithine decarboxylase. It hydrolyzes esculin and arginine. It utilizes glucose, lactose, salicin, sucrose, pullulan, trehalose, cellobiose, hemicellulase, mannose, maltose, and starch. 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that there were 3.6, 3.7, 4.3, 4.7, and 5.9% differences between the 16S rRNA gene sequence of the bacterium and those of Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus anginosus, respectively. The G+C content of it (mean plus minus standard deviation) was 53.0% plus minus 2.9%. Based on phylogenetic affiliation, it belongs to the mitis or anginosus group of Streptococcus. For these reasons a new species, Streptococcus sinensis sp. nov., is proposed, for which HKU4 is the type strain. Further studies should be performed to ascertain the potential of this bacterium to become an emerging cause of infective endocarditis.
TI  - Efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (II). Effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (Crest Complete) or power (Braun 3D Plaque Remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. METHODS: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. At baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. After random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. Clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. Significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the Quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. Streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while Streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. Mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. Major reductions occurred in both groups for A. naeslundii, A. israelii/gerencseriae, Peptostreptococcus micros, Veillonella parvula, Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, S. mitis/oralis/sanguis and S. constellatus/intermedius. All taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. The reductions in prevalence were greater for A. naeslundii, S. constellatus/intermedius, V. parvula, A. israelii/gerencseriae, S. mitis/oralis/sanguis, P. micros, Streptococcus mutans and P. intermedia/nigrescens. Mean prevalence was decreased more for Porphyromonas gingivalis, Campylobacter rectus/showae, Treponema denticola and Bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. CONCLUSIONS: The major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the subgingival microbiota. Counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. This reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. Further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.
TI  - Streptococcus salivarius fimbriae are composed of a glycoprotein containing a repeated motif assembled into a filamentous nondissociable structure.
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius, a gram-positive bacterium found in the human oral cavity, expresses flexible peritrichous fimbriae. In this paper, we report purification and partial characterization of S. salivarius fimbriae. Fimbriae were extracted by shearing the cell surface of hyperfimbriated mutant A37 (a spontaneous mutant of S. salivarius ATCC 25975) with glass beads. Preliminary experiments showed that S. salivarius fimbriae did not dissociate when they were incubated at 100 degrees C in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. This characteristic was used to separate them from other cell surface components by successive gel filtration chromatography procedures. Fimbriae with molecular masses ranging from 20 x 10(6) to 40 x 10(6) Da were purified. Examination of purified fimbriae by electron microscopy revealed the presence of filamentous structures up to 1 microm long and 3 to 4 nm in diameter. Biochemical studies of purified fimbriae and an amino acid sequence analysis of a fimbrial internal peptide revealed that S. salivarius fimbriae were composed of a glycoprotein assembled into a filamentous structure resistant to dissociation. The internal amino acid sequence was composed of a repeated motif of two amino acids alternating with two modified residues: A/X/T-E-Q-M/phi, where X represents a modified amino acid residue and phi represents a blank cycle. Immunolocalization experiments also revealed that the fimbriae were associated with a wheat germ agglutinin-reactive carbohydrate. Immunolabeling experiments with antifimbria polyclonal antibodies showed that antigenically related fimbria-like structures were expressed in two other human oral streptococcal species, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus constellatus.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  - A diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. To investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. Forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. Streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), Streptococcus mitis (66-65%), Prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), Eikenella corrodens (51-52%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), Capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), Actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and Prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. Several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella loescheii, Campylobacter gracilis, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter concisus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. The bacterial species Streptococcus constellatus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, E. corrodens and Fusobacterium nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas Streptococcus intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were associated with bleeding.
TI  - Strain-related acid production by oral streptococci.
AB  - Acid production, in particular at low pH, is thought to be an important ecological determinant in dental caries. The aim of the present study was to determine the acid producing capability at different pH levels of 47 streptococcal strains, representing 9 species, isolated from human dental plaque. The bacteria were grown until mid log-phase under anaerobic conditions and acid production was measured in a pH-stat system at pH 7.0, 6.0, 5.5 and 5.0. At all pH values, the mean velocity of acid production (V(ap)) by Streptococcus mutans and S. sobrinus was significantly higher (p<0.01; ANOVA) than that of the other oral streptococci, including S. mitis, S. oralis, S. gordonii, S. sanguis, S. intermedius, S. anginosus, S. constellatus, and S. vestibularis. However, the V(ap) of some strains of S. mitis biovar 1 and S. oralis, particularly at pH values of 7.0 and 6.0, exceeded that of some strains of S. mutans. The V(ap) decreased with pH for all strains, but some strains of S. mitis biovar 1 and strains of the mutans streptococci maintained a relatively high rate of acid production. The results suggest that some strains of S. mitis biovar 1 and S. oralis may play an important role in caries development by modifying the environment in dental plaque to become favourable for the succession of aciduric species. The study furthermore emphasises the need for detailed species and biovar identification of oral streptococci and for recognition of the significant physiological differences that occur within single species.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  - Eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. The aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. Forty-one different microbial species were isolated. Gemella morbillorum and Peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while P. micros, Streptococcus intermedius, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella loeschei, P. melaninogenica and Selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. The bacterial species S. constellatus, G. morbillorum and P. magnus were isolated in greater numbers in incisors and P. micros, S. intermedius, Campylobacter concisus, Bacteroides egertheii, B. forsythus, P. oralis and S. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. Cluster I was predominated by S. constellatus, S. mitis, S. sanguis, G. morbillorum, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; cluster II was predominated by S. sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea and P. intermedia; cluster III was predominated by S. mitis, C. ochracea, F. nucleatum, P. loeschei, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; and finally cluster IV was predominated by S. sanguis, C. gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Campylobacter gracilis, F. nucleatum and P. intermedia. The bacterial species S. constellatus, P. micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Eikenella corrodens and F. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while S. intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.
TI  - Systemic doxycycline administration in the treatment of periodontal infections (II). Effect on antibiotic resistance of subgingival species.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to determine the proportion and prevalence  of doxycycline resistant species in subgingival plaque samples taken during and after doxycycline administration. 20 subjects with adult periodontitis were randomly assigned to test (n = 10) or control groups (n = 10). Saliva samples as well as subgingival plaque samples taken from the distal surface of 6 posterior teeth were collected at baseline. All subjects received full mouth SRP and the test group systemic doxycycline at the dosage of 100 mg/day for 14 days. Saliva samples and plaque samples from the distal surface of 2 randomly selected teeth were taken at 3, 7 and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. Control subjects were sampled at the same time points. Samples were anaerobically dispersed and serially diluted in PRAS Ringer's solution and plated on enriched Trypticase soy blood agar plates with or without 4 microg/ml doxycycline. After 7 days of anaerobic incubation, colonies were counted on both sets of plates. Microbial growth was washed from the doxycycline-containing media and the species identified using 40 DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Differences in proportions of resistant species between test and control groups were tested for significance at each time point using the Mann Whitney test and over time within each group using the Quade test. The mean % (+/-SEM) of isolates resistant to 4 microg/ml doxycycline in the plaque samples of the test subjects increased from 6+/-2 to 48+/-9% during doxycycline administration, decreasing to 25+/-6% 2 weeks later and 9+/-2% at 90 days. In saliva, the % of resistant isolates rose from 13+/-1% to 81+/-10% during doxycycline administration falling to 46+/-8% 2 weeks later and 22+/-5% at 90 days. The % of resistant isolates did not change significantly in plaque or saliva samples of the control subjects at the same time points. For all subject visits combined, the most prevalent resistant species were: Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Veillonella parvula, Actinomyces gerencseriae, Streptococcus constellatus, Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, Streptococcus gordonii, Eikenella corrodens and Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1. Doxycycline resistant strains of these species were detected in both plaque and saliva samples prior to therapy and in the control group. Despite the finding of increased resistance, approximately 50% of the organisms present at periodontal sites at the end of 14 days of doxycycline administration tested sensitive to the agent.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by analysis of transfer DNA intergenic spacer length polymorphism.
AB  - The utility of PCR analysis of transfer DNA intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tDNA-ILP) for the identification to the species level of clinically relevant viridans streptococci was evaluated with a collection of reference strains of 15 species of the salivarius, anginosus, mitis and mutans rRNA homology groups. PCR products generated by using fluorescent, outwardly directed, consensus tDNA primers were analysed by electrophoresis on denaturating polyacrylamide gels and by laser fluorescence scanning. Eleven species showed specific and distinct tDNA patterns: Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus criceti and Streptococcus ratti. Indistinguishable patterns were obtained among two groups of species: Streptococcus vestibularis and Streptococcus salivarius on the one hand and Streptococcus constellatus and Streptococcus intermedius on the other. S. mitis strains produced heterogeneous patterns that could be separated into three groups: a group containing S. mitis biovar 1 and two S. mitis biovar 2 groups, one of which clustered with S. parasanguinis strains while the other showed patterns unrelated to other species. These results agree in part with protein electrophoretic analysis showing that S. mitis biovar 2 strains belong to several streptococcal taxa. In conclusion, PCR analysis of tDNA-ILP holds promise for rapid identification of viridans streptococci that are difficult to identify by phenotypic tests.
TI  - Isolation of bacteria from cervical lymph nodes in patients with oral cancer.
AB  - Thirty patients with oral mucosal cancer were studied in relation to oral mucosal damage and bacterial translocation to the regional lymph nodes in the neck. All 30 patients (gingiva 11, tongue 13, cheek mucosa four, oral floor two) underwent extensive, clean-contaminated, head-and-neck surgery (including neck dissection) with free flap reconstruction. A total of 153 lymph nodes was harvested for microbial and histological examination. Viable bacteria were isolated from 70 lymph nodes (45.8%) from 25 patients (83.3%). Bacterial cells in the nodes were detected by scanning electron microscopy. Bacterial translocation was found more often in metastatic nodes (75.0%) than in uninvolved nodes (40.3%) (p = 0.015; chi2 test). Gingival carcinoma yielded 56.4% of bacterial growth in the regional lymph nodes compared to tongue (40.3%), oral floor (40.0%) and cheek mucosa (37.5%). As the gingival carcinoma group includes more T4 cases (11/11; 100%) than the other three groups (7/19; 36.8%), bacterial translocation in uninvolved nodes could be caused by the size and invasion of the primary oral tumor. Oral streptococci (Streptococcus intermedius, Strep. constellatus, Strep. oralis, Strep. mitis, Strep. sanguis, Strep. salivarius) were the most common isolates. Aerobic enteric bacteria (Enterococcus, Escherichia, Klebsiella etc.) were also found in the lymph nodes. Among the anaerobic bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from 12 patients. Damaged oral mucosa in patients with oral cancer might allow the new bacterial colonization on the surface and subsequently drain the bacteria into the regional lymph nodes as well as the general circulation.
TI  - Meningitis caused by streptococci other than Streptococcus pneumoniae: a retrospective clinical study.
AB  - We reviewed the medical records of 26 patients (median age 62 years, range 5-76 years) admitted to our institution during 1978-98 with acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) caused by streptococci other than Streptococcus pneumoniae (comprising 1.9% of all patients with ABM). 19 cases were community-acquired and 7 were nosocomial. 73% had comorbid or predisposing conditions and 73% had an identifiable extracerebral focus; only in 2 patients no comorbid disease, primary focus or predisposing condition was present. Five patients had cerebral abscesses, and 5 had endocarditis. Beta-haemolytic streptococci were grown in 14 cases (serotype A: 4, B: 5, C: 1, G: 4) and were predominant among patients with endocarditis, whereas alpha- or non-haemolytic strains grew in 12 cases (S. mitis: 4, S. constellatus: 2, E. faecalis: 2, S. bovis: 1, unspecified: 3) and were predominant in patients with a brain abscess. Staphylococcus aureus grew together with a streptococcus in 2 cases. Blood culture was positive in 9 cases (35%). Neurologic complications occurred in 11 patients (42%) and extraneurologic complications in 18 patients (69%). Adverse outcomes occurred in 10 patients (38%), including 3 patients who died. Occurrence of seizures at any time of disease was significantly associated with an adverse outcome; no other clinical or paraclinical features appeared to affect outcome.
TI  - In vitro exchange of fluoroquinolone resistance determinants between Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans streptococci and genomic organization of the parE-parC region in S. mitis.
AB  - Transfer of fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance determinants between Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans streptococci was explored by transformation in vitro. One-step FQ-resistant parC mutants were selected, and resistance could be transferred from DNA from S. oralis, S. mitis, S. sanguis, and S. constellatus to S. pneumoniae, with frequencies of 10(-3) to <10(-7) in correlation with the homologies of their quinolone resistance determining region sequences (95%, 91%, 85%, and 81%, respectively). Reciprocal transfers of mutated parC from DNA from S. pneumoniae to S. mitis and S. oralis were also observed. Simultaneous transfer of mutated parC and gyrA genes from S. mitis to S. pneumoniae yielded high-level-resistant pneumococcal transformants in one step at low frequencies. The parE-parC region of the type strain S. mitis 103335T had >90% homology with that of S. pneumoniae. The efficient interspecific transfer of quinolone resistance determinants in vitro leads us to anticipate their dissemination in the clinical setting.
TI  - Speciation of presumptive viridans streptococci from early onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  - Twenty isolates resembling viridans streptococci, 16 from blood and four from gastric aspirates, from 17 cases of early onset neonatal sepsis were identified by the API20 Strep, Rapid ID 32 Strep and conventional tests plus hydrolysis of methylumbelliferyl glycoside substrates. Nineteen of the isolates were identified as species of viridans streptococci and one as a Leuconostoc sp. Ten of the isolates were Streptococcus oralis, three S. mitis biotype 1, two S. mitis biotype 2 and one each of S. sanguis, S. vestibularis, S. salivarius and S. intermedius. The Rapid ID 32 Strep and conventional plus methylumbelliferyl tests gave the same species identity for 17 of the isolates. S. intermedius was identified by the Rapid ID 32 Strep as S. constellatus and S. salivarius as S. equinus, with S. salivarius at lower probability. The API20 Strep failed to identify S. vestibularis and identified S. salivarius as S. defectivus. The absence of certain critical tests, including urea hydrolysis, does not allow the API20 Strep to identify all the currently recognised species of viridans steptococci. The species distribution was unexpected and the incidence of S. oralis and other viridans streptococci in vaginal swabs from prenatal patients is being investigated further.
TI  - Microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  - It has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. The purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. The presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. Similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. Community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. One complex consisted of the tightly related group: Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola. The 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the Fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Peptostreptococcus micros. Species associated with this group included: Eubacterium nodatum, Campylobacter rectus, Campylobacter showae, Streptococcus constellatus and Campylobacter gracilis. The 3rd complex consisted of Streptococcus sanguis, S. oralis, S. mitis, S. gordonii and S. intermedius. The 4th complex was comprised of 3 Capnocytophaga species, Campylobacter concisus, Eikenella corrodens and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. The 5th complex consisted of Veillonella parvula and Actinomyces odontolyticus. A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, Selenomonas noxia and Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (A. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. The 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.
TI  - Identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  - We have used a PCR assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (sodA(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (S. acidominimus, S. agalactiae, S. alactolyticus, S. anginosus, S. bovis, S. constellatus, S. canis, S. cricetus, S. downei, S. dysgalactiae, S. equi subsp. equi, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, S. equinus, S. gordonii, S. iniae, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. pneumoniae, S. porcinus, S. pyogenes, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, S. suis, S. thermophilus, and S. vestibularis). Phylogenetic analysis of these sodA(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16S rRNA sequences. We have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their sodA(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the sodA(int) fragments of the type species. We propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci to the species  level by PCR.
AB  - A PCR assay that allows identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci (Streptococcus gordonii, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. salivarius, and S. sanguis) to the species level and identification of milleri group streptococci (S. anginosus, S. constellatus, and S. intermedius) to the group level was developed. This assay was based on specific amplification of internal fragments of genes encoding D-alanine:D-alanine ligases which are species specific and ubiquitous in prokaryotes possessing peptidoglycan. The specificity of this assay was tested on 9 reference strains and 91 characterized clinical isolates. This assay offers a specific and rapid alternative to phenotypic or DNA-DNA hybridization methods for identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci.
TI  - [Evaluation of a rapid method for the identification of the Enterococcus genus].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The evaluation of the reliability of a group of three tests: pyrrolidonil-arilamidase, rapid test in NaCl esculin broth and group D antistreptococci agglutination for the rapid identification of the Enterococcus genus were performed. METHODS: One hundred fifty-eight strains of streptococci: 110 strains of Enterococcus faecalis, 8 E. faecium, 3 E. avium, 16 Streptococcus intermedius, 7 S. salivarius, 4 S. bovis, 4 S. constellatus, 2 S. sanguis and 1 strain of S. equinus, S. mitis, S. uberis and S. mutans were studied. The tests used were: rapid test in NaCl- esculin broth, pyrrolidonyl-arilamidase and antigroup D streptococcus agglutination (Patho Dx Strep D/PYR; Diagnostic Product Corporation). All catalase-negative gram-positive cocci or coccibacilli which were positive in the three tests were considered to belong to the Enterococcus genus. The usefulness of Gram staining in culture in thioglycolate broth was also studied comparing it with the results obtained with solid medium. RESULTS: The results of the proposed identification scheme were evaluated calculating different parameters: sensitivity 98%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value, 100%, and negative predictive value 94%. No significant differences were observed between the results obtained with Gram staining with thioglycolate broth and those obtained with solid medium except in the case of the Streptococcus mutans strain. CONCLUSIONS: The application of a combination of tests: pyrroidonyl-arilamidase, antistreptococci group D agglutination and rapid test in NaCl-esculin broth to catalase-negative gram-positive cocci and coccobacilli allows reliable identification in a maximum of three hours of strains belonging to the Enterococcus genus.
TI  - Utilization of sialic acid by viridans streptococci.
AB  - The importance of viridans streptococci as agents of serious extra-oral diseases, including endocarditis, is now recognized. We have tested the hypothesis that the ability to utilize sialic acid as a nutrient source may play a role in the proliferation of these organisms. The type strains of the 15 presently recognized species of viridans streptococci and two clinical isolates-S. oralis (AR3), isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis, and S. intermedius (UNS35), a brain abscess isolate-were studied for their ability to utilize sialic acid. Only S. oralis, S. sanguis, S. gordonii, S. mitis ("oralis group") S. intermedius, S. anginosus, S. constellatus ("milleri group"), and S. defectivus ("nutritionally variant group") were able to use sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid) efficiently as a sole carbon source. Formate, acetate, and ethanol were produced as the major metabolic end-products of sialic acid metabolism, while corresponding glucose-grown cultures produced lactate as the major metabolic end-product. Utilization of sialic acid was independent of the production of sialidase. Cell-free extracts of sialic acid-grown cultures expressed elevated levels of N-acetylneuraminate pyruvate-lyase (NPL; the first enzyme in the intracellular catabolism of sialic acid) and N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcNAc-6-P) deacetylase and glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6-P) deaminase (enzymes involved in the intracellular catabolism of N-acetylglucosamine). These activities were repressed by growth in the presence of glucose. The intracellular fate of sialic acid, after cleavage by NPL into N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) and pyruvate, is uncertain, but the elevated levels of GlcNAc-6-P deacetylase and GlcN-6-P deaminase in sialic acid-grown cells suggest that phosphorylation and isomerization are possible steps in the metabolism of ManNAc to generate an intermediate common to the pathway of N-acetylglucosamine metabolism. The species of viridans streptococci that have the ability to utilize sialic acid are those most commonly associated with extra-oral diseases, and this ability is likely to play a role in the persistence and survival of these infecting organisms in vivo.
TI  - Cross-reactivity between human sialyl Lewis(x) oligosaccharide and common causative oral bacteria of infective endocarditis.
AB  - The expression of sialy-Lewis(x) (sLe(x); Neu5Ac alpha 2-3 Gal beta 1-4) (Fuc alpha 1-3) GlcNAc-R) on oral bacteria producing infective endocarditis was determined by a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and an immunoelectron microscopy using the well-characterized anti-sLe(x) monoclonal antibody SNH-3 (mAb SNH-3; IgM class). mAb SNH-3 reacted strongly with whole cells of oral bacteria: Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens and Porphyromonas gingivalis. The negatively stained immuno-electron micrograph of Streptococcus pyogenes showed many reactive gold particles on the cell surface. Our findings demonstrated the existence of immunologic mimicry between the sLe(x) oligosaccharide and cell surface antigens of many species associated with infective endocarditis. We propose the hypothesis that if these bacteria escape their normal habitats, the surface components that mimic the sLe(x) oligosaccharide might bind to host antigens of the selectin family which could promote binding to endothelial cells and, consequently, initiation of the events leading to infective endocarditis.
TI  - Viridans streptococci isolated from the bloodstream. Relevance of species identification.
AB  - Over a 4-year-period, 104 isolates belonging to the viridans streptococci were recovered from the blood and identified to the species according to Beighton and co-workers. Streptococcus oralis was the species most frequently recovered from patients in the hematology unit [29 of 39 (74%)]. Streptococcus mitis ranked second [seven of 39 (18%)]. Both species were associated with oromucositis. Isolates presently identified as S. oralis are mainly those previously identified as S. mitis or Streptococcus sanguis II. Streptococcus milleri was most frequently isolated in the patients from the general hospital population [28 of 65 (43%) isolates]: Streptococcus anginosus (n = 20), Streptococcus constellatus (n = 4), and Streptococcus intermedius (n = 4). In 14 episodes from the general hospital population, clinical significance was judged questionable. From this part of the laboratory, clinical significance could not be predicted from the number of blood cultures grown, nor from the delay of growth detection. The Rapid ID 32 Strep system agreed well with the identifications according to the scheme of Beighton et al., whereas the API 20 Strep system did not.
TI  - Degradative enzymes of oral streptococci.
AB  - Members of the Streptococcus sanguis group (SSG) and Streptococcus milleri group  (SMG) were screened for their ability to produce glycosidase, arylamidase (peptidase), protease, dextranase and glycosyltransferase activities. Species within each group produced unique patterns of activity. The most commonly produced glycosidases were beta-D-glucosidase, beta-D-galactosidase, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase and N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminidase and the least commonly produced glycosidase activity was beta-fucosidase with Streptococcus intermedius (SMG) being the only species capable of producing the activity. For arylamidase activity, the most commonly produced type was lysine-arylamidase. Glycosidase and arylamidase activities were localized to particular sub-cellular fractions. alpha-galactosidase was found only in culture supernatant fluids whereas N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase was found in all fractions; the culture supernatant, cell wall, cell membrane and cytoplasm. No arylamidase activity was seen in culture supernatants. Phe-arg-arylamidase was found only in cytoplasmic fractions whereas val-pro-argarylamidase was found in cell walls, cell membranes and cytoplasmic fraction. Protease activity was measured as the degradation of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and casein. Casein was degraded by a number of strains whereas no species/strains were able to degrade BSA. Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus (SMG), Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus defectivus (SSG) were the only species that produced hyaluronidase and no species produced chondroitin sulphatase. The groups were also examined for their abilities to produce glycosyltransferase and dextranase. Strep. sanguis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus oralis produced glucosyltransferase and, with the exception of the latter species, fructosyltransferase. No species within the SMG was capable of producing either glycosyltransferase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Conservation of salivary glycoprotein-interacting and human immunoglobulin G-cross-reactive domains of antigen I/II in oral streptococci.
AB  - In this study we localized more precisely the salivary glycoprotein-interacting and the human immunoglobulin G (hIgG)-cross-reacting domains on the SR molecule, an antigen I/II-related protein from S. mutans serotype f. Mapping of the SR molecule with polypeptides expressed by subclones covering the entire molecule and with synthetic peptides demonstrates that the salivary glycoprotein-binding domain is located in the N-terminal alanine-rich repeats of the SR molecule. In order to investigate the degree of conservation of both regions in various oral streptococci, we tested the reactivity of 8 representative strains of the mutans group and 11 nonmutans oral Streptococcus strains (S. anginosus, S. milleri, S. constellatus, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. sanguis, S. gordonii, S. salivarius, and S. mitis strains) with antipeptide antibodies in a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay together with colony hybridization analysis using DNA probes designed to map these two regions. All the mutans group strains except S. rattus and the 11 nonmutans streptococcal strains showed a high conservation of the C-terminal part of the SR molecule, especially the hIgG-cross-reacting domain, and less homology for the N-terminal salivary glycoprotein-binding region. Almost all of the sera from patients with rheumatic disease reacted strongly with SR from S. mutans serotype f, P1 from S. mutans serotype c, and four peptides located in the hIgG-cross-reacting region and not with peptides located at the C and N termini and in the proline-rich repeats. These results confirm that epitopes located within this region are immunogenic in humans and could lead to the synthesis of natural anti-IgG antibodies.
TI  - Mucin-sulphatase activity of some oral streptococci.
AB  - Mucin-sulphatase activity, measured using a 35S-[SO4(2-)]-labelled colonic mucin  substrate, was detected in whole cells of Streptococci isolated from the human oral cavity. The highest levels of sulphatase activity were found in all strains of Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis and in half of the strains of Streptococcus mutans tested. Little or no activity was detected in 9 of the 11 Streptococcus oralis strains examined, in the 4 Streptococcus constellatus strains, and in the 3 Streptococcus anginosus isolates tested. The highest enzyme levels were obtained from the two fresh Streptococcus gordonii isolates. This is the first report of such activity in oral microorganisms. Streptococcal mucin-sulphatase may contribute to the destruction of salivary mucins and mitigate their protective functions in the oral cavity, and be a determinant in the development of dental caries.
TI  - Interaction of the salivary glycoprotein EP-GP with the bacterium Streptococcus salivarius HB.
AB  - The interaction of the human salivary glycoprotein EP-GP with a number of oral bacterial species, following incubation with human whole saliva, has been investigated. EP-GP could be detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, by means of ELISA or by electrophoresis in combination with Western Transfer. The results indicated that EP-GP is bound only by Streptococcus salivarius, and not by the other tested strains of bacteria, Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides fragilis, S. gordonii, S. oralis, S. sanguis, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. rattus, S. constellatus, and S. anginosus. Binding of EP-GP to S. salivarius is mediated by a protein-protein interaction, which was found to be pH-dependent with a maximum binding between pH 5 and 6. For further characterization of the binding of EP-GP to S. salivarius, four mutants were tested, each of them lacking different cell wall antigens. EP-GP was bound to all mutants in amounts comparable with the wildtype, in spite of the different surface antigen compositions. We were able to identify a 27-kD EP-GP binding protein, by extraction of S. salivarius-cell wall antigens and electrophoretic techniques. In addition to EP-GP, S. salivarius also bound two other salivary proteins, namely, secretory IgA and low-molecular-weight mucin (MG-2).
TI  - A scheme for the identification of viridans streptococci.
AB  - A collection of strains representing all the currently recognised species of oral or viridans streptococci (Streptococcus sanguis, S. parasanguis, S. gordonii, S. oralis, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. vestibularis, S. anginosus, S. constellatus, s. intermedius, S. mutans and S. sobrinus) were tested for the production of a range of glycosidase activities with 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked fluorogenic substrates, and for reactions in a range of conventional fermentation and hydrolytic tests. The resulting biochemical scheme, consisting of 14 tests, enabled the differentiation of all these species and distinguished three biotypes within S. sanguis. The scheme reported here represents an improvement over currently available schemes for the identification of viridans streptococci.
TI  - Sialidase activity of the "Streptococcus milleri group" and other viridans group  streptococci.
AB  - Viridans group streptococci were examined for the production of sialidase (neuraminidase) activity, using the fluorescent substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid in a simple and rapid (15-min) assay. Sialidase was produced by all strains of Streptococcus oralis and S. intermedius and by a majority of S. mitis strains. S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. gordonii, S. sanguis, S. vestibularis, S. salivarius, S. anginosus, S. constellatus, "S. parasanguis," and the "tufted fibril group" were uniformly negative. Sialidase production may be a useful characteristic to assist in the identification of viridans group streptococci.
TI  - Classification and identification of the viridans streptococci.
AB  - This review traces the history of the human, nonhemolytic, or viridans, streptococci and describes improvements in their taxonomy wrought by study of their biochemical profiles and analysis of their nucleic acids. The goal was to define species on the basis of genetic relationships and to describe these species by their phenotypic characteristics so that they can be easily identified. This method has resulted in the division of some species. Streptococcus mutans has been divided into four species, two of which are common in humans. Three more mutans group species are indigenous to animals. Conversely, S. constellatus, S. intermedius, and "S. milleri" have been combined under S. anginosus. S. mitis (or "S. mitior") can be well-defined and includes S. sanguis II. There is genetic heterogeneity within S. sanguis, but the species is usually easy to identify. There is also some heterogeneity in S. bovis, but most human isolates are genetically related. Discussions of the taxonomy of these species are accompanied by descriptions of the characteristics by which these streptococci can be identified. Among these species are potential pathogens which should be suspected in cases of endocarditis and purulent infections of liver, brain, and other tissues.
TI  - Speciation of viridans streptococci & their significance in human infections.
AB  - Sixty strains of viridans streptococci recovered, from various infections, encountered in a large referral Hospital in Tamil Nadu (south India) from December 1983 to May 1985 were characterised by conventional tests. Of these, 57 (95%) belonged to four species viz., Sanguis II, Mitis, Intermedius and Constellatus. Of the 40 strains that were assessed for their clinical significance, 23 (57.5%) were found to be either significant or of suggestive significance. The study suggested viridans streptococci are not particularly virulent pathogens. But local/systemic factors were found to predispose the subjects to this infection.
TI  - Identification of viridans streptococci by three commercial systems.
AB  - The API 20S (Analytab Products, Plainview, NY), the GPI card (Vitek Systems, St.  Louis, MO) and the RapSTR system (Innovative Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) were compared with conventional biochemicals for the identification of viridans streptococci. One hundred nine clinical isolates were tested that included the following species: intermedius (38) sanguis II (20), bovis (variant) (14), mitis (14), salivarius (11), sanguis I (6), constellatus (3), mutans (2), and uberis (1). With initial testing, a correct species call was made with 72% of the isolates with the GPI card, 62% with the RapSTR, and 50% with the API 20S. Identifications of viridans streptococci group or those that needed additional biochemicals for species identification occurred with 28% of isolates with the API 20S, 8% with the RapSTR, and 9% with the GPI card. Incorrect identifications occurred with 6% of the isolates tested by the GPI card, 20% with the API 20S, and 30% with the RapSTR. Most discrepancies with the RapSTR were with 66% of the intermedius isolates, whereas most, 55%, of misidentifications with the API 20S were with sanguis II isolates. No identifications were made with 2% and 13% of isolates with the API 20S and GPI, respectively.
TI  - Association of viridans group streptococci from pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis and upper genital tract infection.
AB  - The prevalence and role of viridans group streptococci in the female genital tract have not been well described. In this study of 482 pregnant women, 147 (30%) were culture positive for viridans group streptococci. Of 392 women with predominant Lactobacillus morphotypes by Gram stain (normal), 110 (28%) were colonized with viridans group streptococci, compared with 37 (41%) of 90 women with bacterial vaginosis (BV) (P = 0.02). To determine whether any species were associated with BV, 177 consecutively isolated viridans group streptococci from the vagina were identified to the species level by using the Facklam scheme. The most frequently isolated species from the vagina was Streptococcus intermedius (13%), followed by Streptococcus acidominimus (6%), Streptococcus constellatus (5%), Streptococcus sanguis II (4%), Streptococcus mitis (2%), Streptococcus salivarius (2%), Streptococcus morbillorum (2%), Streptococcus sanguis I (1%), Streptococcus mutans (0.2%), and Streptococcus uberis (0.2%) with an average of 1.2 species per woman. The distribution of the species among women with BV compared with normal women was not significantly different, with the exception of two species which were associated with BV: S. acidominimus (18% versus 3%, P less than 0.001) and S. morbillorum (6% versus 0.7%, P = 0.005). Amniotic fluid and placenta cultures yielded 54 isolates: S. sanguis II (13 isolates), S. acidominimus (9 isolates), S. intermedius (10 isolates), S. constellatus (3 isolates), S. mitis (4 isolates), S. sanguis I (4 isolates), S. morbillorum (5 isolates), S. mutans (2 isolates), S. uberis (1 isolate), mannitol-positive S. intermedius (1 isolate), and 2 isolates which were not classified. The distribution of species isolated from the upper genital tract was not a reflection of the distribution in the lower genital tract. Dextran-producing species of viridans group streptococci may have a greater pathogenic potential in the placenta than the non-dextran-producing species.
TI  - Cell surface hydrophobicity of group D and viridans streptococci isolated from patients with septicaemia.
AB  - Sixty-three strains of Group D streptococci and viridans streptococci isolated from blood cultures during a two year period were typed to the species level with conventional biochemical tests and API Strep. Streptococcus faecalis was the most common species isolated followed by S. sanguis, S. mitis and S. constellatus (S. milleri). One of the two isolates of S. faecium was a contamination. The reported increasing frequency of this organism and other Group D and viridans streptococci as well as the association of S. bovis with malignant bowel disease indicate the need for full identification of streptococcal isolates from blood cultures. Pronounced surface hydrophobicity as measured with the salt aggregation test (SAT) was expressed by 59/63 (94%) of the blood culture isolates whereas strains isolated from commercial fermentation products and strains passaged several times were hydrophilic. In the presence of human serum albumin which binds to lipoteichoic acid only one strain decreased in surface hydrophobicity. The surface hydrophobicity of two strains even slightly increased indicating that lipoteichoic acid but marginally contributes to surface hydrophobicity of streptococcal cells from these species.
TI  - Evaluation of the API 20 STREP system for species identification of "viridans" streptococci isolated from bacteremia.
AB  - Species identifications of 71 strains of viridans streptococci isolated from blood and 4 reference strains were made by the API 20 STREP system (API system S. A., Montalieu-Vercien, France) and the conventional method. There are high levels of agreement between results obtained with the both methods for determining acidification from carbohydrate except inulin. The API 20 STREP system correctly identified 74.7% of the viridans streptococci with 9.3% low descrimination, 12% incorrect and 4% unidentified. All strains of S. mitis, S. mutans, S. salivarius and S. anginosus-constellatus were correctly identified. The correct identification rates for S. sanguis I, S. sanguis II and S. MG-intermedius were 88.9%, 68% and 61% respectively. The difference of inulin reaction and the taxonomy discrepancy may be the cause of different identification. The study indicates that the API 20 STREP system has a good potentiality for species identification of viridans streptococci at present time, however, further refinement in needed.
TI  - Evaluation of a rapid latex agglutination test for identification of group D streptococci.
AB  - The SeroSTAT latex agglutination test (Scott Laboratories, Inc., Fiskesville, R.I.) for identification of group D streptococci was compared with bile-esculin agar and Lancefield grouping by using 110 clinical isolates of group D streptococci (S. faecalis, 74; S. bovis, 24; S. durans, 3; S. faecium, 9) and 65 viridans streptococci (S. anginosus-constellatus, 2; Streptococcus MG, 15; S. sanguis II, 14; S. mitis, 7; S. mutans, 5; S. salivarius, 8; S. sanguis I, 8; S. acidominimus, 1; S. morbillorum, 2; S. pneumoniae, 3). All strains of group D streptococci were bile-esculin positive. SeroSTAT reactions were falsely positive with 2 strains of S. sanguisII and 1 strain of Streptococcus MG (4.6% of all viridans streptococci tested) and falsely negative with 10 S. bovis, 8 S. faecalis, 1 S. durans, and 6 S. faecium strains (22.7% of all group D streptococci tested). When considered with colonial morphology and hemolytic reaction, SeroSTAT is a rapid (60-s) and useful test for recognition of group D streptococci.
TI  - Prevalence of viridans streptococci exhibiting lactose-inhibitable coaggregation  with oral actinomycetes.
AB  - Fresh oral isolates from human dental plaque were selected on the basis of their  spherical morphology. In a double-blind experiment, their species identity and ability to coaggregate with human oral Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces naeslundii were determined. Of the 110 isolates characterized, 30 were identified as either Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus anginosus-constellatus, or Veillonella parvula; none of these coaggregated with the actinomycetes. The remaining 80 isolates were identified as Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus MG-intermedius, or Streptococcus morbillorum. Of these 49 isolates (61%) coaggregated with actinomycetes, and nearly 90% (43 of 49 isolates) exhibited lactose-inhibitable coaggregations. Compared with previously characterized coaggregation properties determined with stock culture strains of streptococci, 82% of the fresh isolates exhibited identical coaggregations. The other 18% made up a new coaggregation group that possessed a related lactose-inhibitable coaggregation pattern. Thus, most fresh isolates that coaggregated exhibited lactose-inhibitable coaggregations with human oral actinomycetes. It is suggested that these coaggregations are mediated by a network of lectin-carbohydrate interactions similar to those already characterized in previous studies with stock cultures of actinomycetes and streptococci.
TI  - Serologic studies of Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus morbillorum by crossed immunoelectrophoresis.
AB  - A reference antigen-antibody system for Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus  constellatus, and Streptococcus morbillorum was established with crossed immunoelectrophoresis. A comparison of S. intermedius, S. constellatus, and S. morbillorum with crossed immunoelectrophoresis and crossed immunoelectrophoresis with intermediate gel indicated that S. intermedius and S. constellatus are closely related antigenically with as many as six common cytoplasmic antigens. S. morbillorum was antigenically more distinct; antiserum of one strain of S. morbillorum was monospecific, indicating that specific serogroups of S. morbillorum exist. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis and tandem crossed immunoelectrophoresis revealed that S. intermedius, S. constellatus, and S. morbillorum also share some common antigens with Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mitis, but S. intermedius, S. constellatus, and S. morbillorum are antigenically distinct from Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus bovis.
