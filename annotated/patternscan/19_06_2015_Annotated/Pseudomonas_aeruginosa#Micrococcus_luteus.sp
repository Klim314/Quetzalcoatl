TI  == candida and fusarium species known as opportunistic human pathogens from customer-accessible parts of residential washing machines.
AB  == energy constraints have altered consumer practice regarding the use of household  washing machines. washing machines were developed that use lower washing temperatures, smaller amounts of water and biodegradable detergents. these conditions may favour the enrichment of opportunistic human pathogenic fungi. we  focused on the isolation of fungi from two user-accessible parts of washing machines that often contain microbial biofilms: drawers for detergents and rubber door seals. out of 70 residential washing machines sampled in slovenia, 79% were  positive for fungi. in total, 72 strains belonging to 12 genera and 26 species were isolated. among these, members of the fusarium oxysporum and fusarium solani species complexes, candida parapsilosis and exophiala phaeomuriformis represented 44% of fungi detected. these species are known as opportunistic human pathogens and can cause skin, nail or eye infections also in healthy humans. a machine learning analysis revealed that presence of detergents and softeners followed by  washing temperature, represent most critical factors for fungal colonization. three washing machines with persisting malodour that resulted in bad smelling laundry were analysed for the presence of fungi and bacteria. in these cases, fungi were isolated in low numbers (7.5 %), while bacteria micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and sphingomonas species prevailed.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides expressed in medicinal maggots of the blow fly lucilia sericata show combinatorial activity against bacteria.
AB  == the larvae of the common green bottle fly (lucilia sericata) produce antibacterial secretions that have a therapeutic effect on chronic and nonhealing wounds. recent developments in insect biotechnology have made it possible to use  these larvae as a source of novel anti-infectives. here, we report the application of next-generation rna sequencing (rna-seq) to characterize the transcriptomes of the larval glands, crop, and gut, which contribute to the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides (amps) and proteins secreted into wounds. our data confirm that l. sericata larvae have adapted in order to colonize microbially contaminated habitats, such as carrion and necrotic wounds, and are protected against infection by a diverse spectrum of amps. l. sericata amps include not only lucifensin and lucimycin but also novel attacins, cecropins, diptericins, proline-rich peptides, and sarcotoxins. we identified 47 genes encoding putative amps and produced 23 as synthetic analogs, among which some displayed activities against a broad spectrum of microbial pathogens, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, and enterococcus faecalis. against escherichia coli (gram negative) and micrococcus luteus (gram positive), we found mostly additive effects but also synergistic activity when selected amps were tested in combination. the amps that are easy to synthesize are currently being produced in bulk to allow their evaluation as novel anti-infectives that can be formulated in hydrogels to produce therapeutic wound dressings and adhesive bandages.

TI  == isolation and identification of symbiotic bacteria from the skin, mouth, and rectum of wild and captive tree shrews.
AB  == endosymbionts influence many aspects of their hosts' health conditions, including physiology, development, immunity, metabolism, etc. tree shrews (tupaia belangeri chinensis) have attracted increasing attention in modeling human diseases and therapeutic responses due to their close relationship with primates. to clarify the situation of symbiotic bacteria from their body surface, oral cavity, and anus, 12 wild and 12 the third generation of captive tree shrews were examined. based on morphological and cultural characteristics, physiological and biochemical tests, as well as the 16s rdna full sequence analysis, 12 bacteria strains were isolated and identified from the wild tree shrews: body surface: bacillus subtilis (detection rate 42%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (25%), staphlococcus aureus (33%), s. epidermidis (75%), micrococcus luteus (25%), kurthia gibsonii (17%); oral cavity: neisseria mucosa (58%), streptococcus pneumonia (17%); anus: enterococcus faecalis (17%), lactococus lactis (33%), escherichia coli (92%), salmonella typhosa (17%); whereas, four were indentified  from the third generation captive tree shrews: body surface: s. epidermidis (75%); oral cavity: n.mucosa (67%); anus: l. lactis (33%), e. coli (100%). these  results indicate that s. epidermidis, n. mucosa, l. lactis and e. coli were major bacteria in tree shrews, whereas, s. aureus, m. luteus, k. gibsonii, e. faecalis  and s. typhosa were species-specific flora. this study facilitates the future use of tree shrews as a standard experimental animal and improves our understanding of the relationship between endosymbionts and their hosts.

TI  == antibiotic oxylipins from alternanthera brasiliana and its endophytic bacteria.
AB  == bioassay-guided fractionation of alternanthera brasiliana stem extracts resulted  in the isolation of an antibiotically active fraction. five human pathogenic bacteria were used to guide the fractionation process for the isolation of antimicrobial compounds. finally, 17 linoleate oxylipins were identified by lc-ms/ms and nmr spectroscopy. five of the isolated compounds present in a. brasiliana tissues were also detected to be synthesized by endophytic bacteria of the genus bacillus that were isolated from a. brasiliana. it is speculated that the antibiotic oxylipins from a. brasiliana might derive from bacteria and be involved in an ecological relationship between this plant and its endophytes.

TI  == antibacterial properties of silver nanoparticles synthesized using pulicaria glutinosa plant extract as a green bioreductant.
AB  == the antibacterial properties of nanoparticles (nps) can be significantly enhanced by increasing the wettability or solubility of nps in aqueous medium. in this study, we investigated the effects of the stabilizing agent on the solubility of  silver nps and its subsequent effect on their antimicrobial activities. silver nps were prepared using an aqueous solution of pulicaria glutinosa plant extract  as bioreductant. the solution also acts as a capping ligand. during this study, the antimicrobial activities of silver nps, as well as the plant extract alone, were tested against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and micrococcus luteus. silver nps were prepared with various concentrations of the plant extract to study its effect on antimicrobial activity. interestingly, various concentrations of p. glutinosa extract did not show any effect on the growth of tested bacteria; however, a significant effect on the antimicrobial property of plant extract capped silver nps (ag-nps-pe) was  observed. for instance, the half maximal inhibitory concentration values were found to decrease (from 4% to 21%) with the increasing concentrations of plant extract used for the synthesis of ag-nps-pe. these results clearly indicate that  the addition of p. glutinosa extracts enhances the solubility of ag-nps-pe and, hence, increases their toxicity against the tested microorganisms.

TI  == influence of acetylation degree and molecular weight of homogeneous chitosans on  antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  == the results given in the literature are conflicting when considering the relationship between antimicrobial activity and chitosan characteristics. to be able to clarify, we prepared fifteen homogeneous chitosans with different acetylation degrees (da) and molecular weights (mw) by reacetylation of a fully deacetylated chitin under homogeneous conditions. they were tested at different ph values for their antimicrobial activities against four gram-negative bacteria  (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhi), four gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis and micrococcus luteus) and three fungi (aspergillus niger, fusarium oxysporum and alternaria solani). chitosans markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria and fungi tested, although the inhibitory effect depends on the type of microorganism and on the chitosan characteristics (da and mw) with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the range of 0.001 to 0.1 w%. considering chitosan efficiency on bacteria, our series of data clearly show that the lower da and the lower ph give the larger efficiency. antibacterial activity was further enhanced for gram-negative bacteria with decreasing mw, whereas, opposite effect was observed with the gram-positive. concerning the antifungal activity, the influence of chitosan characteristics was dependent on the particular type of fungus. fungal growth decreased with increasing mw for f. oxysporum and decreasing da for a. solani, but no mw or da dependences were observed with a. niger.

TI  == amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptides: membrane active peptidomimetics and their potential as antimicrobial agents.
AB  == we introduce a novel class of membrane active peptidomimetics, the amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptides, and evaluate their potential as antimicrobial agents. the design criteria, the building block and oligomer synthesis as well as a detailed structure-activity relationship (sar) study are reported. specifically, infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (irras) was employed to investigate structural features of amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptide sequences at the hydrophobic/hydrophilic air/liquid interface. furthermore, langmuir monolayers of anionic and zwitterionic phospholipids have been used to model the interactions of amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptides with prokaryotic and eukaryotic cellular membranes in order to predict their membrane  selectivity and elucidate their mechanism of action. lastly, antimicrobial activity was tested against gram-positive m. luteus and s. aureus as well as against gram-negative e. coli and p. aeruginosa bacteria along with testing hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity. we found that amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptide sequences combine high and selective antimicrobial activity with exceptionally low cytotoxicity in comparison to values reported in the literature. overall, this study provides further insights into the sar of antimicrobial peptides and peptidomimetics and indicates that amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptides are strong candidates for further development as antimicrobial agents with high therapeutic index.

TI  == structure-activity study of macropin, a novel antimicrobial peptide from the venom of solitary bee macropis fulvipes (hymenoptera: melittidae).
AB  == a novel antimicrobial peptide, designated macropin (mac-1) with sequence gly-phe-gly-met-ala-leu-lys-leu-leu-lys-lys-val-leu-nh2 , was isolated from the venom of the solitary bee macropis fulvipes. mac-1 exhibited antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, antifungal activity, and moderate hemolytic activity against human red blood cells. a series of macropin analogs were prepared to further evaluate the effect of structural alterations on antimicrobial and hemolytic activities and stability in human serum. the antimicrobial activities of several analogs against pathogenic pseudomonas aeruginosa were significantly increased while their toxicity against  human red blood cells was decreased. the activity enhancement is related to the introduction of either l- or d-lysine in selected positions. furthermore, all-d analog and analogs with d-amino acid residues introduced at the n-terminal part of the peptide chain exhibited better serum stability than did natural macropin.  data obtained by cd spectroscopy suggest a propensity of the peptide to adopt an  amphipathic alpha-helical secondary structure in the presence of trifluoroethanol or membrane-mimicking sodium dodecyl sulfate. in addition, the study elucidates the structure-activity relationship for the effect of d-amino acid substitutions  in mac-1 using nmr spectroscopy.

TI  == the presence of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens in endotracheal tube biofilms and corresponding surveillance cultures.
AB  == mechanically ventilated patients often develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap). soon after intubation, a mixed biofilm harboring microbial pathogens is formed on the endotracheal tube (et). it is believed that this biofilm contributes to the development of vap. unfortunately, the causative agent is often not known at the time vap is suspected, and early therapy often relies on the identification of surveillance cultures (sc). it is thus important to know whether these sc can predict the microbial flora in et biofilms. in this study, we compare the presence of a number of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial bacteria (enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) and of candida albicans in cultures from et biofilms and sc (i.e. sputum samples, nose swabs, and throat swabs) of 20 mechanically ventilated patients. our data indicate that  there is a good correlation between the presence of (antibiotic-resistant) pathogens in et biofilms and sc.

AB  == a series of 15 novel symmetrical and non-symmetrical bis-imidazolidineiminothiones (6a-g, 7a-e, 8a,b, and 9) with various substituents at n-(1) (p-tolyl, p-methoxyphenyl, p-ethoxyphenyl, p-chlorophenyl, p-bromophenyl, p-iodophenyl, and 3,5-dichlorophenyl) and different linkers between the n-(3) atoms [4,4'-oxybis(4,1-phenylene), 2,2'-dimethoxybiphenyl, and  (1,3,3-trimethylcyclohexyl)methyl)] were prepared in 65-75% yields from substituted n-arylcyanothioformanilides and various bis-isocyanates. screening for cytotoxicity against the hepg2, hep2, mcf7, and hct116 tumor cell lines gave  ic50 values ranging from 6.3 to 84.6 microm, where compounds 6b,d,e,g and 7a were markedly active against a least one cell line, underlining the matching effect of properly positioned substituents on n-(1) and the appropriate n-(3)-n-(3) linker. likewise, all heterocyles were tested against microbial organisms (pseudomonas aeruginosa, sarcina lutea, bacillus pumilus, and micrococcus luteus) and fungal strains (candida albicans and penicilium chrysogenum). most compounds showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activities, reaching in certain cases the same level of antimicrobial activity as the standard antibacterial agent erythromycin and the antifungal agent metronidazole. the antimicrobial activity was further supported by quantitative assessment of susceptibilities of a selection of the preceding microorganisms using minimum inhibitory concentration  and minimum bactericidal concentration techniques. finally, the antiviral properties of all compounds were investigated against the viral strains hav, hsv1, and coxb4, where 6c,d,f and 7a,c,e were markedly active against one or two  viral strains, reducing the virus plaque count of various viral strains by 66 to  88%. structure activity relationship studies revealed several matching pairs of aromatic substituents on n-(1) and the n-(3)-n-(3) linkers, which could serve to  optimize structural features for high activity to eventually render such compounds clinically useful drug agents.

TI  == effective inhibition of bacterial respiration and growth by cuo microspheres composed of thin nanosheets.
AB  == this study describes the synthesis, characterization and biocidal potential of copper oxide micro-spheres composed of thin sheets (cuomss-ths). microscopic observations of synthesized cuomss-ths revealed the clusters of thin sheets arranged in small flower like micro-spheres. diameter of each micro-sphere was determined in the range of 2-3 mum, whereas the size of each sheet was approximately 80 nm. these micro-flowers like nanostructures were synthesized using copper nitrate hexahydrate and sodium hydroxide via solution process. the cuomss-ths exhibited a broad-spectrum anti-bacterial activity involving significant growth inhibition of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus. the ic50 values of these engineered nps against e. coli, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and m. luteus were determined to be 195, 200, 131 and 184 mug/ml, respectively. also, the respiration of gram+ ve organisms (m. luteus and s. aureus) was inhibited significantly (p value < 0.005) at relatively lower concentrations of 12.5 and 50 mug/ml, respectively, as compared to the gram- ve bacteria (e. coli and p. aeruginosa), where the growth inhibition occurred at a much greater concentration of 100 mug/ml. the results explicitly demonstrated anti-microbial activity of cuomss-ths with a higher level of toxicity against the gram+ ve vis-a-vis gram- ve bacteria.

TI  == lipopeptide biosurfactants from paenibacillus polymyxa inhibit single and mixed species biofilms.
AB  == although biofilms are recognised as important in microbial colonisation, solutions to their inhibition are predominantly based on planktonic assays. these solutions have limited efficacy against biofilms. here, a series of biofilm-orientated tests were used to identify anti-biofilm compounds from marine micro-flora. this led to the isolation of a complex of anti-biofilm compounds from an extract of paenibacillus polymyxa (ppe). a combination of rphplc and mass spectrometry identified the principle components of ppe as fusaricidin b (li-fo4b) and polymyxin d1, with minor contributions from surfactins. this complex (ppe) reduced the biofilm biomass of bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus bovis. in contrast, ampicillin was only effective against s. aureus. ppe also inhibited a self-assembling marine biofilm (samb) in co-incubation assays by 99.3% +/- 1.9 and disrupted established samb by 72.4% +/- 4.4, while ampicillin showed no significant reduction. the effectiveness of this complex of lipopeptides against  single and multispecies biofilms suggests a future role in biofilm prevention strategies.

TI  == effects of parabens and isothiazolinone on the microbiological quality of baby shampoo: the challenge test.
AB  == an in vitro microbial challenge test has been developed to predict the likelihood of consumer contamination of baby shampoo. four preservatives were tested in our  study: the parbens medcide d, medcide pb, sepicide hb. and isothiazolinone methylisothiazolinone/chloromethylisothiazolinone [mi/mci]. these preservatives were tested separately and in combination. the challenge test involved inoculating the product with micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aspergillus brasiliensis and candida albicans. inhibition growth of these microorganisms at each preservative concentration was followed over a 28 d period. the test was used to classify products as poorly preserved, marginally preserved, or well-preserved. interestingly, it was the combination (0.1% isothiazolinone [mi/mci] and 0.1% sepicide hb) which inhibited most the microbial growth of microorganims while preserving the physicochemical properties of the product. as  a result, the challenge test described can be accurately used to predict the risk of consumer contamination of cosmetic products.

TI  == crustins from eyestalk cdna library of swimming crab portunus trituberculatus: molecular characterization, genomic organization and expression analysis.
AB  == crustins are cationic, cysteine-rich antimicrobial proteins, containing a single  whey acidic protein (wap) domain in the c-terminal end. different from the reported ptcrustin in the hemocytes, two novel crustin genes (ptcrustin2 and ptcrustin3) were cloned completely from the eyestalk cdna library of portunus trituberculatus in this study. all ptcrustins share the consensus cysteine motif  and are considered as type i crustins. four exons and three introns are identified in genomic dna sequence of ptcrustin3 while three exons and two introns in ptcrustin2. the mrna transcripts of ptcrustin2 and ptcrustin3 are mainly detected in eyestalk and gills, but not in hemocytes. although both ptcrutins are up-regulated after challenge of three microorganisms, ptcrustin3 seems to respond more quickly to microbial challenge than ptcrustin2. unlike most crustins, both recombinant ptcrustin2 and ptcrustin3 exhibit antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria micrococcus luteus and staphyloccocus aureus and gram-negative bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa. in addition, rptcrustin2 is moderately active against yeast pichia pastoris and rptcrustin3 show significant activity against gram-negative bacterium vibrio alginolyticus. these results indicate that ptcrustin2 and ptcrustin3 are two novel crustins and  play different roles in immune response of p. trituberculatus against microbial challenge.

TI  == antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  == the aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, salmonella enterica ser. enteritidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. the tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. in the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the ph values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. the inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. phosphates obviously made the development of most gram-positive bacteria impossible. especially micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. on the other  hand, gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. the exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. it should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates hexa68 and hexa70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. by comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be  concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on ph values.

TI  == in vitro interaction of chronic wound bacteria in biofilms.
AB  == objective: to use in vitro biofilm models of wound bacterial isolates and compare the biofilms produced for different combinations of wound bacterial species. method: in vitro biofilms, generated by pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus oralis and micrococcus luteus in microtitre plates and a constant depth film fermentor (cdff), were studied. the tested isolates all originated from chronic venous leg ulcers. biofilms of individual and dual combinations of these species were generated in microtitre plate wells at 37 degrees c for 24-96 hours and also in the cdff for 7 days. the extent of biofilm  formation from these systems was then measured using crystal violet staining and/or total viable counts. results: all the chronic wound bacteria formed biofilms (both individually and in mixed culture) in these models. in mixed species microtitre plate biofilms, both p. aeruginosa and s. aureus appeared to antagonise biofilm formation by s. oralis and m. luteus, with p. aeruginosa completely inhibiting the growth of these organisms. similar effects were evident in the cdff model, when all four bacterial species were added simultaneously, with m. luteus being 'out-competed' by the other organisms present and occurring  at numbers at the limits of detection; however, there was an apparent increase in the numbers of s. oralis compared with its single culture equivalent. conclusion: the study highlighted differences in biofilm formation ability for the tested species in both closed and open model systems. using dual species biofilms, distinct species antagonism was observed with apparent antagonism of pathogenic species over 'commensal' ones. such a finding provides insight into possible bacterial interactions during development of 'non-healing' wound biofilms.

TI  == gram-negative and gram-positive antibacterial properties of the whole plant extract of willow herb (epilobium angustifolium).
AB  == the emergence of new pathogens and the increase in the number of multidrug-resistant strains in well-established pathogens during the past decade  represent a growing public health concern globally. with the current lack of research and development of new antibiotics by large pharmaceutical companies due to poor financial returns, new alternatives need to be explored including natural herbal or plant-based extracts with reported antibacterial properties. willow herb (epilobium angustifolium) preparations have been used in traditional aboriginal and folk medicine preparations externally as an antiphlogistic to treat prostate and gastrointestinal disorders and as an antiseptic to treat infected wounds. the authors hypothesized that a whole plant extract of willow herb would exhibit antimicrobial properties on a variety of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in culture. the authors found that, in comparison to growth controls, willow herb extract significantly inhibited the growth of micrococcus luteus (p < .01), staphylococcus aureus (p < .05), escherichia coli (p < .001), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p < .001). they also found that willow herb extract inhibited the growth of bacteria in culture more effectively than vancomycin (p < .05) or tetracycline (p < .004). these results provide preliminary support for the traditional folkloric claim that the plant willow herb possesses antibacterial properties against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. given that whole plant extract was utilized for this study, further investigations are warranted to determine which specific part of the plant (i.e., leaves, stem, roots, and flowers) possess the antibacterial properties.

TI  == enhanced antimicrobial activity of engineered human lysozyme.
AB  == lysozymes contain a disproportionately large fraction of cationic residues, and are thereby attracted toward the negatively charged surface of bacterial targets. importantly, this conserved biophysical property may inhibit lysozyme antibacterial function during acute and chronic infections. a mouse model of acute pulmonary pseudomonas aeruginosa infection demonstrated that anionic biopolymers accumulate to high concentrations in the infected lung, and the presence of these species correlates with decreased endogenous lysozyme activity. to develop antibacterial enzymes designed specifically to be used as antimicrobial agents in the infected airway, the electrostatic potential of human lysozyme (hlys) was remodeled by protein engineering. a novel, high-throughput screen was implemented to functionally interrogate combinatorial libraries of charge-engineered hlys proteins, and variants with improved bactericidal activity were isolated and characterized in detail. these studies illustrate a general mechanism by which polyanions inhibit lysozyme function, and they are the first direct demonstration that decreasing hlys's net cationic character improves its antibacterial activity in the presence of disease-associated biopolymers. in addition to avoiding electrostatic sequestration, at least one charge-engineered  variant also kills bacteria more rapidly in the absence of inhibitory biopolymers; this observation supports a novel hypothesis that tuning the cellular affinity of peptidoglycan hydrolases may be a general strategy for improving kinetics of bacterial killing.

TI  == monitoring the effects of chiral pharmaceuticals on aquatic microorganisms by metabolic fingerprinting.
AB  == the effects of the chiral pharmaceuticals atenolol and propranolol on pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas aeruginosa, micrococcus luteus, and blastomonas natatoria were investigated. the growth dynamics of exposed cultures were monitored using a bioscreen instrument. in addition, fourier-transform infrared (ft-ir) spectroscopy with appropriate chemometrics and high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) were employed in order to investigate the phenotypic changes and possible degradation of the drugs in exposed cultures. for the majority of the bacteria studied there was not a statistically significant difference in the organism's phenotype when it was exposed to the different enantiomers or mixtures of enantiomers. in contrast, the pseudomonads appeared to respond differently to propranolol, and the two enantiomers had different effects on the cellular phenotype. this implies that there were different metabolic responses in the organisms when they were exposed to the different enantiomers. we suggest that our findings may indicate that there are widespread effects on aquatic communities in which active pharmaceutical ingredients are present.

TI  == hydroxytyrosol from tyrosol using hydroxyphenylacetic acid-induced bacterial cultures and evidence of the role of 4-hpa 3-hydroxylase.
AB  == hydroxytyrosol (htyr) is a potent natural antioxidant found in olive mill wastewaters. bacterial conversion of 4-tyrosol (2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethanol) to htyr was reported in a limited number of bacterial species including pseudomonas  aeruginosa. in this work, we studied this conversion, taking as a model the newly isolated halomonas sp. strain htb24. it was first hypothesized that the enzyme responsible for 4-tyrosol hydroxylation in htyr was a 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid  3-hydroxylase (hpah, ec 1.14.13.3), previously known to convert 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4-hpa) into 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (3,4-dhpa) in p. aeruginosa. cloning and expression of hpab (oxygenase component) and hpac (reductase component) genes from p. aeruginosa confirmed this hypothesis. furthermore, using cultures of htb24 containing 4-tyrosol, it was shown that 4-hpa accumulation preceded 4-tyrosol hydroxylation. we further demonstrated that the synthesis of hpah activity was induced by 4-hpa, with the latter compound being formed from 4-tyrosol oxidation by aryl-dehydrogenases. interestingly, similar results were obtained with other 4-hpa-induced bacteria, including p. aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus and other halomonas, thus demonstrating general hydroxylating activity of 4-tyrosol by the  hpah enzyme. e. coli w did not have aryl-dehydrogenase activity and hence were unable to oxidize 4-tyrosol to 4-hpa and htyr to 3,4-dhpa, making this bacterium  a good candidate for achieving better htyr production.

TI  == report: antibiotic production by thermophilic bacillus specie sat-4.
AB  == production of antimicrobial compounds seems to be a general phenomenon for most bacteria. the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among key microbial pathogens is increasing at an alarming rate worldwide. current solutions involve  development of a more rationale approach to antibiotic use and discover of new antimicrobials. bacillus species produce a large number of biological compounds active against bacteria, fungi, protozoa and viruses. the process of production usually involves screening of wide range of microorganisms, testing and modification. production is carried out using fermentation. thermophilic spore-forming, gram positive, motile rod bacterial strains were isolated from the thar desserts, sindh province, pakistan. these strains were screened and checked  for antibacterial activity. the best activity was observed by sat4 against micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeroginosa. the activity was only observed against gram positive bacteria and no activity was seen against pseudomonas aeroginosa. thermophilic bacillus specie sat4 was found  to be active in the fermentation process to produce the antimicrobial agents. further optimizations of different conditions (time of incubation, media, ph, glucose concentrations, nitrogen concentrations, and temperature) for antimicrobial production by the selected bacterial strain was performed. agar diffusion assay was performed to evaluate the antibacterial activity. optimum conditions for the production of antimicrobials by selected isolate were observed to be 48 hour, ph 5, temperature 55 degrees c, 2% glucose and 1.5% nitrogen concentration. this newly isolated bacterial strain has great potential for antimicrobial production at industrial scale.

TI  == leptoglycin: a new glycine/leucine-rich antimicrobial peptide isolated from the skin secretion of the south american frog leptodactylus pentadactylus (leptodactylidae).
AB  == antimicrobial peptides are components of innate immunity that is the first-line defense against invading pathogens for a wide range of organisms. here, we describe the isolation, biological characterization and amino acid sequencing of  a novel neutral glycine/leucine-rich antimicrobial peptide from skin secretion of leptodactylus pentadactylus named leptoglycin. the amino acid sequence of the peptide purified by rp-hplc (c(18) column) was deduced by mass spectrometric de novo sequencing and confirmed by edman degradation: gllggllgpllgggggggggll. leptoglycin was able to inhibit the growth of gram-negative bacteria pseudomonas  aeruginosa, escherichia coli and citrobacter freundii with minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 8 microm, 50 microm, and 75 microm respectively, but it  did not show antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and enterococcus faecalis), yeasts (candida albicans and candida tropicalis) and dermatophytes fungi (microsporum canis and trichophyton rubrum). no hemolytic activity was observed at the 2-200 microm range concentration. the amino acid sequence of leptoglycin with high level of glycine (59.1%) and leucine (36.4%) containing an unusual central proline suggests the existence of a new class of gly/leu-rich antimicrobial peptides. taken together, these results suggest that this natural antimicrobial peptide could be a tool to develop new antibiotics.

TI  == growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii grazing on different  bacteria.
AB  == free-living amoebae of the genus acanthamoeba are widely distributed in soil and  water collections, where trophozoites (vegetative, multiplicative stages) feed mainly by phagocytosis and thus control bacterial populations in the environment. here, we examined the growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii receiving different bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, bacillus subtilis, bacillus megaterium, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) in nonnutrient saline. all bacteria assayed induced a  dose-dependent proliferative response, in most cases maximized with a bacterial dose of 1 x 10(9) ml(-1); except for m. luteus, trophozoites grew better with viable than with heat-killed bacteria. in addition, acanthamoeba growth was improved by adding bacteria on alternate days. single-dose experiments indicated  a temporal association between the growth of trophozoite and bacterial consumption, and higher consumption of m. luteus, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, bacterial species that allowed the highest trophozoite yields. long-term acanthamoeba-bacteria incubation revealed that encystment was significantly delayed by almost all the bacteria assayed (including s. aureus, which elicited a poor growth response) and that the presence of bacteria markedly increased cyst yield; final cyst recovery clearly depended on both the dose and the type of the  bacterium given, being much higher with e. coli, m. luteus and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == brassica juncea chitinase bjchi1 inhibits growth of fungal phytopathogens and agglutinates gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == brassica juncea bjchi1 is a plant chitinase with two chitin-binding domains. its  expression, induced in response to wounding, methyl jasmonate treatment, aspergillus niger infection, and caterpillar pieris rapae feeding, suggests that  it plays a role in defence. in this study, to investigate the potential of using  bjchi1 in agriculture, pichia-expressed bjchi1 and its deletion derivatives that  lack one or both chitin-binding domains were tested against phytopathogenic fungi and bacteria. transplastomic tobacco expressing bjchi1 was also generated and its extracts assessed. in radial growth-inhibition assays, bjchi1 and its derivative  with one chitin-binding domain showed anti-fungal activities against phytopathogens, colletotrichum truncatum, c. acutatum, botrytis cinerea, and ascochyta rabiei. bjchi1 also inhibited spore germination of c. truncatum. furthermore, bjchi1, but not its derivatives lacking one or both domains, inhibited the growth of gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, ralstonia solanacearum, pseudomonas aeruginosa) more effectively than gram-positive bacteria (micrococcus luteus and bacillus megaterium), indicating that the duplicated chitin-binding domain, uncommon in chitinases, is essential for bacterial agglutination. galactose, glucose, and lactose relieved agglutination,  suggesting that bjchi1 interacts with the carbohydrate components of the gram-negative bacterial cell wall. retention of chitinase and bacterial agglutination activities in transplastomic tobacco extracts implicates that bjchi1 is potentially useful against both fungal and bacterial phytopathogens in  agriculture.

AB  == although quinone production and melanin formation are widely recognized as an integral part of the insect defense system, experimental evidence is lacking that the proteolytic activation of prophenoloxidase participates in the direct killing of invading microbes-active phenoloxidase generates quinones that polymerize to form melanin. here, we report the antimicrobial effect of reactive intermediates  produced in phenoloxidase-catalyzed reactions. after being treated with manduca sexta phenoloxidase and dopamine, escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis ceased to grow, whereas the growth of pichia pastoris was slightly affected. microscopic analysis showed melanin deposition on cell surface, aggregation of bacteria, and  loss of cell mobility. viability tests revealed major decreases in the bacterial  colony counts and, since the decrease remained significant after dispersion of the cell clumps, the reactive compounds were surmised to have aggregated and killed e. coli and b. subtilis cells. under the experimental conditions, 60-94% of the gram-negative bacteria (e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium) and 52-99% of the gram-positive bacteria  (bacillus cereus, b. subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) were killed. in the presence of phenoloxidase, dopamine or 5,6-dihydroxyindole (dhi) exhibited much higher antibacterial activity than l-dopa, n-acetyldopamine  (nada) or n-beta-alanyldopamine (nbad) did, suggesting that dhi and its oxidation products were cytotoxic. the antifungal activity of dhi was detected using p. pastoris, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida albicans, and beauveria bassiana. these results established that prophenoloxidase activation is an integral component of the insect defense system involving a multitude of enzymes (e.g. proteinases, oxidases, and dopachrome conversion enzyme (dce)), which immobilizes and kills invading microorganisms.

TI  == comparison of the antibacterial activity of honey from different provenance against bacteria usually isolated from skin wounds.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of honey samples provided by apiarists and honey packers was tested against microorganisms usually isolated from skin wounds. the  antibacterial activity was tested using the well-agar diffusion assay. the honey  samples were tested without dilution, and at 75, 50, 30, and 10% (w/v) dilution.  most of the undiluted honey samples inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. some honey samples provided by apiarists also inhibited the growth of s. aureus even at 50% dilution. undiluted honey samples also inhibited the growth of staphylococcus uberis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae, although to a lesser extent. no inhibition of micrococcus luteus and enterococcus faecalis growth was detected. the diameters of the inhibition zones generated by honey samples provided by apiarists were larger than those generated by honey samples provided by honey packers. this observation may be explained by considering the provenance of the honey samples.

TI  == in vitro deposition of lysozyme on etafilcon a and balafilcon a hydrogel contact  lenses: effects on adhesion and survival of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == purpose: to compare lysozyme adsorption and absorption and bacterial adhesion interactions on conventional (etafilcon a) and silicone (balafilcon a) hydrogel contact lenses. method: lysozyme concentrations and activities associated with the lenses were determined after solvent extraction (trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile) and directly on the lenses without extraction with micrococcal- and micro-bicinchoninic acid (bca) assays. cells of bacteria with radiolabeled leucine and a cell recovery procedure were used in determinations of bacterial adhesion to lenses. results: lysozyme was adsorbed and absorbed to the  conventional etafilcon a lens at about a 10-fold greater concentration than to the balafilcon a silicone hydrogel lens. enzyme activities on the surfaces of both lenses were similar but replenished after saline extraction only with the etafilcon a lens. lysozyme on the lens surface showed significant lysis of micrococcus luteus but had a negligible effect on the adhesion and survival of staphylococcus aureus. lysozyme did not appear to affect the survival of pseudomonas aeruginosa on lenses. conclusion: in vitro experiments show that concentrations of active lysozyme on the surface of the etafilcon a lens, unlike  the balafilcon a lens which showed negligible absorption, may be sustained from the lens matrix. lysozyme deposited on hydrogel lenses had marked activity against m. luteus but relatively minor effects on the primary adhesion of p. aeruginosa and s. aureus.

TI  == chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of four different anatolian propolis samples.
AB  == propolis means a gum that is gathered by bees from various plants. it is known for its biological properties, having antibacterial, antifungal and healing properties. the aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of four different anatolian propolis samples on different groups of microorganisms including some oral pathogens and comparison between their chemical compositions. ethanol extracts of propolis (eep) were prepared from four different anatolian propolis samples and examined whether eep inhibit the growth of the test microorganisms or not. for the antimicrobial activity assays, minimum inhibitory  concentrations (mic) were determined by using macrodilution method. the mic values of the most effective propolis (tb) were 2 microg/ml for streptococcus sobrinus and enterococcus faecalis, 4 microg/ml for micrococcus luteus, candida albicans and c. krusei, 8 microg/ml for streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterobacter aerogenes, 16 microg/ml for escherichia coli and c. tropicalis and 32 microg/ml for salmonella typhimurium and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the chemical compositions of eep's were determined by high-temperature high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. the main compounds of four anatolian propolis samples were flavonoids such as pinocembrin, pinostropin, isalpinin, pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine and chrysin. although propolis samples were collected from different regions of anatolia all showed significant antimicrobial activity against the gram positive bacteria and yeasts. propolis can prevent dental caries since it demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms such as streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus and c. albicans, which involves in oral diseases.

TI  == antibacterial screening of anthocyanic and proanthocyanic fractions from cranberry juice.
AB  == the effect of anthocyanin- and proanthocyanidin-rich fractions isolated from cranberry juice was studied for their antibacterial activity against nine bacterial strains. activity was assessed by the agar diffusion assay. staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538 was the only strain to exhibit some susceptibility to four out of 10 anthocyanin-rich fractions tested. a variable susceptibility of s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis atcc 10541, and micrococcus luteus atcc 9341 to proanthocyanidin- rich fractions was also observed. streptococcus mutans strains as well as escherichia coli atcc 10538 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 were not susceptible to any of the cranberry juice samples or fractions at the tested concentrations. there was no clear correlation between gram-positive or gram-negative bacterial susceptibility to cranberry juice. in this work, the role of cranberry juice anthocyanic and proanthocyanic fractions upon bacterial viability is discussed.

TI  == cecropin p1 and novel nematode cecropins: a bacteria-inducible antimicrobial peptide family in the nematode ascaris suum.
AB  == cecropin p1 was first identified as a mammalian antimicrobial peptide isolated from the pig intestine. much research aimed at characterizing this peptide has been reported. recently, the workers who discovered the peptide corrected their original conclusion, and confirmed that this peptide originates in fact from the  pig intestinal parasitic nematode, ascaris suum. in the present study, we carried out a semi-exhaustive search for bacteria-inducible transcripts in a. suum by the cdna subtraction method. the transcripts encoding cecropin p1 and novel ascaris cecropins, designated cecropins p2, p3 and p4, were found to be positively induced factors. chemically synthesized ascaris cecropins were bactericidal against a wide range of microbes, i.e. gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and micrococcus luteus) and gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, serratia marcescens and esherichia coli) bacteria, and were weakly but detectably active against yeasts (saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida albicans). cecropin p1-like sequences were also detected at least in two other species (ascaris lumbricoides and toxocara canis) of the ascarididae. all ascaris cecropin precursors contain an acidic pro-region connected by a tetra-basic cleavage site at the c-terminus. such an acidic pro-region is also reported to be present in the tunicate cecropin-type antimicrobial peptide styelin. on the basis of the evolutionary position of nematodes and tunicates, the ancestral cecropin may have contained the acidic pro-region at the c-terminus.

TI  == antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria included in inoculants for silage  and in silages treated with these inoculants.
AB  == aims: to determine antibacterial activity in lactic acid bacteria (lab) silage inoculants and in wheat and corn silages which were treated with these inoculants. methods and results: wheat and two corn silages were prepared in 0.25 l sealed glass jars. inoculant treatments were prepared for each type of silage with each of 10 lab silage inoculants at inoculation rate of 10(6) cfu g(-1). untreated silages served as controls. antibacterial activity was determined in the inoculants and in their respective silages with micrococcus luteus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. antibacterial activity was detected in nine of the 10 inoculants whereas such activity in the silages varied. control silages did not have antibacterial activity. conclusions: many lab silage inoculants have antibacterial activity and in some cases this activity is imparted on inoculated  silages. significance and impact of the study: this study was conducted as part of a broader research objective, which is to find out how lab silage inoculants enhance ruminant performance. the results of this study indicate that lab silage  inoculants produce antibacterial activity, and therefore, have a potential to inhibit detrimental micro-organisms in the silage or in the rumen.

TI  == [interaction of neomycin with other antibiotics on selected bacterial strains].
AB  == antimicrobial combinations are used most frequently to provide broad-spectrum empirical coverage in the treatment of bacterial infections. however, combination of two antibiotics may not influence their activity, may lead to synergy or antagonism in the activity. neomycin may be combined with one of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, procaine penicillin, gramicidin, bacitracin, polymyxin b, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, and erythromycin in some human and veterinary multiantibiotic drugs distributed in poland. the checkerboard method has been one of the traditional assays for the measurement of antibiotic interactions. the aim of this study was to analyse the activity interaction of neomycin with second antibiotic in multiantibiotic drugs distributed in poland on standards and clinical bacterial strains. checkerboard results for all strains demonstrated synergism for 2.5% of combinations, only for standards strains. in one case salmonella enteritidis, in combination of neomycin with bacitracin, inhibition effect was observed. additive effects were predominant--49%. in 18% neutral effects were shown, but in 26% of combinations fic indexes were not possible to calculate, because of the resistance of clinical strains to the highest concentration of at least one antibiotic. in combination of aminoglycoside (neomycin) with beta-lactams antibiotics (ampicillin, procaine penicillin) in vitro, no synergy was observed for all examined strains. the best results were achieved for combinations of neomycin with peptide antibiotics (polymyxin, gramicidin and bacitracin)--5 for all 6 synergy effect observed.

TI  == resistance of rumen bacteria murein to bovine gastric lysozyme.
AB  == background: lysozymes, enzymes mostly associated with defence against bacterial infections, are mureinolytic. ruminants have evolved a gastric c type lysozyme as a digestive enzyme, and profit from digestion of foregut bacteria, after most dietary components, including protein, have been fermented in the rumen. in this  work we characterized the biological activities of bovine gastric secretions against membranes, purified murein and bacteria. results: bovine gastric extract  (bge) was active against both g+ and g- bacteria, but the effect against gram- bacteria was not due to the lysozyme, since purified bgl had only activity against gram+ bacteria. we were unable to find small pore forming peptides in the bge, and found that the inhibition of gram negative bacteria by bge was due to an artefact caused by acetate. we report for first time the activity of bovine gastric lysozyme (bg lysozyme) against pure bacterial cultures, and the specific  resistance of some rumen gram positive strains to bgl. conclusions: some gram+ rumen bacteria showed resistance to abomasum lysozyme. we discuss the implications of this finding in the light of possible practical applications of such a stable antimicrobial peptide.

TI  == validation of microbial recovery from hydrogen peroxide-sterilized air.
AB  == the use of hydrogen peroxide as a sanitant in isolators and other barrier systems is well documented. to confirm that the isolator maintains a germ-free environment between decontamination cycles, microbiological air monitoring is performed after the sanitation and aeration cycles. in this study, we have shown  that residual levels of hydrogen peroxide as low as 1 ppm can remain in the isolator and inhibit the growth of microorganisms after concentration on agar media. this lingering hydrogen peroxide can make accurate microbiological air monitoring difficult and can even cause false negative test results. to solve this issue, we have developed a new media that can mediate the effects of residual peroxide and prevent false negative test results. initially, catalase was tested as a neutralizing agent but proved not to be efficient enough. instead, 1% pyruvate was added, which was able to tolerate as much as 15 ppm vaporous hydrogen peroxide (vhp) and ensured growth promotion of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans and aspergillus niger. the 1% pyruvate retained its neutralizing activity for micrococcus luteus at up to 100 ppm vhp. raising the pyruvate concentration to 5% pyruvate enabled neutralization of up to 300 ppm vhp, permitting subsequent growth of micrococcus luteus on agar media.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  == background: retinoids such as retinoic acid (ra), retinol (rol) and retinaldehyde (ral) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. aim: to analyse the potential anti-infective  activities of topical rol, ral and ra. methods: microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of rol, ral and ra were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus flavus, propionibacterium acnes, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus hominis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus group b, enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and pseudomonas/klebsiella. in two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% ral or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% ral or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. results: of the three retinoids tested, only ral showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like s. aeureus, micrococcus spp. or  p. acnes. no activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. these results on  reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. mic(50) and mic(90) values for ral were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant s. aureus. the two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with ral had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. in the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2)  for p. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. no resistant bacteria were  found after 2 weeks of topical use. preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of ral is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. conclusion: we have shown that ral differs from parent natural retinoids such as rol and ra in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. this activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the  potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.

TI  == enteric bacteria counteract lipopolysaccharide induction of antimicrobial peptide genes.
AB  == the humoral immunity of drosophila involves the production of antimicrobial peptides, which are induced by evolutionary conserved microbial molecules, like lps. by using drosophila mbn-2 cells, we found that live bacteria, including e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, erwinia carotovora, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, prevented lps from inducing antimicrobial peptide genes, while micrococcus luteus and streptococcus equi did not. the inhibitory effect was seen at bacterial levels from 20 per mbn-2 cell, while antimicrobial peptides were induced at lower bacterial concentrations (< or =2 bacteria per cell) also in the absence of added lps. gel shift experiment suggests that the inhibitory effect is upstream or at the level of the activation of the transcription factor relish, a member of the nf-kappab/rel family. the bacteria have to be in physical contact with the cells, but not phagocytosed, to prevent lps induction. interestingly, the inhibiting mechanism is, at least for e. coli, independent of the type iii secretion system, indicating that the inhibitory mechanism is unrelated to the one earlier described for yopj from yersinia.

TI  == dicynthaurin: an antimicrobial peptide from hemocytes of the solitary tunicate, halocynthia aurantium.
AB  == we isolated a novel antimicrobial peptide, dicynthaurin, from hemocytes of a tunicate, halocynthia aurantium. the native peptide had a mass of approximately 6.2 kda and was composed of two 30-residue monomers without sequence homology to  any previously identified peptides (ilqkavldclkaagsslskaaitaiynkit). most cynthaurin molecules were c-terminally amidated and were linked covalently by a single cystine disulfide bond. when performed in membrane-mimetic environments, circular dichroism studies of dicynthaurin revealed largely alpha-helical conformations. dicynthaurin's broad-spectrum activity encompassed gram-positive (micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa), but not candida albicans, a fungus. although dicynthaurin was purified from a marine invertebrate, its antimicrobial activity was optimal at nacl concentrations below 100 mm. this suggests that the antimicrobial actions of this molecule may take place intracellularly (e.g., within a phagosome) rather than extracellularly.

TI  == protective effects of alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene on para-nonylphenol-induced inhibition of cell growth, cellular respiration and glucose-induced proton extrusion of bacteria.
AB  == para-nonylphenol (np) showed a dose-dependent inhibition against the cell growth  of bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus at 5-100 microm. however, other typical plastic-derived endocrine disruptors such as bisphenol a and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (dehp) did not significantly affect the cell growth of these bacteria at 5-100 microm. the np-induced cell growth inhibition was restored when concomitantly supplemented with lipophilic antioxidants such as alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene, but not  with hydrophilic antioxidants, ascorbic acid and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (egcg). np also suppressed in a dose-dependent manner cellular oxygen consumption and glucose-induced proton extrusion of these bacteria at 10-100 microm. both effects were prevented when added with alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene, but not with ascorbic acid and egcg. the significance of these results is discussed from the viewpoint of environmental microbiology and a possible biochemical mechanism of the inhibitory effect of np is suggested.

TI  == design and synthesis of novel antimicrobial pseudopeptides with selective membrane-perturbation activity.
AB  == by incorporating carbamate bond(s) into a cytolytic peptide, novel pseudopeptides with potent antibacterial activity and low hemolytic activity were synthesized. circular dichroism spectra suggested that the incorporation of carbamate bond(s)  decrease the alpha helical conformation of the peptide in lipid membrane circumstances, which must be regarded as a major factor for the separation of antibacterial activity from cytotoxic activity for mammalian cell. experiments in which dye was released from vesicles indicated that the potent antibacterial activity and low hemolytic activity of the pseudopeptides must be due to their great lipid membrane selectivity. the present result suggest that backbone modifications can be a great tool for developing pseudopeptides with improved biological activity and bioavailability from cytolytic peptides.

TI  == effect of chelators and nisin produced in situ on inhibition and inactivation of  gram negatives.
AB  == the ability of chelators and nisin generated in situ to inhibit and inactivate e. coli and other gram negatives in a model substrate was investigated. the effect of various chelators and different concentrations of exogenous nisin on inhibition of e. coli in broth medium showed that only edta and pyrophosphates were able to cause appreciable inhibition of e. coli by nisin. in a broth where l. lactis ncfb 497 produced nisin in a concentration of 250-300 iu/ml, pyrophosphates were unable to inactivate e. coli. under the same conditions, addition of edta led to inactivation of e. coli at neutral and slightly acidic ph only. a cocktail of strains of e. coli was less sensitive than e. coli atcc 25922 alone. pseudomonas aeruginosa was more sensitive and salmonellae more resistant.  edta also caused a slight reduction in the l. lactis population and its biochemical activity as regards ph drop and acid production. some of the inhibition of e. coli could be ascribed to the physical presence of lactococcus cells rather than their metabolites excreted into the medium. failure to observe  any inhibition in fermented broths at their natural ph (4.0) was ascribed to the  poor chelating power of edta under acid conditions.

TI  == formation and structure of mixed bacterial communities.
AB  == mixed bacterial communities are formed by unrelated bacteria on solid media. mixed bacterial communities on solid media are similar to "classical" colonies and are formed after the growth of a large number of unrelated bacteria simultaneously plated onto a limited area of agar. the morphology of the mixed bacterial communities was similar for different combinations of bacteria and did  not change when the bacteria were plated on different media. different bacterial  strains form zones of individual and mixed growth in the structure of mixed bacterial communities. the results of electron microscopic examination indicate that mixed bacterial communities are isolated from their external environment by  a surface film. the basic part of this film is formed by an elementary membrane.  the membrane of the surface film of mixed bacterial communities is a stable structure occupying a large surface area. the results of this investigation seem  to indicate the existence of a special type of co-operation between different species of bacteria. this type of co-operation may be very important in the regulation of interactions between different bacteria and between bacteria and the environment.

TI  == performance evaluation of disinfectant formulations using poloxamer-hydrogel biofilm-constructs.
AB  == poloxamer f127 is a di-block co-polymer of polyoxyethylene and polyoxypropylene.  aqueous solutions show thermo-reversible gelation, being liquid at temperatures < 15 degrees c and robust gels at temperatures > 15 degrees c. chilled poloxamer solutions (30% w/v) were inoculated with approximately 10(4-5) cfu ml-1 of stationary phase cultures of pseudomonas aeruginosa, ps. fluorescens, pantoea agglomerans, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis or listeria innocua. drops (200 microliters) of the inoculated poloxamers were placed on stainless steel coupons held in petri dishes containing moistened cotton wool and incubated at 30 degrees c for 5 h. all strains grew well giving between 10(6-7) cfu ml-1 at 5-6 h. the cultured gels were readily applied to tests of biocide effectiveness as the stainless steel coupons could be removed and flooded with biocide solution for fixed exposure times. provided that the temperature of the biocide solutions was > 15 degrees c, the integrity of the gels could be maintained during exposure. after exposure, the gels and their supports were removed to separate tubes containing neutralizer solution (< 15 degrees c). the gels rapidly dispersed within 5 min to ensure a complete recovery of the sample population. biofilm-constructs and cell suspensions (10(7) cfu ml-1) were exposed to four commercial disinfectant formulations, based on hypochlorite, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide and a tenside, at recommended use levels. cell suspensions, in the presence of bovine serum albumen (bsa; 0.03% w/v), were subject to a > 5-log kill within 5 min while the killing effected against the biofilm-constructs varied between 0.4 and 2-log reductions. the results indicate a high degree of reproducibility between replicate samples, with patterns of susceptibility varying both as a function of organism, biocide type and concentration. the experiments strongly support the view that poloxamer-constructs are suitable for application in trials and testing of disinfectant formulations.

TI  == in vitro determination of direct antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine in vitro the time required for calcium hydroxide in direct contact with microorganisms to express its antimicrobial effect. the microorganisms used were: micrococcus luteus (atcc-9341), staphylococcus aureus (atcc-6538), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc-25586), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc-27853), escherichia coli, and streptococcus sp. the strains were cultivated in brain heart infusion (bhi), with the exception of f. nucleatum (bhi-pras). pure and mixed suspensions of the microorganisms were prepared. paper cones immersed in these substances were covered with calcium hydroxide paste, and after 0, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h  and 7 days they were transferred to an appropriate medium to observe the growth and multiplication of the microorganisms. incubation was conducted at 37 degrees  c for 48 h, according to the requirements of oxygen of each microorganism. the antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide was shown to occur after 12 h on m. luteus and f. nucleatum, 24 h on streptococcus sp, 48 h on e. coli, and 72 h on s. aureus and p. aeruginosa. mixture ii (m. luteus + streptococcus sp + s. aureus) was sensitive to calcium hydroxide antimicrobial potential after 48 h, whereas mixture i (m. luteus + e. coli + p. aeruginosa), mixture iii (e. coli + p. aeruginosa), and mixture iv (s. aureus + p. aeruginosa) were inactivated after 72 h of exposure.

TI  == detection of extracellular proteases from microorganisms on agar plates.
AB  == we present herein an improved assay for detecting the presence of extracellular proteases from microorganisms on agar plates. using different substrates (gelatin, bsa, hemoglobin) incorporated into the agar and varying the culture medium composition, we were able to detect proteolytic activities from pseudomonas aeruginosa, micrococcus luteus and serratia marcescens as well as the influence that these components displayed in the expression of these enzymes. for all microorganisms tested we found that in agar-bhi or yeast extract medium containing gelatin the sensitivity of proteinase detection was considerably greater than in bsa-agar or hemoglobin-agar. however, when bsa or hemoglobin were added to the culture medium, there was an increase in growth along with a marked  reduction in the amount of proteinase production. in the case of m. luteus the incorporation of glycerol in bhi or yeast extract gelatin-agar induced protease liberation. our results indicate that the technique described here is of value for detecting extracellular proteases directly in the culture medium, by means of a qualitative assay, simple, inexpensive, straight forward method to assess the presence of the proteolytic activity of a given microorganism colony with great freedom in substrate selection.

AB  == the first antibiotic conjugates of vancomycin (1) and siderophore analogues containing spermidine-based catechol ligands (conjugate 11) as well as mixed catechol and hydroxamate ligands (conjugate 13) are described. the design of the  conjugates was based on the earlier observation that conjugation of siderophore components to beta-lactam antibiotics induced active iron transport-mediated drug delivery. the novel conjugates (11 and 13) were synthesized by selective acylation of the primary amino group of 1. preliminary biological studies indicated that siderophore modified vancomycins lost some activity (4- to 16-fold) against gram-positive bacteria relative to vancomycin itself, and were generally similar to vancomycin in activity against gram-negative bacteria under  iron-sufficient conditions. however, under iron-depleted conditions which mimic human serum, conjugate 11 displayed enhanced antibacterial activity against an antibiotic hypersensitive strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == in vivo effects of urease-producing bacteria involved with the pathogenesis of infection-induced urolithiasis on renal urokinase and sialidase activity.
AB  == many hypotheses have been proposed for renal stone formation. it has been argued  that with infection-induced renal stones the hydrolysis of urea by bacterial urease increases urinary ph, with consequent stone formation. unfortunately, this theory is not applicable to the micro-organisms that do not produce urease (e.g.  escherichia coli). it has been recently reported that e. coli reduces the urinary urokinase activity of male rats, but does not influence the urinary sialidase activity. this study has now been expanded to the urease-producing bacteria proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa  and micrococcus luteus. subcutaneous injections with these bacteria were found to significantly (p < 0.003) reduce the uk activity of extrarenally obstructed kidneys. the urease-producing mammalian skin bacterium, m. luteus, was, however,  the exception (p = 0.1079). in contrast to s. epidermidis, p. aeruginosa and m. luteus (p < 0.0213), p. mirabilis and s. aureus had no effect on renal sialidase  activity (p < 0.4047). these results may explain why proteus species are predominant in infection-induced renal stones. according to the urokinase-sialidase hypothesis, a decrease in urinary urokinase activity should increase the uromucoid levels, whilst no effect on the urinary sialidase activity should favour conversion of urinary uromucoid to mineralizable matrix. these conditions may lead to renal stone formation. an increase in urinary ph resulting from urease-producing micro-organisms will increase salt precipitation on the uromucoid. it is thus concluded that urease-producing bacteria may play a double  role in renal stone formation.

AB  == the bactericide quality of different materials containing copper (copper, brass,  brass-sheet) was tested and particularly the effect of humidity and copper-concentration was examined. in first examinations (i. communication) (19)  the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of  different microorganisms (micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa). the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined after defined  exposure times (0, 5, 30, 60, 120 min). the following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. in this examination the results were tested for statistical significance and in parallel experiments the copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials was determined. materials containing copper contaminated with wet hands show a significant bactericide effect after an exposure time of 120 min. the bactericide effect on micrococcus luteus and pseudomonas aeruginosa is inhibited after contamination with dry hands. this results can not be explained by a different copper-concentration on the surfaces  of the materials, because a statistically significant difference of copper-ion concentrations between contamination with wet and dry hands could not be obtained.

TI  == the antimicrobial activity in vitro of chlorhexidine, a mixture of isothiazolinones ('kathon' cg) and cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (ctab).
AB  == chlorehexidine, two 4% chlorhexidine antiseptic handwashes ('bioprep' and 'hibiclens'), cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (ctab) and isothiazolinones ('kathon') were tested against staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris and candida albicans. the activities measured were the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), minimum microbicidal concentration (mmc), rate of kill in water and broth, effect of organic soil, the development of microbial resistance  on continuous exposure and agent bioavailability in media and formulation. 'kathon' was the most active microbistatic agent showing maximal activity at low  concentration, least inactivation by organic soil and media components and the lowest level of development of bacterial resistance. it was synergistic with chlorhexidine against s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa. media, formulation components and organic soil affected the performance of chlorhexidine and ctab. chlorhexidine was more broadly active than ctab but showed a greater reduction in activity in the presence of soil and engendered a greater level of bacterial resistance. it was more rapidly bactericidal to p. aeruginosa and s. marcescens than to s. aureus. stable resistance to chlorhexidine and ctab was developed by p. aeruginosa and s. marcescens, the latter showing the higher level of resistance. chlorhexidine-resistant strains were also resistant to ctab. the antiseptic formulations were more rapidly bactericidal than chlorhexidine alone but were otherwise of comparable activity. mixtures of disinfectants, in particular a combination of chlorhexidine and a preservative level of 'kathon', were more active than single disinfectants. the importance of standardization of  media and test conditions and the use of chemically defined media for accurate and reproducible in-vitro testing of disinfectant activity is emphasized. disinfection kinetics, expressed as time-kill curves, log reduction factors or decimal reduction times were shown to be valuable in differentiating microbistatic from microbicidal activity, showing the effects of dilution and soil on activity and indicating possible different mechanisms of action.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of sugar osazones and anhydro sugars.
AB  == the antimicrobial effect of 14 sugar osazones and anhydro sugars was studied with model strains of micrococcus luteus, bacillus licheniformis, escherichia coli and strains staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from clinical material. the relationship between the structure of these compounds, their solubility in water and 1-octanol and antimicrobial effect was investigated.

TI  == ensifer adhaerens predatory activity against other bacteria in soil, as monitored by indirect phage analysis.
AB  == an indirect phage analysis procedure was used to detect and follow the activity of the bacterial predator ensifer adhaerens in situ in natural soil. the soil was percolated with an aqueous suspension of washed bacterial host cells so that the  e. adhaerens cells naturally present in the soil would multiply in response to the host cells. the natural phage development which ensued against these multiplying e. adhaerens cells in the soil was then monitored by noting plaques which developed when the percolation fluid was plated with laboratory strains of  e. adhaerens on laboratory media. the activities of the other members of the predation system that includes e. adhaerens (streptomyces sp. strain 34 and a myxobacter) could not be monitored directly by phage analysis because phage were  not found for them. indirect monitoring was possible, however, because they were  susceptible to attack by e. adhaerens. in general, the results were in agreement  with previous observations by other methods of the predation sequence. e. adhaerens attacked micrococcus luteus, streptomyces sp. strain 34, and the myxobacter but did not attack several other possible species of hosts. it also did not respond to percolation of the soil with various nutrient solutions. e. adhaerens phage activity was not present in half of the soils percolated with m.  luteus cells. this seemed to reflect too great a phage-host specificity for the technique as regards these soils, because e. adhaerens-like bacteria other than the strains used for plaquing were present in at least some of these soils. although e. adhaerens did not attack escherichia coli or pseudomonas aeruginosa in soil, there was an overproduction of e. adhaerens phage if these bacteria were percolated simultaneously with m. luteus cells. the possibility is discussed that this represents an activation by m. luteus (or by a heat-extractable factor from  it) of other bacterial predators that attack e. coli or p. aeruginosa and that these predators subsequently are themselves attacked by e. adhaerens.

TI  == antimicrobial characteristic of insoluble alkylpyridinium iodide.
AB  == insoluble and soluble alkylpyridinium iodides (c8 to c18) were synthesized. the insoluble agents were quaternized 4-vinylpyridine-divinylbenzene copolymers. the  insoluble agent [c12(50)] that contained 50% divinylbenzene and had a c12 alkyl chain was selected as the most suitable insoluble agent. c12(50) showed poor durability of the antibacterial activity, but c12(50), which had lost the activity, was refreshed by washing with ethanol. this washing became ineffective  after a few cycles of antibacterial treatment and refreshment. such c12(50) recovered the activity upon 1.0 n naoh treatment. the antibacterial activity of c12(50) depended on its surface area. it showed high antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria and also showed activity against gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. but the activities of c12(50) and laurylpyridinium iodide solution were different against some microbes. the antibacterial activities of the agents were investigated against escherichia coli and micrococcus luteus under various conditions. the activity of c12(50) was higher at a higher temperature or at a lower cell concentration. the activity of c12(50) decreased on addition of nacl, glucose, or bovine albumin to the cell suspension or in 0.01 m sodium-potassium phosphate buffer. c12(50) showed less activity when cells were mixed with dead cells or the supernatant of dead cells killed in an autoclave. the mode of action of the laurylpyridinium iodide solution against e. coli and m. luteus was similar to that of c12(50) except for the influence of e. coli cell concentration.

TI  == distribution of membrane-bound monoamine oxidase in bacteria.
AB  == the distribution of membrane-bound monoamine oxidase in 30 strains of various bacteria was studied. monoamine oxidase was determined by using an ammonia-selective electrode; analyses were sensitive and easy to perform. the enzyme was found in some strains of the family enterobacteriaceae, such as klebsiella, enterobacter, escherichia, salmonella, serratia, and proteus. among strains of other families of bacteria tested, only pseudomonas aeruginosa ifo 3901, micrococcus luteus ifo 12708, and brevibacterium ammoniagenes iam 1641 had  monoamine oxidase activity. in all of these bacteria except b. ammoniagenes, monoamine oxidase was induced by tyramine and was highly specific for tyramine, octopamine, dopamine, and norepinephrine. the enzyme in two strains oxidized histamine or benzylamine. correlations between the distributions of membrane-bound monoamine oxidase and arylsulfatase synthesized in the presence of tyramine were discussed.
