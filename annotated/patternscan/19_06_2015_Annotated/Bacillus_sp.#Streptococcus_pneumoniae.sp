TI  == four new tetramic acid and one new furanone derivatives from the plant endophytic fungus neopestalotiopsis sp.
AB  == four new tetramic acid analogues neopestalotins a-d (1-4), one new furanone derivative neopestalotin e (6), and the known compound hymenosetin have been isolated from the solid cultures of the plant endophytic fungus neopestalotiopsis sp. the structures of the new compounds were determined mainly by nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) experiments. the absolute configurations of 1 and 2 were assigned by circular dichroism (cd) data, whereas those of 3 and 4 were deduced by a combination of cd and heteronuclear long range coupling (hetloc) data. compound 2 showed modest antimicrobial activity against the gram-positive bacteria, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus col, and streptococcus pneumoniae.

TI  == recombinant expression and functional analysis of proteases from streptococcus pneumoniae, bacillus anthracis, and yersinia pestis.
AB  == background: uncharacterized proteases naturally expressed by bacterial pathogens  represents important topic in infectious disease research, because these enzymes  may have critical roles in pathogenicity and cell physiology. it has been observed that cloning, expression and purification of proteases often fail due to their catalytic functions which, in turn, cause toxicity in the e. coli heterologous host. results: in order to address this problem systematically, a modified pipeline of our high-throughput protein expression and purification platform was developed. this included the use of a specific e. coli strain, bl21(de3) plyss to tightly control the expression of recombinant proteins and various expression vectors encoding fusion proteins to enhance recombinant protein solubility. proteases fused to large fusion protein domains, maltosebinding protein (mbp), sp-mbp which contains signal peptide at the n-terminus of mbp, disulfide oxidoreductase (dsba) and glutathione s-transferase  (gst) improved expression and solubility of proteases. overall, 86.1% of selected protease genes including hypothetical proteins were expressed and purified using  a combination of five different expression vectors. to detect novel proteolytic activities, zymography and fluorescence-based assays were performed and the protease activities of more than 46% of purified proteases and 40% of hypothetical proteins that were predicted to be proteases were confirmed. conclusions: multiple expression vectors, employing distinct fusion tags in a high throughput pipeline increased overall success rates in expression, solubility and purification of proteases. the combinatorial functional analysis of the purified proteases using fluorescence assays and zymography confirmed their function.

TI  == rational design of a plasmid origin that replicates efficiently in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == background: most plasmids replicate only within a particular genus or family. methodology/principal findings: here we describe an engineered high copy number expression vector, pbav1k-t5, that produces varying quantities of active reporter proteins in escherichia coli, acinetobacter baylyi adp1, agrobacterium tumefaciens, (all gram-negative), streptococcus pneumoniae, leifsonia shinshuensis, peanibacillus sp. s18-36 and bacillus subtilis (gram-positive). conclusions/significance: our results demonstrate the efficiency of pbav1k-t5 replication in different bacterial species, thereby facilitating the study of proteins that don't fold well in e. coli and pathogens not amenable to existing genetic tools.

TI  == evaluation of the antibacterial activity of the methylene chloride extract of miconia ligustroides, isolated triterpene acids, and ursolic acid derivatives.
AB  == the methylene chloride extract of miconia ligustroides (dc.) naudin (melastomataceae), the isolated compounds ursolic and oleanolic acids and a mixture of these acids, and ursolic acid derivatives were evaluated against the following microorganisms: bacillus cereus (atcc 14579), vibrio cholerae (atcc 9458), salmonella choleraesuis (atcc 10708), klebsiella pneumoniae (atcc 10031),  and streptococcus pneumoniae (atcc 6305). the microdilution method was used for determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) during evaluation of  the antibacterial activity. the methylene chloride extract showed no activity against the selected microorganisms. ursolic acid was active against b. cereus, showing a mic value of 20 microg/ml. oleanolic acid was effective against b. cereus and s. pneumoniae with a mic of 80 microg/ml in both cases. the mixture of triterpenes, ursolic and oleanolic acids, did not enhance the antimicrobial activity. however, the acetyl and methyl ester derivatives, prepared from ursolic acid, increased the inhibitory activity for s. pneumoniae.

TI  == substrate specificity of streptococcal unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolases for sulfated glycosaminoglycan.
AB  == unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase (ugl) categorized into the glycoside hydrolase family 88 catalyzes the hydrolytic release of an unsaturated glucuronic acid from glycosaminoglycan disaccharides, which are produced from mammalian extracellular  matrices through the beta-elimination reaction of polysaccharide lyases. here, we show enzyme characteristics of pathogenic streptococcal ugls and structural determinants for the enzyme substrate specificity. the putative genes for ugl and phosphotransferase system for amino sugar, a component of glycosaminoglycans, are assembled into a cluster in the genome of pyogenic and hemolytic streptococci such as streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes, which produce extracellular hyaluronate lyase as a virulent factor. the ugls of these three streptococci were overexpressed in escherichia coli cells, purified, and characterized. streptococcal ugls degraded unsaturated hyaluronate  and chondroitin disaccharides most efficiently at approximately ph 5.5 and 37 degrees c. distinct from bacillus sp. gl1 ugl, streptococcal ugls preferred sulfated substrates. dna microarray and western blotting indicated that the enzyme was constitutively expressed in s. agalactiae cells, although the expression level increased in the presence of glycosaminoglycan. the crystal structure of s. agalactiae ugl (sagugl) was determined at 1.75 a resolution by x-ray crystallography. sagugl adopts alpha(6)/alpha(6)-barrel structure as a basic scaffold similar to bacillus ugl, but the arrangement of amino acid residues in the active site differs between the two. sagugl arg-236 was found to  be one of the residues involved in its activity for the sulfated substrate through structural comparison and site-directed mutagenesis. this is the first report on the structure and function of streptococcal ugls.

TI  == adrenal gland hemorrhage in patients with fatal bacterial infections.
AB  == a wide spectrum of adrenal gland pathology is seen during bacterial infections. hemorrhage is particularly associated with meningococcemia, while abscesses have  been described with several neonatal infections. we studied adrenal gland histopathology of 65 patients with bacterial infections documented in a variety of tissues by using immunohistochemistry. the infections diagnosed included neisseria meningitidies, group a streptococcus, rickettsia rickettsii, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, ehrlichia sp., bacillus anthracis, leptospira sp., clostridium sp., klebsiella sp., legionella sp., yersinia pestis, and treponema pallidum. bacteria were detected in the adrenal of 40 (61%) cases. adrenal hemorrhage was present in 39 (60%) cases. bacteria or bacterial antigens were observed in 31 (79%) of the cases with adrenal hemorrhage including 14 with n. meningitidis, four with r. rickettsii, four with s. pneumoniae, three with group a streptococcus, two with s. aureus, two with b. anthracis, one with t. pallidum, and one with legionella sp. bacterial antigens were observed in nine of 26 non-hemorrhagic adrenal glands that showed inflammatory foci (four cases), edema (two cases), congestion (two cases), or necrosis (one case). hemorrhage is the most frequent adrenal gland pathology observed in fatal bacterial infections. bacteria and bacterial antigens are frequently seen in adrenal glands with hemorrhage and may play a pathogenic role. although n. meningitidis is the most frequent bacteria associated with adrenal gland pathology, a broad collection of bacteria can also cause adrenal lesions.

TI  == pulmonary collectins in innate immunity of the lung.
AB  == pulmonary collectins, hydrophilic surfactant proteins a and d (sp-a and sp-d), have been implicated in the regulation of pulmonary host defence and inflammation. sp-a and sp-d directly interact with a variety of microorganisms including bacteria and viruses, and attenuate the growth of gram-negative bacteria, histoplasma capsulatum and mycoplasma pneumoniae. the collectins are thought to contribute to bacterial clearance. these lectins augment the phagocytosis of the bacteria by macrophages. sp-a serves as an opsonin and stimulates the uptake of bacteria and bacillus calmette-guerin through a c1q receptor- and an sp-r210-mediated processes. the collectin also stimulates fcr- and cr1-mediated phagocytosis by activating the macrophages. in addition, sp-a and sp-d directly interact with macrophages and enhance the phagocytosis of streptococcus pneumoniae and mycobacterium by increasing cell surface localization of the phagocytic receptors, scavenger receptor a and mannose receptor. the collectins also modulate pulmonary inflammation. sp-a and sp-d bind to cell surface receptors including toll-like receptors, sirpalpha and calreticulin/cd91, and attenuate or enhance inflammation in a microbial ligand-specific manner. in this article we review the immunomodulatory functions  of sp-a and sp-d and their possible mechanisms in direct actions on microbes, macrophage phagocytosis and modulation of inflammation.

TI  == [etiology of community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompetent adults].
AB  == in an ideal clinical setting, empiric antimicrobial treatment prescribed in adult community acquired pneumonia (cap) should be based on national etiological surveillance and in vitro susceptibility assays. available information about etiology in ambulatory patients and intensive care unit (icu) patients is scarce, compared to information obtained in hospitalized patients. in studies designed to explore the etiology of pneumonia, no microorganism is detected in 40-50% of patients, a fact that represents limited yields in diagnostic methods. in all settings, streptococcus pneumoniae is the main respiratory pathogen recovered in  adults cap, being responsible of about 16% of cases among ambulatory patients and about 22% of those admitted to hospital and icu. about one third of cases are caused by a small group of microorganisms: haemophilus influenzae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae, respiratory viruses, staphylococcus aureus, gramnegative bacillus, legionella sp; each one is isolated in less than 10% of cases. in general, microorganism distribution varies scarcely in the following attending settings: ambulatory patients, common wards and icu. an exception is represented by a higher frequency of gram negative bacillus, s. aureus and legionella sp in icu, and of c. pneumoniae in the ambulatory setting. in chile, cap etiology in hospitalized adult patients is similar to foreign reports; no systematic information has been collected about the etiology in neither ambulatory patients nor in severe cap.

TI  == characterization of a 3944 da bacteriocin, produced by enterococcus mundtii st15, with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == strain st15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, propionibacterium sp., clostridium tyrobutyricum, acinetobacter baumanii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus caprinus. bacteriocin st15 is inactivated by proteinase k, pronase, pepsin, protease and triton x-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, triton x-100, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta. no change in activity was recorded after 2 h at ph values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100  degrees c for 90 min. activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees  c for 20 min. the mode of activity is bactericidal. the highest level of activity (51200 au ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in mrs broth, ph 6.5. bacteriocin st15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for enterococcus spp. by being active against gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == a global approach to identify novel broad-spectrum antibacterial targets among proteins of unknown function.
AB  == attempted allelic replacement of 144 streptococcus pneumoniae open reading frames of previously uncharacterized function led to the identification of 36 genes essential for growth under laboratory conditions. of these, 14 genes (obg, spoiiij2, trmu, yaca, yacm, ydic, ydie, yjbn, ynes, yphc, ysxc, ytag, yloi and yxeh4) were also essential in staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae or escherichia coli, 2 genes (yrrk and ydib) were only essential in h. influenzae as well as s. pneumoniae and 8 genes were necessary for growth of s.pneumoniae and s. aureus and did not have a homolog in h. influenzae(murd2, ykqc, ylqf, yqeh, ytgp, yybq) or were not essential in that organism (yqel, yhct). the proteins encoded by these genes could represent good targets for novel antibiotics covering different therapeutic profiles. the putative functions of some of these  essential proteins, inferred by bioinformatic analysis, are presented. four mutants, with deletions of loci not essential for in vitro growth, were found to  be severely attenuated in a murine respiratory tract infection model, suggesting  that not all targets for antibacterial therapeutics are revealed by simple in vitro essentiality testing. the results of our experiments together with those collated from previously reported studies including bacillus subtilis, e. coli and mycoplasma sp. demonstrate that gene conservation amongst bacteria does not necessarily indicate that essentiality in one organism can be extrapolated to others. moreover, this study demonstrates that different experimental procedures  can produce apparently contradictory results.

TI  == interactions between penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) and two novel classes of  pbp inhibitors, arylalkylidene rhodanines and arylalkylidene iminothiazolidin-4-ones.
AB  == several non-beta-lactam compounds were active against various gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. the mics of arylalkylidene rhodanines and arylalkylidene iminothiazolidin-4-ones were lower than those of ampicillin and cefotaxime for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus mi339 and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium ef12. several compounds were found to inhibit the cell wall synthesis of s. aureus and the last two steps of peptidoglycan biosynthesis catalyzed by ether-treated cells of escherichia coli or cell wall membrane preparations of bacillus megaterium. the effects of the arylalkylidene rhodanines and arylalkylidene iminothiazolidin-4-one derivatives on e. coli pbp 3 and pbp 5, streptococcus pneumoniae pbp 2xs (pbp 2x from a penicillin-sensitive strain) and pbp 2xr (pbp 2x from a penicillin-resistant strain), low-affinity pbp 2a of s. aureus, and the actinomadura sp. strain r39 and streptomyces sp. strain r61 dd-peptidases were studied. some of the compounds exhibited inhibitory activities in the 10 to 100 microm concentration range. the  inhibition of pbp 2xs by several of them appeared to be noncompetitive. the dissociation constant for the best inhibitor (ki = 10 microm) was not influenced  by the presence of the substrate.

TI  == a novel member of glycoside hydrolase family 88: overexpression, purification, and characterization of unsaturated beta-glucuronyl hydrolase of bacillus sp. gl1.
AB  == unsaturated beta-glucuronyl hydrolase of bacillus sp. gl1 catalyzes the hydrolytic release of unsaturated glucuronic acids from oligosaccharides produced through the reactions of polysaccharide lyases such as gellan, xanthan, hyaluronate, and chondroitin lyases. an overexpression system for the enzyme was  constructed in escherichia coli cells involving regulation of the enzyme gene under the t7 promoter and terminator. the expression level of the enzyme in e. coli cells was 250-fold higher than that in bacillus sp. gl1 cells. the enzyme expressed in e. coli cells was purified and characterized. the optimal ph and temperature, and substrate specificity of the purified enzyme were similar to those of the native enzyme from bacillus sp. gl1 cells, although the enzyme expressed in e. coli cells underwent self-assembly into polymeric forms through the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. circular dichroism analysis indicated that the secondary structure of the enzyme was rich in alpha-helices. genes showing high identity (over 40% identity) with that of the enzyme were found in the genomes of some pathogenic bacteria, such as streptococcus pyogenes  and streptococcus pneumoniae, which cause serious diseases (e.g., meningitis and  pneumonia). therefore, the enzyme of bacillus sp. gl1 and the streptococcal proteins form a new glycoside hydrolase family, 88.

TI  == rho is not essential for viability or virulence in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == we have identified the gene for transcription termination factor rho in staphylococcus aureus. deletion of rho in s. aureus reveals that it is not essential for viability or virulence. we also searched the available bacterial genomic sequences for homologs of rho and found that it is broadly distributed and highly conserved. exceptions include streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus  pyogenes, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma pneumoniae, ureaplasma urealyticum, and synechocystis sp. strain pcc6803, all of which appear not to possess a rho homolog. complementation studies indicate that s. aureus rho possesses the same activity as escherichia coli rho and that the rho inhibitor bicyclomycin is active against s. aureus rho. our results explain the lack of activity of bicyclomycin against many gram-positive bacteria and raise the possibility that the essentiality of rho may be the exception rather than the rule.

TI  == comb, a novel competence gene required for natural transformation of acinetobacter sp. bd413: identification, characterization, and analysis of growth-phase-dependent regulation.
AB  == here we describe five tandemly arranged and converging orfs in acinetobacter sp.  bd413, namely lytb, orfy, orfx, comb, and orfz, located upstream of the previously identified competence gene comc. the n-termini of the deduced proteins orfy and comb exhibit the conserved endopeptidase cleavage motifs of prepilin proteins; the deduced protein comb is similar to type iv pilins. lytb is similar  to the escherichia coli lytb, which has been implicated in the stringent response. no homologues of orfx, orfy and orfz could be identified. a mutation in orfy or orfz led to 100-fold reduced transformation frequencies and a mutation in comb resulted in a non-competent phenotype. disruption of lytb did not affect the natural transformation phenotype. complementation studies clearly demonstrated that comb is involved in natural transformation, whereas the transformation-deficient phenotypes of orfy and orfz mutants were due to polar effects on comb and comc, respectively. analyses of the twitching motility phenotype and of the ultrastructure of the noncompetent comb mutant suggested that the competence gene comb is not essential for the biogenesis of type iv pili and expression of the type iv pili-associated property of twitching motility. transcriptional fusions between comb and a promoter-free lacz gene were constructed, and analysis of growth-phase-dependent transcription revealed increased expression of comb during prolonged exponential and stationary phases.

TI  == the biological activity of selected cyclic dipeptides.
AB  == cyclic dipeptides are widely used as models for larger peptides because of their  simplicity and limited conformational freedom. some cyclic dipeptides have been shown to be antiviral, antibiotic and anti-tumour. the aim of this study was to determine the biological activity of four cyclic dipeptides synthesized in this laboratory: cyclo(l-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl), cyclo(l-tyrosyl-l-prolyl), cyclo(l-tryptophanyl-l-prolyl) and cyclo(l-tryptophanyl-l-tryptophanyl). the enhancement or inhibition of calcium channels in ventricular myocytes from rats and delayed-rectifier potassium channels in ventricular myocytes from guinea-pigs were determined by use of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. the induction of  differentiation in ht-29 cells was assessed by assaying for an increase in the expression of alkaline phosphatase. antibiotic properties against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilus and streptococcus sp. were determined by use of the kirby-bauer disc-diffusion assay. results from these assays indicate that the cyclic dipeptides have biological activity in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. three of  the dipeptides block cation channels in ventricular myocytes and all increase the expression of alkaline phosphatase. all the dipeptides have concentration-dependent antibacterial properties. these results suggest that with increased solubility the cyclic dipeptides might have potential as muscle relaxants, anti-tumour compounds and antibiotics.

TI  == phosphorylcholine-containing antigens in bacteria from the mouth and respiratory  tract.
AB  == phosphorylcholine (pc)-containing antigens were sought in 269 bacterial isolates  from the mouth and respiratory tract by an enzyme immunoassay method. only 41 (15%) isolates were pc-positive and of these 29 (70%) were strains of haemophilus influenzae. other species that produced positive results included two of five isolates of gemella haemolysans, two of five isolates of micrococcus spp., and a  single strain each of bacillus sp., corynebacterium jeikeium, lactococcus sp. and h. parainfluenzae. the presence of pc-containing antigens in h. influenzae may be an important source of cross-reaction in antigen detection techniques that detect the c-polysaccharide antigen of streptococcus pneumoniae in respiratory specimens and would result in false positive results.
