TI  - Conjunctival flora of clinically normal and diseased turtles and tortoises.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In captive breed turtles and tortoises conjunctival disease is common. Our aim was to investigate the bacterial and fungal flora present in the eyes of healthy and pathological chelonians and to compare findings in turtles with those in tortoises. RESULTS: Samples were taken from the conjunctival sacs of 34, diseased and healthy, chelonians (18 tortoises and 16 turtles) and submitted to bacterial and fungal investigation. All samples showed bacterial growth. Thirteen animals (38%), harboured a single bacterial species as sole isolate and twenty-one animals (62%) harboured more than one species. Detection of multiple bacterial infection was clearly greater in tortoises compared to turtles. Most frequently isolated bacterial species were Bacillus spp. (13 isolates), Staphylococcus xylosus (10 isolates), Sphingomonas paucimobilis (6 isolates), Staphylococcus sciuri and Aeromonas hydrophila/caviae (each 5 isolates), Ochrobactrum anthropi (3 isolates), Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas luteola (each 2 isolates). Only one isolate of Kocuria varians/rosea, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus auricularis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus lentus, Morganella morganii, Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella pneumotropica/haemolytica, Proteus spp., Pseudomonas putida, Salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Vibrio parahaemolyticus was evidenced. The presence in 8 animals of Mycoplasma spp. and in 1 animal with severe conjunctivitis of Chlamydia spp. was detected by PCR. Candida spp. was also isolated from two healthy animals. CONCLUSIONS: A clear predominance of Gram positive isolates in tortoises and Gram negative isolates in turtles was found. However, we cannot ascribe the observed difference to the diversity of animal species, as other factors, including especially different characteristics of the living environments, may play a role. Almost all bacterial species isolated may have clinical significance, mostly as opportunistic pathogens, both for humans and animals. That chelonians are often carrier of bacteria with zoonotic potential is a well-known fact, in particular with regard to Salmonella spp. Therefore, it is not surprising the detection of a strain of Salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae in the eye of one of the animals tested. Worthy of note is the finding of Chlamydia spp. in a severe case of conjunctivitis, though we cannot epidemiologically assess a cause-effect relationship between presence of chlamydia and disease.
TI  - Pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in Seri Kembangan, Malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  - This study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around Seri Kembangan, a city in Malaysia. Pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of OTUs with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. Taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) observed across all samples. The highest appearance frequencies (100%) were OTUs closely related to Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas sp. and Pseudomonas putida. Several OTUs were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including Bacillus cereus, Cronobacter sakazaki, Cronobacter turisensis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Hafnia alvei, Kurthia gibsonii, Salmonella bongori, Salmonella enterica, Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella tyhpi, Salmonella typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. The condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. Regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.
TI  - Efficacy of multiple metals against copper-resistant bacterial strains.
AB  - AIMS: The antibacterial efficacy of zeolites containing copper (Cu) or silver (Ag) ions or a combination was assessed against several reported copper-resistant (Cu(R)) bacterial strains. METHODS AND RESULTS: Comparison strains were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection that had no documented metal resistance. Reductions in bacterial populations were determined after exposure time intervals of 3, 6 and 24 h. All three Cu(R) strains of Salmonella enterica exhibited resistance to Cu, Ag and Cu/Ag after three and 6 h of exposure. Both the Cu(R) and comparison strain of Enterococcus faecium were resistant to both metals and the metal combination. Cu(R) Pseudomonas putida was significantly reduced by all zeolites within 3 h. The Cu(R) Escherichia coli strain was more sensitive to Cu, but more resistant to Ag than the comparison strain; however, significant reductions were achieved within 3 h with both Cu and Cu/Ag, and within 24 h with Ag. CONCLUSIONS: Some strains with reported resistance to Cu were also resistant to Ag, suggestive of a shared resistance mechanism such as an indiscriminate Cu efflux pump. Ent. faecium appears to have innate resistance to both metals. In general, Ent. faecium was the most resistant species to the individual metals and the combination of metals, Ps. putida the least resistant, and the Salmonella strains were more resistant than E. coli. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Several of the comparison strains with no reported copper resistance were resistant to one or both metals. This may call into question the methods for determining bacterial metal resistance, which typically use nutrient-rich media containing metals to assess the ability of the bacteria to grow in comparison with a wild-type strain. Nevertheless, all the Cu(R) strains evaluated in this study, with the exception of Ent. faecium, were reduced using the Cu and Ag zeolite combination.
TI  - [Study of mutagenic activity of hexachlorocyclohexane and products of its microbial degradation].
AB  - Mutagenic activity of hexachlorcyclohexane (HCH) was investigated. As is known, gamma-isomer of HCH has insecticidal properties. The strains of microorganisms of genera Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Bacillus decomposing HCH into 46.3-86.7% from initial quantity have been selected. Microbial HCH destruction by investigated strains made changes of pesticide genetic activity: in most cases in condition of intermediate action the quantity of mutations S. typhimurium TA 100 and S. typhimurium TA 98 have decreased 1.2-1.5 times in comparison with initial substance. In a single case after HCH transformation by strain P. putida 1 the intermediates have increased the mutation frequency 1.9 times. The obtained results are necessary for selection of the most promising strains-decomposers as a basis of biopreparations for remediation of HCH polluted soils.
TI  - Mutagenicity and genotoxicity of acid yellow 17 and its biodegradation products.
AB  - Acid yellow 17 (AY17), a very important commercial azo dye used in the textile industry, was degraded by Pseudomonas putida mt-2 at a concentration of up to 200 mg/L. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of the biodegradation media revealed the presence of 4-aminobenzensulfonic acid (4-ABS) derived from AY17 azoreduction, which attests the expression of an azoreductase by this bacterium. This amine was identified only in the medium of static incubation, which is consistent with its biotransformation under shaken incubation (i.e., aerobic conditions). The mutagenicity of AY17 and its biodegradation products was evaluated by using Salmonella typhimurium TA102 and TA104. No mutagenicity was observed in the presence or absence of a metabolic activation system (S9). In addition, the ability of tested compounds to induce DNA damage in vitro with the DNA strand scission assay was evaluated. Results showed that only static decolorization culture of AY17 showed a significant ability to induce the pKS plasmid DNA opening. The present study showed that P. putida mt-2, cultivated under aerobic conditions, was able to decolorize, and especially to detoxify, AY17.
TI  - Cyclopropane fatty acids are involved in organic solvent tolerance but not in acid stress resistance in Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E.
AB  - Bacterial membranes constitute the first physical barrier against different environmental stresses. Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E accumulates cyclopropane fatty acids (CFAs) in the stationary phase of growth. In this strain the cfaB gene encodes the main cyclopropane synthase responsible of the synthesis of CFAs, and its expression is mediated by RNA polymerase with sigma factor sigma(38). We generated a cfaB mutant of P. putida DOT-T1E and studied its response to solvents, acid pH and other stress conditions such as temperature changes, high osmolarity and the presence of antibiotics or heavy metals in the culture medium. A CfaB knockout mutant was more sensitive to solvent stress than the wild-type strain, but in contrast to Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, the P. putida cfaB mutant was as tolerant to acid shock as the wild-type strain. The cfaB mutant was also as tolerant as the parental strain to a number of drugs, antibiotics and other damaging agents.
TI  - Studying the mechanism of RNA separations using RNA chromatography and its application in the analysis of ribosomal RNA and RNA:RNA interactions.
AB  - DNA/RNA chromatography presents a versatile platform for the analysis of nucleic  acids. Although the mechanism of separation of double stranded (ds) DNA fragments is largely understood, the mechanism by which RNA is separated appears more complicated. To further understand the separation mechanisms of RNA using ion pair reverse phase liquid chromatography, we have analysed a number of dsRNA and single stranded (ss) RNA fragments. The high-resolution separation of dsRNA was observed, in a similar manner to dsDNA under non-denaturing conditions. Moreover, the high-resolution separation of ssRNA was observed at high temperatures (75 degrees C) in contrast to ssDNA. It is proposed that the presence of duplex regions/secondary structures within the RNA remain at such temperatures, resulting in high-resolution RNA separations. The retention time of the nucleic acids reflects the relative hydrophobicity, through contributions of the nucleic sequence and the degree of secondary structure present. In addition, the analysis of RNA using such approaches was extended to enable the discrimination of bacterial 16S rRNA fragments and as an aid to conformational analysis of RNA. RNA:RNA interactions of the human telomerase RNA component (hTR) were analysed in conjunction with the incorporation of Mg2+ during chromatography. This novel chromatographic procedure permits analysis of the temperature dependent formation of dimeric RNA species.
TI  - Nitrous oxide emission and microbial community in the rhizosphere of nodulated soybeans during the late growth period.
AB  - We examined N(2)O emissions from the rhizosphere of field-grown soybeans during the late growth stage (99-117 days after sowing). Marked emissions were detected from the nodulated root systems of field-grown soybeans, whereas a non-nodulating soybean mutant showed no emission. Degraded nodules exclusively generated the N(2)O. A culture-independent analysis of microbial communities showed Bradyrhizobium sp., Acidvorax facilis, Salmonella enterica, Xanthomonas sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas putida, Fusarium sp., nematodes, and other protozoans to be more abundant in the degraded nodules, suggesting that some of these organisms participate in the N(2)O emission process in the soybean rhizosphere.
TI  - In vitro study of DNA damage induced by acid orange 52 and its biodegradation derivatives.
AB  - Mutagenicity of acid orange 52 (AO52) and its degradation products by Pseudomonas putida mt-2 was evaluated with the use of Salmonella Typhimurium TA102 and TA104 with and without the metabolic activation system (S9). No mutagenicity was observed in the absence of S9 and in the presence of S9 for biodegradation under shaking conditions, but it increased significantly in the presence of S9 after biodegradation under static conditions. In addition, the ability of tested compounds to induce DNA damage in vitro was evaluated with the DNA strand scission assay. The toxicity generated by the pure azo dye and the corresponding azoreduction products (4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid and N,N'-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine) were compared. We suggest that the mutagenicity mechanism of these molecules occurs through free radical generation processes. In this study, we demonstrate that P. putida mt-2 incubated under aerobic conditions undergoes catabolism that enables it to degrade AO52 completely and, especially, to detoxify the dye mixtures.
TI  - Attachment of ampicillin to expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene): surface reactions leading to inhibition of microbial growth.
AB  - The broad spectrum antibiotic, ampicillin (AM), was reacted to expanded poly (tetrafluoroethylene) (ePTFE) surfaces and resulted in the formation of antimicrobial surfaces effective against gram-positive, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Enterococcus faecalis, and gram-negative, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Salmonella enterica bacteria. These ePTFE surface modifications were accomplished by utilization of microwave maleic anhydride (MA) plasma reactions leading to the formation of acid groups, followed by amidation reactions of heterofunctional NH 2/COOH-terminated polyethylene glycol (PEG). The final step, the attachment of AM to the PEG spacer, was achieved by amidation reactions between COOH-terminated PEG and NH 2 groups of AM. This approach protects the COOH-AM functionality and diminishes the possibility of hydrolysis of the antimicrobial active portion of AM. These studies also show that approximately 90% of AM molecules are still covalently attached to PEG-MA-ePTFE surfaces after exposure to the bacteria solutions. Even after a 24 h period, the AM volume concentration changes only from 2.25 to 2.04 microg/m3, and depending upon the bacteria type, the bacteria suspensions containing AM-PEG-MA-ePTFE specimens retain 85-99% of their initial optical density.
TI  - Disinfectant test against monoculture and mixed-culture biofilms composed of technological, spoilage and pathogenic bacteria: bactericidal effect of essential oil and hydrosol of Satureja thymbra and comparison with standard acid-base sanitizers.
AB  - AIMS: To assess the antimicrobial action of three natural-derived products (essential oil, decoction and hydrosol of Satureja thymbra) against biofilms, composed of useful, spoilage and pathogenic bacteria (formed as monoculture or/and mixed-culture), and to compare their efficiency with three standard acid and alkaline chemical disinfectants. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two acids (hydrochloric and lactic, pH 3), one alkali (sodium hydroxide, pH 11), the essential oil of S. thymbra (1% v/v) and the two by-products of the essential oil purification procedure (the decoction and the hydrosol fraction of essential oil, 100%), were tested against biofilms formed by five bacterial species, either as monospecies, or as mixed-culture of all species. The tested bacterial species were Staphylococcus simulans and Lactobacillus fermentum (useful technological bacteria), Pseudomonas putida (spoilage bacterium), Salmonella enterica and Listeria monocytogenes (pathogenic bacteria). Biofilms were left to be formed on stainless steel coupons for 5 days at 16 degrees C, before the application of disinfection treatments, for 60 and 180 min. The disinfection efficiency was evaluated by detaching the remaining viable biofilm cells and enumerating them by agar plating, as well as by automated conductance measurements (using Rapid Automated Bacterial Impedance Technique). Both these methods revealed that the essential oil and the hydrosol of S. thymbra exhibited a strong antimicrobial action against both monospecies and mixed-culture biofilms. Surprisingly, the efficiency of the other three acid-base disinfectants was not adequate, although a long antimicrobial treatment was applied (180 min). CONCLUSIONS: The essential oil of S. thymbra (1%), as well as its hydrosol fraction (100%), presents sufficient bactericidal effect on bacterial biofilms formed on stainless steel. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Use of natural antimicrobial agents could provide alternative or supplemented ways for the disinfection of microbial-contaminated industrial surfaces.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of flavonoids extracted from bergamot (Citrus bergamia Risso) peel, a byproduct of the essential oil industry.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the antimicrobial properties of flavonoid-rich fractions derived from bergamot peel, a byproduct from the Citrus fruit processing industry and the influence of enzymatic deglycosylation on their activity against different bacteria and yeast. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bergamot ethanolic fractions were tested against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, Salmonella enterica), Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria innocua, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactococcus lactis) and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Bergamot fractions were found to be active against all the Gram-negative bacteria tested, and their antimicrobial potency increased after enzymatic deglycosylation. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the fractions and the pure flavonoids, neohesperidin, hesperetin (aglycone), neoeriocitrin, eriodictyol (aglycone), naringin and naringenin (aglycone), were found to be in the range 200 to 800 microg ml(-1). The interactions between three bergamot flavonoids were also evaluated. CONCLUSION: The enzyme preparation Pectinase 62L efficiently converted common glycosides into their aglycones from bergamot extracts, and this deglycosylation increased the antimicrobial potency of Citrus flavonoids. Pairwise combinations of eriodictyol, naringenin and hesperetin showed both synergistic and indifferent interactions that were dependent on the test indicator organism. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Bergamot peel is a potential source of natural antimicrobials that are active against Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Use of a PNA probe to block DNA-mediated PCR product formation in prokaryotic RT-PCR.
AB  - A novel method eliminating DNA-mediated PCR product formation in reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) amplification of specific RNA sequences is described. The method exploits the higher melting temperature values of peptide nucleic acid (PNA)/DNA duplexes compared with DNA/DNA duplexes by binding a sequence-specific PNA probe to a genomic sequence immediately overlapping one of the PCR-primer attachment sites within the sequence of interest. Hybridization of the blocking probe precludes primer attachment to DNA without affecting attachment of the same primer to the reverse transcription-generated cDNA sequence. A four-step PCR cycle is used that allows the PNA probe to hybridize to the DNA strand at a higher temperature just prior to the primer annealing step.
TI  - [Cloning, sequence analysis and expression of alanine racemase gene in Pseudomonas putida].
AB  - Two distinct alanine racemase genes from Pseudomonas putida 200 were cloned and sequenced. DadX encodes a peptide of 357 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 38.82kDa. The putative product of alr gene is a peptide of 409 amino acids with molecular weight of 44.182kDa. A homology comparison revealed identities of 96.64%, 71.99%, 44.88% and 47.37% of the DadX alanine racemase to those from P. putida KT2440, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, respectively. The amino acids sequence deduced from alr gene showed the homologies of 94.38%, 22.89%, 25.72% and 26.44% to those from the microorganisms above, respectively. Two motifs believed essential to the enzyme activity are found both in DadX and Alr, such as pyridoxal-5'-phosphate binding site. Both dadX and alr were expressed in E. coli TG1. Neither alanine racemase activity or serine racemase activity was detected in the host strain. Only alanine racemase activity was found in E. coli TG1/pCTD. But both E. coli TG1/pCTA and TG1/pCBA exhibit activity toward L-alanine and L-serine. Transcription of alr gene in E. coli is independent from extraneous promoter, a result confirmed by the significant enzyme activity observed in the E. coli TG1/pCBA, which indicates the presence of a possible promoter upstream the structure gene.
TI  - Quenched autoligation probes allow discrimination of live bacterial species by single nucleotide differences in rRNA.
AB  - Quenched autoligation (QUAL) probes are a class of self-reacting nucleic acid probes that give strong fluorescence signal in the presence of fully complementary RNAs and selectivity against single nucleotide differences in solution. Here, we describe experiments designed to test whether QUAL probes can discriminate between bacterial species by the detection of small differences in their 16S rRNA sequences. Probes were introduced into live cells using small amounts of detergent, thus eliminating the need for fixation, and fluorescence signal was monitored both by microscopy and by flow cytometry without any washing steps. The effects of probe length, modified backbone, probe concentration and growth state of the bacteria were investigated. The data demonstrate specific fluorescence discrimination between three closely related bacteria, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica and Pseudomonas putida, based on single nucleotide differences in their 16S rRNA. Discrimination was possible with cells in mid-log phase or in lag phase. These results suggest that QUAL probes may be useful for rapid identification of microorganisms in laboratory and clinical settings.
TI  - REP code: defining bacterial identity in extragenic space.
AB  - Through the analysis of 57 bacterial genomes we have detected repetitive extragenic palindromic DNA sequences (REPs) in 11 species. For a sequence to be considered as REP, the following criteria should be met: (i) It should be extragenic, (ii) palindromic, (iii) of a length between 21 and 65 bases and (iv) should constitute more than 0.5% of the total extragenic space. Species-specific REPs have been found in human pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Neisseria meningitidis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Rickettsia conorii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens and the soil bacteria Deinococcus radiodurans, Pseudomonas putida and Sinorhizobium meliloti.
TI  - Cell density-dependent gene contributes to efficient seed colonization by Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
AB  - We have characterized the expression pattern of a gene, ddcA, involved in initial colonization of corn seeds by Pseudomonas putida KT2440. The ddcA gene codes for a putative membrane polypeptide belonging to a family of conserved proteins of unknown function. Members of this family are widespread among prokaryotes and include the products of a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium gene expressed during invasion of macrophages and psiE, an Escherichia coli phosphate starvation-inducible gene. Although its specific role is undetermined, the presence of ddcA in multicopy restored the seed adhesion capacity of a KT2440 ddcA mutant. Expression of ddcA is growth phase regulated, being maximal at the beginning of stationary phase. It is independent of RpoS, nutrient depletion, or phosphate starvation, and it is not the result of changes in the medium pH during growth. Expression of ddcA is directly dependent on cell density, being also stimulated by the addition of conditioned medium and of seed exudates. This is the first evidence suggesting the existence of a quorum-sensing system in P. putida KT2440. The potential implication of such a signaling process in seed adhesion and colonization by the bacterium is discussed.
TI  - RtsA and RtsB coordinately regulate expression of the invasion and flagellar genes in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.
AB  - Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium encounters numerous host environments and defense mechanisms during the infection process. The bacterium responds by tightly regulating the expression of virulence genes. We identified two regulatory proteins, termed RtsA and RtsB, which are encoded in an operon located on an island integrated at tRNA(PheU) in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium. RtsA belongs to the AraC/XylS family of regulators, and RtsB is a helix-turn-helix DNA binding protein. In a random screen, we identified five RtsA-regulated fusions, all belonging to the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1) regulon, which encodes a type III secretion system (TTSS) required for invasion of epithelial cells. We show that RtsA increases expression of the invasion genes by inducing hilA expression. RtsA also induces expression of hilD, hilC, and the invF operon. However, induction of hilA is independent of HilC and HilD and is mediated by direct binding of RtsA to the hilA promoter. The phenotype of an rtsA null mutation is similar to the phenotype of a hilC mutation, both of which decrease expression of SPI1 genes approximately twofold. We also show that RtsA can induce expression of a SPI1 TTSS effector, slrP, independent of any SPI1 regulatory protein. RtsB represses expression of the flagellar genes by binding to the flhDC promoter region. Repression of the positive activators flhDC decreases expression of the entire flagellar regulon. We propose that RtsA and RtsB coordinate induction of invasion and repression of motility in the small intestine.
TI  - AraC/XylS family members, HilD and HilC, directly activate virulence gene expression independently of HilA in Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - Salmonella typhimurium is a Gram-negative enteric pathogen that can infect intestinal epithelial cells and induce inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. These processes are mediated by a type III secretion system (TTSS), which is encoded on Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1). Previous studies showed that four SPI1-encoded transcriptional regulators, HilD, HilC, HilA and InvF, act in an ordered fashion to co-ordinately activate expression of the SPI1 TTSS. HilD and HilC derepress hilA transcription. HilA activates invF as well as SPI1 genes that encode components of the TTS apparatus. InvF then activates genes that encode proteins secreted by the SPI1 TTS apparatus. In this scheme, HilD and HilC indirectly activate expression of the SPI1 TTS apparatus and its secreted substrates by affecting hilA expression. Here, we report that HilD and HilC can also activate expression of a subset of SPI1 genes independently of HilA. Our studies show that HilD and HilC activate transcription of invF from a promoter that is far upstream of its HilA-dependent promoter. This activation is most probably through direct binding of HilD and HilC to sequences upstream and downstream of this alternative HilA-independent promoter. We conclude that HilD and HilC have a second role in SPI1 gene regulation that is separate from their role in co-ordinating expression of the SPI1 TTSS through hilA.
TI  - Differences in attachment of Salmonella enterica serovars and Escherichia coli O157:H7 to alfalfa sprouts.
AB  - Numerous Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli O157:H7 outbreaks have been associated with contaminated sprouts. We examined how S. enterica serovars, E. coli serotypes, and nonpathogenic bacteria isolated from alfalfa sprouts grow on and adhere to alfalfa sprouts. Growth on and adherence to sprouts were not significantly different among different serovars of S. enterica, but all S. enterica serovars grew on and adhered to alfalfa sprouts significantly better than E. coli O157:H7. E. coli O157:H7 was essentially rinsed from alfalfa sprouts with repeated washing steps, while 1 to 2 log CFU of S. enterica remained attached per sprout. S. enterica Newport adhered to 3-day-old sprouts as well as Pantoea agglomerans and 10-fold more than Pseudomonas putida and Rahnella aquatilis, whereas the growth rates of all four strains throughout seed sprouting were similar. S. enterica Newport and plant-associated bacteria adhered 10- to 1,000-fold more than E. coli O157:H7; however, three of four other E. coli serotypes, isolated from cabbage roots exposed to sewage water following a spill, adhered to sprouts better than E. coli O157:H7 and as well as the Pseudomonas and Rahnella strains. Therefore, attachment to alfalfa sprouts among E. coli serotypes is variable, and nonpathogenic strains of E. coli to be used as surrogates for the study of pathogenic E. coli may be difficult to identify and should be selected carefully, with knowledge of the biology being examined.
TI  - AraC/XylS family members, HilC and HilD, directly bind and derepress the Salmonella typhimurium hilA promoter.
AB  - During infection, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium colonizes the small intestine of its hosts. This process requires a type III secretion system encoded by several genes on Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1), a 40 kb region of DNA near centisome 63 of the Salmonella chromosome. SPI1 gene expression is controlled by a complex regulatory cascade. HilA, a member of the OmpR/ToxR family of transcriptional regulators, directly activates the expression of two SPI1 operons encoding type III apparatus components. hilA transcription is repressed by many environmental conditions and regulatory mutations. This repression requires an upstream repressing sequence (URS) located between -314 and -68 relative to the hilA transcription start site. The repressing activity of the URS is counteracted by two AraC/XylS family members named HilC and HilD. We show that HilC and HilD bind directly to the hilA promoter region in vitro. We also provide evidence that HilC and HilD bind to the same or overlapping sites within the URS. Our data are consistent with a model in which HilC and HilD derepress hilA expression by binding directly to the URS and counteracting its repressing effect in vivo.
TI  - Using light scatter signal to estimate bacterial biovolume by flow cytometry.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the past decade, flow cytometry has become a useful and precise alternative to microscopic bacterial cell counts in aquatic samples. However, little evidence of its usefulness for the evaluation of bacterial biovolumes has emerged in from the literature. METHODS: The light scattering and cell volume of starved bacterial strains and natural bacterial communities from the Black Sea were measured by flow cytometry and epifluorescence microscopy, respectively, in order to establish a relationship between light scattering and cell volume. RESULTS: With the arc-lamp flow cytometer, forward angle light scatter (FALS) was related to cell size in both the starved strains and natural communities, although regression parameters differed. We tested the predictive capacity of the FALS verous cell size relationship in a bacterial community from the North Sea. That analysis showed that a reliable bacterial biovolume prediction of a natural bacterial community can be obtained from FALS using a model generated from natural bacterial community data. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial biovolume is likely to be related to FALS measurements. It is possible to establish a generally applicable model derived from natural bacterial assemblages for flow cytometric estimation of bacterial biovolumes by light scatter.
TI  - Microstructural factors controlling the survival of food-borne pathogens in porous media.
AB  - The survival of Salmonella typhimurium LT2, Escherichia coli K-12 and Pseudomonas putida in several model porous media poised at a water activity of 0.94 is shown to depend critically on the microstructure of the particulate matrix and the microscopic water distribution. The porous media were made by randomly dispersing a liquid inoculum containing ca. 10(7) cells/ml throughout the pores and interparticle spaces of packed beds of silica particles and Sephadex microspheres. The purely "microstructural stress" effects were isolated by comparison with a homogeneous liquid growth medium having the same water activity. The possibility of exploiting similar microstructural stress effects in food preservation is discussed.
TI  - Cell envelope mutants of Pseudomonas putida: physiological characterization and analysis of their ability to survive in soil.
AB  - To generate mutants with altered lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of the wild-type Pseudomonas putida KT2442, we used the mini-Tn5luxAB-Km transposon. A mutant was found among luminescent colonies and selected as a negative clone in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with monoclonal antibody (mAb) 7.3B, which recognizes the O-antigen of P. putida LPS. The DNA region of the LPS mutant interrupted by the minitransposon insertion was cloned and sequenced. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with protein sequence databases showed similarity to the O-antigen polymerase (Wzy) of Salmonella enterica (muenchen). The wild-type gene was rescued by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cloned into a broad-host-range plasmid and used to carry out complementation assays. The cloned gene was able to restore the wild-type phenotype of the P. putida wzy mutant. We constructed an isogenic mutant of the luminescent wzy mutant to which an oprL mutation was transferred by homologous recombination with an oprL::xylE cassette. The wzy mutants of P. putida were more sensitive to SDS, deoxycholate and EDTA than the corresponding parental strains. We analysed the ability of wzy, oprL and wzy oprL mutants of P. putida to colonize soil. In comparison with the wild-type strain, the ability of single mutants to colonize soil decreased; this characteristic was more evident for the double mutant, especially at high temperatures.
TI  - Acquisition of the rfb-gnd cluster in evolution of Escherichia coli O55 and O157.
AB  - The rfb region specifies the structure of lipopolysaccharide side chains that comprise the diverse gram-negative bacterial somatic (O) antigens. The rfb locus is adjacent to gnd, which is a polymorphic gene encoding 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. To determine if rfb and gnd cotransfer, we sequenced gnd in five O55 and 13 O157 strains of Escherichia coli. E. coli O157:H7 has a gnd allele (allele A) that is only 82% identical to the gnd allele (allele D) of closely related E. coli O55:H7. In contrast, gnd alleles of E. coli O55 in distant lineages are >99.9% identical to gnd allele D. Though gnd alleles B and C in E. coli O157 that are distantly related to E. coli O157:H7 are more similar to allele A than to allele D, there are nucleotide differences at 4 to 6% of their sites. Alleles B and C can be found in E. coli O157 in different lineages, but we have found allele A only in E. coli O157 belonging to the DEC5 lineage. DNA 3' to the O55 gnd allele in diverse E. coli lineages has sequences homologous to tnpA of the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium IS200 element, E. coli Rhs elements (including an H-rpt gene), and portions of the O111 and O157 rfb regions. We conclude that rfb and gnd cotransferred into E. coli O55 and O157 in widely separated lineages and that recombination was responsible for recent antigenic shifts in the emergence of pathogenic E. coli O55 and O157.
TI  - TrfA-dependent inner membrane-associated plasmid RK2 DNA synthesis and association of TrfA with membranes of different gram-negative hosts.
AB  - TrfA, the replication initiator protein of broad-host-range plasmid RK2, was tested for its ability to bind to the membrane of four different gram-negative hosts in addition to Escherichia coli: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Cells harboring TrfA-encoding plasmids were fractionated into soluble, inner membrane, and outer membrane fractions. The fractions were subjected to Western blotting, and the blots were probed with antibody to the TrfA proteins. TrfA was found to fractionate with the cell membranes of all species tested. When the two membrane fractions of these species were tested for their ability to synthesize plasmid DNA endogenously (i.e., without added template or enzymes), only the inner membrane fraction was capable of extensive synthesis that was inhibited by anti-TrfA antibody in a manner similar to that of the original host species, E. coli. In addition, although DNA synthesis did occur in the outer membrane fraction, it was much less extensive than that exhibited by the inner membrane fraction and only slightly affected by anti-TrfA antibody. Plasmid DNA synthesized by the inner membrane fraction of one representative species, P. aeruginosa, was characteristic of supercoil and intermediate forms of the plasmid. Extensive DNA synthesis was observed in the soluble fraction of another representative species, R. sphaeroides, but it was completely unaffected by anti-TrfA antibody, suggesting that such synthesis was due to repair and/or nonspecific chain extension of plasmid DNA fragments.
TI  - Development of a new lysis solution for releasing genomic DNA from bacterial cells for DNA amplification by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - A new lysis solution designated TZ, consisting of 2.0% Triton X-100 plus 2.5 mg sodium azide/ml in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8.0, yielded higher levels of genomic DNA from Escherichia coli O157:H7 cells compared with a number of other commonly used cell lysis methods. Ethidium bromide stained DNA bands resulting from PCR amplification of target DNA from 100 CFU of E. coli O157:H7 were readily detected following electrophoresis of agarose gels. In contrast, conventional cell lysis methods failed to detect target DNA from 100 CFU after PCR amplification. The new solution was highly effective for lysing cell suspensions of Salmonella enteritidis, Pseudomonas putida, Lysteria monocytogenes and Psychrobacter immobilis.
TI  - Proline catabolism by Pseudomonas putida: cloning, characterization, and expression of the put genes in the presence of root exudates.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida KT2442 is a root-colonizing strain which can use proline, one  of the major components in root exudates, as its sole carbon and nitrogen source. A P. putida mutant unable to grow with proline as the sole carbon and nitrogen source was isolated after random mini-Tn5-Km mutagenesis. The mini-Tn5 insertion was located at the putA gene, which is adjacent to and divergent from the putP gene. The putA gene codes for a protein of 1,315 amino acid residues which is homologous to the PutA protein of Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Rhodobacter capsulatus, and several Rhizobium strains. The central part of P. putida PutA showed homology to the proline dehydrogenase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster, whereas the C-terminal end was homologous to the pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase of S. cerevisiae and a number of aldehyde dehydrogenases. This suggests that in P. putida, both enzymatic steps for proline conversion to glutamic acid are catalyzed by a single polypeptide. The putP gene was homologous to the putP genes of several prokaryotic microorganisms, and its gene product is an integral inner-membrane protein involved in the uptake of proline. The expression of both genes was induced by proline added in the culture medium and was regulated by PutA. In a P. putida putA-deficient background, expression of both putA and putP genes was maximal and proline independent. Corn root exudates collected during 7 days also strongly induced the P. putida put genes, as determined by using fusions of the put promoters to 'lacZ. The induction ratio for the putA promoter (about 20-fold) was 6-fold higher than the induction ratio for the putP promoter.
TI  - Two AraC/XylS family members can independently counteract the effect of repressing sequences upstream of the hilA promoter.
AB  - During infection of its hosts, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium) enters the epithelial cells of the small intestine. This process requires a number of invasion genes encoded on Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1), a 40 kb stretch of DNA located near minute 63 of the S. typhimurium chromosome. Expression of S. typhimurium SPI1 invasion genes is activated by the transcription factor HilA. hilA is tightly regulated in response to many environmental conditions, including oxygen, osmolarity and pH. Regulation of hilA expression may serve to limit invasion gene expression to the appropriate times during Salmonella infection. We have mapped the transcription start site of hilA and identified regions of the promoter that are required for the repression of hilA expression by conditions unfavourable for Salmonella invasion. We have also identified two SPI1-encoded genes, hilC and hilD, that can independently derepress hilA expression. HilC and HilD are both members of the AraC/XylS family of transcriptional regulators. A mutation in hilD significantly reduces the ability of S. typhimurium to enter tissue culture cells, whereas a mutation in hilC only modestly affects Salmonella invasion. Based on these results, we have updated our model of Salmonella SPI1 invasion gene regulation. We also speculate on the possible significance of this model for Salmonella pathogenesis.
TI  - Isolation and sequencing of a gene coding for glyoxalase I activity from Salmonella typhimurium and comparison with other glyoxalase I sequences.
AB  - The glyoxalase I gene (gloA) from Salmonella typhimurium has been isolated in Escherichia coli on a multi-copy pBR322-derived plasmid, selecting for resistance to 3 mM methylglyoxal on Luria-Bertani agar. The region of the plasmid which confers the methylglyoxal resistance in E. coli was sequenced. The deduced protein sequence was compared to the known sequences of the Homo sapiens and Pseudomonas putida glyoxalase I (GlxI) enzymes, and regions of strong homology were used to probe the National Center for Biotechnology Information protein database. This search identified several previously known glyoxalase I sequences and other open reading frames with unassigned function. The clustal alignments of the sequences are presented, indicating possible Zn2+ ligands and active site regions. In addition, the S. typhimurium sequence aligns with both the N-terminal half and the C-terminal half of the proposed GlxI sequences from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, suggesting that the structures of the yeast enzymes are those of fused dimers.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the Staphylococcus aureus RNA polymerase rpoB gene and comparison of its predicted amino acid sequence with those of other bacteria.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of the rpoB gene which encodes the beta subunit  of S. aureus RNA polymerase has been determined. The RpoB protein, consists of 1182 amino acids and has a novel initiation codon UUG which initiates protein synthesis with methionine. There is a very strong Shine-Dalgarno complementarity and the -10 and -35 promoter hexameric sequences are TAATAT and CCGTTT, respectively. A rho-dependent termination site, CAATCAA, is present which overlaps the -35 promoter sequence of the adjacent rpoC gene a feature which may have a role in the co-ordinate expression of the two genes. A strong homology and conserved regions were found to exist over the predicted amino acid sequences coding for S. aureus rpoB and the equivalent proteins in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, Salmonella typhimurium, Chlamydia trachomatis, cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120.
TI  - Membrane topologies of the TolQ and TolR proteins of Escherichia coli: inactivation of TolQ by a missense mutation in the proposed first transmembrane segment.
AB  - The TolQ and TolR proteins of Escherichia coli are required for the uptake of group A colicins and for infection by filamentous phages. Their topology in the cytoplasmic membrane was determined by cleavage with aminopeptidase K, proteinase K, and trypsin in spheroplasts and cell lysates. From the results obtained, it is proposed that the N terminus of TolQ is located in the periplasm and that it contains three transmembrane segments (residues 9 to 36, 127 to 159, and 162 to 191), a small periplasmic loop, and two large portions in the cytoplasm. The N terminus of TolR is located in the cytoplasm and is followed by a transmembrane segment (residues 21 to 40), and the remainder of the protein is located in the periplasm. A tolQ mutant, which rendered cells resistant to group A colicins and sensitive to cholate, had alanine 13 replaced by glycine and was lacking serine 14 in the first transmembrane segment. The membrane topologies of TolQ and TolR are similar to those proposed for ExbB and ExbD, respectively, which is consistent with the partial functional substitution between ExbB and TolQ and between ExbD and TolR. The amino acid sequences of these proteins display the highest homology in the transmembrane segments, which indicates that the membrane-spanning regions play an important role in the activities of the proteins.
TI  - Observations on the mode of bacterial infection of hens' eggs.
AB  
TI  - Nucleotide sequence analysis and comparison of the lexA genes from Salmonella typhimurium, Erwinia carotovora, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequences of the lexA genes from Salmonella typhimurium,  Erwinia carotovora, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida were determined; the DNA sequences of the lexA genes from these bacteria were 86%, 76%, 61% and 59% similar, respectively, to the Escherichia coli K12 gene. The predicted amino acid sequences of the S. typhimurium, E. carotovora and P. putida LexA proteins are 202 residues long whereas that of P. aeruginosa is 204. Two putative LexA repressor binding sites were localized upstream of each of the heterologous genes, the distance between them being 5 bp in S. typhimurium and E. carotovora, as in the lexA gene of E. coli, and 3 bp in P. putida and P. aeruginosa. The first lexA site present in the lexA operator of all five bacteria is very well conserved. However, the second lexA box is considerably more variable. The Ala-84--Gly-85 bond, at which the LexA repressor of E. coli is cleaved during the induction of the SOS response, is also found in the LexA proteins of S. typhimurium and E. carotovora. Likewise, the amino acids Ser-119 and Lys-156 are present in all of these three LexA repressors. These residues also exist in the LexA proteins of P. putida and P. aeruginosa, but they are displaced by 4 and 6 residues, respectively. Furthermore, the structure and sequence of the DNA-binding domain of the LexA repressor of E. coli are highly conserved in the S. typhimurium, E. carotovora, P. aeruginosa and P. putida LexA proteins.
TI  - Sequence and complementation analysis of recF genes from Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas putida and Bacillus subtilis: evidence for an essential phosphate binding loop.
AB  - We have compared the recF genes from Escherichia coli K-12, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas putida, and Bacillus subtilis at the DNA and amino acid sequence levels. To do this we determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the recF gene from Salmonella typhimurium and we completed the nucleotide sequence of recF gene from Pseudomonas putida begun by Fujita et al. (1). We found that the RecF proteins encoded by these two genes contain respectively 92% and 38% amino acid identity with the E. coli RecF protein. Additionally, we have found that the S. typhimurium and P. putida recF genes will complement an E. coli recF mutant, but the recF gene from Bacillus subtilis [showing about 20% identity with E. coli (2)] will not. Amino acid sequence alignment of the four proteins identified four highly conserved regions. Two of these regions are part of a putative phosphate binding loop. In one region (position 36), we changed the lysine codon (which is essential for ATPase, GTPase and kinase activity in other proteins having this phosphate binding loop) to an arginine codon. We then tested this mutation (recF4101) on a multicopy plasmid for its ability to complement a recF chromosomal mutation and on the E. coli chromosome for its effect on sensitivity to UV irradiation. The strain with recF4101 on its chromosome is as sensitive as a null recF mutant strain. The strain with the plasmid-borne mutant allele is however more UV resistant than the null mutant strain. We conclude that lysine-36 and possibly a phosphate binding loop is essential for full recF activity. Lastly we made two chimeric recF genes by exchanging the amino terminal 48 amino acids of the S. typhimurium and E. coli recF genes. Both chimeras could complement E. coli chromosomal recF mutations.
TI  - The influence of temperature on the behaviour of mixed bacterial contamination of the shell membrane of the hen's egg.
AB  - The inner membrane of the air cell of hens' eggs was inoculated with Pseudomonas  putida, Staphylococcus xylosus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis. The first mentioned eventually dominated the contamination of the albumen of eggs stored at 4, 15, and 20 degrees C. The last mentioned did so in eggs stored at 37 degrees C. The interval between inoculation of the membrane and gross contamination of the albumen was markedly influenced by site of contamination relative to yolk movement.
TI  - One-step cloning system for isolation of bacterial lexA-like genes.
AB  - A system to isolate lexA-like genes of bacteria directly was developed. It is based upon the fact that the presence of a lexA(Def) mutation is lethal to SulA+ cells of Escherichia coli. This system is composed of a SulA- LexA(Def) HsdR- strain and a lexA-conditional killer vector (plasmid pUA165) carrying the wild-type sulA gene of E. coli and a polylinker in which foreign DNA may be inserted. By using this method, the lexA-like genes of Salmonella typhimurium, Erwinia carotovora, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and P. putida were cloned. We also found that the LexA repressor of S. typhimurium presented the highest affinity for the SOS boxes of E. coli in vivo, whereas the LexA protein of P. aeruginosa had the lowest. Likewise, all of these LexA repressors were cleaved by the activated RecA protein of E. coli after DNA damage. Furthermore, under high-stringency conditions, the lexA gene of E. coli hybridized with the lexA genes of S. typhimurium and E. carotovora but not with those of P. aeruginosa and P. putida.
TI  - [Rare initiation codons are regulators of expression of the rpoC gene].
AB  - Translation of the rpoC genes in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium is known to start from the GUG codon. Now, using toeprint analysis we have shown UUG to be the initiation codon of the Pseudomonas putida rpoC gene. IF3 does not seem to proofread initiation at the UUG codon. The rpoC genes of P. putida, E. coli, and S. typhimurium, which use rare start codons, have strong SD-domains AGGAGG (P. p.) and GGGAG (E. c., S. t.), optimal seven-nucleotide spacing between SD and start codons, and good second codon AAA. We suggest that rpoC presents an infrequent case of the regulation of translation initiation by selecting the start codon.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the ponB gene, encoding penicillin-binding protein 1B of Escherichia coli, in heterologous systems.
AB  - A fragment from the ponB region of the Escherichia coli chromosome comprising the promoterless sequence encoding penicillin-binding protein 1B (PBP 1B) has been cloned in a broad-host-range expression vector under the control of the kanamycin resistance gene promoter present in the vector. The hybrid plasmid (pJP3) was used to transform appropriate strains of Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In all instances, the coding sequence was expressed in the heterologous hosts, yielding a product with electrophoretic mobility, protease accessibility, membrane location, and beta-lactam-binding properties identical to those of native PBP 1B in E. coli. These results indicated that PBP 1B of E. coli is compatible with the cytoplasmic membrane environment of unrelated bacterial species and support the idea that interspecific transfer of mutated alleles of genes coding for PBPs could potentially be an efficient spreading mechanism for intrinsic resistance to beta-lactams.
TI  - Expression of E. coli genes carried by hybrids of plasmid RP4.
AB  - Hybrids of the RP4 plasmid, containing bacteriophage Mu and chromosomal genes of  Escherichia coli, were transferred into Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. The individual genes of the arginine, histidine, leucine and threonine operons were expressed in these microorganisms.
TI  - Isolation of large bacterial plasmids and characterization of the P2 incompatibility group plasmids pMG1 and pMG5.
AB  - Large plasmids from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were routinely and consistently isolated using a procedure which does not require ultracentrifugation but includes steps designed to separate large-plasmid DNA from the bacterial folded chromosome. It also selectively removes fragments of broken chromosome. A variety of large plasmids was readily visualized with agarose gel electorphoresis, including five between 70 and 85 megadaltons (Mdal) in size, six between 90 and 143 Mdal, one that was larger than 200 Mdal, and one that was larger than 300 Mdal. This isolation procedure allowed initial estimation of the molecular sizes of the two IncP2 plasmids, pMG1 and pMG5, which were 312 and 280 Mdal, respectively. A standard curve for size determination by gel electrophoresis including plasmids between 23 and 143 Mdal in size did not extrapolate linearly for plasmids of the 300-Mdal size range. Unique response of different plasmids to the isolation procedure included sensitivity of IncP1 plasmids to high pH and the co-isolation of a 20-Mdal "cryptic" plasmid in conjunction.
TI  - Comparative effect of methioninyl adenylate on the growth of Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The bacteriostatic effect of methioninyl adenylate(MAMP)--a specific inhibitor of the enzyme methionyl-tRNA synthetase--was investigated on Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 0.1 mM of this molecule added to the culture, inhibits the growth of S. typhimurium. The inhibition is specifically reversible by 0.1 mM L-methionine. In the same conditions even 1-2 mM MAMP has a very slight effect on the growth rate of P. aeruginosa and only during the first two generations. The same observation was made with the two other members of the fluorescens group P.fluorescens and P.putida. The growth rate of P. testosteroni with 1 mM MAMP in the medium is similar to the growth rate of P. aeruginosa but the other member of the acidovorans group P. acidovorans is much more affected by the smae concentration of the inhibitor. --P. multivorans is inhibited by MAMP like P. acidovorans but with a somewhat higher yield at the end of the culture. --MAMP has no effect on P. alcaligenes. The possible reasons for the weak bacteriostatic effect of MAMP on P. aeruginosa were investigated. It was established that the inhibitor enters the cells and is not used as a carbon and energy source. The intracellular methionine concentration in S. typhimurium and in P. aeruginosa is about the same and does not increase when bacteria are cultivated with MAMP. The MTS of the two microorganisms is inhibited by MAMP in vitro to about the same extent. Furthermore the tRNAmet from P. aeruginosa are fully acylated after 3 to 4 generations with this compound. Nevertheless MAMP elicits higher MTS activity in P. aeruginosa and in P. acidovorans after 1 h of incubation. The most striking difference between S. typhimurium and P. aeruginosa is that the intra and extracellular level of 5'phosphodiesterase which degrades MAMP is 10-20 fold higher in the second than in the first species.
TI  - Immunological study of anthranilate synthetase.
AB  - An immunological study of anthranilate synthetase (ASase) has been initiated using quantitative precipitation, enzyme neutralization, and immunodiffusion methods. Cross-reactivity of anthranilate synthetase-anthranilate-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase (ASase-PRTase) from Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, and Salmonella typhimurium and ASase from Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas putida was detected with antibodies to ?E. coli trypsin-treated ASase. Cross-reactivity of antigens was also obtained with S. marcescens anti-ASase. Indices of dissimilarity verified the overall structural similarity of ASase-PRTase from E. coli, K. aerogenes, and S. typhimurium and the divergence from S. marcescens ASase. Further divergence of these enzymes from ASase in B. subtilis and P. putida was apparent. Precipitation of ASase components I and II (ASase CoI and ASase CoII) was obtained using anti-ASase or antiserum fractionated to contain component-specific antibodies. Anti-ASase inhibited enzyme activity to binding to determinants on both subunits. Anti-ASase CoI inhibited the ammonia-dependent reaction and interfered with amide transfer from glutaminyl-ASase CoII. Anti-ASase CoII inhibited the glutamine reaction by blocking amide transfer. Enzyme neutralization experiments indicate more conservation of determinants at the active site region of ASase CoII compared to ASase CoI in the enterobacteria. A particulate form of ASase-PRTase in E. coli, K. aerogenes, and S. typhimurium could be distinguished by quantitative precipitation and immunodiffusion.
TI  - Amino-terminal sequence of the tryptophan synthetase alpha chain of Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The sequence of the 46 NH(2)-terminal residues of the tryptophan synthetase alpha chain of Bacillus subtilis was determined and compared with the corresponding sequences of Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium, Aerobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas putida. A deletion of six residues was found at the NH(2)-terminal end of the alpha chain of B. subtilis.
