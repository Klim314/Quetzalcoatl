TI  == comparison of the gut microbiota of people in france and saudi arabia.
AB  == background/objectives: the gut microbiota contributes to energy acquisition from  food, and changes in the gut microbiome are associated with obesity. the eating habits of saudis are much different than those of europeans, and our objective was to compare the fecal microbiota of obese and normal weight saudis and french. subjects/methods: illumina miseq deep sequencing was used to test the gut microbiota of 9 normal weight and 9 obese individuals from saudi arabia and 16 normal weight and 12 obese individuals from france. results: obese french possessed significantly more relative proteobacteria (p=0.002) and bacteroidetes  (p=0.05) and had lower richness and biodiversity at all the operational taxonomic unit (otu) cutoffs (p<0.05) than normal weight french. obese saudis possessed significantly more firmicutes (p=0.001) without a difference in richness (p=0.2)  and biodiversity (p=0.3) compared with normal weight saudis. we found a common bacterial species core of 23 species existing in 50% of obese and normal weight saudis and 29 species in 50% of obese and normal weight french. actinomyces odontolyticus, escherichia coli and ruminococcus obeum were present in at least 50% of all individuals tested. french individuals had significantly higher richness and biodiversity compared with saudis at all the otu cutoffs (p<0.05). conclusion: microbiota differences between obese and normal weight french were not similar to those between obese and normal weight saudis. the studies of different populations can result in contrasting data regarding the associations of the gut microbiota and obesity.

TI  == reclassification of ruminococcus obeum as blautia obeum comb. nov.
AB  == during our previous studies we reclassified clostridium coccoides and a number of misclassified ruminococci into a novel genus blautia within the family lachnospiraceae. however, the rules of the bacteriological code currently require that the types of all species and subspecies with new names (including new combinations) be deposited in two different collections in two different countries. the type strain of ruminococcus obeum was, at that period in time, only deposited in the american type culture collection (atcc) and a second independent deposit, as required by the code, was not available. consequently, the transfer of this species to the genus blautia could not be made, because the  resulting species name would not conform to the rules governing the valid publication of species names and deposit of type material (rules 27 and 30) and consequently would not be considered to be validly published. this resulted in a  nomenclatural and taxonomic anomaly with r. obeum being phylogenetically placed among members of the genus blautia with 16s rrna gene sequence similarities of between 91.8 and 96.6 %. in order to rectify this unsatisfactory situation, through our discussions with the atcc, the deposit of strain r. obeum atcc 29174(t) to the dsmz as strain number dsm 25238(t) was completed. hence, the transfer of r. obeum to the genus blautia as blautia obeum comb. nov. is now proposed. the type strain is atcc 29174(t) ( = dsm 25238(t) = kctc 15206(t)).

TI  == members of the human gut microbiota involved in recovery from vibrio cholerae infection.
AB  == given the global burden of diarrhoeal diseases, it is important to understand how members of the gut microbiota affect the risk for, course of, and recovery from disease in children and adults. the acute, voluminous diarrhoea caused by vibrio  cholerae represents a dramatic example of enteropathogen invasion and gut microbial community disruption. here we conduct a detailed time-series metagenomic study of faecal microbiota collected during the acute diarrhoeal and  recovery phases of cholera in a cohort of bangladeshi adults living in an area with a high burden of disease. we find that recovery is characterized by a pattern of accumulation of bacterial taxa that shows similarities to the pattern  of assembly/maturation of the gut microbiota in healthy bangladeshi children. to  define the underlying mechanisms, we introduce into gnotobiotic mice an artificial community composed of human gut bacterial species that directly correlate with recovery from cholera in adults and are indicative of normal microbiota maturation in healthy bangladeshi children. one of the species, ruminococcus obeum, exhibits consistent increases in its relative abundance upon  v. cholerae infection of the mice. follow-up analyses, including mono- and co-colonization studies, establish that r. obeum restricts v. cholerae colonization, that r. obeum luxs (autoinducer-2 (ai-2) synthase) expression and ai-2 production increase significantly with v. cholerae invasion, and that r. obeum ai-2 causes quorum-sensing-mediated repression of several v. cholerae colonization factors. co-colonization with v. cholerae mutants discloses that r.  obeum ai-2 reduces vibrio colonization/pathogenicity through a novel pathway that does not depend on the v. cholerae ai-2 sensor, luxp. the approach described can  be used to mine the gut microbiota of bangladeshi or other populations for members that use autoinducers and/or other mechanisms to limit colonization with  v. cholerae, or conceivably other enteropathogens.

TI  == phylogenetic distribution of three pathways for propionate production within the  human gut microbiota.
AB  == propionate is produced in the human large intestine by microbial fermentation and may help maintain human health. we have examined the distribution of three different pathways used by bacteria for propionate formation using genomic and metagenomic analysis of the human gut microbiota and by designing degenerate primer sets for the detection of diagnostic genes for these pathways. degenerate  primers for the acrylate pathway (detecting the lcda gene, encoding lactoyl-coa dehydratase) together with metagenomic mining revealed that this pathway is restricted to only a few human colonic species within the lachnospiraceae and negativicutes. the operation of this pathway for lactate utilisation in coprococcus catus (lachnospiraceae) was confirmed using stable isotope labelling. the propanediol pathway that processes deoxy sugars such as fucose and rhamnose was more abundant within the lachnospiraceae (based on the pdup gene, which encodes propionaldehyde dehydrogenase), occurring in relatives of ruminococcus obeum and in roseburia inulinivorans. the dominant source of propionate from hexose sugars, however, was concluded to be the succinate pathway, as indicated by the widespread distribution of the mmda gene that encodes methylmalonyl-coa decarboxylase in the bacteroidetes and in many negativicutes. in general, the capacity to produce propionate or butyrate from hexose sugars resided in different species, although two species of lachnospiraceae (c. catus and r. inulinivorans) are now known to be able to switch from butyrate to propionate production on different substrates. a better understanding of the microbial ecology of short-chain fatty acid formation may allow modulation of propionate formation by the human gut microbiota.

TI  == blautia faecis sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  == a strictly anoxic, gram-stain-positive, non-motile blautia-like bacterium, designated strain m25(t), was isolated from a human faecal sample. strain m25(t)  was negative for both catalase and oxidase activity, utilized carbohydrates as fermentable substrates, produced lactate and acetate as the major end products of glucose fermentation in pyg medium, and had a dna g+c content of 41.6 mol%. comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that strain m25(t) was closely related to ruminococcus obeum atcc 29174(t) (96.40 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity) and blautia glucerasea hfth-1(t) (96.17 %) within the family lachnospiraceae. straight-chain saturated and monounsaturated cellular fatty acids were also detected, the majority being c(14 : 0), c(16 : 0) and c(16 : 0) dimethyl acetal acids. based on the phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic characteristics presented in this study, strain m25(t) represents a novel species within the genus blautia for which the name blautia faecis sp. nov. is proposed.  the type strain is m25(t) ( = kctc 5980(t) = jcm 17205(t)).

TI  == oligosaccharides in 4 different milk groups, bifidobacteria, and ruminococcus obeum.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to identify a link between the total amount of breast milk oligosaccharides and faecal microbiota composition of newborns at  the end of the first month of life, with special attention paid to bifidobacteria, and establish the role, if any, of the different oligosaccharides in determining the gut microbiota composition. subjects and methods: milk oligosaccharide groups were identified by high-performance anion exchange chromatography analysis. dpcrna from newborns' faecal samples at 30 days of life  was isolated and processed by polymerase chain reaction analyses that allow the identification of 6 species of bifidobacteria (adolescentis, bifidum, breve, catenulatum, longum, infantis) and ruminococcus spp; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis was also performed. results: no substantial differences  in bifidobacteria species composition within milk groups 1, 2, and 3 were observed; however, infants fed with group 4 milk show a microbiota characterised  by a greater frequency of bifidobacteria adolescentis and the absence of bifidobacteria catenulatum. for the first time, a high percentage of the ruminococcus genus in infants fed with all milk groups was found. conclusions: our data show that milk groups 1, 2, and 3, containing an amount of oligosaccharides ranging within 10 to 15 g/l, share a substantially identical composition of the intestinal microbiota in breast-fed infants, despite quali-quantitative difference in oligosaccharides content. newborns taking milk with only 5 g/l of oligosaccharides (group 4) harbour a different intestinal microbiota.

TI  == structural shifts of gut microbiota as surrogate endpoints for monitoring host health changes induced by carcinogen exposure.
AB  == this study monitored structural shifts of gut microbiota of rats developing precancerous mucosal lesions induced by carcinogen 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine (dmh) treatment using pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and 454 pyrosequencing on the 16s rrna gene v3 region. partial least square discriminant  analysis of dgge fingerprints showed that the gut microbiota structure of treated animals was similar to that of the controls 1 and 3 weeks after dmh treatments, but significantly different 7 weeks after dmh treatments, when a large number of  aberrant crypt foci (acf) developed in their colons. martens' uncertainty test, followed by anova test (p<0.05) identified ruminococcus-like and allobaculum-like bacteria as key variables for discrimination of dmh-treated rats from controls. real-time pcr confirmed the significant increase of the ruminococcus obeum and the allobaculum-like bacteria in dmh-treated rats. unifrac analysis based on v3 pyrosequencing further validated that the gut microbiota structures of treated and control animals were similar at an early stage, but segregated after acf formation. thirteen operational taxonomic units including ruminococcus-like and allobaculum-like bacteria were identified as key variables for the discrimination of dmh-treated rats from controls. dynamic analysis of gut microbiota may become  a noninvasive strategy for monitoring host health changes induced by carcinogen exposure.

TI  == high temporal and inter-individual variation detected in the human ileal microbiota.
AB  == the diversity and temporal stability of the predominant bacteria in the human ileum was studied with the use of ileal effluent samples of seven individuals with brooke ileostomies. the total number of bacteria within the ileal effluent was in the range of 10(7) -10(8) bacteria per gram (wet weight). the diversity of the bacteria in the ileal effluent showed marked differences compared with that in faecal samples from age-matched healthy adults. the ileal effluent had a higher relative abundance of species within the orders lactobacillales and clostridiales, mainly streptococcus bovis-related species, and the veillonella group, and a lower proportion of species related to ruminococcus gnavus, r. obeum and bacteroides plebeius. in addition, inter-individual differences were found, indicative of a highly personal ileal microbiota profile. furthermore, temporal profiles showed large fluctuations per individual over a period of 9-28 days (average similarity over a period of 9 days was as low as 44%), and differences between morning and afternoon profiles were observed. parallel cloning and sequencing efforts revealed several phylotypes that were not identified in previous studies (12 out of 65 phylotypes showed less than 97% sequence similarity with previously reported sequences). achaea were found to be below detection limit by quantitative pcr. overall, the results indicate that the microbiota of the human ileum is relatively unstable, less complex and consisting of different dominating phylotypes when compared with the colonic microbiota.

TI  == novel alpha-glucosidase from human gut microbiome: substrate specificities and their switch.
AB  == the human intestine harbors a large number of microbes forming a complex microbial community that greatly affects the physiology and pathology of the host. in the human gut microbiome, the enrichment in certain protein gene families appears to be widespread. they include enzymes involved in carbohydrate  metabolism such as glucoside hydrolases of dietary polysaccharides and glycoconjugates. we report the crystal structures (wild type, 2 mutants, and a mutant/substrate complex) and the enzymatic activity of a recombinant alpha-glucosidase from human gut bacterium ruminococcus obeum. the first ever protein structures from this bacterium reveal a structural homologue to human intestinal maltase-glucoamylase with a highly conserved catalytic domain and reduced auxiliary domains. the alpha-glucosidase, a member of gh31 family, shows  substrate preference for alpha(1-6) over alpha(1-4) glycosidic linkages and produces glucose from isomaltose as well as maltose. the preference can be switched by a single mutation at its active site, suggestive of widespread adaptation to utilization of a variety of polysaccharides by intestinal micro-organisms as energy resources.

TI  == isolation of a novel bacterium, blautia glucerasei sp. nov., hydrolyzing plant glucosylceramide to ceramide.
AB  == a bacterial strain that is capable of hydrolyzing plant glucosylceramide (glucer) was newly isolated from dog feces. the novel strain, designated as strain hfth-1(t), hydrolyzed plant glucer with a variety of chemical structures, but did not hydrolyze glucosylsphingosine, lactosylceramide, or monosialoganglioside gm(3), indicating that strain hfth-1(t) produces glucer-specific glucosylceramidase. strain hfth-1(t) was gram-positive, anaerobic, oval-spore-forming, rod-shaped, lecithinase-negative, and lipase-negative. it fermented a wide variety of carbohydrates and produced mainly acetate, formate, and lactate from glucose. the g + c content of its dna was 40.7 mol%. the phylogenetic analysis of 16s rrna sequence revealed that strain hfth-1(t) is placed in the clostridial rrna cluster xiva, with ruminococcus obeum as the nearest relative. pairwise comparison revealed approximately 5.0% sequence divergence between strain hfth-1(t) and the type strain of r. obeum. on the basis of its phenotypic characteristics and phylogenetic divergence, it is proposed that the hitherto unknown rod-shaped bacterial strain hfth-1(t) (= dsm 22028(t) = nbrc 104932(t)) should be placed in the genus blautia as a novel species, blautia glucerasei sp. nov, the only currently known isolate of the species.

TI  == sudan azo dyes and para red degradation by prevalent bacteria of the human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == sudan azo dyes have genotoxic effects and ingestion of food products contaminated with sudan i, ii, iii, iv, and para red could lead to exposure in the human gastrointestinal tract. in this study, we examined thirty-five prevalent species  of human intestinal bacteria to evaluate their capacity to degrade sudan dyes and para red. among these tested bacterial strains, 23, 13, 33, 30, and 29 out of 35  species tested were able to reduce sudan i, ii, iii, iv, and para red, respectively, to some extent. bifidobacterium infantis, clostridium indolis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and ruminococcus obeum were able  to reduce completely all four tested sudan dyes and para red. escherichia coli and peptostreptococcus magnus were the only two strains that were not able to reduce any of the tested sudan dyes and para red to any significant extent. metabolites of the reduction of the tested sudan dyes and para red by e. faecalis were isolated and identified by hplc and lc/esi-ms analyses and compared with authentic standards. thus it appears that the ability to reduce sudan dyes and para red except sudan ii is common among bacteria in the human colon.

TI  == mechanism of conjugated linoleic acid and vaccenic acid formation in human faecal suspensions and pure cultures of intestinal bacteria.
AB  == faecal bacteria from four human donors and six species of human intestinal bacteria known to metabolize linoleic acid (la) were incubated with la in deuterium oxide-enriched medium to investigate the mechanisms of conjugated linoleic acid (cla) and vaccenic acid (va) formation. the main cla products in faecal suspensions, rumenic acid (cis-9,trans-11-cla; ra) and trans-9,trans-11-cla, were labelled at c-13, as were other 9,11 geometric isomers. traces of trans-10,cis-12-cla formed were labelled to a much lower extent. in pure culture, bifidobacterium breve ncfb 2258 formed labelled ra and trans-9,trans-11-cla, while butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 16.4, roseburia hominis a2-183t, roseburia inulinivorans a2-192t and ruminococcus obeum-like strain a2-162 converted la to va, labelled in a manner indicating that va was formed via c-13-labelled ra. propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii dsm 4902t, a  possible probiotic, formed mainly ra with smaller amounts of trans-10,cis-12-cla  and trans-9,trans-11-cla, labelled the same as in the mixed microbiota. ricinoleic acid (12-oh-cis-9-18 : 1) did not form cla in the mixed microbiota, in contrast to cla formation described for lactobacillus plantarum. these results were similar to those reported for the mixed microbiota of the rumen. thus, although the bacterial genera and species responsible for biohydrogenation in the rumen and the human intestine differ, and a second route of ra formation via a 10-oh-18 : 1 is present in the intestine, the overall labelling patterns of different cla isomers formation are common to both gut ecosystems. a hydrogen-abstraction enzymic mechanism is proposed that may explain the role of a 10-oh-18 : 1 intermediate in 9,11-cla formation in pure and mixed cultures.

AB  == phenotypic and phylogenetic studies were performed on 15 isolates of an unidentified gram-positive, anaerobic, non-sporulating coccobacillus-shaped bacterium isolated from human faeces. the novel organisms were catalase-negative, indole-negative and produced acetate and succinate as end products of metabolism. comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing demonstrated that the 15 isolates were highly related to each other and formed a hitherto unknown subline within the clostridial rrna cluster xiva. the novel isolates formed a robust phylogenetic group with a number of organisms which included clostridium coccoides, ruminococcus luti, ruminococcus obeum and a number of other misclassified ruminococci. on the basis of these studies, a novel genus, blautia gen. nov., is  proposed. it is suggested that clostridium coccoides, ruminococcus hansenii, ruminococcus hydrogenotrophicus, ruminococcus luti, ruminococcus productus, and ruminococcus schinkii are transferred to this genus as blautia coccoides gen. nov., comb. nov., blautia hansenii comb. nov., blautia hydrogenotrophica comb. nov., blautia luti comb. nov., blautia producta comb. nov. and blautia schinkii comb. nov. one of the new isolates, the hitherto unknown coccus-shaped bacterial  strain wal 14507t (=atcc baa-1564t=dsm 19850t) is proposed as representing the type strain of a novel species, blautia wexlerae sp. nov.

TI  == the relationship between microbiota and polyamine concentration in the human intestine: a pilot study.
AB  == the fecal microbiota of 10 hospitalized elderly subjects and 14 healthy adults were analyzed by terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis using hha i, msp i, hae iii, and alu i, as well as fecal polyamine (pa)  concentration. the t-rflp profiles of the fecal microbiota of the subjects were roughly divided into 2 clusters-i (9 out of 11 were derived from hospitalized elderly subjects) and ii (12 out of 13 were derived from healthy adults). the average concentration of putrescine in cluster ii was 5.8 times higher than that  of putrescine in cluster i (p=0.0015). using a phylogenetic assignment database for t-rflp analysis of human colonic microbiota, the terminal-restriction fragments (t-rfs) characteristically detected in the case of subjects with high fecal pa concentration were predicted to be derived from bacterial species and phylotypes belonging to clostridium subcluster xiva, particularly including clostridium xylanolyticum, clostridium saccharolyticum, the uncultured human intestinal bacterium clone jw1h4 (a relative of desulfotomaculum guttoideum), roseburia intestinalis, the uncultured bacterium clone 41f10 (a relative of eubacterium ramulus), roseburia cecicola, ruminococcus obeum and its relatives. from these results, we concluded that fecal microbiota may be linked with fecal pa concentration and that some bacterial species belonging to clostridium subcluster xiva may play a major role in the control of intestinal pa concentration in humans.

TI  == molecular analyses of the intestinal microbiota of chimpanzees in the wild and in captivity.
AB  == little information is available regarding the intestinal bacteria of chimpanzees  in the wild, due to the technical difficulties of studying intestinal bacteria in the field. in this study, molecular-based bacterial analyses were performed to overcome this difficulty because polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based methods, such as temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (tgge) and amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra), of the bacterial 16s rrna gene can be applied to ethanol-fixed fecal samples. the common presence of bacteria belonging to the  clostridium rrna sub-group xiva, such as ruminococcus obeum and eubacterium sp.,  was indicated for bossou wild chimpanzees by ardra. tgge on partial 16s rdna followed by hierarchical clustering analysis showed a systematic difference in the composition of intestinal microbiota between wild and captive chimpanzees. however, several tgge bands commonly shared by wild and captured chimpanzees were excised, and their sequences were obtained. they were suggested to be the clostridium leptum subgroup bacteria, lactobacillus gasseri-like bacterium, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum- or b. catenulatum-like bacterium. these may be considered as common intestinal bacteria for chimpanzees, and may be transmitted  vertically over generations.

TI  == effects of long-term ingestion of difructose anhydride iii (dfa iii) on intestinal bacteria and bile acid metabolism in humans.
AB  == changes in the intestinal microbiota of 10 human subjects with long-term ingestion of 3 g/d difructose anhydride iii (dfa iii; 4 persons, 2 months; 3 persons, 6 months; and 3 persons, 12 months) were examined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). according to the answers to questionnaires, the subjects were divided into two groups (constipated and normal). the dgge profile  was different for every individual and each subject had unique profiles of intestinal microbiota. in the dgge profiles of constipated subjects, the intensities of bands related to bacteroides spp. increased. moreover, the dfa iii-assimilating bacteria, ruminococcus sp. were isolated from subjects who ingested dfa iii for 12 months. these strains showed 95% similarity of their 16s  rdna sequences with that of ruminococcus obeum atcc 29174(t) (x85101) and produced large amounts of acetic acid. dfa iii ingestion for 2 months tended to increase total organic acids in feces, and tended to decrease fecal ph and the secondary bile acid (sba) ratio in total bile acids. the sba ratio in total bile  acids corresponded to fecal ph. the production of sba was decreased by low ph in  vitro. these results indicated that dfa iii ingestion in humans tended to lower intestinal ph, inhibited bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylation activities and also tended to decrease the sba ratios in total bile acids. moreover, as another cause for the decrease in the sba ratio in total bile acids, it was suggested that the  number of bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylating bacteria were decreased by dfa iii ingestion.

TI  == genetic diversity of viable, injured, and dead fecal bacteria assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and 16s rrna gene analysis.
AB  == a novel approach combining a flow cytometric in situ viability assay with 16s rrna gene analysis was used to study the relationship between diversity and activity of the fecal microbiota. simultaneous staining with propidium iodide (pi) and syto bc provided clear discrimination between intact cells (49%), injured or damaged cells (19%), and dead cells (32%). the three subpopulations were sorted and characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of 16s rrna gene amplicons obtained from the total and bifidobacterial communities. this analysis revealed that not only the total community but also the distinct subpopulations are characteristic for each individual. cloning and sequencing of the dominant bands of the dgge patterns showed that most of clones  retrieved from the live, injured, and dead fractions belonged to clostridium coccoides, clostridium leptum, and bacteroides. we found that some of the butyrate-producing related bacteria, such as eubacterium rectale and eubacterium  hallii, were obviously viable at the time of sampling. however, amplicons affiliated with bacteroides and ruminococcus obeum- and eubacterium biforme-like  bacteria, as well as butyrivibrio crossotus, were obtained especially from the dead population. furthermore, some bacterial clones were recovered from all sorted fractions, and this was especially noticeable for the clostridium leptum cluster. the bifidobacterial phylotypes identified in total samples and sorted fractions were assigned to bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum,  bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, and bifidobacterium  bifidum. phylogenetic analysis of the live, dead, and injured cells revealed a remarkable physiological heterogeneity within these bacterial populations; b. longum and b. infantis were retrieved from all sorted fractions, while b. adolescentis was recovered mostly from the sorted dead fraction.

TI  == molecular analysis of fecal microbiota in elderly individuals using 16s rdna library and t-rflp.
AB  == fecal microbiota in six elderly individuals were characterized by the 16s rdna libraries and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis. random clones of 16s rrna gene sequences were isolated after pcr amplification with universal primer sets from total genomic dna extracted from feces of three elderly individuals. these clones were partially sequenced (about  500 bp). t-rflp analysis was performed using 16s rdna amplified from six subjects. the lengths of the terminal restriction fragment (t-rf) were analyzed after digestion by hhai and mspi. among 240 clones obtained, approximately 46% belonged to 27 known species. about 54% of the other clones were 56 novel "phylotypes" (at least 98% homology of clone sequence). these libraries included  83 species or phylotypes. in addition, about 13% (30 phylotypes) of these phylotypes were newly discovered in these libraries. a large number of species that are not yet known exist in the feces of elderly individuals. 16s rdna libraries and t-rflp analysis revealed that the majority of bacteria were bacteroides and relatives, clostridium rrna cluster iv, ix, clostridium rrna subcluster xiva, and "gammaproteobacteria". the proportion of clostridium rrna subcluster xiva was lower than in healthy adults. in addition, although ruminococcus obeum and its closely related phylotypes were detected in high frequency in healthy young subjects, hardly any were detected in our elderly individuals. "gammaproteobacteria" were detected at high frequency.

TI  == development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == a membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. the 16s rdna sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. digoxigenin (dig)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. hybridization signals were read by nbt/bcip color development. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. fragilis, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, r. bromii, r. callidus, r. albus, bifidobacterium  longum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, eubacterium biforme, e. aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus,escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. the result was also confirmed by  using specific pcr methods for these bacteria.

TI  == ruminococcus luti sp. nov., isolated from a human faecal sample.
AB  == a strain of an unidentified strictly anoxic, gram-postive, non-motile ruminococcus-like bacterium was isolated from a human faecal sample. the organism used carbohydrates as fermentable substrates, produced acetate, succinate, and hydrogen as the major products of glucose metabolism, and possessed a g + c content of 43.3 mol%. the morphological and biochemical characteristics of the organism were consistent with its assignment to the genus ruminococcus but it did not correspond to any recognized species of this genus. comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing showed the unidentified bacterium represents a previously unrecognised sub-line within the clostridium coccoides rrna group of organisms. the nearest relative of the unknown bacterium corresponded to ruminococcus obeum but a 16s rrna sequence divergence value of >3% demonstrated it represents a different species. based on the presented findings a new species, ruminococcus luti, is described. the type strain of ruminococcus luti is binix(t) (dsm 14534t, ccug 45635t).

AB  == a 16s rrna-targeted probe was designed and validated in order to quantify the number of uncultured ruminococcus obeum-like bacteria by fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish). these bacteria have frequently been found in 16s ribosomal  dna clone libraries prepared from bacterial communities in the human intestine. thirty-two reference strains from the human intestine, including a phylogenetically related strain and strains of some other ruminococcus species, were used as negative controls and did not hybridize with the new probe. microscopic and flow cytometric analyses revealed that a group of morphologically similar bacteria in feces did hybridize with this probe. moreover, it was found that all hybridizing cells also hybridized with a probe specific for the clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale group, a group that includes the uncultured r. obeum-like bacteria. quantification of the uncultured r. obeum-like bacteria and the c. coccoides-e. rectale group by flow cytometry and microscopy revealed that these groups comprised approximately 2.5 and 16% of the total community in fecal samples, respectively. the uncultured r. obeum-like bacteria comprise about 16% of the c. coccoides-e. rectale group. these results indicate that the uncultured r. obeum-like bacteria are numerically important in human feces. statistical analysis revealed no significant difference between the microscopic and flow cytometric counts and the different feces sampling times, while a significant host-specific effect on the counts was observed. our data demonstrate that the combination of fish and flow cytometry is a useful approach  for studying the ecology of uncultured bacteria in the human gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == design and evaluation of oligonucleotide-microarray method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == an oligonucleotide-microarray method was developed for the detection of intestinal bacteria in fecal samples collected from human subjects. the 16s rdna  sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to glass slides. cyanine5 (cy5)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or bacterial dna using two universal primers and were hybridized to the oligo-microarray. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, clostridium leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, ruminococcus bromii, ruminococcus callidus, ruminococcus albus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium infantis, eubacterium biforme, eubacterium aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the oligo-microarray method developed in this study is a reliable method for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples.

TI  == assessment of microbial diversity in human colonic samples by 16s rdna sequence analysis.
AB  == abstract the bacterial species diversity of three colonic tissue samples from elderly people was investigated by sequence analysis of randomly cloned eubacterial 16s rdna. the majority of sequences (87%) clustered within three bacterial groups: (1) bacteroides; (2) low g+c content gram-positives related to  clostridium coccoides (cluster xiva); (3) gram-positives related to clostridium leptum (cluster iv). these groups have been shown to dominate the human faecal flora. only 25% of sequences were closely related (>97%) to current species type  strains, and 28% were less than 97% related to any database entry. 19% of sequences were most closely related to recently isolated butyrate-producing bacteria belonging to clusters xiva and iv, with a further 18% of the sequences most closely related to ruminococcus obeum and ruminococcus torques (members of cluster xiva). these results provide the first molecular information on the microbial diversity present in human colonic samples.

TI  == 16s rdna sequencing of ruminococcus albus and ruminococcus flavefaciens: design of a signature probe and its application in adult sheep.
AB  == the ruminococci are an important group of fibrolytic bacteria inhabiting the rumen. seventeen strains of presumptively identified ruminococcus were evaluated  by a combination of nearly complete and partial 16s rdna sequence that identified all strains as either ruminococcus albus or ruminococcus flavefaciens. all sequences fell into cluster iv of the clostridia, while other species of ruminococci (e.g. ruminococcus obeum, ruminococcus gnavus, ruminococcus lactaris) fall into cluster xiva of the clostridia. ruminococcus cluster iv sequences were  used to design a 16s rrna oligonucleotide probe to assess the relative abundance  of target populations in a stable ruminal environment. a stable population (animals fed eight times per day) was established in sheep so that statistically  robust comparisons could be made in the absence of variation due to diurnal rumen fluctuations. the steady state populations were sampled six times over a 24 d period and direct microscopic counts (dc), total culturable counts (tcc), and total cellulolytic counts (cel) were determined. dc and culturable data (tcc and  cel) were compared with relative abundance estimates of ruminococcus iv and fibrobacter succinogenes. a combination of the ruminococcus and f. succinogenes probes accounted for 4.0% of the bacterial population and cellulolytic bacteria (measured by most-probable numbers) were 5.2% of the total culturable count. these data suggest that a major portion of the ruminococcus and fibrobacter diversity has been cultured and is represented by available sequences. steady state populations were measured over several days in three sheep and an estimate  of variation in dc, tcc, cel and 16s-based data were obtained. these variance estimates could be used to determine the theoretical sample sizes required to obtain statistically significant differences under different experimental conditions.

TI  == pcr detection of ruminococcus spp. in human and animal faecal samples.
AB  == polymerase chain reaction (pcr) procedures for ruminococcus spp. were developed and used for the detection of ruminococcus spp. in human and animal faeces. the pcr specificity was established for ruminococcus albus, r. bromii, r. obeum, r. callidus and r. flavefaciens. the pcr sensitivity ranged from 4 to 100 cells of the pure cultures, depending on the species. ruminococcus albus, r. bromii, r. obeum and r. callidus were detected in human faeces. r. bromii, r. albus and r. obeum were also detected in animal faeces. r. flavefaciens was not detected in most of the samples tested, except for a weak positive in monkey faecal specimens. the pcr appears to be a specific and efficient method for the detection of ruminococcus spp. in faecal specimens.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis by 16s ribosomal dna sequence comparison reveals two unrelated groups of species within the genus ruminococcus.
AB  == phylogenetic analysis of the genus ruminococcus based on 16s rdna sequence data showed the genus to be phylogenetically heterogenous. ruminococcus species fall within the radiation of the bacillus/clostridium subphylum of the gram-positive line of descent. two distinct and unrelated clusters are recovered. one group contains r. flavefaciens, r. albus, r. bromii, and r. callidus. the second group  constitutes r. gnavus, r. hansenii, r. lactaris, r. obeum, r. productus and r. torques which together with some clostridium species may constitute a new genus.
