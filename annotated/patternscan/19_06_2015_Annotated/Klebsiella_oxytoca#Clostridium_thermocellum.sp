TI  == ethanol production from cellobiose, amorphous cellulose, and crystalline cellulose by recombinant klebsiella oxytoca containing chromosomally integrated zymomonas mobilis genes for ethanol production and plasmids expressing thermostable cellulase genes from clostridium thermocellum.
AB  == the zymomonas mobilis genes for ethanol production have been integrated into the  chromosome of klebsiella oxytoca m5a1. the best of these constructs, strain p2, produced ethanol efficiently from cellobiose in addition to monomeric sugars. utilization of cellobiose and cellotriose by this strain eliminated the requirement for external beta-glucosidase and reduced the amount of commercial cellulase needed to ferment solka floc sw40 (primarily crystalline cellulose). the addition of plasmids encoding endoglucanases from clostridium thermocellum resulted in the intracellular accumulation of thermostable enzymes as coproducts  with ethanol during fermentation. the best of these, strain p2(pct603t) containing celd, was used to hydrolyze amorphous cellulose to cellobiose and produce ethanol in a two-stage process. strain p2(pct603t) was also tested in combination with commercial cellulases. pretreatment of solka floc sw40 at 60 degrees c with endoglucanase d substantially reduced the amount of commercial cellulase required to ferment solka floc. the stimulatory effect of the endoglucanase d pretreatment may result from the hydrolysis of amorphous regions, exposing additional sites for attack by fungal cellulases. since endoglucanase d  functions as part of a complex in c. thermocellum, it is possible that this enzyme may complex with fungal enzymes or bind cellulose to produce a more open structure for hydrolysis.

TI  == conversion of xylan to ethanol by ethanologenic strains of escherichia coli and klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  == a two-stage process was evaluated for the fermentation of polymeric feedstocks to ethanol by a single, genetically engineered microorganism. the truncated xylanase gene (xynz) from the thermophilic bacterium clostridium thermocellum was fused with the n terminus of lacz to eliminate secretory signals. this hybrid gene was  expressed at high levels in ethanologenic strains of escherichia coli ko11 and klebsiella oxytoca m5a1(ploi555). large amounts of xylanase (25 to 93 mu/mg of cell protein) accumulated as intracellular products during ethanol production. cells containing xylanase were harvested at the end of fermentation and added to  a xylan solution at 60 degrees c, thereby releasing xylanase for saccharification. after cooling, the hydrolysate was fermented to ethanol with the same organism (30 degrees c), thereby replenishing the supply of xylanase for a subsequent saccharification. recombinant e. coli metabolized only xylose, while recombinant k. oxytoca m5a1 metabolized xylose, xylobiose, and xylotriose but not xylotetrose. derivatives of this latter organism produced large amounts of intracellular xylosidase, and the organism is presumed to transport both xylobiose and xylotriose for intracellular hydrolysis. by using recombinant m5a1, approximately 34% of the maximal theoretical yield of ethanol was obtained from xylan by this two-stage process. the yield appeared to be limited by the digestibility of commercial xylan rather than by a lack of sufficient xylanase or by ethanol toxicity. in general form, this two-stage process, which uses a single, genetically engineered microorganism, should be applicable for the production of useful chemicals from a wide range of biomass polymers.
