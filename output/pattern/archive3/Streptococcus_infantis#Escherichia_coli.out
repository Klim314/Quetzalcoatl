identification and screening for antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus species isolated from healthy infant faeces.
the antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile of 109 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from 32 healthy korean infants was measured. the ability to show similar activity against escherichia coli o157:h7 and staphylococcus aureus was also looked for. twelve of the 109 lab showed activity against c. difficile and 19 strains were active against e. coli o157:h7, but none against s. aureus. four strains had antimicrobial activity against both c. difficile and e. coli o157:h7. of the 12 strains that had activity against c. difficile, four strains were excluded as streptococcus species, while the other eight were identified using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays using group-specific primers designed from the nucleotide sequences of the 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer (its) regions of the bifidobacterium and lactobacillus species. based on the sequencing results, the eight strains screened were identified as bifidobacterium infantis and lactobacillus salivarius.
measurement of antibacterial activities of t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin  a, aflatoxin b1 and fumonisin b1 using microtitration tray-based turbidimetric techniques.
various mycotoxins were tested for their antibacterial activity by evaluating growth delays using a fully automated microturbidmetric method. ten different strains of the genera escherichia, streptococcus, staphylococcus, yersinia, salmonella, erysipelothrix and lactobacillus were used as test micro-organisms. t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol (don), ochratoxin a (ota), aflatoxin b1 (afb1) and fumonisin b1 (fb1) were used as representative mycotoxins. the inhibitory effect in vitro was defined as the difference between the growth rate without mycotoxins and the growth rate in the presence of a mycotoxin. among the tested strains, streptococcus agalactiae was found to be sensitive to all the toxins, with the exception of ota. t-2 toxin and fb1 were the most effective in slowing down the growth of staphylococcus aureus. afb1 affected the growth of yersinia enterocolitica. the growth rate of escherichia coli and salmonella infantis was decreased by fb1. among the bacterial strains used in this study, only the growth of erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was inhibited by ota. thus, using appropriate tester strains it should be possible to set up a broad-range microtubidimetry assay for individual mycotoxin screening in vitro. we concluded that the microtitration technique provides a rapid, convenient and high-throughput capacity system to analyse bacteria-mycotoxin interactions.
