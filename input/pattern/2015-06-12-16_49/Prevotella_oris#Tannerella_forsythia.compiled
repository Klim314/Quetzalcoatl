TI  - Microbial dynamics during conversion from supragingival to subgingival biofilms in an in vitro model.
AB  - The development of dental caries and periodontal diseases result from distinct shifts in the microbiota of the tooth-associated biofilm. This in vitro study aimed to investigate changes in biofilm composition and structure, during the shift from a "supragingival" aerobic to a "subgingival" anaerobic profile. Biofilms consisting of Actinomyces oris, Candida albicans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mutans and Veillonella dispar were aerobically grown in saliva-containing medium on hydroxyapatite discs. After 64 h, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia and Streptococcus anginosus were further added along with human serum, while culture conditions were shifted to microaerophilic. After 96 h, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola were finally added and the biofilm was grown anaerobically for another 64 h. At the end of each phase, biofilms were harvested for species-specific quantification and localization. Apart from C. albicans, all other species gradually increased during aerobic and microaerophilic conditions, but remained steady during anaerobic conditions. Biofilm thickness was doubled during the microaerophilic phase, but remained steady throughout the anaerobic phase. Extracellular polysaccharide presence was gradually reduced throughout the growth period. Biofilm viability was reduced during the microaerophilic conversion, but was recovered during the anaerobic phase. This in vitro study has characterized the dynamic structural shifts occurring in an oral biofilm model during the switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, potentially modeling the conversion of supragingival to subgingival biofilms. Within the limitations of this experimental model, the findings may provide novel insights into the ecology of oral biofilms. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
TI  - Colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. This in vitro study investigated the colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola). METHODS: The grown biofilm consisted of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Veillonella dispar, P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, T. forsythia, T. denticola, Actinomyces oris, Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". After 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: Exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected S. oralis, but not other species. The "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. A co-localisation trend was observed between P. gingivalis and T. denticola, as determined by FISH. However, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially S. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both CLSM and SEM. CONCLUSIONS: While the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. This antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.
TI  - Impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. The model included Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus anginosus, Actinomycesoris, Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, Veillonella dispar, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola. Based on literature, we considered Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus anginosus, and Actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. We quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative PCR and further compared the structures using confocal laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. The absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. The biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. However, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. In the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. Moreover, besides a significant increase of P. intermedia and a decrease of P. gingivalis , P. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. A. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. Hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on P. intermedia and P. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. Streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of P. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence P. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.
TI  - Suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Suppuration (SUP) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. The aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with SUP in patients with chronic (CP) and aggressive (AgP) periodontitis. METHODS: A total of 156 patients with CP and 66 with AgP were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). The counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. Comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests, respectively. Associations between frequency of SUP and bacterial species were analyzed by the Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The prevalence of SUP in patients with CP was 24.4%, and in patients with AgP it was 30.3%, and the percentage of SUP sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (P >0.05). SUP sites from patients with CP had significantly higher counts of Veillonella parvula, Dialister pneumosintes, Tannerella forsythia, and Prevotella nigrescens than SUP sites from patients with AgP (P <0.005). Significant positive correlations between high frequency of SUP and high levels of Actinomyces spp, Streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with CP (P <0.05). In patients with AgP, Actinomyces oris, Propionibacterium acnes, P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with SUP, whereas Prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with SUP (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: SUP sites from patients with CP harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than SUP sites from patients with AgP. Actinomyces spp., Streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, T. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with SUP.
TI  - Validation of a quantitative real-time PCR assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. Owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. The aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming unit (CFU) counts on selective agar plates. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 10 species included in the in vitro biofilm were Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus anginosus, Veillonella dispar, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, Actinomyces oris, Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia. The numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qPCR, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of CFUs after growth on selective agar plates. RESULTS: All 10 species were successfully quantified using qPCR and FISH or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers of CFUs after growth on selective agar. In early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between methods. In late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qPCR and FISH or immunofluorescence, but not by CFU counts, maintained significant correlation. CFU counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. CONCLUSION: Quantitative PCR and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. However, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. This may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.
TI  - Exploring bacterial diversity of endodontic microbiota by cloning and sequencing  16S rRNA.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The characterization of microbial communities infecting the endodontic system in each clinical condition may help on the establishment of a correct prognosis and distinct strategies of treatment. The purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial diversity in primary endodontic infections by 16S ribosomal-RNA (rRNA) sequence analysis. METHODS: Samples from root canals of untreated asymptomatic teeth (n = 12) exhibiting periapical lesions were obtained, 16S rRNA bacterial genomic libraries were constructed and sequenced, and bacterial diversity was estimated. RESULTS: A total of 489 clones were analyzed (mean, 40.7 +/- 8.0 clones per sample). Seventy phylotypes were identified of which six were novel phylotypes belonging to the family Ruminococcaceae. The mean number of taxa per canal was 10.0, ranging from 3 to 21 per sample; 65.7% of the cloned sequences represented phylotypes for which no cultivated isolates have been reported. The most prevalent taxa were Atopobium rimae (50.0%), Dialister invisus, Prevotella oris, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and Tannerella forsythia (33.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Although several key species predominate in endodontic samples of asymptomatic cases with periapical lesions, the primary endodontic infection is characterized by a wide bacterial diversity, which is mostly represented by members of the phylum Firmicutes belonging to the class Clostridia followed by the phylum Bacteroidetes.
TI  - Clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  - It has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. It is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. To investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the DNA-DNA hybridization technique. Actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. Factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for T. forsythia, Campylobacter rectus, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, Parvimonas micra, and Treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of A. oris, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Eikenella corrodens, Streptococcus intermedius, Selenomonas noxia, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Veillonella parvula. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while Fusobacterium nucleatum loaded on both. These findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.
