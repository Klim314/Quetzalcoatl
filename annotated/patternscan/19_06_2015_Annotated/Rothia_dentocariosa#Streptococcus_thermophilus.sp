TI  == inhibition of microbial adhesion to silicone rubber treated with biosurfactant from streptococcus thermophilus a.
AB  == microbial adhesion of four bacterial and two yeast strains isolated from explanted voice prostheses to silicone rubber before and after conditioning with  a biosurfactant obtained from the probiotic bacterium streptococcus thermophilus  a was investigated in a parallel plate flow chamber. the silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed biosurfactant layer was characterized using contact angle measurements. water contact angles indicated that the silicone rubber surface with adsorbed biosurfactant was more hydrophilic (58 degrees) than bare silicone  rubber (109 degrees). the results obtained showed that the biosurfactant was effective in decreasing the initial deposition rates, and the number of bacterial cells adhering after 4 h, for all microorganisms tested. a decrease in the initial deposition rate was observed for rothia dentocariosa gbj 52/2b and staphylococcus aureus gb 2/1 from 1937+/-194 to 179+/-21 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1) and from 1255+/-54 to 233+/-26 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), respectively, accounting for an 86% reduction of the initial deposition rate for both strains.  the number of bacterial cells adhering to the silicone rubber with preadsorbed biosurfactant after 4 h was further reduced by 89% and 97% by the two strains, respectively. the two yeast strains tested showed less reduction in adhesion after 4 h, to values between 67% and 70%. such a pretreatment with surface-active compounds may constitute a promising strategy to reduce the microbial colonization rate of silicone rubber voice prostheses.
