TI  == natural antimicrobials subtilosin and lauramide arginine ethyl ester synergize with conventional antibiotics clindamycin and metronidazole against biofilms of gardnerella vaginalis but not against biofilms of healthy vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of clindamycin and metronidazole to synergize with natural antimicrobials against biofilms of bacterial vaginosis (bv)-associated gardnerella vaginalis. minimum bactericidal concentrations for biofilm cells (mbcs-b) were determined for each antimicrobial. the mbcs-b of lauramide arginine ethyl ester (lae), subtilosin, clindamycin and metronidazole were 50, 69.5, 20 and 500 mug ml(-1), respectively. a checkerboard  assay and isobologram were used to analyze the type of interactions between these antimicrobials. the combination of metronidazole with natural antimicrobials did  not inhibit planktonic lactobacilli. clindamycin with either lae or with subtilosin was inhibitory for planktonic but not for biofilm-associated lactobacilli. all tested antimicrobial combinations were inhibitory for bv-associated mobiluncus curtisii and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. lae and subtilosin synergized with clindamycin and metronidazole against biofilms of g. vaginalis but not biofilm-associated vaginal lactobacilli. the biofilms of bv-associated pathogens can be controlled by synergistically acting combinations  of conventional antibiotics and natural antimicrobials which will help better management of current antibiotics, especially considering robust bacterial resistance. our findings create a foundation for a new strategy in the effective  control of vaginal infections.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of preparation bioaron c.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of sirupus bioaron c, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of aloe arborescens, was tested against  different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. the experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus candida and on 18 reference strains (atcc). the antimicrobial activity  of bioaron c (mbc and mfc) was determined at undiluted concentration. bioaron c proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. at the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (mbc, mfc) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, parvimonas micra, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus anginosus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans, already after 15 min. the mic of bioaron c against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. the great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. bioaron c  may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.

TI  == a comparative antimicrobial analysis of various root canal irrigating solutions on endodontic pathogens: an in vitro study.
AB  == background and objectives: evolution in understanding the poly-microbial environment of both endodontic infections and that of failed root canal treatments has been debatable over the years. the present study was designed to compare and analyze the effect of various root canal irrigation solutions on certain endodontic pathogens in vitro. materials and methods: to analyze in vitro the zone of inhibition of the micro-organisms the following irrigating solutions  were employed: a. sodium hypochlorite (naocl) 5% b. sodium hypochlorite (naocl) 3% c. chlorhexidine 2% d. chlorhexidine (chx) 0.12% e. doxycycline 0.01% f. doxycycline 0.005% g. mtad. an agar culture plate inoculated with four endodontic pathogens was used namely 1. enterococcus faecalis (mtcc-439) 2. candida albicans (mtcc-183) 3. fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc-25586) 4. peptostreptococcus anaerobius (atcc-27337) the inoculums were streaked out on the trypticase soy agar plate for discrete colonies with a wire loop using standard method. the inoculated plates carrying the antibiotic disks were incubated in an anaerobic jar in the following way-anaerobic incubation-the following procedure was used to provide anaerobiosis with an increased concentration of carbon dioxide. by this method the zone of inhibition obtained by different irrigating solutions against  different pathogens could be compared. results: mtad showed maximum antibacterial activity. in case of c. albicans mtad was less effective than 5% naocl, 3% naocl  and 2% chx, 0.12% chx. however, it was more effective against e. faecalis, f. nuleatum and p. anaerobicus. in any case, antimicrobial activity is not the only  prerequisite for an endodontic irrigant. e. faecalis strain used in this study showed resistance to doxycycline; also doxycycline was ineffective against c. albicans at 0.01% and 0.005% concentrations. conclusion: it was found that mtad was more antimicrobial than 5% naocl for some of the test micro-organisms; however the ability of mtad to dissolve pulp tissue is not comparable to 5% naocl. in addition, 5 and 3% naocl showed signifcant antimicrobial activity against all test micro-organisms. the best option for a primary endodontic irrigant therefore is 5% naocl.

TI  == efficacy and safety of intravenous azithromycin followed by oral azithromycin for the treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease and perihepatitis in japanese  women.
AB  == pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) is mainly caused by ascending infection from the vaginal flora including the sexually transmitted organisms, neisseria gonorrhoeae and chlamydia trachomatis, and lower genital tract endogenous anaerobes, leading to serious consequences including infertility and ectopic pregnancy. to evaluate the efficacy and safety of azithromycin in the treatment of pid that requires initial intravenous therapy, we conducted a multicenter, unblinded, non-comparative phase 3 trial. intravenous azithromycin (500 mg, once  daily) for 1 or 2 days followed by oral azithromycin (250 mg once daily) to complete a total of 7 days treatment was administered to 60 japanese women with acute pid. the clinical and bacteriological responses were assessed at the end of treatment, and on days 15 and 29. the most commonly detected baseline causative pathogens were c. trachomatis (12 strains), prevotella bivia (10 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (7 strains), n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (6 strains each). the clinical success rate on day 15 was 94.1% (48/51 subjects including perihepatitis). the clinical efficacy and bacterial eradication rates against c. trachomatis and n. gonorrhoeae (including 2 quinolone-resistant strains) were both 100%. common treatment-related adverse events were diarrhoea, injection site pain, and nausea. all adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. azithromycin intravenous-to-oral switch therapy demonstrated excellent clinical and bacteriological effects for pid caused by various etiologic agents including quinolone-resistant strains and strains with low susceptibility to azithromycin at in vitro testing. the therapy was well tolerated in the treatment of pid in japanese women. registration number: nct00871494.

TI  == preservation of fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius dna after loss of cell viability.
AB  == aim: to investigate whether dna from two obligate anaerobes, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, is recoverable after loss of cell viability induced by air exposure. methodology: harvested cultures of f. nucleatum and p. anaerobius were killed by exposure to air and stored in phosphate-buffered saline. dead cells were incubated aerobically for up to 6 months. every month, the presence of detectable dna in the cell pellet and supernatant was assessed by conventional and quantitative pcr. cell staining techniques were used to characterize the cell wall permeability of air-killed cells. scanning electron microscopy was used to examine viable, freshly killed and stored cells. results: with conventional pcr, amplifiable dna was detectable  over 6 months in all samples. quantitative pcr showed a progressive fall in dna concentration in nonviable cell pellets and a concomitant rise in dna concentration in the supernatant. dna staining showed that some air-killed cells  retained an intact cell wall. after storage, sem of both air-killed species revealed shrivelling of the cells, but some cells of p. anaerobius retained their initial form. conclusion: amplifiable dna from f. nucleatum and p. anaerobius was detectable 6 months after loss of viability. air-killed anaerobes initially retained their cell form, but cells gradually shriveled over time. the morphological changes were more pronounced with the gram-negative f. nucleatum than the gram-positive p. anaerobius. over 6 months, there was a gradual increase in cell wall permeability with progressive leakage of dna. bacterial dna was recoverable long after loss of cell viability.

TI  == bacteriological evaluation of tonsillar microbial flora according to age and tonsillar size in recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == although numerous studies based on the bacteriology of the tonsil have been carried out, none of them analyzed the variation of tonsillar flora with respect  to both age and tonsillar size. the purpose of this study was to isolate the facultative and obligate anaerobes both from the surface and the core of tonsils  in recurrent tonsillitis as well as to analyze the variation of isolated bacterial strains according to age and tonsillar size. a prospective study was performed on 111 patients who underwent tonsillectomy. we analyzed the differences between the bacterial pathogens in recurrent tonsillitis and semi-growth estimates with regard to age and tonsillar grade. among 111 cases, 604 bacterial strains of 21 different from the tonsil superficial and core were isolated. the most common facultative anaerobic species isolated from the surface and core were coagulase-negative staphylococci, alpha-hemolytic streptococci and  diphtheroid bacilli in all subgroups except patients below 8 years old. the most  commonly obligate anaerobic species isolated from the core were propionibacterium acnes, prevotella melaninogenica and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. we found no significant difference in the cultured bacteria with respect to age and tonsillar size. the study subgroups did not differ in the occurrence of semiquantitative growth estimates of 3-4+. our study demonstrates that there is polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic flora in tonsils with regardless of patient's age and tonsillar size. this polymicrobial spectrum of bacteria may contribute to recurrence and to the failure of conservative treatment of these cases and therefore leads to surgical therapy.

AB  == a gram-positive staining, rod-shaped, non-motile, spore-forming obligately anaerobic bacterium, designated cribt, was isolated from the gastro-intestinal tract of a rat and characterized. the major cellular fatty acids of strain cribt  were saturated and unsaturated straight-chain c12-c19 fatty acids, with c16:0 being the predominant fatty acid. the polar lipid profile comprised six glycolipids, four phospholipids and one lipid that did not stain with any of the  specific spray reagents used. the only quinone was mk-6. the predominating cell-wall sugars were glucose and galactose. the peptidoglycan type of strain cribt was a1sigma lanthionine-direct. the genomic dna g+c content of strain cribt was 28.1 mol%. on the basis of 16s rrna gene sequence similarity, strain cribt was most closely related to a number of species of the genus clostridium, including clostridium lituseburense (97.2%), clostridium glycolicum (96.2%), clostridium mayombei (96.2%), clostridium bartlettii (96.0%) and clostridium irregulare (95.5%). all these species show very low 16s rrna gene sequence similarity (<85%) to the type strain of clostridium butyricum, the type species of the genus clostridium. dna-dna hybridization with closely related reference strains indicated reassociation values below 32%. on the basis of phenotypic and  genetic studies, a novel genus, romboutsia gen. nov., is proposed. the novel isolate cribt (=dsm 25109t=nizo 4048t) is proposed as the type strain of the type species, romboutsia ilealis gen. nov., sp. nov., of the proposed novel genus. it  is proposed that c. lituseburense is transferred to this genus as romboutsia lituseburensis comb. nov. furthermore, the reclassification into novel genera is  proposed for c. bartlettii, as intestinibacter bartlettii gen. nov., comb. nov. (type species of the genus), c. glycolicum, as terrisporobacter glycolicus gen. nov., comb. nov. (type species of the genus), c. mayombei, as terrisporobacter mayombei gen. nov., comb. nov., and c. irregulare, as asaccharospora irregularis  gen. nov., comb. nov. (type species of the genus), on the basis of additional data collected in this study. in addition, an emendation of the species peptostreptococcus anaerobius and the order eubacteriales is provided.

TI  == the effects of a mineral trioxide aggregate-based sealer on the production of reactive oxygen species, nitrogen species and cytokines by two macrophage subtypes.
AB  == aim: to test the effects of a mineral trioxide aggregate-based sealer (mta fillapex((r))) and mta (mta-angelus((r))) on viability and on the production of cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ros) and nitrogen species (no) by m1 and m2 inflammatory macrophages. methodology: m1 (from c57bl/6 mice) and m2 (from balb/c mice) peritoneal inflammatory macrophages were obtained and cultured in vitro in  the presence of original and diluted extracts of mta and mta fillapex (flpx). the cell viability, ros release and the release of tumour necrosis factor-a, interleukin (il)-12, il-10 and no in response to stimulation with interferon-gamma and fusobacterium nucleatum or peptostreptococcus anaerobius were evaluated. the data were analysed using the mann-whitney test and student's  t-test. results: fillapex was cytotoxic at the highest concentrations (1:1;1:2) and decreased the viability (p < 0.05) of both macrophage types (<20%). mta did not interfere with cellular viability. flpx inhibited the release of ros and decreased no release in f. nucleatum and p. anaerobius -stimulated m1 and m2 macrophages (</=25 mu mol l(-1)). f. nucleatum-stimulated m2 macrophage cultures  released lower levels of tnf-alpha when flpx was added (</=1 ng ml(-1)). m2 macrophages released higher (>5 ng ml(-1)) levels of il-10 than m1 macrophages. only m1 macrophage cultures produced il-12p70. conclusions: fillapex impaired effector immune responses during inflammation (m1 macrophages), as well as during healing (m2 macrophages) responses.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).

AB  == an amies agar gel swab transport system was evaluated for its ability to maintain bacterial viability and relative quantity after freezing at -80 degrees c. nine american type culture collection (atcc) bacterial strains were used: 3 anaerobic  strains (propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and clostridium  sporogenes) and 6 facultative or strict aerobic bacterial strains (stenotrophomonas maltophilia, escherichia coli ([atcc 25922 and atcc 11775], salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium, staphylococcus saprophyticus, and lactobacillus casei). the bacterial species were chosen because they corresponded to bacteria identified in psittacine feces and cloacal  samples. there were no significant differences between growth scores at baseline  and after storage at -80 degrees c for 40 days for any of the bacteria examined after 48 and 72 hr of incubation, with the exception of p. anaerobius. for p. anaerobius, there was a significant reduction (p < 0.001) in the growth score after storage at -80 degrees c for 40 days from that of the baseline; however, the bacteria were still viable. the tested swab transport system may be useful when lengthy storage and transport times necessitate freezing samples prior to culture.

TI  == peptostreptococcus russellii sp. nov., isolated from a swine-manure storage pit.
AB  == using a polyphasic approach, a taxonomic study was performed on seven strains of  an unknown gram-reaction-positive, non-spore-forming, obligately anaerobic coccus-shaped bacterium, isolated from a swine-manure storage pit. comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing confirmed that all seven isolates were highly related to each other and formed a hitherto unknown lineage within the clostridial rrna xi cluster of organisms. pairwise analysis demonstrated that the novel organism was  most closely related to peptostreptococcus anaerobius ccug 7835(t) and peptostreptococcus stomatis ccug 51858(t) with 16s rrna gene sequence similarities of 95.5 and 93.0 %, respectively. the peptidoglycan type of the cell wall was determined to be a4alpha l-lys-d-asp and glucose, xylose and traces of mannose were detected as the cell-wall sugars. based on biochemical, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic evidence the unknown bacterium represents a new species of the genus peptostreptococcus, for which the name peptostreptococcus russellii sp. nov, is proposed. the type strain is rt-10b(t) ( = ccug 58235(t) =  nrrl b-59380(t) = dsm 23041(t)).

TI  == competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == objective: to investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. material and methods: the antimicrobial activity  of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains.  four probiotic bacterial species (lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium) were isolated from  yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. results: fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. in addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', streptococcus sanguinis. the competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. when probiotics were inoculated first, bifidobacterium inhibited porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas circumdentaria, and prevotella nigrescens; l. acidophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. circumdentaria, p. nigrescens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius; l. bulgaricus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. nigrescens; and s. thermophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and p. nigrescens. however, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens)  were inoculated simultaneously. when periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, prevotella intermedia inhibited bifidobacterium and s. thermophilus. conclusions: the results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are  capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.

TI  == antagonism and synergism in gardnerella vaginalis strains isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == antagonistic and synergistic substances are important for interactions between micro-organisms associated with human body surfaces, either in healthy or in diseased conditions. in the present study, such compounds produced by gardnerella vaginalis strains isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis (bv) were detected in vitro and the antagonistic ones were partially characterized. among 11 g. vaginalis strains tested, all showed antagonistic activity against at least one of the 22 indicator bacteria assayed. interestingly, for some of these strains, antagonism reverted to synergism, favouring one of the indicator strains (peptostreptococcus anaerobius) when the growth medium was changed. partial characterization of antagonistic substances suggested a bacteriocin-like chemical nature. depending on growth conditions, g. vaginalis isolated from women with bv  produced antagonistic or synergistic compounds for other bacterial components of  the vaginal ecosystem. this is the first report to our knowledge of the production of antagonistic and/or synergistic substances by g. vaginalis. this ability may be a pivotal factor in understanding bv and the ecological role of this bacterium in the vaginal environment.

TI  == starvation response and growth in serum of fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, prevotella intermedia, and pseudoramibacter alactolyticus.
AB  == the microbiota inhabiting the untreated root canal differ markedly from those found in post-treatment disease, yet there is limited information on the microbial characteristics distinguishing the different infections. we hypothesized that starvation survival is a key microbial property in species selection. this study analyzed starvation-survival behavior over 60 days of species representative of the untreated root canal infection: fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, prevotella intermedia and pseudoramibacter alactolyticus. all species did not survive 1 day in water. in 1% serum, the 4 species could not survive beyond 2-3 weeks. they required a high initial cell density and >or=10% serum to survive the observation period. the results highlight a poor starvation-survival capacity of these 4 species compared with species prevalent in post-treatment infection, which are well equipped to endure starvation and survive in low numbers on minimal serum. these findings point to starvation-survival capacity as a selection factor for microbial participation in post-treatment disease.

TI  == the antimicrobial effects of hops (humulus lupulus l.) on ruminal hyper ammonia-producing bacteria.
AB  == aim: to assess the antimicrobial effects of hops (humulus lupulus l.) on hyper ammonia producing-bacteria (hab), which catabolize amino acids and peptides in the bovine rumen. methods and results: when media were amended with dried hops or hops extract (30.7% lupulone), ammonia production by mixed rumen bacteria was inhibited. the growth and ammonia production of pure cultures (peptostreptococcus anaerobius, clostridium aminophilum, or clostridium sticklandii) was inhibited by 30 ppm lupulone at ph 6.7, and bactericidal activity was observed at ph 5.6. when hops extract was added to energized cell suspensions, the intracellular ph rapidly decreased and intracellular potassium was lost. conclusions: the three hab species were sensitive to the antimicrobial components in hops, and the inhibition of ammonia production by mixed rumen bacteria indicates that similar effects could be expected in the rumen. significance and impact of the study: as  much as half of the amino acids consumed by ruminants can be lost due to microbial degradation in the rumen. this study supports the idea that biologically active plant metabolites can be used to mitigate this wasteful process.

TI  == the ability of non-bacteriocin producing streptococcus bovis strains to bind and  transfer bovicin hc5 to other sensitive bacteria.
AB  == streptococcus bovis hc5 produces a broad spectrum lantibiotic (bovicin hc5), but  s. bovis jb1 does not have antimicrobial activity. preliminary experiments revealed an anomaly. when s. bovis jb1 cells were washed in stationary phase s. bovis hc5 cell-free culture supernatant, the s. bovis jb1 cells were subsequently able to inhibit hyper-ammonia producing ruminal bacteria (clostridium sticklandii, clostridium aminophilum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius). other non-bacteriocin producing s. bovis strains also had the ability to bind and transfer semi-purified bovicin hc5. bovicin hc5 that was bound to s. bovis jb1 was much more resistant to pronase e than cell-free bovicin hc5, but it could be  inactivated if the incubation period was 24 h. acidic nacl treatment (100 mm, ph  2.0) liberates half of the bovicin hc5 from s. bovis hc5, but it did not prevent  bovicin hc5 from binding to s. bovis jb1. acidic nacl liberated some bovicin hc5  from s. bovis jb1, but the decrease in activity was only 2-fold. bovicin hc5 is a positively charged peptide, and the ability of s. bovis jb1 to bind bovicin hc5 could be inhibited by either calcium or magnesium (100 mm). acidic nacl-treated s. bovis jb1 cells were unable to accumulate potassium, but they were still able  to bind bovicin hc5 and prevent potassium accumulation by untreated s. bovis jb1  cells. based on these results, bovicin hc5 bound to s. bovis jb1 cells still acts as a pore-forming lantibiotic.

TI  == the role of toll-like receptors 2 and 4 on reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide production by macrophage cells stimulated with root canal pathogens.
AB  == introduction: periapical lesions arise as a result of the activation and interaction of the host immune responses against root canal infection. recently identified toll-like receptors (tlr) seem to be involved in the recognition and development of immune responses against a myriad of microorganisms. however, very little information is available on the role of tlr in the induction of periapical lesions. method: the role of tlr-2 and tlr-4 in the activation of murine macrophages stimulated using fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius was investigated. the production of nitric oxide (no) and reactive oxygen species (ros) was assessed. results: the results demonstrate that tlr-2 and tlr-4 are involved in the production of ros by activated macrophages. the microorganisms induced similar levels of no production by tlr-2-competent and tlr-2-deficient macrophages, regardless of the addition of interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma), ruling out a role for tlr-2 in the no production induced by these bacteria. only p. anaerobius induced no production by tlr-4-competent macrophages without the addition of ifn-gamma. however, after ifn-gamma addition, f. nucleatum induced macrophage no production. therefore, no production stimulated by ifn-gamma and these microorganisms seems to be tlr-4-independent. conclusion:  tlr-2 seems to be involved in the induction of ros production by macrophages in response to prevalent root canal bacteria, while only f. nucleatum induced ros production by tlr-4-competent macrophages. both microorganisms significantly induced large amounts of no independent of tlr-2 and tlr-4. we conclude that microorganisms may participate in the induction and progression of periapical lesions through no and ros production by activated macrophages.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  == human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to obtain recombinant hbd3 (rhbd3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of hbd3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. genetic engineering was used to obtain active rhbd3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals,  including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. in an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rhbd3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. the ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. we conclude that hbd3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.

AB  == samples from infected root canals of 43 teeth with chronic apical periodontitis were analyzed for the presence and relative levels of 83 oral bacterial species and/or phylotypes using a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. associations between the most frequently detected taxa were also recorded. the most prevalent taxa were olsenella uli (74%), eikenella corrodens (63%), porphyromonas endodontalis (56%), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (54%), and bacteroidetes oral clone x083 (51%). when prevalence was considered only for bacteria present at levels >10(5), bacteroidetes clone x083 was the most frequently isolated bacterium (37%), followed by parvimonas micra (28%), e. corrodens (23%), and tannerella forsythia (19%). the number of target taxa per canal was directly proportional to the size of the apical periodontitis lesion, with lesions >10 mm in diameter harboring a mean number of approximately 20 taxa. several positive associations for the most prevalent taxa were disclosed for the  first time and may have important ecological and pathogenic implications. in addition to strengthening the association of several cultivable named species with chronic apical periodontitis, the present findings using a large-scale analysis allowed the inclusion of some newly named species and as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with  this disease.

AB  == this study assessed the influence of mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) on adaptive immune responses. balb/c mice were immunized with heat-killed fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) in mta or other control adjuvants, and serum igg responses to fn were measured. either fn- or peptostreptococcus anaerobius (pa)-reactive memory t cells (tm) were preincubated in vitro with/without mta and restimulated with fn or pa. tm proliferation and cytokine production were assessed. compared with control groups, immunoglobulin g-antibody responses were upregulated in mice immunized with fn in mta in a similar manner to animals immunized with fn in freund's adjuvant or aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. although mta did not affect the upregulated expression of interleukin 10, tumor necrosis factor alpha, or rankl by tm, it suppressed the proliferation of pa- or fn-tm and inhibited their production of th1- or th2-signature cytokines. mta upregulated the adaptive humoral immune responses but had little or no effect on pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokine production by tm.

TI  == quantitative survival of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in port-a-cul and copan transport systems.
AB  == transport media should preserve the viability and stability of microorganisms in  clinical specimens. in this study, the port-a-cul transport system and the copan  transport system without charcoal, both designed to preserve anaerobes, were evaluated. dacron swabs were inoculated with two combinations of facultative and  anaerobic organisms typically found in vaginal swab samples. combination i contained candida albicans, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., group b streptococci, lactobacillus crispatus, and staphylococcus aureus. combination ii  contained lactobacillus iners, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, mobiluncus curtisii, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and gardnerella vaginalis. duplicate swabs were placed into the two transporters and held for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 4 and 24 degrees c. both transporters maintained the viability of organisms better at 4 degrees c than at 24 degrees c. prevotella bivia and prevotella corporis had a loss of viability in both transporters at both temperatures. however, at 24 degrees c, there was a significantly greater loss of viability for mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, and peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus when the organisms were stored in copan transport  medium than when they were stored in port-a-cul transport medium for 96 h (p < 0.002). some organisms proliferated in the transport media, but when transporters were held at 24 degrees c for 96 h, a significantly greater increase in the concentrations of group b streptococci and candida albicans, escherichia coli, and enterococcus spp. organisms in copan medium than in port-a-cul medium was observed (p < 0.002). at room temperature, the port-a-cul system is superior to the copan system with respect to the preservation of fastidious microorganisms and the prevention of the proliferation of facultative organisms.

AB  == this present study investigated the changes in bacterial community composition, with an emphasis on lactobacillus spp. and streptococcus suis populations as potentially beneficial and harmful groups, in the stomach, jejunum and ileum of piglets after weaning (21 days postpartum) by 16s rrna gene-based methods. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis showed that, after weaning, predominant bands related to lactobacillus spp. disappeared and were replaced by  potential pathogenic species, such as peptostreptococcus anaerobius, moraxella cuniculi, s. suis and porphyromonas catoniae. real-time pcr revealed that the abundances of lactobacilli and lactobacillus sobrius as a proportion of total bacterial abundance were significantly lower in the stomach, jejunum and ileum of weaned piglets than in 21-day-old piglets. a specific and sensitive real-time pcr assay was developed for quantification of the important pathogen s. suis within gastrointestinal microbiota. the assay showed that s. suis predominated in the stomach samples of weaned piglets with population levels up to 10(7) copies g(-1) digesta, while it was not detected in the stomach before weaning. streptococcus suis was not dominant in the jejunum and ileum digesta before weaning, but became dominant after weaning, with population levels up to 10(7) copies g(-1) digesta.  the results demonstrated for the first time the postweaning dominance of the potentially harmful s. suis in piglet intestine. the results also suggest that the defensive barrier of the stomach can be impaired as s. suis became dominant while the proportion of lactobacillus populations decreased after weaning, which  may further result in an increase of s. suis abundance in the intestine.

AB  == hypothesis: increasing rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) infections have also affected the microbial profile  of breast abscesses. objective: to update the decade-old bacteriologic description of breast abscesses to improve the choice of initial antibacterial drug therapy. design: retrospective case series. setting: county hospital emergency department. patients: forty-four women (mean age, 41 years; age range,  20-63 years) with breast abscesses. methods: all cultures from the breast abscesses of patients were reviewed. main outcome measures: the microbiologic features and sensitivities of breast abscesses. results: of 46 specimens only 28  showed bacterial yield (61%). of these, 11 (39%) were polymicrobial, for an average of 1.4 isolates per specimen. the most common organism was s aureus, present in 12 of 37 aerobic cultures (32%), with mrsa in 7 (58%). the remaining organisms included coagulase-negative staphylococcus (16%), diphtheroids (16%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), proteus mirabilis (5%), and other isolates (22%). all mrsa was sensitive to clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and linezolid. only 2 patients (29%) were sensitive to levofloxacin. two anaerobic cultures were positive for propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. conclusions: staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogenic organism in modern breast abscesses. many breast abscesses have community-acquired mrsa, with more than 50% of all s aureus and 19% of all cultures being mrsa. this finding parallels the local and national increases in mrsa reported in other soft-tissue infections. with increasing bacterial resistance and more minimally invasive management of breast abscesses, understanding the current bacteriologic profile of these abscesses is essential to determining the correct empirical antibiotic drug therapy.

TI  == production of antagonistic substance by eikenella corrodens isolated from the oral cavity of human beings with and without periodontal disease.
AB  == aims: antagonistic abilities may confer ecological advantages for micro-organisms in competitive ecosystems. however, reports regarding this phenomenon in eikenella corrodens are not available. methods and results: nineteen e. corrodens strains, isolated from the oral cavity of human beings without periodontal disease (n = 5) and with aggressive (n = 9) and chronic (n = 5) periodontitis, as well as a reference strain (e. corrodens atcc23834), were evaluated for antagonistic activity. the following indicators were used: porphyromonas gingivalis fdc381, prevotella intermedia atcc25611, actinomyces israelii atcc12102, eubacterium lentum atcc25559, peptostreptococcus anaerobius atcc27337, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans fdcy4, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc10953, streptococcus sanguinis atcc10557, streptococcus uberis atcc9927, streptococcus mutans im/ufrj, staphylococcus aureus atcc33591 and candida albicans atcc18804. all the strains showed antagonism against at least one of the indicator strains.  this phenomenon was more frequently observed for strains isolated from patients with chronic periodontitis (36.4%), than those from healthy subjects (20.6%) and  those with aggressive periodontitis (10.8%). conclusions: the heterogeneous antagonistic spectrum exhibited by e. corrodens isolates suggests their ability to produce more than one antagonistic substance, whose ecological relevance is yet to be demonstrated. significance and impact of the study: this is the first description of antagonistic compound production by e. corrodens and its relationships with the clinical status of the patients.

AB  == qualitative and quantitative composition of gastric microflora has been studied in 30 children with chronic gastritis. bacteriological study of gastric biopsies  and parietal mucus in 10 children with chronic gastritis not associated with helicobacter pylori more frequently revealed conditionally pathogenic bacteria--escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus viridans, s. pyogenes (group a), peptostreptococcus anaerobius, p. prevotii and their associations. in 20 studied patients with h.pylori-associated chronic gastritis composition of local microflora was less diverse--conditionally pathogenic, lacto- and bifidobacteria often were absent. study showed that eradication of h.  pylori led to appearance of conditionally pathogenic bacteria in stomach microflora, which were frequently isolated in associations. not effective treatment was associated with disappearance of lacto- and bifidobacteria and frequent isolation of candida albicans.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis samples from different geographical origins against certain oral pathogens.
AB  == propolis is an agent having antimicrobial properties, however, its composition can vary depending on the area where it is collected. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of five propolis samples, collected from four different regions in turkey and from brazil, against nine anaerobic strains was evaluated.  ethanol extracts of propolis (eep) were prepared from propolis samples and we determined minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) of eep on the growth of test microorganisms by using agar dilution method. all strains were susceptible and mic values ranged from 4 to 512 microg/ml for propolis activity. propolis from kazan-ankara showed most effective mic values to the studied microorganisms. mbc values of kazan-ankara eep samples  were ranged from 8 to 512 microg/ml. death was observed within 4 h of incubation  for peptostreptococcus anaerobius and micros and lactobacillus acidophilus and actinomyces naeslundii, while 8 h for prevotella oralis and prevotella melaninogenica and porphyromonas gingivalis, 12 h for fusobacterium nucleatum, 16 h for veillonella parvula. it was shown that propolis samples were more effective against gram positive anaerobic bacteria than gram negative ones. the organic chemical compositions of eeps were determined by high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (gc-ms). the main compounds of eeps were flavonoids such as pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine, chrysin and aromatic acids such as cafeic acid. because of increased antimicrobial resistance, propolis may be kept in mind in the treatment of oral cavity diseases.

TI  == activities of four frog skin-derived antimicrobial peptides (temporin-1dra, temporin-1va and the melittin-related peptides ar-23 and rv-23) against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activities of two antimicrobial peptides belonging to the temporin family (temporin-1dra from rana draytonii and temporin-1va from rana virgatipes) and two peptides with structural similarity to the bee venom peptide melittin (ar-23 from rana tagoi and rv-23 from r. draytonii) were evaluated against a range of reference strains and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. these peptides were selected because they show broad-spectrum growth inhibitory activity against reference strains of several medically important aerobic microorganisms and against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. all peptides showed relatively high potency (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) </=25 microm) against the gram-positive bacilli propionibacterium acnes and clostridium tertium and the gram-positive cocci peptostreptococcus anaerobius. activity was lower and more variable against clostridium septicum, clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. growth of the gram-negative  bacilli bacteroides fragilis and fusobacterium spp. was poorly inhibited, but all the peptides were active (mic</=25 microm) against prevotella melaninogenica. the clinical utility of the melittin-related peptides is limited by their toxicities, but temporin-1dra and temporin-1va have relatively low haemolytic activity against human erythrocytes and so represent candidates for drug development, particularly for topical therapy of infected surface lesions.

TI  == an in vitro time-kill assessment of linezolid and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == linezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains), streptococci (including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae), and other aerobic and facultative bacteria. the agent has also demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. previous time-kill assessments have shown linezolid to be generally bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci, and bactericidal against streptococci. in this study, an anaerobic glovebox technique was employed to conduct time-kill assessments for four strains of anaerobic gram-positive, and seven strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. the time-kill experiment was performed using anaerobe broth medium. the drugs were tested at four-fold the minimum inhibitory  concentration (mic), or at the higher concentration of 8mg/l for linezolid, 2mg/l for clindamycin, and 8mg/l for metronidazole. samples for viable count were taken at 0, 6, and 24h, and plated using the bioscience international autospiral dw. exposure of samples to the aerobic environment during plating was held to less than 30min. plates were counted after a 48h anaerobic incubation (37 degrees c).  the species tested included bacteroides fragilis (2), b. distasonis, b. thetaiotaomicron, fusobacterium nucleatum, f. varium, prevotella melaninogenica,  clostridium perfringens, eubacterium lentum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (2). the activity of linezolid was compared to that of metronidazole and clindamycin, two standard anti-anaerobe agents. as expected, the control agents were very active in these assays. metronidazole yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions  of 3.0 or greater for nine of ten strains; clindamycin yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for three  strains. linezolid also produced significant in vitro killing in this model achieving log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for four strains. the profile of activity was similar to that of clindamycin indicating that additional developmental studies of linezolid with anaerobic bacteria are warranted.

TI  == taxonomy--general comments and update on taxonomy of clostridia and anaerobic cocci.
AB  == since such things as sites of normal carriage, type and severity of infections produced, and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns may vary according to the particular species involved, accurate taxonomy for differentiation of species is  important. for example, reclassification of the 'bacteroides gracilis group' revealed that sutterella wadsworthensis is actually responsible for the antimicrobial resistance seen in that group. with clostridia and anaerobic cocci, as with other taxa, there have been a number of recent changes in classification  of existing taxa as well as description of novel taxa. it is important that both  clinicians and microbiologists adapt quickly to new classification schemes and new taxa as soon as they are validated. for example, peptostreptococcus is now restricted to the species p. anaerobius and five new genera have been created. there has also been significant reclassification of clostridia and new species of clostridia have also been described.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria in new zealand: 1999-2003.
AB  == objectives: routine susceptibility testing of all anaerobic organisms is not advocated, but it is useful for laboratories to test periodically for anaerobic organisms and provide local susceptibility data to guide therapy. this study reports the national trend of antibiotic susceptibility of clinically significant anaerobes in new zealand. methods: clinical isolates were tested using standardized methods against a range of antibiotics commonly used to treat anaerobic infections. susceptibility was determined using nccls criteria. the change in susceptibility trends between this study and earlier studies was measured by comparing the geometric mean of the mic. results: a total of 364 anaerobes were tested. penicillin had poor activity against bacteroides spp., prevotella spp., eubacterium spp., clostridium tertium and veillonella spp. in general, fusobacterium spp., bacteroides ureolyticus, propionibacterium spp., clostridium perfringens and anaerobic streptococci isolates, with the exception of peptostreptococcus anaerobius, were penicillin susceptible. amoxicillin/clavulanate showed good activity against most anaerobes, but resistance was seen with bacteroides fragilis group and p. anaerobius isolates. cefoxitin was more active than cefotetan, particularly against non-b. fragilis species, eubacterium spp. and p. anaerobius. meropenem and imipenem showed good activity against all anaerobes, with only 2 and 4% of bacteroides spp., respectively, showing resistance. with the exception of propionibacterium acnes isolates, which are predictably resistant, metronidazole was active against all anaerobes tested. there has been little change in susceptibility since 1997. conclusions: metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin/tazobactam and amoxicillin/clavulanate remain good empirical choices when anaerobes are expected in our setting. no clinically relevant changes in susceptibility over time were found.

AB  == most of bartholin's gland abscesses have been thought to be caused by microorganisms found in opportunistic infections. however, we have encountered two very interesting cases of bartholin's gland abscesses caused by streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, two major pathogens of respiratory tract infections. in the first case, since abscess formation was not observed due to disintegration, cefdinir (cfdn), 300 mg/day, t.i.d. for 5 days was administered.  the treatment improved clinical symptoms, but relapse occurred 3 days after the administration was discontinued. microbiological examination of pus revealed the  presence of streptococcus pneumoniae and finegoldia magna, and it also showed that the isolated s. pneumoniae was penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp). after an incision and drainage of abscess, cefteram pivoxil (cftm-pi), 300 mg/day t.i.d. for 7 days, was administered, and the cure was confirmed. in the second case, after an incision and drainage of bartholin's gland abscess, amoxicillin (ampc), 750 mg/day, t.i.d. for 5 days, was administered. the treatment improved clinical symptoms temporarily. however, the symptoms deteriorated 7 days after the operation, and the patient was diagnosed with relapse. microbiological examination of pus revealed the presence of haemophilus influenzae and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and it also showed that the isolated h. influenzae was beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae (blnar). after performing additional incision and drainage of abscess again, cftm-pi, 300 mg/day, t.i.d. for 7 days, was administered, and the cure was confirmed. in addition, the analysis of these two cases using pk/pd theory revealed that the time above mic reached 100% with administration of cftm-pi 300mg, t.i.d. suggesting that the dosage is sufficient for treating these infections. there are other cases of external genitalia infections caused by microorganisms usually associated with respiratory tract infections like cases that we are reporting here. therefore, it is necessary to consider a possible infection by drug-resistant bacteria even for a case of external genitalia infection. in addition, it was thought that adjusting dosage and method for administration of antibacterial agents based on pk/pd theory would help to rovide efficient treatment.

TI  == variation in antimicrobial action of proanthocyanidins from dorycnium rectum against rumen bacteria.
AB  == the proanthocyanidin polymer fractions of the leaves of the forage legume dorycnium rectum were analysed by acid catalysis with benzyl mercaptan, nmr and es-ms. the results showed that d. rectum differs from other temperate proanthocyanidin-containing forage legumes in that the range of polymers extends  up to very high degrees of polymerisation. three fractions were characterised as  low, medium, and high molecular weight proanthocyanidin fractions with mean degree of polymerisations of 10.3, 41 and 127, respectively. epigallocatechin was the most abundant extension unit and the terminating flavan-3-ols comprised largely catechin and gallocatechin units in equal proportions. formation of thiolyated dimer products showed the interflavan-linkages of the lower molecular  weight proanthocyanidins to be predominantly c4-->c8 with a small amount of c4-->c6. es-ms spectra distinguished lower from higher polymeric proanthocyanidins from m2- to m8(2)-. the antibacterial activity of proanthocyanidin fractions against pure cultures of microbes selected from the ruminal population to represent fibre degrading, proteolytic and hyper ammonia producing bacteria in broth culture was evaluated. the activity of proanthocyanidin fractions against clostridium aminophilum, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and clostridium proteoclasticum was significantly dependent on their structure but not so against ruminococcus albus and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. the latter observation was unique in that they were sensitive to all  proanthocyanidin fractions evaluated, even at the lowest concentration (100 microg/ml). the results suggest the effects of the extractable proanthocyanidins  on rumen microbes should be considered when evaluating an alternative proanthocyanidin-containing forage source for ruminants, such as d. rectum.

AB  == in vitro susceptibility data were collected for co-amoxiclav and other antimicrobial agents against 1297 recent anaerobe isolates collected in europe and the usa. the co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) mic(50/90)s (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid concentration in a ratio of 2:1, expressed in terms  of amoxicillin concentration in mg/l) were 0.5/4 for bacteroides fragilis, </=0.125/1 for prevotella species, </=0.125/0.25 for fusobacterium nucleatum, 0.5/1 for eikenella corrodens, 0.25/8 for peptostreptococcus anaerobius, </=0.125/0.5 for micromonas (peptostreptococcus) micros, </=0.25/0.5 for fingoldia (peptostreptococcus) magna, and </=0.125/0.125 for porphyromonas species. the co-amoxiclav susceptibility rate for b. fragilis was 94.6%, for p. anaerobius 84.3% and for all other species tested 100%. these data indicate that  co-amoxiclav remains an effective drug for the antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis of many anaerobic infections. among the comparator drugs, metronidazole was very active against all bacterial species (>96% susceptible) except e. corrodens (mic(50/90) of >32/>64 mg/l), which is a capnophilic organism. imipenem was also highly active against all species (>98% susceptible). levofloxacin and clindamycin were the least potent agents tested, particularly against bacteroides, prevotella and peptostreptococcus (levofloxacin susceptibility rates: bacteroides 72.7%, prevotella 71.5%, f. magna 72.4%; clindamycin susceptibility rates: bacteroides 79.5%, prevotella 92.1%, f. magna 84.7%).

TI  == the use of pcr for the identification and characterisation of bacteriocin genes from bacterial strains isolated from rumen or caecal contents of cattle and sheep.
AB  == pcr primers were designed to amplify the gene that encodes bovicin 255 from streptococcus gallolyticus lrc0255 and the bacteriocin genes from butyrivibrio fibrisolvens strains ar10 and or79a (bvid and bvi79a) in order to screen for their incidence in rumen and caecal b. fibrisolvens and streptococcus bovis-like  isolates from new zealand and north american ruminants. none of the b. fibrisolvens-like strains (n=34) isolated from new zealand or north america had the genes encoding for butyrivibriocins ar10 (bvid) or or79 (bvi79a). however, seven s. bovis isolates from new zealand ruminants and three from north american  animals had the bovicin 255 gene. sequence comparison of cloned bovicin 255 pcr products indicated a 92.9-95.7% similarity to that of the corresponding bovicin 255 gene sequence of s. gallolyticus. four of the new zealand bovicin 255 positive s. bovis isolates were from the caecal contents of the same sheep and had identical pfge profiles. two other s. bovis isolates sharing the same pfge profile were isolated from a separate animal from the same flock. pfge analysis of the north american strains indicated that all three were closely related as two of three had identical pfge profiles with the remaining isolate differing only by a single band position. the 16s rrna gene sequences of the 10 isolates were at least 99.8% identical to s. bovis. all 10 s. bovis isolates having the gene for bovicin 255 produced bacteriocin activity that inhibited the growth of peptostreptococcus anaerobius d1 in a deferred antagonism plating (dap) assay. certain s. bovis isolates obtained from ruminants have bacteriocin activity associated with a distinct bovicin 255 gene sequence but it appears that bacteriocin production by the rumen anaerobe b. fibrisolvens may be uncommon in strains isolated from cattle and sheep in new zealand.

TI  == phospholipid analogue profiles of peptostreptococcus, micromonas, and finegoldia  species analysed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry.
AB  == species of peptostreptococcus cause a variety of infections, primarily abscesses  of soft tissues, joints, and mucous membranes. the aim of this study was to compare the phospholipid analogue profiles of peptostreptococcus species, represented by p. anaerobius, p. asaccharolyticus, p. indolicus, p. lacrimalis, and p. prevotii; micromonas micros (p. micros) and finegoldia magna (p. magnus).  after anaerobic growth on blood-faa, lipids extracted by chloroform-methanol (2:1 v/v) were purified, then analysed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (fab-ms) in negative ion mode. the major peaks with mass to charge (m/z) 719, 721, and 749, corresponded to phosphatidylglycerol analogues, namely pg (32:1), pg (32:0), and pg (34:0), which have been found previously in lactobacillus spp., clostridium difficile, and staphylococcus spp. other major peaks observed, with m/z 619, 647, 665, 675, 677, 687, 691, 693, 701, 703, 707, 733, and 746 have also been reported in one or more of these three species. however, other major peaks found here in peptostreptococcus, micromonas, and finegoldia have not been described elsewhere; these are 501, 514, 515, 618, 659, 673, 676, 688, 690, 692,  694, 700, 706, 715, 718, 722, and 750. we conclude that peptostreptococcus, micromonas, and finegoldia isolates are chemically unique.

TI  == rapid identification of gram-positive anaerobic coccal species originally classified in the genus peptostreptococcus by multiplex pcr assays using genus- and species-specific primers.
AB  == here, a rapid and reliable two-step multiplex pcr assay for identifying 14 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac) species originally classified in the genus peptostreptococcus (anaerococcus hydrogenalis, anaerococcus lactolyticus, anaerococcus octavius, anaerococcus prevotii, anaerococcus tetradius, anaerococcus vaginalis, finegoldia magna, micromonas micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, peptoniphilus harei, peptoniphilus indolicus, peptoniphilus ivorii and peptoniphilus lacrimalis) is reported. fourteen type strains representing 14 gpac species were first identified to the genus level by multiplex pcr (multiplex pcr-g). since three of these genera (finegoldia, micromonas and peptostreptococcus) contain only a single species, f. magna, m. micros and p. anaerobius, respectively, these organisms were identified to the species level directly by using the multiplex pcr-g. then six species of the genus anaerococcus (a. hydrogenalis, a. lactolyticus, a. octavius, a. prevotii, a. vaginalis and a. tetradius) were further identified to the species level using multiplex pcr assays (multiplex pcr-ia and multiplex pcr-ib). similarly, five species of the genus peptoniphilus (pn. asaccharolyticus, pn. harei, pn. indolicus, pn. ivorii and pn. lacrimalis) were identified to the species level using multiplex pcr-iia and multiplex pcr-iib. the established two-step multiplex pcr identification scheme was applied to the identification of 190 clinical isolates of gpac species that had been identified previously to the  species level by 16s rrna sequencing and phenotypic tests. the identification obtained from multiplex pcr assays showed 100 % agreement with 16s rdna sequencing identification, but only 65 % (123/190) agreement with the identification obtained by phenotypic tests. the multiplex pcr scheme established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of gpac species. it will permit a more accurate assessment of the role of various gpac species in infection and of the degree of antimicrobial resistance in each of the group members.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin.
AB  == background: telithromycin is one of the ketolides, characterised by a 3-keto group instead of l-cladinose and a c(11)-c(12) carbamate link by an alkyl chain to a pyridinum and imidazolium ring side chain. we evaluated in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin against gynaecological pathogens. methods: in the vitro study, the antibacterial activity of telithromycin against  180 isolates (isolated in the year 2000) of streptococcus agalactiae (n = 33), enterococcus faecalis (n = 22), neisseria gonorrhoeae (n = 30), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (n = 20), finegoldia magna (n = 20), bacteroides fragilis (n = 25) and prevotella bivia (n = 30) was compared with that of erythromycin a, clarithromycin, azithromycin, ampicillin and levofloxacin. in the in vivo study, the efficacy of telithromycin was evaluated using experimental intra-abdominal abscesses in mice caused by b. fragilis (minimum inhibitory concentration of telithromycin 0.5 mg/l). results: in the in vitro study, telithromycin inhibited more than 50% of clinical isolates of s. agalactiae, e. faecalis, n. gonorrhoeae, p. anaerobius, f. magna, b. fragilis and p. bivia at concentrations of 0.016, 0.063, 0.063, 0.032, 0.032, 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. telithromycin inhibited more than 90% of these clinical isolates at concentrations of 0.016, 4, 0.125, 0.063, 0.063, 4 and 1 mg/l, respectively. in the in vivo study, telithromycin inhibited abscess formation and significantly decreased viable cell counts in abscesses in comparison with the untreated group. conclusions: these in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities suggest that telithromycin could be a potential candidate for the treatment of bacterial infections complicated by chlamydial infection.

TI  == development of a pcr assay specific for peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  == peptostreptococcus anaerobius is a gram-positive anaerobic coccus that is widely  distributed in the normal human flora. the organism has also been implicated as a causative agent of several systemic infections, including endocarditis and infections of the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts. its role in oral disease is less well defined, although it has been implicated in periodontal disease, gingivitis and root canal infections. identification of p. anaerobius in clinical samples is currently reliant upon traditional culture and biochemical methods. the aim of this study was to develop a novel pcr assay for the detection of p. anaerobius and to attempt detection of this organism in oral samples. pcr primers specific for p. anaerobius dna were developed by alignment of bacterial 16s ribosomal rna gene sequences and selection of sequences specific at their 3'  ends for p. anaerobius. when used in a pcr assay, positivity for p. anaerobius dna was indicated by the amplification of a 943-bp product. the primers were shown to be specific for p. anaerobius dna, as no pcr products were obtained when genomic dna from a wide range of other peptostreptococcus species and other oral  bacteria were used as templates. the pcr assay was then applied to the detection  of p. anaerobius dna in subgingival plaque samples from adult periodontitis patients and pus aspirates from subjects with acute dento-alveolar abscesses. all of 60 subgingival plaque samples from 16 patients were negative for p. anaerobius dna. none of the 43 pus samples analysed contained p. anaerobius dna. these results suggest that p. anaerobius is not a major pathogen in adult periodontitis and dento-alveolar abscesses. the pcr assay is a more rapid, sensitive and specific alternative to culture-based methods for identification of p. anaerobius in clinical samples.

TI  == heterogeneity within the gram-positive anaerobic cocci demonstrated by analysis of 16s-23s intergenic ribosomal rna polymorphisms.
AB  == peptostreptococci are gram-positive, strictly anaerobic bacteria which, although  regarded as members of the commensal human microflora, are also frequently isolated from sites of clinical infection. the study of this diverse group of opportunist pathogens has been hindered by an inadequate taxonomy and the lack of a valid identification scheme. recent re-classification of the peptostreptococcus family into five distinct genus groups has helped to clarify the situation. however, this has been on the basis of 16s rrna sequence determinations, which are both time-consuming and expensive. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of pcr-amplified ribosomal dna spacer polymorphisms for the rapid differentiation of the currently recognised taxa within the group of anaerobic gram-positive cocci. a collection comprising 19 reference strains with  representatives of each of the 15 species, two close relatives and two of the well-characterised groups, together with 38 test strains was studied. all strains were identified to species group level by phenotypic means. amplification of the  16s-23s intergenic spacer region (isr) with universal primers produced distinct banding patterns for all the 19 reference strains and the patterns could be differentiated easily visually. however, of the 38 test strains, less than half could be speciated from isr analysis alone. only five groups produced correlating banding patterns for all members tested (peptoniphilus lacrimalis, p. ivorii, anaerococcus octavius, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and micromonas micros). for  other species, either the type strain differed significantly from other species members (e.g., a. hydrogenalis) or there appeared to be considerable intra-species variation (e.g., a. vaginalis). partial 16s rrna gene sequences for the 'trisimilis' and 'betagal' groups showed that both are most closely related to the anaerococcus group. this work highlights the heterogeneous nature of a number of peptostreptococcus species and hence the need for still further revision of the taxonomy of this important group of pathogens.

AB  == background: chediak-higashi syndrome (c-hs) is a rare congenital disease characterized by defective neutrophil function with abnormal lysosomal inclusions, neutropenia, and reduced chemotaxis. the complete syndrome includes oculocutaneous albinism with photophobia, neurologic features, recurrent infections, and enterocolitis. methods: a 14-year-old male c-hs patient was referred to us because of serious periodontal destruction with acute inflamed gingiva and ulcers. clinical and biological investigations were performed, leading to the diagnosis of c-hs. results: laboratory findings included neutropenia and hypergammaglobulinemia. peripheral blood smears showed giant granules in neutrophils, eosinophils, and granulocytes. bone marrow smears showed giant inclusions in leukocyte precursor cells. these granules and inclusions were characteristic of chediak-higashi syndrome. oral radiographic status showed extensive loss of alveolar bone leading, in most cases, to tooth exfoliation. bacteria often associated with periodontitis were detected in subgingival plaque  samples, including fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and clostridium sp. biopsies of periodontal tissues for light and electronic microscopic examinations revealed massive bacterial invasion of the epithelial tissue, epithelial cells, and connective tissue. ultrastructural observations of periodontal polymorphonuclear  leukocytes showed defective granulation, with abnormal granules not discharging their lysosomal content against engulfed bacteria. viable dividing bacteria were  found in the cytoplasm. conclusions: in this case, early-onset periodontitis seems to be the expression of c-hs granulocyte deficiency. periodontal treatment  of these patients is often unsuccessful. this case report illustrates the importance of the dentist in initiating clinical and biological investigations in such early aggressive periodontitis in young patients.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == induction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 expression by anaerobes associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common disorder characterized by increased levels of anaerobic bacteria in the genital tract. bv has been associated with an increased rate of sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). the  effects of bv-associated anaerobic bacteria on hiv expression in monocytoid cells and t cells were examined. peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus and prevotella bivia stimulated hiv expression in monocytoid cells, whereas bacteroides ureolyticus, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and lactobacillus acidophilus did not enhance hiv expression. p. asaccharolyticus also enhanced hiv expression in t cells and activated hiv long-terminal-repeat transcription in u38 cells. this report suggests a mechanism by which disturbances in vaginal flora could lead to  a higher rate of sexual transmission of hiv. furthermore, this study supports the idea that treatment of bv might serve as a preventive measure to reduce the risk  of hiv transmission.

TI  == postantibiotic effects and bactericidal activities of clarithromycin-14-hydroxy-clarithromycin, versus those of amoxicillin-clavulanate, against anaerobes.
AB  == the bactericidal activities and postantibiotic effects (pae) of clarithromycin-14-hydroxy-clarithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanate against bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus anaerobius were determined. a concentration of twice the mic resulted in bactericidal activity against four of  four and three of four organisms at 24 h with clarithromycin-14-hydroxy-clarithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanate, respectively. the pae of clarithromycin-14-hydroxy-clarithromycin was 1.44 to 3.20 h, compared to the less than 1 h of amoxicillin-clavulanate. clarithromycin-14-hydroxy-clarithromycin possesses good activity against susceptible anaerobes.

TI  == acid production by vaginal flora in vitro is consistent with the rate and extent  of vaginal acidification.
AB  == perinatally, and between menarche and menopause, increased levels of estrogen cause large amounts of glycogen to be deposited in the vaginal epithelium. during these times, the anaerobic metabolism of the glycogen, by the epithelial cells themselves and/or by vaginal flora, causes the vagina to become acidic (ph approximately 4). this study was designed to test whether the characteristics of  acid production by vaginal flora in vitro can account for vaginal acidity. eight  vaginal lactobacillus isolates from four species-l. gasseri, l. vaginalis, l. crispatus, and l. jensenii-acidified their growth medium to an asymptotic ph (3.2 to 4.8) that matches the range seen in the lactobacillus-dominated human vagina (ph 3.6 to 4.5 in most women) (b. andersch, l. forssman, k. lincoln, and p. torstensson, gynecol. obstet. investig. 21:19-25, 1986; l. cohen, br. j. vener. dis. 45:241-246, 1969; j. paavonen, scand. j. infect. dis. suppl. 40:31-35, 1983; c. tevi-benissan, l. belec, m. levy, v. schneider-fauveau, a. si mohamed, m.-c. hallouin, m. matta, and g. gresenguet, clin. diagn. lab. immunol. 4:367-374, 1997). during exponential growth, all of these lactobacillus species acidified their growth medium at rates on the order of 10(6) protons/bacterium/s. such rates, combined with an estimate of the total number of lactobacilli in the vagina, suggest that vaginal lactobacilli could reacidify the vagina at the rate  observed postcoitally following neutralization by the male ejaculate (w. h. masters and v. e. johnson, human sexual response, p. 93, 1966). during bacterial  vaginosis (bv), there is a loss of vaginal acidity, and the vaginal ph rises to >4.5. this correlates with a loss of lactobacilli and an overgrowth of diverse bacteria. three bv-associated bacteria, gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia,  and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, acidified their growth medium to an asymptotic ph (4.7 to 6.0) consistent with the characteristic elevated vaginal ph associated with bv. together, these observations are consistent with vaginal flora, rather than epithelial cells, playing a primary role in creating the acidity of the vagina.

TI  == coaggregation of candida dubliniensis with fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == the binding of microorganisms to each other and oral surfaces contributes to the  progression of microbial infections in the oral cavity. candida dubliniensis, a newly characterized species, has been identified in human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive patients and other immunocompromised individuals. c. dubliniensis phenotypically resembles candida albicans in many respects yet can be identified and differentiated as a unique candida species by phenotypic and genetic profiles. the purpose of this study was to determine oral coaggregation (coag) partners of c. dubliniensis and to compare these findings with coag of c.  albicans under the same environmental conditions. fifteen isolates of c. dubliniensis and 40 isolates of c. albicans were tested for their ability to coaggregate with strains of fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus magnus, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia. when c. dubliniensis and c. albicans strains were grown at 37 degrees c on sabouraud dextrose agar, only c. dubliniensis strains coaggregated with f. nucleatum atcc 49256 and no c. albicans strains showed coag. however, when the c. dubliniensis and c. albicans strains were grown at 25 or 45 degrees c, both c. dubliniensis and c. albicans strains demonstrated coag with f. nucleatum. heating the c. albicans strains (grown at 37 degrees c) at 85 degrees c for 30 min or treating them with dithiothreitol allowed the c. albicans strains grown at 37 degrees c to coaggregate with f. nucleatum. coag at all growth temperatures was inhibited by mannose and alpha-methyl mannoside but not by edta or arginine. the coag reaction between f.  nucleatum and the candida species involved a heat-labile component on f. nucleatum and a mannan-containing heat-stable receptor on the candida species. the coag reactions between f. nucleatum and the candida species may be important  in the colonization of the yeast in the oral cavity, and the coag of c. dubliniensis by f. nucleatum when grown at 37 degrees c provides a rapid, specific, and inexpensive means to differentiate c. dubliniensis from c. albicans isolates in the clinical laboratory.

TI  == comparative activity of eighteen antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria  isolated in south africa.
AB  == the in vitro activity of 18 antimicrobial agents was determined against 378 anaerobic bacteria isolated in bloemfontein, south africa, during 1996/97. against the gram-positive isolates, mics of penicillin and cefoxitin were >0.5 microg/ml and >16 microg/ml, respectively, for five and three strains of non-perfringens clostridium spp. seventeen peptostreptococcus anaerobius strains  were resistant to penicillin (mic > or = 2 microg/ml). all gram-positive anaerobes tested except one peptostreptococcus sp. and one clostridium sp. were susceptible to dalfopristin-quinupristin (mics < or = 1 microg/ml). the carbapenems exhibited excellent activity against the gram-positive isolates and were effective against most gram-negative anaerobes, with the exception of the fusobacteria. only seven strains exhibited decreased susceptibility to trovafloxacin (mics > 2 microg/ml). in mixed anaerobic/aerobic infections, carbapenems and the fourth-generation quinolone trovafloxacin were the agents most suitable for us as broad-spectrum monotherapy.

TI  == endodontic pathogens stimulate monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-8 in mononuclear cells.
AB  == microbial infection of the dental pulp leads to the recruitment of leukocytes and the formation of lesions of endodontic origin. the chemokines interleukin-8 (il-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1) are relatively specific chemoattractants for neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. in the present studies, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated by streptococcus mutants, porphyromonas endodontalis, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, which are associated with lesions of endodontic origin. each of these bacteria induced a dose-dependent increase in il-8 and mcp-1, determined by elisa. the levels induced are physiologically relevant. however, low doses of p. endodontalis were  less effective in inducing il-8 or mcp-1 expression, compared with s. mutants or  p. anaerobius. thus, these bacteria can induce significant levels of the chemokines il-8 and mcp-1, which could contribute to the recruitment of neutrophils or monocytes in vivo. the expression of these mediators may contribute to the development of endodontic infections, particularly with regard  to inflammatory leukocyte recruitment.

TI  == aminopeptidase activities in peptostreptococcus spp. are statistically correlated to gelatin hydrolysis.
AB  == one hundred peptostreptococcus isolates from five species were assessed for their ability to hydrolyze gelatin. most peptostreptococcus magnus (95.8%) and peptostreptococcus micros isolates (79.0%) hydrolyzed gelatin in contrast to peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (8.0%), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (10.0%), and peptostreptococcus prevotii isolates (16.7%). gelatin hydrolysis in  peptostreptococcus magnus and peptostreptococcus micros isolates correlated (r =  0.80; p = 0.0019) with more aminopeptidases produced than peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, or peptostreptococcus prevotii.  the five species were further classified into three groups using the extended tukey test (p < 0.0001) based on the mean percentage of aminopeptidases produced  by each species with peptostreptococcus magnus and peptostreptococcus micros belonging to group i, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus and peptostreptococcus  prevotii belonging to group ii, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius forming group iii. an analysis of possible proteolytic activity of four selected peptostreptococcus magnus isolates indicated that only 5 of 11 substrates were hydrolyzed as compared to a control isolate of porphyromonas gingivalis w83, which had a strong proteolytic profile. therefore, gelatin hydrolysis by peptostreptococcus spp., in particular peptostreptococcus magnus and peptostreptococcus micros, is probably due to a variety of aminopeptidases rather than proteinases.

AB  == pasture-grazed dairy cows, deer, and sheep were tested for the presence of ammonia-hyperproducing (hap) bacteria in roll tubes containing a medium in which  tryptone and casamino acids were the sole nitrogen and energy sources. colonies able to grow on this medium represented 5.2, 1.3, and 11.6% of the total bacterial counts of dairy cows, deer, and sheep, respectively. a total of 14 morphologically distinct colonies were purified and studied further. restriction  fragment length polymorphisms of 16s rrna genes indicated that all isolates differed from the previously described hap bacteria, clostridium aminophilum, clostridium sticklandii, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. carbon source utilization experiments showed that five isolates (c2, d1, d4, d5, and s1) were unable to use any, or very few, of the carbon sources tested. biochemical tests and phylogenetic analyses of 16s ribosomal dna sequences indicated that all isolates were monensin sensitive; that d1 and s1 belonged to the genus peptostreptococcus, that d4 and d5 belonged to the family bacteroidaceae, where d4 was similar to fusobacterium necrophorum; and that c2 was most similar to an unidentified species from the genus eubacterium. growth on liquid medium containing tryptone and casamino acids as the sole nitrogen and energy source showed that d1, d4, and s1 grew rapidly (specific growth rates of 0.40, 0.35, and 0.29 h-1, respectively), while c2 and d5 were slow growers (0.25 and 0.10 h-1, respectively). ammonia production rates were highest in d1 and d4, which produced 945.5 and 748.3 nmol/min per mg of protein, respectively. tests of individual nitrogen sources indicated that d1 and d4 grew best on tryptone, s1 grew equally  well on casamino acids or tryptone, and c2 and d5 grew poorly on all nitrogen sources. the intact proteins casein and gelatin did not support significant growth of any of the isolates. these isolates extend the diversity of known hap rumen bacteria and indicate the presence of significant hap bacterial populations in pasture-grazed new zealand ruminants.

TI  == gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
AB  == gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac) are a heterogeneous group of organisms defined by their morphological appearance and their inability to grow in the presence of oxygen; most clinical isolates are identified to species in the genus peptostreptococcus. gpac are part of the normal flora of all mucocutaneous surfaces and are often isolated from infections such as deep organ abscesses, obstetric and gynecological sepsis, and intraoral infections. they have been little studied for several reasons, which include an inadequate classification, difficulties with laboratory identification, and the mixed nature of the infections from which they are usually isolated. nucleic acid studies indicate that the classification is in need of radical revision at the genus level. several species of peptostreptococcus have recently been described, but others still await formal recognition. identification has been based on carbohydrate fermentation tests, but most gpac are asaccharolytic and use the products of protein degradation for their metabolism; the introduction of commercially available preformed enzyme kits affords a physiologically more appropriate method of identification, which is simple and relatively rapid and can be used in routine diagnostic laboratories. recent reports have documented the isolation in  pure culture of several species, notably peptostreptococcus magnus, from serious  infections. studies of p. magnus have elucidated several virulence factors which  correlate with the site of infection, and reveal some similarities to staphylococcus aureus. p. micros is a strongly proteolytic species; it is increasingly recognized as an important pathogen in intraoral infections, particularly periodontitis, and mixed anaerobic deep-organ abscesses. comparison  of antibiotic susceptibility patterns reveals major differences between species.  penicillins are the antibiotics of choice, although some strains of p. anaerobius show broad-spectrum beta-lactam resistance.

AB  == the metabolism of phenylalanine and leucine by peptostreptococcus anaerobius and  the effects of metronidazole on this metabolism were studied. the cells metabolized both phenylalanine and leucine under strict anaerobic conditions and  produced hydroxylated products (i.e. phenyllactate from phenylalanine and hydroxyisocaproate from leucine). other products were phenylpropionate, cinnamate and phenylacetate from phenylalanine; isocaproate, alpha-ketoisocaproate and isovalerate from leucine. metronidazole inhibited the production of all end-products, with the exception of phenyllactate and hydroxyisocaproate which were increased. similarly, when the reaction was carried out aerobically, the cells also metabolized both phenylalanine and leucine and all end-products were inhibited again with the exception of phenyllactate and hydroxyisocaproate. our results suggest that the inhibitory mode of metronidazole is similar to that of oxygen.

TI  == emerging resistance of anaerobic bacteria to antimicrobial agents in south korea.
AB  == in previous studies, bacteroides fragilis group organisms isolated from korean patients were more frequently resistant to various antimicrobial agents, including clindamycin, than were isolates in other countries. a recent report of  increased resistance of peptostreptococcus species prompted us to include such isolates in a study of antimicrobial susceptibility. anaerobes isolated in 1994 at a tertiary care hospital in seoul were tested by agar dilution method. none of the b. fragilis group organisms were resistant to imipenem, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, or metronidazole. however, 6.7% were resistant to ampicillin/sulbactam, 20.2% to cefotetan, 30.3% to piperacillin, 48.3% to cefotaxime, and 42.7% to clindamycin. almost all of the clostridium perfringens isolates were susceptible to all of the agents tested, except tetracycline. peptostreptococcus isolates were susceptible to piperacillin, cefotaxime, and imipenem, while 7.4% were resistant to penicillin g, cefotetan, and metronidazole, and 25.9% were resistant to clindamycin. the isolates resistant to penicillin g, cefotetan, and metronidazole were identified as peptostreptococcus  anaerobius. in conclusion, besides the well-known high rate of resistance of b. fragilis group organisms to clindamycin, the emergence of resistance of peptostreptococcus species isolates to beta-lactam drugs has become obvious in korea.

AB  == bacteriologic samples from 31 young men were cultured quantitatively for aerobes  and anaerobes; these samples included 31 specimens of tonsils (16 infected and 15 healthy), 16 specimens from pericoronal pockets of lower third molars (11 infected and 5 symptom-free), and 6 postoperative specimens from lower-third-molar extraction sockets. anaerobes were isolated more often from infected third molars than from infected tonsils (14.5 isolates vs. 8.4 isolates, respectively; p < .001). infected tonsil samples contained significantly more anaerobic species if an adjacent partly erupted lower third molar was present rather than absent (10.3 isolates vs. 6.9 isolates, respectively; p < .05). eubacterium aerofaciens, clostridium species, peptostreptococcus micros, and prevotella oris were frequently isolated. streptococcus salivarius was found more frequently in tonsillar specimens, whereas corynebacterium species, prevotella denticola, capnocytophaga species, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and lactobacillus species were more common in pericoronal pocket samples. thus, partial eruption of lower third molars increases the number of anaerobic bacterial species on tonsils and many species can be isolated simultaneously from both tonsils and lower third molars.

TI  == [antibiotic sensitivity of anaerobic bacteria isolated during one year (1993)].
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobian susceptibility of the anaerobe bacteria isolated from clinical samples in the authors' department in 1993. methods: the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 10 antimicrobians were determined in microgram/ml for 129 anaerobe bacterias by the  microdilution in broth method recommended by the nccls. results: all the strains  were sensitive to chloramphenicol. metronidazole inhibited all the isolates except a. meyeri and 50% of other non spored gram-positive bacilli. imipenen and  piperacillin-tazobactam were the most active beta lactamics, with only 1 b. fragilis being resistant to both. clavulanic amoxycillin presented good activity  with only 5% from the b. fragilis group, 1 f. mortiferum and 2 p. anaerobius being resistant. in the b. fragilis group 10% were resistant to cefoxitin and 15% to piperacillin. the remaining isolates were sensitive to both antimicrobians. resistance to clindamycin in the b. fragilis group was 16.7%. there were also strains resistant to peptostreptococcus, prevotella and aerotolerant non spored gram-positive bacilli. penicillin and amoxycillin were the least active antimicrobians. conclusions: chloramphenicol, metronidazole, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and clavulanic amoxycillin were very effective and showed a wide spectrum of activity versus the strains studied. cefoxitin, piperacillin and clindamycin maintain good antianaerobe activity.

TI  == an rrna approach for assessing the role of obligate amino acid-fermenting bacteria in ruminal amino acid deamination.
AB  == ruminal amino acid degradation is a nutritionally wasteful process that produces  excess ruminal ammonia. monensin inhibited the growth of monensin-sensitive, obligate amino acid-fermenting bacteria and decreased the ruminal ammonia concentrations of cattle. 16s rrna probes indicated that monensin inhibited the growth of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and clostridium sticklandii in the rumen. clostridium aminophilum was monensin sensitive in vitro, but c. aminophilum persisted in the rumen after monensin was added to the diet. an in vitro culture  system was developed to assess the competition of c. aminophilum, p. anaerobius,  and c. sticklandii with predominant ruminal bacteria (prb). prb were isolated from a 10(8) dilution of ruminal fluid and maintained as a mixed population with  a mixture of carbohydrates. prb did not hybridize with the probes to c. aminophilum, p. anaerobius, or c. sticklandii. prb deaminated trypticase in continuous culture, but the addition of c. aminophilum, p. anaerobius, and c. sticklandii caused a more-than-twofold increase in the steady-state concentration of ammonia. c. aminophilum, p. anaerobius, and c. sticklandii accounted for less  than 5% of the total 16s rrna and microbial protein. monensin eliminated p. anaerobius and c. sticklandii from continuous cultures, but it could not inhibit  c. aminophilum. the monensin resistance of c. aminophilum was a growth rate-dependent, inoculum size-independent phenomenon that could not be maintained in batch culture. on the basis of these results, we concluded that the feed additive monensin cannot entirely counteract the wasteful amino acid deamination  of obligate amino acid-fermenting ruminal bacteria.

TI  == the in vitro activity of trospectomycin against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the authors evaluated the activity of trospectomycin, a new aminocyclitol which is characterized by good antibacterial and broad spectrum activity, in comparison with clindamycin and ampicillin on a sample of recent isolates: bacteroides fragilis (15 strains), bacteroides urealyticus (5 strains), bacteroides vulgatus  (5 strains), bacteroides spp. (15 strains), prevotella melaninogenica (6 strains), porphyromonas asaccharolytica (7 strains), mobiluncus spp. (3 strains), peptococcus niger (3 strains), peptococcus variabilis (9 strains), peptococcus spp (30 strains), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (5 strains), peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (3 strains), peptostreptococcus spp. (25 strains) and propionibacterium spp. (7 strains). the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) were determined for all strains by microtiter serial dilutions in wilkins-chalgren broth in an anaerobic chamber in  an atmosphere of 10% h2, 10% co2, 80% n2. all the drugs tested exert their activity against gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic isolates. in particular, trospectomycin is quite active against gram-positive cocci (mic 90 =  4 - 8 mg/l), gram-negative rods (mic 90 = 8 - 16 mg/l), gram-positive rods (mic 90 = 4 mg/l) and mobiluncus spp. (mic 90 = 0.5 mg/l).

TI  == non-sporing anaerobes in certain surgical group of patients.
AB  == the magnitude of non-sparing anaerobic (nsa) infections has been defined in the postoperative wounds on colorectum in children (57.1%), general surgery (0%), abdominoperineal and uterocervical operations (11-45%) in gynaecologic and obstetrical cases and perforative peritonitis (25.8-32.3%). children below the 6  months age group bear less risk of acquiring nsa infection. under certain situations, metronidazole combats nsa infections in a better way than other antibacterials. the bacteriology of nsa infections has been probed at the species level in the gynaecologic and obstetrical patients. the species of normal cervix  (44.6%) are represented in wounds involving abdominal wall (11%), perineum (22.8%) and uterocervix (45.6%) to suggest endogenous infection. out of the 22 species of nsa isolated, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, acidaminococcus fermentans and peptococcus prevotii are the commonest. others were peptococcus niger, gaffkya anaerobia, lactobacillus bulgaricus, actinomyces bovis, bacteroides oralis, fusobacterium gonidiaformans and the different species of peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, propionibacterium and fusobacterium. the weight of evidence indicated a pathogenic role of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and ruminococcus flavefaciens, in view of their heavy growth. the umbrella of antibacterials reduced gram-positive anaerobic cocci from 40% to 16%. the facultative anaerobes staph aureus, staph epidermidis, kl pneumoniae and proteus appeared as the exogenous agents of nosocomial infections.

TI  == a numerical taxonomic study of the gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
AB  == clinical (101) and collection (26) strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci were  examined in conventional tests and pyrolysis mass spectrometry (pms). numerical classifications based upon conventional test reaction patterns (ctrps) and pms showed 27 and 22 clusters, respectively. cross-tabulation of cluster membership in the two classifications showed excellent correlation, with the combined classifications showing clear groups corresponding to the currently recognised species peptostreptococcus anaerobius, p. heliotrinreducens, p. hydrogenalis, p.  indolicus, p. lactolyticus, p. magnus, p. micros and peptococcus niger. strains of p. prevotii and p. tetradius clustered together in a heterogeneous group of saccharolytic organisms. however, strains previously identified as p. asaccharolyticus were divided into three distinct groups in pms, two of which differed only in indole-associated pyrolysis products. a further four groups and  several single-member clusters were distinct from these species. pms data supported the validity of identification by pre-formed enzyme profiles and confirmed that hare group iii is synonymous with p. hydrogenalis, hare group iv with p. magnus, and the "adh group" with p. vaginalis. there is clearly a need for a taxonomic revision of the genus peptostreptococcus, which probably encompasses several generic groups.

TI  == antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  == in addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. this investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol,  super eba and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli b and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenica, fusobacterium  necrophorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. after growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials  were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees c. impregnated discs with the super eba liquid were used as positive controls. the antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials.  impregnated discs with super eba liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. zinc  oxide-eugenol and super eba pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == crystalline surface protein of peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  == the surface ultrastructure of three anaerobic gram-positive cocci frequently encountered in oral infections, peptostreptococcus micros, p. magnus and p. anaerobius, was studied. the type strains of p. micros (dsm 20468) and p. anaerobius (atcc 27337), several clinical isolates of both species and the type strain of p. magnus (dsm 20470) were included. thin-sectioned cells studied by electron microscopy revealed a homogeneous layer outside the peptidoglycan layer  in p. anaerobius. in p. micros and p. magnus a more amorphous layer was present.  no periodic structures were seen in negatively stained whole cells of these three species. however, in freeze-etched cells of p. anaerobius a crystalline surface protein layer (s-layer) was detected. no periodicity was seen in any of the p. micros strains or the p. magnus type strain by the methods used, but a periodic pattern was observed in negatively stained specimens of cell wall fragments of sonicated p. anaerobius cells. no capsular material was visible outside the s-layer in p. anaerobius. the cells of the peptostreptococcus spp. were extracted for 30 min with detergents and urea. one per cent sds and m urea both extracted a major 78 kda protein from all strains of p anaerobius. extraction of p. micros and p. magnus cells did not reveal any major protein bands comparable to that of  p. anaerobius. surface biotinylation of cells followed by western blotting and detection by alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated extravidin showed strong staining of the 78 kda band in p. anaerobius, further indicating that this molecule is located on the surface of the cell and is the s-protein.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == sinus disease has been assumed to exist in children with respiratory tract allergies. we consecutively evaluated 375 patients (245 male, 130 female) with childhood onset asthma, between 5 and 15 years of age (mean 7.8 years of age). abnormal waters radiographs were found in 205 patients (54.7%) which included mucosal wall thickening greater than 6 mm (67.3%), complete opacification (22.9%) and air-fluid levels (9.8%). the level of immunoglobulin (ig) e was found to be much higher in non-sinusitis asthmatic children than in asthmatic children with sinusitis (1207 iu/ml vs. 644 iu/ml). the igg, iga, igm and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr) values were not significantly different in the two groups. all patients were treated with antibiotics for 3 to 6 weeks. five patients required surgical intervention after antibiotic treatment had little success. streptococcus viridans was isolated from 4 patients following surgical aspirates and peptostreptococcus anaerobius was isolated in only one patient. in  conclusion, sinusitis in children may be an aggravating factor for chronic reactive lower airway disease. optimal treatment may decrease the need of asthmatic medication.

TI  == electrogenic glutamine uptake by peptostreptococcus anaerobius and generation of  a transmembrane potential.
AB  == peptostreptococcus anaerobius converted glutamine stoichiometrically to ammonia and pyroglutamic acid, and the eadie-hofstee plot of glutamine transport was biphasic. high-affinity, sodium-dependent glutamine transport (affinity constant  [kt] of 1.5 microm) could be driven by the chemical gradient of sodium, and more  than 20 mm sodium was required for half-maximal velocity. high-affinity glutamine transport was not stimulated or inhibited by a membrane potential (delta psi). low-affinity glutamine transport had a rate which was directly proportional to the external glutamine concentration, required less than 100 microm sodium, and was inhibited strongly by a delta psi. cells which were treated with n,n-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide to inhibit the f1f0 atpase still generated a delta psi but did so only if the external glutamine concentration was greater than 15 mm. low-affinity glutamine uptake could not be saturated by as much as 200 mm glutamine, but glutamine-1 accounts for only a small fraction of the total glutamine at physiological ph values (ph 6 to 7). on the basis of these results,  it appeared that the low-affinity glutamine transport was an electrogenic mechanism which was converting a chemical gradient of glutamine-1 into a delta psi. other mechanisms of delta psi generation (electrogenic glutamine-pyroglutamate or -ammonium exchange) could not be demonstrated.

AB  == in this study of the vaginal flora of 171 pregnant women in labor at term, the flora was categorized as normal (lactobacillus predominant), intermediate, or representative of bacterial vaginosis (bv) on the basis of a vaginal smear. bv was diagnosed in 39 women (23%); the vaginal flora was classified as normal in 50% of cases and as intermediate in 27%. h2o2-producing lactobacilli were recovered from 5% of women with bv, 37% of those with an intermediate flora, and  61% of those with a normal flora. h2o2-negative lactobacilli were equally frequent (57%-65%) in all three groups. the microorganisms most frequently recovered from women with bv included gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia/disiens, bacteroides ureolyticus, prevotella corporis/bacteroides levii, fusobacterium nucleatum, mobiluncus species, peptostreptococcus prevotii, peptostreptococcus tetradius, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, viridans streptococci, ureaplasma urealyticum, and mycoplasma hominis (p < .05 for each).  the presence of all but three of these organisms was inversely related to vaginal colonization by h2o2-producing lactobacilli; the exceptions were b. ureolyticus,  f. nucleatum, and p. prevotii. other microorganisms were equally frequent among women with and without bv. we conclude that specific groups of anaerobes are associated with bv in this population and that a strong association exists between species associated with bv and those inhibited by h2o2-producing lactobacilli.

TI  == in vitro activity of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and flomoxef against 322 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. a fastidious facultative anaerobe, gardnerella vaginalis, was also studied. fk037 inhibited 90% of isolates of peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, clostridium perfringens, mobiluncus spp., g. vaginalis, and porphyromonas gingivalis at < or = 0.78 micrograms/ml. the mics of fk037 for 50 and 90% of bacteroides fragilis isolates were 25 and > 200 micrograms/ml, respectively; the activity of fk037 was comparable to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime but lower than that of flomoxef. the activity of fk037  against fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium varium, and bilophila wadsworthia  decreased when inoculum size was increased from 10(6) to 10(8) cfu/ml. little influence of inoculum size on the activity of fk037 was observed for other isolates tested. medium ph affected the activity of fk037 against f. varium (mics at phs 5 and 7, 3.13 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively) and bacteroides gracilis (mics at phs 5 and 7, 12.5 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively) but not against other organisms tested. fk037 was less resistant than flomoxef to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase group 2e derived from b. fragilis gai 0558 and gai 10150.

TI  == intrapleural streptokinase in experimental empyema.
AB  == intrapleural streptokinase has been used in multiloculated empyemas to enhance pleural space drainage, presumably by causing fibrinolysis of the interlocular septae. we evaluated the efficacy and safety of daily administration of 10,000 u  intrapleural streptokinase or equal volumes of saline to enhance resolution of experimental empyema in the rabbit pleural space. seventy-two hours after intrapleural turpentine, 10(8) colony-forming units each of escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and bacteroides fragilis were injected into the sterile pleural effusion of all animals. immediately after bacterial inoculation, and daily for 3 days, animals received 10,000 u streptokinase or saline intrapleurally. animals that achieved a pleural fluid ph < 7.30 and either glucose < 50 mg/dl or ldh > 500 iu/l were included for data analysis. at day 4 after bacterial inoculation, the streptokinase-treated empyemic rabbits had more  pleural fluid (18.8 +/- 5.1 ml) (mean +/- sem) than did saline-treated control animals (4.8 +/- 1.7 ml) (p = 0.015), fewer interpleural adhesions (8.2 +/- 2.7)  than did saline-treated control animals (25.1 +/- 3.6) (p = 0.002), and comparable amounts of visceral and parietal pleural plaque than did saline-treated control animals (p = ns). no evidence of systemic fibrinolysis was observed at 1 h after intrapleural streptokinase administration. we conclude that intrapleural streptokinase decreases interpleural adhesion numbers but fails to reduce the amount of pleural plaque observed in experimental empyema in rabbits.  the increases in pleural fluid volume observed after streptokinase administration may be due to mechanisms other than fibrinolytic activity.

TI  == the influence of race and gender on periodontal microflora.
AB  == previous studies have demonstrated that demographic characteristics of subject populations influence both the incidence of periodontal diseases and various aspects of host responses to periodontal bacteria. in this study we analyzed the  components of the subgingival microflora from individuals with adult periodontitis, early onset periodontitis, gingivitis, and periodontal health as a function of gender and race (black and white). clinical categories were analyzed  individually so that there were no differences in the clinical characteristics of the sampled sites. no significant differences were noted in the subgingival microflora between males and females. when either the first two bacterial samples from each subject or all bacterial samples taken from each subject were included  in the analysis, it was found that porphyromonas gingivalis was more significantly associated with black subjects in the adult periodontitis group. when all samples were considered in the analysis, it was found that peptostreptococcus anaerobius was associated with black subjects in the adult periodontitis group, while fusobacterium nucleatum was associated with white subjects in both the adult periodontitis and early onset periodontitis groups. thus a limited number of important bacterial components of the subgingival microflora are influenced by the race and diagnosis of the subject group.

TI  == cytotoxicity versus antibacterial activity of some antiseptics in vitro.
AB  == through the development of new techniques for bacterial growth and isolation, obligate anaerobes have been shown to be more prevalent than previously thought in the pathogenesis of periapical and pulpal diseases. a follow-up study was conducted to examine the germicidal effect of 0.05% naocl, 10 mg/ml metronidazole and supernatant of ca (oh)2 (0.025 ml) on four anaerobic microorganisms commonly  found in root canals, and to compare the toxicity of these substances on cell cultures. in vitro testing revealed that 0.05% naocl and ca (oh)2 were both equally effective on these anaerobes. also, metronidazole was found to be germicidally effective against bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides oralis and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, but ineffective against veillonella alcalescens. furthermore, it was found that naocl and ca (oh)2 had a very destructive effect on cell cultures compared with their antimicrobial effect, whereas metronidazole was less toxic among the agents tested.

TI  == phylogeny of the ammonia-producing ruminal bacteria peptostreptococcus anaerobius, clostridium sticklandii, and clostridium aminophilum sp. nov.
AB  == in previous studies, gram-positive bacteria which grew rapidly with peptides or an amino acid as the sole energy source were isolated from bovine rumina. three isolates, strains c, ft (t = type strain), and sr, were considered to be ecologically important since they produced up to 20-fold more ammonia than other  ammonia-producing ruminal bacteria. on the basis of phenotypic criteria, the taxonomic position of these new isolates was uncertain. in this study, the 16s rrna sequences of these isolates and related bacteria were determined to establish the phylogenetic positions of the organisms. the sequences of strains c, ft, and sr and reference strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius, clostridium sticklandii, clostridium coccoides, clostridium aminovalericum, acetomaculum ruminis, clostridium leptum, clostridium lituseburense, clostridium acidiurici, and clostridium barkeri were determined by using a modified sanger dideoxy chain  termination method. strain c, a large coccus purported to belong to the genus peptostreptococcus, was closely related to p. anaerobius, with a level of sequence similarity of 99.6%. strain sr, a heat-resistant, short, rod-shaped organism, was closely related to c. sticklandii, with a level of sequence similarity of 99.9%. however, strain ft, a heat-resistant, pleomorphic, rod-shaped organism, was only distantly related to some clostridial species and p. anaerobius. on the basis of the sequence data, it was clear that strain ft warranted designation as a separate species. the closest known relative of strain ft was c. coccoides (level of similarity, only 90.6%). additional strains that are phenotypically similar to strain ft were isolated in this study.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [the role anaerobes in dermatitis digitalis et interdigitalis in cattle].
AB  == altogether 52 tissue samples and swabs from the corium of the claw of diseased cattle were investigated. microbiological examinations revealed the presence of 11 strictly anaerobic bacterial strains that belonged to the species peptococcus  asacharolyticus, pc. sacharolyticus, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides asacharolyticus and b. melaninogenicus. the remaining isolates were classified as bacteroides, fusobacterium, streptococcus and clostridium. in the above-mentioned strains observations of their biochemical, morphological and enzymatic properties (tab. i) were carried out. their resistance to antibiotics was evaluated from the qualitative viewpoint (tab. ii). capillary isotachophoresis was used to determine the amounts of volatile fatty acids that developed during glucose fermentation (tab. iii). in the single clinical samples the above-mentioned strains occurred as association of microorganism. the anaerobic genera bacteroides and fusobacterium were found in 52% of the samples (bacteroides sp. and fusobacterium sp. were recorded in 25% and 12% of the samples, respectively, whereas in 15% of  the samples both species occurred). according to our results the etiology of dermatitis digitalis et interdigitalis is closely connected with the incidence of anaerobes. of the latter, those belonging to the genera bacteroides and fusobacterium are of major importance.

TI  == experimental studies of survival of anaerobic bacteria at 4 degrees c and 22 degrees c in two different transport systems.
AB  == the survival of anaerobic bacteria on swabs in two different transport systems at 4 degrees c and 22 degrees c was evaluated. the transport systems were a charcoal-impregnated cotton swab in modified stuart transport medium (mst), and a viscose swab in modified siff transport medium (btm) (bionor). the following eight clinical strains of anaerobic bacteria were tested for quantitative recovery at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h; fusobacterium necrophorum, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides intermedius, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptococcus magnus, clostridium perfringens, clostridium tetani, and actinomyces  israelii. additionally, a mixture of staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli was tested together with bacteroides fragilis, fusobacterium necrophorum and clostridium perfringens. both transport systems preserved the bacteria, but the btm medium gave a better quantitative recovery of the bacteria than the mst in 29/64 (45%) of the experiments, whereas the opposite was the case in 15/64 (23%)  of the experiments (p < 0.05). there was no significant strain-related difference between the recovery of 10 different b. fragilis strains. there was no major difference in the recovery of the anaerobes in the two systems at 4 degrees c compared to 22 degrees c, except for fusobacterium necrophorum, which survived best at 4 degrees c in the bionor transport system.

TI  == associations between microbial species in dental root canal infections.
AB  == the existence of commensal or antagonistic relationships between microorganisms in the root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis was investigated. samples were taken from 65 infected human root canals and were analysed according to species, frequency of occurrence and proportion of the total isolated flora. the  most frequent species were fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, eubacterium alactolyticum, eubacterium lentum and wolinella recta. an odds ratio system was used to calculate positive or negative associations between the isolated bacteria. strong positive associations were found between f. nucleatum and p. micros, porphyromonas endodontalis, selenomonas sputigena and w. recta. there was also a positive association between p. intermedia and p. micros, p. anaerobius and the eubacteria. in general, species of streptococci, propionibacterium propionica, capnocytophaga ochracea and veillonella parvula showed no or negative associations with the other bacteria. the results are consistent with the concept of a special and selective environment occurring in the root canal that is due, in part, to the cooperative as well as antagonistic nature of the relationships between bacteria in the root canal.

TI  == the relative lethality of intestinal bacteria for gnotobiotic rats with experimental intestinal strangulation.
AB  == in eight experiments utilizing 28 animals each, germfree rats with and without ischemically or hemorrhagically strangulated closed loop intestinal segments were contaminated with either one of four common intestinal anaerobic bacteria, or a combination of two or three bacteria previously found to be innocuous in pure culture. the results showed that: a) in pure culture, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius were innocuous; b) fusobacterium necrophorum alone was a very lethal organism that produced intense, confluent, intraperitoneal, fibrous adhesions after four to six days; and c) mixed inoculum of klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and/or streptococcus faecalis was found to be lethal for gnotobiotic rats with intestinal strangulation. it is concluded that fusobacterium necrophorum is so patent that it should be specifically treated with antibiotics when suspected or  known to be present in clinical specimens. this gnotobiotic animal model will be  useful to delineate the lethality of known combinations of intestinal bacteria.

TI  == [empyema due to an anaerobic streptococcus in childhood].
AB  == anaerobic infections are quite rare in pediatric age, being that, they affect only neonates and immunodepressed patients. we think to be somewhat interesting to describe the case of our patient, a 9 year old boy, unaffected by any predisposing factor, came under our observation because of a severe respiratory distress. he showed evident clinical and radiological signs of pleural effusion in the right lung, together with a gas coil in the upper field and a left mediastinal shifting. a thoracentesis was then performed, giving rise to 600 ml of foul smelling purulent material; this procedure promptly improved his respiratory function. a permanent drainage trough the chest wall was set and an antibiotic therapy, based on the clinical picture and the character of the exudate, begun. in effect, the typical smell of the purulent material led us to suspect an anaerobic infection, and for this reason we employed the teicoplanin iv, a rarely used in the pediatric age drug. while blood cultures were negative for any organism, exudate cultures yielded peptostreptococcus anaerobius; the last one resulted highly sensible following antibiogram to the previously chosen  drug. the x-ray pattern and the rapid disappearing of the gas coil induced us to  exclude further either congenital or acquired lung diseases. we conclude that, in absence of other proved sources of entry, the air presence in the pleural space was secondary to gas formation by the anaerobic micro-organism. the clinical course was very satisfactory allowing the patient to be dismissed on the 28th hospital day, with no need of further surgical therapy.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == protein-kinase-c-independent activation of arachidonate release and prostaglandin e2 formation in macrophages interacting with certain bacteria.
AB  == certain bacterial species, of which we selected fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and propionibacterium acnes, were found to induce release of arachidonic acid in a dose- and time-dependent manner in mouse macrophages. the release of arachidonic acid showed a characteristic lag period of approximately 10 min and was accompanied by selective transformation into prostaglandin e2. bacteria killed by various methods caused a similar response, indicating that bacterial surface structures rather than secreted products were involved. down-regulation of protein kinase c  by treatment of macrophages with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate hardly affected the response to bacteria at all, except for a partial inhibition in the  case of p. acnes. furthermore, the generation of prostaglandin e2 was synergistically enhanced when macrophages were exposed to both bacteria and phorbol ester. it is also unlikely that bacterial activation was mediated exclusively via a rise in cytosolic [ca2+], since bacteria stimulated the release of arachidonic acid also when [ca2+] was clamped at various levels and since the  response to bacteria was enhanced in an additive to synergistic manner when combined with calcium ionophore. changes in protein phosphorylation in macrophages exposed to f. nucleatum (gram-negative) were virtually identical to those seen with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, while p. anaerobius (gram-positive) induced enhanced labeling of a single detectable phosphoprotein. in both cases, the changes in protein phosphorylation showed a time lag of 4-8 min and occurred  independently of protein kinase c, consistent with a possible role in signal transduction. these results demonstrate that certain bacteria cause activation of arachidonic acid release and prostaglandin e2 formation in mouse macrophages; that the response is independent of protein kinase c and that it is not wholly mediated via a rise in cytosolic [ca2+].

TI  == the laboratory identification of gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
AB  == a collection of 256 clinical strains and 40 reference strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac) was studied, to characterise the recognised species more fully and to define groups of strains which might correspond to previously undescribed species. the methods used were: gas-liquid chromatography (glc) for the detection of volatile fatty acids (vfas); determination of the pre-formed enzyme profile with a commercially available kit, atb 32a; microscopic appearance; colonial morphology; and antibiotic sensitivity tests. strains were placed in one of five vfa groups according to their glc profile; 96% of strains were further assigned to 12 groups by their enzyme profile. there was less than 99% agreement between the two methods. of 111 clinical strains in the vfa-negative group, 110 gave one of three distinct enzyme profiles corresponding  to peptostreptococcus magnus, p. micros and p. heliotrinreducens. the assignment  of strains to groups based on their microscopic appearance and colonial morphology agreed well with groupings according to enzyme profile. identification of butyrate-producing gpac was unsatisfactory because it relied heavily on the enzyme profile; testing for indole production was of limited discriminative value. most strains of p. asaccharolyticus and p. indolicus were very similar in  enzyme profile, microscopic appearance and colonial morphology, but a sub-group of p. asaccharolyticus could be distinguished. a further indole-positive group corresponding to hare group iii was also noted. strains of p. prevotii and p. tetradius were very similar, but easily distinguished from other butyrate-producing gpac. however, 45% of the butyrate-producing cocci could not be assigned to recognised species; most of these were assigned to one of two new  groups, the adh group and the bgal group, by their enzyme profile, microscopic appearance and smell. four strains that produced a terminal vfa peak of isovaleric acid formed a new group designated 'ivoricus'. reliable features for the identification of p. anaerobius were glc (all gpac that produced isocaproic acid were identified as p. anaerobius), enzyme profile and sensitivity to sps. two clinical strains that produced caproci acid were identified as hare group viii; they were distinguished from peptococcus niger by their enzyme profile and  colonial morphology. a phenotypic classification based on glc and enzyme profile  is presented, with a method for the identification of most strains of gpac within 48 h of primary isolation.

AB  == two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (peptostreptococcus (1); eubacterium (9); clostridium (6); veillonella (6); megasphera (1); bacteroides (28); fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (p. anaerobius (1); e. fossor (9); c. villosum (1); b. fragilis (1); b. tectum (2); b. heparinolyticus (2)). three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (lrt) or paraoral (po) bacterial infections. of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. among the obligately anaerobic species, gram-positive cocci including p. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, e. fossor 11% and other gram-positive rods (excluding  clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. the gram-negative rods comprised b. fragilis 5%, b. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented bacteroides 3% and other bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of fusobacterium (7%), and gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by pasteurella spp. 19%, escherichia coli 17%, actinomyces spp. 9%, streptococcus spp. 9%. incidental facultative isolates were enterococcus spp. 2%, enterobacter cloaceae 2%, actinobacillus spp. 2% and gram-negative corroding rods 5%. on the basis of the similarities (as determined by dna hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. e. fossor and b. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and lrt and po diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.

TI  == obligately anaerobic bacterial species isolated from foot-rot lesions in goats.
AB  == lesions showing clinical signs of foot-rot from 120 goats were cultured on six selective media during october 1987 to november 1988. a total of 582 strictly anaerobic microorganisms belonging to 50 different species was isolated and identified. the anaerobes most frequently isolated belonged to the following genera: bacteroides (80%), peptostreptococcus (63.6%), megasphaera (40%), fusobacterium (29.2%), clostridium (22.5%), propionibacterium (12.5%), eubacterium (11.7%) and leptotrichia (10.8%). percentages for acidaminococcus, peptococcus, tissierella, wolinella and veillonella were below 10%. the following species were identified in 10% or more of cases: peptostreptococcus anaerobius (61.7%), bacteroides buccae (51.7%), bacteroides nodosus (42.5%), megasphaera elsdenii (40%), bacteroides ruminicola subsp. brevis (22.5%), fusobacterium necrophorum (19.2%), leptotrichia buccalis (11.7%) and clostridium perfringens (10%). lower percentages were obtained for the remaining species. the efficiency  and selectivity of the six culture media used for isolation are discussed.

TI  == polysaccharides from peptostreptococcus anaerobius and structure of the species-specific antigen.
AB  == the cell-envelope antigens of peptostreptococcus anaerobius were extracted from intact cells by autoclave or alkaline treatment. the purified species-specific antigen (g) was identified among several polysaccharides obtained from the extracts by successive treatments with ribonuclease and pronase followed by ion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography. g was investigated by 13c- and 31p-n.m.r. spectroscopy, titrimetry, elemental analysis, and gas-liquid chromatography. oxidation of g with naio4 followed by reduction with nabh4 and mild acid hydrolysis yielded the smith degradation product of g (gs). treatment of g and gs with 48% hf gave the respective dephosphorylated products gf and gsf. the structures of gs, gf, and gsf were investigated by 13c-n.m.r. spectroscopy, methylation analysis, and gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. the principal constituents of g were 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucose (d-glcnac), d-glyceric acid, and phosphate as a diester, in the ratio 2:1:1, and a minor amount of d-glucose (beta-d-glcp). gs contained d-glcnac, d-glyceric acid, glycerol, and phosphate in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. gf and gsf contained d-glcnac and d-glyceric acid in the ratios 2:1 and 1:1, respectively. a structure for the principal repeating unit of polymeric g compatible with the analytical data consists of alpha-d-glcpnac-(1----3)-alpha-d-glcpnac-(1----2)-d-glyceric acid units linked through c-6'-c-6" phosphate diester bridges. this structure is novel for two reasons: (a) unsubstituted glyceric acid residues occur as aglycons in the repeating structure, and (b) phosphate diester bridges link nonanomeric glycose carbons in a non-nucleic acid polymer. the structural role of the minor amount of beta-d-glcp in g remains unknown.

AB  == gas-liquid chromatography was employed to analyze the volatile and nonvolatile acids produced in modified norleucine-tyrosine (mnt) broth by various gram-positive cocci. the mnt broth consists of 0.5% trypticase (bbl microbiology  systems, cockeysville, md.), 0.5% yeast extract (difco laboratories, detroit, mich.), 0.2% l-norleucine, and 0.1% l-tyrosine. the microorganisms included reference strains and clinical isolates of peptostreptococcus spp. (p. anaerobius, p. asaccharolyticus, p. indolicus, p. magnus, and p. prevotii), staphylococcus spp. (s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and s. saccharolyticus), and streptococcus spp. (s. agalactiae, s. intermedius, s. mutans, s. sanguis i, and s. sanguis ii). only peptostreptococcus anaerobius strains produced caproic and valeric acids in mnt broth cultures. all 11 p. anaerobius strains produced valeric acid in mnt broth, and only 1 strain failed to produce caproic acid in the medium. this unique feature aids in rapid, reliable identification of p. anaerobius with a minimum number of tests.

TI  == bactericidal effects of human neutrophils and sera on selected endodontic pathogenic bacteria in an anaerobic environment.
AB  == phagocytosis by normal human neutrophils and the bactericidal activity of normal  human pooled serum were measured under anaerobic conditions on six endodontic pathogenic bacterial species from the genera actinomyces, bacteroides, fusobacterium, peptostreptococcus and streptococcus. the results revealed that actinomyces viscosus was not killed either by human neutrophils or by 20 per cent serum; peptostreptococcus anaerobius was not killed by either 20 per cent or 95 per cent serum; and bacteroides intermedius was susceptible to both 20 per cent and 95 per cent serum, but was not killed by neutrophils after exposure for 20 minutes. the other species showed intermediate susceptibility patterns. such results suggest that oral pathogens vary with regard to the bactericidal effects  of these two host defense mechanisms, and that this variation may at least in part explain the relative quantities of microbes recovered in certain oral infections.

TI  == a rapid diagnosis of anaerobic infection in the oro-maxillary region by gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  == the relationship between volatile fatty acids (vfas) in pus and infecting bacterial species was examined in order to establish a rapid identification system for anaerobic microorganisms in purulent inflammation in the oro-maxillary region. vfas were detected by the direct injection of pus into gas-liquid chromatography (glc). bacterial examination was carried out by anaerobic culture  using blood agar plates. the bacterial identification was carried out mainly according to the vpi manual. analysis of the direct vfa patterns of each sample resulted in 5 groups. the following bacterial species were the main isolates in each group: streptococcus intermedius in group a, peptostreptococcus micros in group b, fusobacterium nucleatum in group c, bacteroides gingivalis in group d, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius in group e. the profile of vfas produced in the pyg culture medium of the above isolated bacteria was compared with the direct vfa patterns. agreement ratios between direct and pyg vfa patterns were as follows: group a, 47.1%; groups b and c, 45.0%; group d, 87.5%; and group e, 62.9%. the acetic acid concentration was more than 14 x 10(-4) meq/ml in group b, the butyric acid concentration was more than 7 x 10(-4) meq/ml in group c, and the iso-caproic acid concentration was more than 14 x 10(-4) meq/ml in group e. in these cases, it was found that the agreement ratios between the direct and pyg fva pattern were high. in group d, irrespective of the concentration of iso-valeric acid detected, the agreement ratio was very high. the antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates was studied. efficiency rates of abpc, pipc, ccl,  cez, cmz, sbt/cpz, jm, cldm, mino and gm were relatively low and resistant rates  were high for the gram-negative rods.

TI  == the obligate and facultatively anaerobic bacterial flora of the normal feline gingival margin.
AB  == samples from the gingival margins of 14 cats considered normal on clinical examination were cultured for facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria. all mouths were free from any gingival marginal inflammation and tartar build-up; all cats were between 6 and 12 months of age. a mixed growth was obtained from all samples. the mean number of bacterial species per sample was 10.7 with a range of 7-16 isolates. of the 150 isolates processed, 109 (72.66%) were obligate anaerobes. of the facultatively anaerobic species, actinomyces (including a. viscosus, a. hordeovulneris and a. denticolens) comprised 12%, pasteurella multocida 9.33% of isolates and propionibacterium species 6% of all isolates. gram-negative bacilli belonging to the genera bacteroides and fusobacterium were  isolated from 12 of the 14 samples, and comprised 77% of the obligate anaerobes isolated. clostridium villosum comprised 10.1% of obligately anaerobic isolates,  wolinella species made up 6.42%, while 4.58% were peptostreptococcus anaerobius.  the most commonly isolated obligately anaerobic species was c. villosum and the most commonly isolated facultatively anaerobic species was p. multocida. these findings show a bacterial flora of the normal feline mouth which is very similar  in composition to that of cat fight abscesses and feline pyothorax.

TI  == comparative efficacy of cefoperazone, cefoperazone plus sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and penicillin g against anaerobic bacteria in an animal model.
AB  == treatment efficacy of various antimicrobial regimens against anaerobes was studied in semipermeable chambers simulating a closed-space, locally neutropenic  infection site in rabbits. bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, clostridium perfringens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius were inoculated (at a  mean of 5.3 log10 cfu/ml in prereduced pooled rabbit serum) into the chambers (one isolate per chamber) in triplicate. antimicrobial therapy consisted of cefoperazone, cefoperazone plus sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole (against the gram-negative anaerobes), or penicillin g (against the gram-positive anaerobes), beginning 4 hours after organism inoculation and continuing every 6 hours for 16 doses. with the use of anaerobic techniques for specimen acquisition, transport, and culture, quantitative bacterial findings were measured at the start of therapy and at various time points thereafter. antibiotic concentrations were measured in blood and chamber fluid by liquid chromatography or bioassay methods. at the end of the study in vivo organisms were reduced by at least 3 log10 cfu/ml from drug-free growth control chambers by all the antimicrobial regimens tested except for cefoperazone against b. fragilis and ciprofloxacin against the three isolates tested. the addition of sulbactam to cefoperazone inhibited b. fragilis beta-lactamase activity and eradicated b. fragilis in vivo. in vivo results with this model confirmed in vitro susceptibilities of all tested antimicrobials except ciprofloxacin and should provide useful indications of the potential clinical efficacy of other new agents against anaerobes.

TI  == quantitative bacteriology of a case of acute parotitis.
AB  == it is generally assumed that the microorganisms responsible for acute suppurative parotitis are facultative anaerobes, primarily staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus viridans. a quantitative microbiologic investigation of an aspirate of pus from the case we report revealed a microbial flora (5.1 x 10(6) cfu/ml) consisting entirely of strict anaerobes (fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius). the strain of f. nucleatum was sensitive to metronidazole but resistant to penicillin, amoxicillin, and erythromycin (minimum inhibitory concentration greater than 16 micrograms/ml). p. anaerobius was sensitive to the antibiotics tested. it is concluded that a high concentration of viable anaerobic bacteria may be present in acute suppurative parotitis and thus  pus obtained from cases of sialadenitis should be cultured with microbiologic methods capable of isolating strict anaerobes. additionally, antibiotic sensitivity should be determined routinely.

TI  == preformed enzyme profiles of reference strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
AB  == the preformed (constitutive) enzyme profiles of 30 type strains and reference strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci were determined with two commercial systems, rapid ana and a prototype system from api. both systems identified peptostreptococcus anaerobius, ps. asaccharolyticus, ps. indolicus, ps. magnus and ps. micros accurately, except for one strain of ps. magnus misidentified as ps. micros by the rapid ana system. the indole-negative, butyrate-producing cocci (classified at present as ps. prevotii and ps. tetradius) produced several different, unique patterns with the prototype api system, but the results with rapid ana were often misleading. eight strains of hare group cocci produced previously described profiles. four strains of streptococci produced profiles easily distinguished from those of the gram-positive anaerobic cocci. we conclude that most gram-positive anaerobic cocci can be identified rapidly and reliably to the species level by their preformed enzyme profiles, providing that their underlying classification is sound. problems were encountered with the butyrate-producing cocci, which appear to be a more heterogeneous group of organisms than is currently acknowledged; further taxonomic studies on these organisms are required.

TI  == characterization of cross-reactive proteins detected by culturette brand rapid latex test for clostridium difficile.
AB  == clostridium sporogenes, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and bacteroides asaccharolyticus have been reported to react in the culturette brand rapid latex  test (marion scientific, div. marion laboratories, inc., kansas city, mo.) for clostridium difficile. from the results of this study we showed that c. sporogenes and p. anaerobius produce a protein which is very similar biochemically and immunologically to the protein of c. difficile that is detected by the test. thus, the positive latex reactions observed with c. sporogenes and p. anaerobius are due to a cross-reactive protein. we did not detect this cross-reactive protein in filtrates from b. asaccharolyticus, indicating that this bacterium reacts with the latex reagent by some other mechanism. we cloned the c. difficile gene that codes for the cross-reactive protein and showed that the protein produced by the recombinant organism is nontoxic and distinct from toxin a, thus confirming our earlier findings.

AB  == subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 32 cats showing different stages of periodontal disease. correlations were sought between gingival index scores and the prevalence of various microbial groups, and between microbial populations found in sites designated as most-affected and least-affected within individual cats. the tendency with higher gingival index scores, and with the most-affected  sites, was toward a microbial population composed to a greater extent of anaerobic gram-negative rods. the most common organism was an anaerobic gram-negative rod in the black-pigmented bacteroides group that was biochemically similar to b. gingivalis but had catalase activity. the black-pigmented bacteroides group and peptostreptococcus anaerobius were found in increasing numbers with increasingly severe periodontal disease. pasteurella multocida was isolated from most samples and appeared to decrease in numbers with increasing periodontal disease.

TI  == controlled evaluation of trypticase soy broth with and without gelatin and yeast  extract in the detection of bacteremia and fungemia.
AB  == the addition of gelatin to blood culture media has been suggested to prevent the  inhibition of neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, gardnerella vaginalis, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius that is caused by sodium polyanetholsulfonate. to determine the effect of such supplementation on the overall yield of microorganisms, we compared the yield and speed of detection of  clinically important microorganisms from 5422 paired 10-ml samples of blood cultured in trypticase soy broth (tsb) containing 0.03% sodium polyanetholesulfonate (sps) and tsb/sps containing 1.2% gelatin and 1.0% yeast extract (mtsb). the atmosphere of incubation (open venting unit) and ratio of blood to broth (1:5) were the same for both samples. only cultures with adequate  blood sample (greater than or equal to 80% of stated volume) were compared statistically. addition of gelatin and yeast extract resulted in inhibited growth of enterobacteriaceae (p less than 0.001), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p less than 0.01), fungi (p less than 0.05), and the overall set of microorganisms encountered (p less than 0.001). it delayed growth of enterobacteriaceae (p less  than 0.001) but reduced the time to recover staphylococci (p less than 0.02). of  12 isolates of species usually inhibited by sps, seven grew only with the addition of gelatin and yeast extract, none grew only without supplementation, and five grew in both media. although gelatin and yeast extract may improve the yield of some specific bacteria, the routine use of these additives cannot be recommended for all blood culture media.

TI  == controlled evaluation of modified radiometric blood culture medium supplemented with gelatin for detection of bacteremia and fungemia.
AB  == although the addition of 1.2% gelatin to broth blood culture media containing sodium polyanetholesulfonate has been shown to enhance detection of certain bacteria, including neisseria meningitidis, n. gonorrhoeae, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and gardnerella vaginalis, the effect of such supplementation on the  detection of other microorganisms causing bacteremia and fungemia is not known. therefore, we studied bactec 6b medium with and without gelatin in 6,833 paired comparisons to examine the effects of supplementation on both the yield and the speed of detection of sepsis. more aerobic and facultative bacteria grew in the 6b than in the 6b-gelatin medium (p less than 0.001), especially staphylococci (p less than 0.01), escherichia coli (p less than 0.01), other members of the family enterobacteriaceae (p less than 0.05), and acinetobacter spp. (p less than 0.05). when microorganisms grew in both bottles, they did so earlier in 6b than in 6b-gelatin (p less than 0.001). we conclude that the 6b medium in its present formulation is superior to 6b medium supplemented with 1.2% gelatin.

TI  == identification of anaerobic bacteria using high-performance liquid chromatography.
AB  == 20 species of the genera clostridium, bacteroides, fusobacterium and the type strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptococcus asaccharolyticus, veillonella parvula and propionibacterium acnes were examined for the production  of volatile (vfa) and nonvolatile (nvfa) short-chain fatty acids using high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) with a column for organic acids (aminex hpx-87h). 10 min are needed for sample preparation and the vfa and nvfa were detected simultaneously in a single chromatographic run. the total time required to run each chromatogram was approximately 60 min. with regard to the production of short-chain fatty acids in culture media it was possible to identify the species of the genera rapidly and clearly. the results illustrate the role of hplc in determinating short-chain fatty acid products as an additional means for rapid differentiation between closely related anaerobic bacterial species. the aim of the method developed is to establish a complete automatization for the identification of anaerobic bacteria using an automatic sampling system and a microprocessor-controlled chromatography unit.

TI  == proline requirement for glucose utilization by peptostreptococcus anaerobius atcc 27337.
AB  == resting cells of peptostreptococcus anaerobius maintained under anaerobic conditions were unable to metabolize either glucose or alanine. the addition of proline to the appropriate suspension, however, resulted in the immediate utilization of both compounds. fermentation of alanine by the cells required that stoichiometric concentrations of proline be present in the medium; and during the oxidation of alanine, proline was simultaneously reduced to the ring cleavage product delta-aminovaleric acid. although proline was required to initiate glucose transport, stoichiometric amounts of the imino acid were not necessary for glucose fermentation. proline also stimulated the uptake and concomitant phosphorylation of the nonmetabolizable glucose analog 2-deoxy-d-glucose. the proline requirement for glucose transport by p. anaerobius could be replaced by adding ferricyanide or simply by aerating the cell suspension. the initiation of  sugar uptake by proline, ferricyanide, and o2 was attributed to the capacity of these compounds to function as electron acceptors, which permitted reoxidation of the (reduced) intracellular nucleotide pool and the formation (from an endogenous reserve) of the high-energy donor(s) required for the vectorial transport and phosphorylation of sugar.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria isolated from female genital tract infections.
AB  == certain species or subspecies of anaerobic bacteria are isolated with higher frequency from female genital tract infections than from other anatomic sites. to gain susceptibility data more specific to the treatment of these infections, nine antimicrobial agents were tested by an agar dilution technique against 230 anaerobic bacteria isolated solely from obstetric and gynecological infections. these genital isolates were, in general, very susceptible to imipenem (most active, inhibiting all gram-negative rods at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml), clindamycin (all isolates inhibited at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml), metronidazole (all gram-negative rods inhibited at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml), and chloramphenicol. penicillin g had generally low activity against bacteroides spp., not restricted to just the bacteroides fragilis group, although it was very active against gram-positive species. bacteroides bivius, a species uniquely common in female genital infections, was particularly resistant (90% mic, 64 u/ml). also, the bacteroides melaninogenicus  isolates were less susceptible than previously reported for isolates not exclusively from genital sites. compared with moxalactam, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone, cefoxitin usually demonstrated equal or greater activity against most bacteroides spp., with the exception of greater activity of moxalactam against b. fragilis (formerly subsp. fragilis). resistance to moxalactam was observed among strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius, a common genital isolate. overall, the activities of these four drugs were not as predictable as those observed for clindamycin, metronidazole, chloramphenicol, and imipenem.

TI  == inactivation of the polyanionic detergent sodium polyanetholsulfonate by hemoglobin.
AB  == sodium polyanetholsulfonate (sps) has been added to blood culture media for many  years. its incorporation results in a higher yield of positive blood cultures due to its inactivation of antimicrobial cationic compounds. the most active of these cations include complement components, aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol antibiotics,  and receptors on polymorphonuclear leukocytes. there have been reports from studies conducted outside patient blood culture bottles that sps itself may possess antibacterial activity against some isolates of neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. conversely, in patient  clinical trials there has been no significant difference in pathogen isolation rates in the presence or absence of sps. in an attempt to explain this in vitro/in vivo disparity, a search was undertaken to elucidate which variable constituent in blood, heretofore not studied quantitatively, might have a major effect on modulating the activity of sps. it was found that hemoglobin combined stoichiometrically with sps with a kd of approximately 10(-7) mol/liter. optimum  sps inactivation occurred at an sps/hemoglobin ratio of 1:6 (wt/wt). sps-sensitive isolates of n. gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis were protected by the addition of hemoglobin from the antimicrobial effects of this polyanion in time-kill studies. this protection was directly related to the amount of sps combined in solution. therefore, the amount of free hemoglobin in solution must be measured when studying the antimicrobial activity of polyanions or when evaluating the effect of different polyanions on the recovery rates of pathogens  in patient blood culture clinical trials.

TI  == cefamandole therapy in hand infections.
AB  == hand lacerations, especially when inadequately treated, may result in infections  caused by aerobic or anaerobic bacteria. anaerobic infections most commonly result from human bite injuries in which there is contact between hand and mouth. the search continues for an ideal antibiotic to employ when anaerobic organisms are suspected. in this study cefamandole, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, was employed whenever anaerobic hand infections were suspected following trauma. in each patient quantitative cultures for both aerobic and anaerobic organisms were  obtained. all organisms isolated were tested by standard susceptibility assays for both aerobes and anaerobes. in the case of anaerobes, minimum inhibitory concentration assays were also performed. after the initial culture was obtained, each patient received approximately 1.5 gm of cefamandole every 6 hours for a period of 5 days. this therapy was changed only if susceptibility studies indicated resistance to cefamandole. in our patients, 58% of the infectious organisms were aerobic and facultative anaerobic and 42% were obligate anaerobes. the predominant organisms isolated were staphylococcus aureus and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, which accounted for 42% of the infections. in most of the aerobic infections a single organism was isolated, whereas multiple organisms were identified in the anaerobic infections. all but one of the infections responded to cefamandole; the one that didn't was caused by enterobacter cloacae and required treatment with an aminoglycoside. because of its broad-spectrum coverage, which includes both aerobes and anaerobes, cefamandole is useful in treating infections, especially those resulting from human bites.

AB  == enoate reductase present in clostridium kluyveri and clostridium spec. la 1 could be detected in three strains of c. tyrobutyricum and ten clostridia belonging to  the groups of proteolytic and saccharolytic or proteolytic species, respectively. in c. pasteurianum, c. butyricum and c. propionicum enoate reductase could not be found even after growth on (e)-2-butenoate. a 2-oxo-carboxylate reductase was present in rather low activities in the non-proteolytic clostridia which produce  enoate reductase. high activities (up to 10 u/mg protein) of 2-oxo-carboxylate reductase were found in six of ten proteolytic clostridia. the substrate specificities of the enoate reductase and the 2-oxo-carboxylate reductases from the proteolytic clostridia were determined with different alpha, beta-unsaturated carboxylates (enoates) and 2-oxo-carboxylates, respectively. enoates as well as 2-oxo-carboxylates are intermediates of the pathway by which amino acids are degraded. an explanation is offered for the long known but not understood fact that in the stickland reaction isoleucine always acts as an electron donor and leucine and phenylalanine can be electron acceptors as well as donors. peptostreptococcus anaerobius converting some amino acids to the same products as c. sporogenes did this also with the intermediates which were found for the reductive deamination of amino acids in c. sporogenes, however, in crude extracts reduction of enoates occurred only in an activated form.

TI  == effect of glucose concentration in the growth medium upon neutral and acidic fermentation end-products of clostridium bifermentans, clostridium sporogenes and peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  == clostridium bifermentans, c. sporogenes and peptostreptococcus anaerobius were grown in fastidious anaerobe broth with glucose concentrations from 0-1.5% (w/v). gas chromatographic (glc) analysis of fermentation end-products revealed that a change in glucose concentration markedly affected fermentation patterns of each microorganism. increased glucose concentration resulted in stimulation of ethanol production by all strains, and of butanol and butyric acid by c. sporogenes. with c. bifermentans, there was a parallel increase in ethanol and acetic acid production and decreased formation of propanol and propionic, iso-butyric and iso-valeric acids. increased ethanol formation by p. anaerobius was accompanied by an increase in acetic acid and a decrease in butan-1-ol production. the greatest incremental change in glc profiles occurred when glucose concentration was raised from zero to 0.1% (w/v). these data suggest that glucose concentration in a medium for glc analysis must be rigorously controlled if reproducible results are to be obtained.

TI  == the recovery of anaerobic bacteria from swabs in three transport systems. statistical evaluation by application of a variance component model.
AB  == the recovery of six anaerobic species from swabs in three transport systems was quantitatively evaluated. the test strains were bacteroides fragilis, b. melaninogenicus ss. intermedius, fusobacterium necrophorum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, eubacterium lentum, and clostridium ramosum. the transport systems were a charcoal-impregnated cotton swab in modified stuart's transport medium (ms), or a plain cotton swab in either a dry aerobic tube (da) or an aerobic agar tube (aa). swabs were charged with a known number of organisms of the test strain and inserted in the appropriate transport systems. immediately hereafter the swabs were transferred to glass tubes with reduced buffer. after vigorous shaking, aliquots from the buffer were seeded onto blood agar plates, and the number of colony forming units (cfu) was counted after incubation. the number of  cfus from independent replications had a variation that was too large to be accounted for by the poisson distribution. the probability of recovery (por) was  defined as the number of cfu recovered from a swab as a percentage of the original inoculum. the logarithms of the por values were analyzed with a variance component model. this showed that estimated values of por were significantly higher in da (44%) than in aa (23%), while the value for ms (33%) did not differ  significantly from those for aa or da. it is concluded that in ms, friction between swab and medium does not contribute significantly to bacterial recovery loss, as compared to aa and da.

AB  == root canals of 49 teeth with necrotic pulp tissue in five monkeys were infected with streptococcus faecalis ss liquefaciens, actinomyces bovis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and bacteroides oralis in various combinations. after 6 months the root canals and the periapical tissues were subjected to radiographic, bacteriologic, and histologic examinations. signs of periapical inflammation were radiographically registered in 41 teeth, most frequently in teeth inoculated with a mixed flora. in 11 out of 16 teeth infected separately with strep. faecalis ss liquefaciens, apical periodontitis was observed. sera from the monkeys prior to and after the experimental inoculation were analyzed by means of gel diffusion, hemagglutination (ha), and complement binding test for antibodies against different antigen preparations of the homologous bacterial strains used for the inoculation. detectable antibodies were seen with antigens of b. oralis in all five monkeys. agglutinating antibodies were demonstrated with lipopolysaccharide-antigen of b. oralis in titers between  1:40 and 1:320. a marked reduction of the antibody level against lipopolysaccharide (lps) antigen after mercaptoethanol treatment indicated that a main part of the antibodies registered was of igm-class. the study shows that certain antigens of bacterial origin from infected root canals, while affecting the periapical tissues, also stimulate the production of circulating antibodies.

AB  == an anaerobic incubator was compared with a standard jar system for the isolation  of anaerobes from clinical material. seventy specimens were selected as likely to yield anaerobes: 342 different anaerobes were isolated in the incubator and 347 in anaebrobic jars. these included bacteroides spp (43%), peptococcus spp (26%),  peptostreptococcus spp (13%), veillonella spp (7%), fusobacterium spp (7%), clostridium spp (2%) and miscellaneous gram-positive nonsporing bacilli (2%). differences in isolation rates for each system were inconsistent and minor. sixteen anaerobes were chosen for quantitative tests at the beginning and end of  the study period. miles and misra counts showed a slight advantage of the incubator for f nucleatum, but no difference for b fragilis, b thetaiomicron, b uniformis, b bivius, b corrodens, f mortiferum, ps anaerobius, p prevotii or propionibacterium acnes. in almost all cases, colonies in anaerobic jars were slightly larger than those in the incubator. disc antibiotic sensitivity tests gave the same results in each system, at the beginning and end of the study period. the anaerobic incubator provides an effective means of isolation of anaerobes in a clinical laboratory. however, several design features of the prototype would require change if the system were introduced.

TI  == leucine dissimilation to isovaleric and isocaproic acids by cell suspensions of amino acid fermenting anaerobes: the stickland reaction revisited.
AB  == freshly compared cell suspensions of clostridia (clostridium bifermentans, c. botulinum proteolytic type a, c. difficile, c. sordellii, and c. sporogenes) and  peptostreptococcus anaerobius converted leucine to isovaleric (iv) and isocaproic (ic) acids in the absence of other amino acids. the optimal ph for conversion was between 8 and 9 at 37 degrees c. the stoichiometry of reaction was compatible with that expected for the stickland reaction, as the ratio of iv to ic was 1:2,  the amount of co2 produced was equivalent to that of iv, and ammonium ion concentrations were equal to the total c5 and c6 acids formed. the presence of alanine and valine (proton donors in the stickland reaction) in incubations effectively increased the concentration of ic at the expense of iv production, implying that leucine acted there primarily as a proton acceptor. glycine and proline (proton acceptors) stimulated both iv and ic production from leucine, but increases in iv concentrations were proportionately greater than for ic so that leucine was primarily a proton donor in the presence of proton acceptors. glucose stimulated the conversion of leucine to volatile fatty acids but favoured ic production. production of ic from leucine was inhibited by surface active compounds (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and desoxycholate) as well as arsenite  and iodoacetate. the redox dyes methyl viologen and phenosafranine inhibited ic production more severely than iv production, as did the nitroimidazole antimicrobial agent, metronidazole.

TI  == biotransformation of 1-nitropyrene in intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds have recently been found in photocopies, urban  atmosphere, automobile exhaust and wastewater. 1-nitropyrene (1-np) is readily formed when pyrene, ubiquitous in the environment, is exposed to nitrogen dioxide in the urban atmosphere or in automobile exhaust, and is highly mutagenic, inducing 449 his+ revertants/plate/nmol from salmonella typhimurium strain ta98 in the absence of s9 fraction in the salmonella-microsome test. it is possible to swallow sputum or some food containing 1-np and it would come into contact with the normal bacterial flora. we determined the 1-np nitroreductase activity in environmental and laboratory bacterial strains. we found that the mutagenicity of 1-np mixed with the feces of a healthy man or a culture of anaerobic bacteria was decreased. the product proved to be 1-aminopyrene (1-ap), based on its fluorescence spectrum, its mass spectrum, and its characteristic thin layer chromatographic and high performance liquid chromatographic patterns. the 1-np nitroreductase activity of aerobic bacteria was low, but crude extracts from the  anaerobic bacteria, i.e., bacteroides fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, fusobacterium mortiferum, f. nucleatum, clostridium perfringens, c. sporogenes, bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, eubacterium lentum, e. limosum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, all easily converted 1-np to 1-ap and proportionally decreased the mutagenic activity of 1-np.

AB  == peptostreptococcus anaerobius vpi 4330-1 was tested under various conditions for  examination of the bactericidal effect of hydrogen peroxide. the cells were most  rapidly killed by hydrogen peroxide when they were in the exponential-growth phase. cooling or starving the cells decreased the bactericidal effect of hydrogen peroxide. the ionophore nigericin and the metal ion chelating agent 2,2'-bipyridine stopped macromolecular syntheses and greatly decreased the bactericidal effect of hydrogen peroxide. the ionophore valinomycin and the glycolytic inhibitor iodoacetate also stopped the syntheses of the macromolecules but only slightly decreased the bactericidal effect of hydrogen peroxide. novobiocin, an inhibitor of deoxyribonucleic acid gyrase, and chloramphenicol, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, were not able to decrease the bactericidal effect of hydrogen peroxide. these findings implicate metal ions and an active metabolism of the organism in the bactericidal effect of hydrogen peroxide.

AB  == peptostreptococcus anaerobius vpi 4330-1 was exposed to atmospheric oxygen in a dilution bland (0.2% gelatin, salts, resazurin) solution. the organisms were rapidly killed when the solution contained cysteine. the organisms were effectively protected by catalase and horseradish peroxidase as well as by the metal ion-chelating agents 8-hydroxyquinoline and 2,2'-bipyridine. superoxide dismutase increased the rate of killing of the organisms, whereas singlet oxygen  quenchers and scavengers of hydroxyl free radicals did not protect the organisms  from the toxic effect of cysteine. hydrogen peroxide was formed when cysteine was exposed to oxygen in the dilution blank solution, and the reaction was inhibited  by metal ion-chelating agents. the organisms were rapidly killed by 20 microm hydrogen peroxide in anaerobic dilution blank solution. the toxic effect of hydrogen peroxide in anaerobic dilution blank solution. the toxic effect of hydrogen peroxide was completely abolished by catalase and metal ion-chelating agents. these results indicated that hydrogen peroxide was formed in the dilution blank solution in a metal ion-catalyzed autoxidation of cysteine and that hydrogen peroxide was toxic to p. anaerobius vpi 4330-1 in a reaction also catalyzed by metal ions.

TI  == tyrosine degradation in presumptive identification of peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  == a new tyrosine medium was developed and evaluated for the differentiation of peptostreptococcus anaerobius from other anaerobic, gram-positive cocci. the strains included 159 originating from clinical specimens and 13 reference strains received from other workers in the field. only one strain of each species was included in the study from multiple cultures from the same patient. this medium is simple to prepare and can be used in a small clinical laboratory. one hundred  seventy-two strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci were grown and evaluated with the new tyrosine medium; 36 strains (100%) of p. anaerobius degradated the tyrosine crystals when incubated at 37 degrees c under anaerobic conditions in a  gaspak jar (baltimore biological laboratory) for approximately 72 h. on the other hand, 135 of 136 other anaerobic gram-positive cocci were negative for tyrosine degradation, but grew on the tyrosine agar plate when incubated anaerobically. the single strain that degraded tyrosine was 1 of the 13 isolates of peptostreptococcus micros studied.

TI  == effects of storage in an anaerobic transport system on bacteria in known polymicrobial mixtures and in clinical specimens.
AB  == an anaerobic transport system (ats) which provides for catalytic removal of oxygen was evaluated by using in vitro-prepared polymicrobial mixtures of logphase bacteria and clinical specimens. inoculated swabs were stored at room temperature in (i) aerobic, (ii) anaerobic glove box, and (iii) ats environments, and bacteria were quantitated after 2, 24, 48, and 72 h. bacteria in a three-part mixture of bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and escherichia coli and in a five-part mixture of b. fragilis, p. anaerobius, fusobacterium nucleatum, staphylococcus epidermidis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa survived 72 h of storage in the ats and anaerobic glove box environments, but the anaerobic species were inactivated in the aerobic storage except for b. fragilis in pure culture or in the three-part mixture. changes in relative proportions among the species in a mixture were least in the ats and anaerobic glove box environments and greatest during the aerobic storage, particularly in the five-part mixture. bacteria present in pure or mixed culture in clinical specimens generally survived 72 h of storage in the ats. these data indicate that changes in relative proportions occur with prolonged storage even under anaerobic conditions, but that the ats would be most effective for preserving anaerobic bacteria and preventing drastic concentration changes and overgrowth of facultative and aerobic bacteria.

TI  == factors related to the oxygen tolerance of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the effect of atmospheric oxygen on the viability of 13 strains of anaerobic bacteria, two strains of facultative bacteria, and one aerobic organism was examined. there were great variations in oxygen tolerance among the bacteria. all facultative bacteria survived more than 72 h of exposure to atmospheric oxygen. the survival time for anaerobes ranged from less than 45 min for peptostreptococcus anaerobius to more than 72 h for two clostridium perfringens strains. an effort was made to relate the degree of oxygen tolerance to the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidases in cell-free extracts of the bacteria. all facultative bacteria and a number of anaerobic bacteria possessed superoxide dismutase. there was a correlation between superoxide dismutase activity and oxygen tolerance, but there were notable exceptions. polyacrylamide gel electropherograms stained for superoxide dismutase indicated that many of the anaerobic bacteria contained at least two electrophoretically distinct enzymes with superoxide dismutase activity. all facultative bacteria contained peroxidase, whereas none of the anaerobic bacteria possessed measurable amounts of this enzyme. catalase activity was variable among the bacteria and showed no relationship to oxygen tolerance. the ability of the bacteria to reduce oxygen was also examined and related to enzyme content and oxygen tolerance. in general, organisms that survived for relatively long periods of time in the presence of oxygen but demonstrated little superoxide dismutase activity reduced little oxygen. the effects of medium composition and conditions  of growth were examined for their influence on the level of the three enzymes. bacteria grown on the surface of an enriched blood agar medium generally had more enzyme activity than bacteria grown in a liquid medium. the data indicate that superoxide dismutase activity and oxygen reduction rates are important determinants related to the tolerance of anaerobic bacteria to oxygen.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical formation in anaerobic broth media exposed to atmospheric oxygen.
AB  == fourteen different broth media were autoclaved under anaerobic conditions and then exposed to atmospheric oxygen. the hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical  formation as well as the bactericidal effect of the media were studied. the rate  of killing of peptostreptococcus anaerobius vpi 4330-1 was high in media that rapidly autoxidized and accumulated hydrogen peroxide. in actinomyces broth (bbl), 50% of the cells were killed within 2 min, and in brewer thioglycolate medium (difco), 50% were killed within 11 min, whereas more than 50% of the cells survived for more than 2 h in clausen medium (oxoid), fluid thioglycolate medium  (bbl), and thioglycolate medium without dextrose or indicator (difco). only media that contained phosphate and glucose had a tendency to accumulate hydrogen peroxide. a solution of phosphate and glucose autoxidized when it had been heated to 120 degrees c for at least 5 min and when the ph of the solution was higher than 6.5. transitional metal ions catalyzed the autoxidation, but they were not necessary for the reaction to occur. of the other substances heated in phosphate  buffer, only alpha-hydroxycarbonyl compounds autoxidized with accumulation of hydrogen peroxide. superoxide dismutase decreased the autoxidation rate of most of the broth media. this indicated that superoxide radicals were generated in these media.

TI  == enhancement of experimental anaerobic infections by blood, hemoglobin, and hemostatic agents.
AB  == certain foreign materials have been demonstrated to enhance the infectivity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. whole blood and other protein compounds encountered in surgical settings or trauma were tested for their effect on infectivity of nonsporeforming anaerobic bacteria. infectious synergistic mixtures of bacteroides fragilis plus peptostreptococcus anaerobius and bacteroides melaninogenicus plus fusobacterium necrophorum were each diluted to a barely noninfectious or minimally infectious concentration (subinfective inoculum) that was injected intraperitoneally into mice alone and in combination  with test proteins. infectivity was measured by deaths from sepsis or abscess(es) within the abdominal cavity at autopsy at 1 week. two hemostatic agents, gelfoam  powder and avitene (final concentrations, 10 mg/ml), and crystalline hemoglobin (4 g/100 ml) each produced a marked increase (p < 0.001) in the rate of infection when mixed with a normally subinfective inoculum of either bacterial mixture. fresh homologous mouse blood (0.25 ml) injected intraperitoneally without anticoagulant also significantly enhanced infectivity (p < 0.01) of a subinfective inoculum of b. fragilis plus p. anaerobius. these studies demonstrated the capacity of whole blood, hemoglobin, and hemostatic agents to enhance the infectivity of certain nonsporeforming anaerobic bacteria. the high concentrations of anaerobic bacteria in the gastrointestinal, female genital, and respiratory tracts produce an increased risk of human infection after surgery or  trauma in these sites; the protein agents studied here may further enhance infection.

TI  == bactericidal effect of anaerobic broth exposed to atmospheric oxygen tested on peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  == peptostreptococcus anaerobius strain vpi 4330-1 was used as the test organism in  an evaluation of the bactericidal effect of anaerobic broth exposed to air. the test organism, grown under anaerobic conditions in trypticase soy broth, was diluted in buffered salt solution, and about 2 x 10(4) cells were suspended in 10 ml of an aerated broth. ninety percent of the cells were killed within 15 min in  actinomyces broth and within 50 min in trypticase soy broth. all cells survived for 2 h in fluid thioglycolate medium. addition of dabco [1,4-diazabicyclo (2.2.2) octane] or mannitol to trypticase soy broth did not influence the death rate of the organism, whereas superoxide dismutase decreased the death rate. addition of catalase or manganese dioxide to the broth kept all the cells viable  for 2 h. of the three broth media tested, actinomyces broth reduced oxygen at the highest rate and trypticase soy broth reduced it at the slowest rate. hydrogen peroxide could be demonstrated in actinomyces broth and in trypticase soy broth but not in fluid thioglycolate medium. in addition to catalase, manganese dioxide also removed all hydrogen peroxide from trypticase soy broth, and superoxide dismutase significantly decreased the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the broth. the results suggest that hydrogen peroxide mediated the toxic effect of atmospheric oxygen in these broth media.

(5 strains) were susceptible.  on the contrary, propionibacterium acnes (6 strains) was resistant to 100 mcg/ml  or more of tinidazole and metronidazole. the antibacterial activity of tinidazole was stronger against bacteroides than that of metronidazole, while almost equal against peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium and fusobacterium. tinidazole was bactericidal against f. varium in a concentration of 2 mic till 24 hours of incubation but did not show such an activity on b. fragilis ss. fragilis in same concentration even after 12 hours of incubation. on the other hand, metronidazole was bactericidal against b. fragilis ss. fragilis while was not against f. varium. against p. prevotii bactericidal activity of both drugs was similar. tinidazole as well as metronidazole is an excellent chemotherapeutic agent against anaerobic bacteria excluding propionibacterium acnes and bifidobacterium adolescentis.

AB  == the production of extracellular deoxyribonuclease was examined with anaerobic organisms isolated from clinical specimens. nuclease activity was extraordinarily common. all strains of fusobacterium, including eight species, as well as bacteroides fragilis and b. melaninogenicus, displayed enzyme activity. whereas the gram-positive bacteria were generally less productive, all strains of clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus intermedius, and p. anaerobius specifically produced deoxyribonuclease. the test is taxonomically valuable, particularly in the characterization of gram-positive cocci, since a deoxyribonuclease-producing coccus indicates p. intermedius or p. anaerobius. additionally, possession of the enzyme may prove to be a useful correlate of the  potential pathogenicity of anaerobes.

TI  == bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  == human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, eh < -42 mv at ph 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic pmn. anaerobic pmn were able to kill staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus, viridans streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and peptococcus magnus normally. organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic pmn included staphylococcus  aureus (strains wood 46 and 502a), escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and salmonella typhimurium. these findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide  may be important in the killing of some bacteria.
