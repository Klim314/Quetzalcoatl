TI  - The cultivable microbiota of primary and secondary infected root canals, their susceptibility to antibiotics and association with the signs and symptoms of infection.
AB  - AIM: To examine the presence of microbial species in primary and secondary infections and identify the signs and symptoms associated with them. METHODOLOGY: A total number of 37 root canals from 33 patients undergoing root canal treatment were selected. Samples were taken using a sterile paper point following chemomechanical canal instrumentation. Microbiological identification was performed by macromorphological, micromorphological, and commercial biochemical tests (ATB system). The antibiotic susceptibility profile of isolated Enterococcus, Streptococcus and Propionibacterium spp. was evaluated. RESULTS: A total number of 54 species were isolated. The most common was E. faecalis followed by Propionibacterium acnes and Streptococcus spp. Five multidrug-resistant enterococcal strains were isolated. However, resistance to linezolid or glycopeptides was not found. Radiolucency was observed significantly more often in symptomatic infections (p=0.0061) caused by Actinomyces spp. than in asymptomatic ones. CONCLUSIONS: Enterococci and Streptococci were the most commonly isolated bacteria from root canals. The resistance of enterococci to many antimicrobials may pose a problem in their eradication.

TI  - The microbial epidemiology of breast implant infections in a regional referral centre for plastic and reconstructive surgery in the south of France.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast implant infections are usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Gram-negative bacilli are rarely reported to be involved in breast implant infections. METHODS: Thirty-seven cases of microbiologically confirmed breast implant infection managed from January 2008 to June 2012 in the study centre were reviewed, including 10 cases from the study centre itself and 27 cases from private clinics in the region. RESULTS: The prevalence of breast implant infection in the study centre was 0.74% of breast implantation, i.e., 3.23% in breast reconstruction for breast cancer and 0.27% in aesthetic breast augmentation (p=0.0002). Of the 37 cases, 30% had undergone radiotherapy and 11% had undergone a lymph node dissection. S. aureus was identified in 18 cases, Gram-negative bacilli in 10 cases, coagulase-negative staphylococci in eight cases, anaerobic bacteria in eight cases, and streptococci in three cases. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the second most commonly identified pathogen. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequent coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species. In addition to Propionibacterium acnes and Actinomyces neuii, other facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria have not been reported before, e.g., Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Corynebacterium simulans, Dermabacter hominis, Finegoldia magna, and Peptoniphilus harei. Seventy-percent of cases were treated by immediate implant removal. All cases treated only with antibiotics were treated with surgery at the second visit. CONCLUSIONS: The microbiological epidemiology was noted by an increasing the proportion of Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria detected with the advent of MALDI-TOF MS and molecular identification for diagnosis.
TI  - Synergistic effect of 2% chlorhexidine combined with proteolytic enzymes on biofilm disruption and killing.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the dynamics of a disinfection regimen using 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase K in combination with 2% chlorhexidine (with or without ultrasonics) using a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies model biofilm. METHODOLOGY: Nutrient-stressed biofilms (Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actinomyces radicidentis, Streptococcus mitis and Enterococcus faecalis OMGS 3202) were grown in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth. The treatment groups included 1% trypsin and 2% chlorhexidine (CHX), 1% proteinase K and 2% CHX (with and without ultrasonics). 2% CHX was the positive control and untreated group, and sterile saline (with and without ultrasonics) was the negative control. The biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. RESULTS: The trypsin and CHX group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective in reducing viable counts and the substratum coverage than those of all other groups (P < 0.05). The viable counts of the proteinase K and CHX group used with (4.26 +/- 0.58 log10 cfu mL-1 ) or without ultrasonics (5.05 +/- 1.36 log10 cfu mL-1 ) were significantly reduced (P < 0.05) as compared with the untreated control (7.67 +/- 0.84 log10 cfu mL-1 ) and saline groups used with (6.57 +/- 0.73 log10 cfu mL-1 ) and without ultrasonics (6.74 +/- 0.10 log10 cfu mL-1 ). The CHX group was less effective in biofilm disruption compared to when used in combination with trypsin and proteinase K. CONCLUSION: The trypsin and CHX group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective at reducing bacterial viable counts and disrupting biofilm.
TI  - Analysis of bacterial flora associated with peri-implantitis using obligate anaerobic culture technique and 16S rDNA gene sequence.
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze and characterize the predominant bacterial flora associated with peri-implantitis by using culture techniques under obligate anaerobic conditions and 16S rDNA gene sequences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subgingival bacterial specimens were taken from 30 patients: control (n = 15), consisting of patients with only healthy implants; and test (n = 15), consisting of patients with peri-implantitis. In both groups, subgingival bacterial specimens were taken from the deepest sites. An anaerobic glove box system was used to cultivate bacterial strains. The bacterial strains were identified by 16S rDNA genebased polymerase chain reaction and comparison of the gene sequences. RESULTS: Peri-implantitis sites had approximately 10-fold higher mean colony forming units (per milliliter) than healthy implant sites. A total of 69 different bacterial species were identified in the peri-implantitis sites and 53 in the healthy implant sites. The predominant bacterial species in the peri-implantitis sites were Eubacterium nodatum, E. brachy, E. saphenum, Filifactor alocis, Slackia exigua, Parascardovia denticolens, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Centipeda periodontii, and Parvimonas micra. The predominant bacteria in healthy implant sites apart from Streptococcus were Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Veillonella species, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces species, Propionibacterium acnes, and Parvimonas micra. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the environment in the depths of the sulcus showing peri-implantitis is well suited for growth of obligate anaerobic bacteria. The present study demonstrated that the sulcus around oral implants with peri-implantitis harbors high levels of asaccharolytic anaerobic gram-positive rods (AAGPRs) such as E. nodatum, E. brachy, E. saphenum, Filifactor alocis, Slackia exigua, and gram-negative anaerobic rods, suggesting that conventional periodontopathic bacteria are not the only periodontal pathogens active in peri-implantitis, and that AAGPRs may also play an important role.
TI  - The effectiveness of enzymic irrigation in removing a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies biofilm.
AB  - AIM: To establish a nutrient-stressed multispecies model biofilm and investigate  the dynamics of biofilm killing and disruption by 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase K with or without ultrasonic activation. METHODOLOGY: Nutrient-stressed biofilms (Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actinomyces radicidentis, Streptococcus mitis and Enterococcus faecalis OMGS 3202) were grown on hydroxyapatite discs and in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth in modified fluid universal medium. The treatment groups included trypsin, proteinase K, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 1% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) (with and without ultrasonics). NaOCl and chlorhexidine were the positive controls and untreated group, and sterile saline was the negative control. The biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. RESULTS: Nutrient stress in the multispecies biofilm was apparent as the medium pH became alkaline, glucose was absent, and serum proteins were degraded in the supernatant. The CLSM showed the percentage reduction in viable bacteria at the biofilm surface level due to nutrient starvation. On the disc model, trypsin and proteinase K were effective in killing bacteria; their aerobic viable counts were significantly lower (P < 0.01) than the negative control and chlorhexidine. NaOCl was the most effective agent (P < 0.001). In the tooth model, when compared to saline, trypsin with ultrasonics caused significant killing both aerobically and anaerobically (P < 0.05). Chlorhexidine (1.46 +/- 0.42), trypsin (3.56 +/- 1.18) and proteinase K (4.2 +/- 1.01) with ultrasonics were significantly effective (P < 0.05) in reducing the substratum coverage as compared to saline with ultrasonics (12% +/- 4.9). CONCLUSION: Trypsin with ultrasonic activation has a biofilm killing and disrupting potential.
TI  - Suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Suppuration (SUP) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. The aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with SUP in patients with chronic (CP) and aggressive (AgP) periodontitis. METHODS: A total of 156 patients with CP and 66 with AgP were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). The counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. Comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests, respectively. Associations between frequency of SUP and bacterial species were analyzed by the Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The prevalence of SUP in patients with CP was 24.4%, and in patients with AgP it was 30.3%, and the percentage of SUP sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (P >0.05). SUP sites from patients with CP had significantly higher counts of Veillonella parvula, Dialister pneumosintes, Tannerella forsythia, and Prevotella nigrescens than SUP sites from patients with AgP (P <0.005). Significant positive correlations between high frequency of SUP and high levels of Actinomyces spp, Streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with CP (P <0.05). In patients with AgP, Actinomyces oris, Propionibacterium acnes, P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with SUP, whereas Prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with SUP (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: SUP sites from patients with CP harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than SUP sites from patients with AgP. Actinomyces spp., Streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, T. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with SUP.
TI  - Trends of SAPHO therapy: should we be content?
AB  - The interventional studies with bone biopsy of the SAPHO lesions and microbiological investigation are a significant addition to a long range of publications showing an association of SAPHO with Propionibacterium acnes. Infectious agents isolated from SAPHO patients have merited special attention for many years. Their possible etiological role is supported by the pathogen isolation from different sites: anterior chest wall, spine, synovial fluid, bone tissue, and skin pustules. A range of pathogens have been found, including Staphylococcus aureus, Hemophilusparainfluenzae, actinomyces, and even Treponemapallidum. P. acnes is a much more frequent pathogen and plays a particular role. The article focus is to emphasize limited use of interventional method to verify infection ethology of SAPHO in publications last two years. Successful therapy may be really effective and eradicative on a basis of the pathogen identification.Randomized control studies are needed to confirm the effects of antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Evaluation of the new OxyPlate Anaerobic System for the isolation of ocular anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - AIM: Anaerobic bacteria can cause ocular infections. We tested the OxyPlate Anaerobic System (OXY) to isolate pertinent anaerobic bacteria that can cause ocular disease. METHODS: OXY, which does not require direct anaerobic conditions (i.e. bags, jars), was compared to conventional isolation of incubating culture media in anaerobic bags. Standard colonies counts were performed on anaerobic ocular bacterial isolates under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (anaerobic bags) using agar media: 1) OXY (aerobic only), 2) 5% sheep blood (SB), 3) Chocolate, and 4) Schaedler. The bacteria tested were de-identified ocular isolates cultured from endophthalmitis and dacryocystitis that include 10 Propionibacterium acnes and 3 Actinomyces species. The colony counts for each bacteria isolate, on each culturing condition, were ranked from largest to smallest, and non-parametrically compared to determine the best culturing condition. RESULTS: All anaerobic conditions were positive for all of the anaerobic isolates. SB and Schaedler's agar under aerobic conditions did not support the growth of anaerobic bacteria. Sparse growth was noted on chocolate agar with Propionibacterium acnes. As an anaerobic system, SB in an anaerobic bag isolated higher colony counts than OXY (P=0.0028) and chocolate agar (P=0.0028). CONCLUSION: Although OXY did not test to be more efficient than other anaerobic systems, it appears to be a reasonable alternative for isolating anaerobic bacteria from ocular sites. The use of an agar medium in a specially designed plate, without the requirement of an anaerobic bag, rendered OXY as an advantage over other anaerobic systems.
TI  - Comparison of the antibacterial effect of modified 3-mix paste versus Ultrapex over anaerobic microorganisms from infected root canals of primary teeth: an in vitro study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial efficacy of a modified 3-mix paste and to compare it with an iodoform paste (Ultrapex) against anaerobic microorganisms isolated from root canals of infected or necrotic primary teeth. STUDY DESIGN: An in vitro experimental assay was performed over isolated and identified anaerobic microorganisms of 21 samples, in order to compare the antimicrobial ability of both root canal filling materials, using a disc-diffusion method. RESULTS: A total of 21 microbial samples (15 polymicrobial and 6 monomicrobial) were obtained, from which 19 different strains were identified. Modified 3-mix paste showed an excellent antimicrobial effect against most of both kinds of microbial samples, although some of them exhibited resistance; on the other hand, Ultrapex showed only minimal antimicrobial ability (null or low categories). Clostridium ramosum exhibited the most resistance to both materials. CONCLUSION: The bactericidal effect of the modified 3-mix paste was superior to Ultrapex, with a statistically significant difference, against anaerobic microorganisms isolated from infected root canals of primary teeth.
TI  - Evaluation of the Andromas matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry system for identification of aerobically growing Gram-positive bacilli.
AB  - Matrix-associated laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is a rapid and simple microbial identification method. Previous reports using the Biotyper system suggested that this technique requires a preliminary extraction step to identify Gram-positive rods (GPRs), a technical issue that may limit the routine use of this technique to identify pathogenic GPRs in the clinical setting. We tested the accuracy of the MALDI-TOF MS Andromas strategy to identify a set of 659 GPR isolates representing 16 bacterial genera and 72 species by the direct colony method. This bacterial collection included 40 C. diphtheriae, 13 C. pseudotuberculosis, 19 C. ulcerans, and 270 other Corynebacterium isolates, 32 L. monocytogenes and 24 other Listeria isolates, 46 Nocardia, 75 Actinomyces, 18 Actinobaculum, 11 Propionibacterium acnes, 18 Propionibacterium avidum, 30 Lactobacillus, 21 Bacillus, 2 Rhodococcus equi, 2 Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and 38 other GPR isolates, all identified by reference techniques. Totals of 98.5% and 1.2% of non-Listeria GPR isolates were identified to the species or genus level, respectively. Except for L. grayi isolates that were identified to the species level, all other Listeria isolates were identified to the genus level because of highly similar spectra. These data demonstrate that rapid identification of pathogenic GPRs can be obtained without an extraction step by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
TI  - Subgingival microbial profiles of generalized aggressive and chronic periodontal  diseases.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to distinguish between generalized aggressive (GAgP) and chronic periodontitis (CP) based on the subgingival microbial profiles predominant in these diseases. METHODS: Two-hundred and sixty subjects, 75 with GAgP and 185 with CP were recruited. Full-mouth clinical measurements were recorded. Individual subgingival plaque samples were taken from 7 sites per subject and analyzed for the prevalence and levels of 51 species by chequerboard. Differences between groups were examined by the Mann-Whitney test. Associations between bacterial species and GAgP were examined by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Actinomyces gerensceriae, Actinomyces israelli, Eubacterium nodatum and Propionibacterium acnes were detected in significantly greater counts in GAgP, whereas Capnocytophaga ochracea, Fusobacterium periodonticum, Staphylococcus aureus and Veillonella parvula were more predominant in CP patients (adjusted p < 0.001). E. nodatum (at mean levels >/=4 x 10(5)) increased significantly the probability of a subject being diagnosed with GAgP than CP (OR 2.44 [0.96-6.20]), whereas P. gingivalis (OR 0.34 [0.11-0.93]) and T. denticola (OR 0.35 [0.11-0.94]) were associated with CP. CONCLUSIONS: Very few subgingival species differed in prevalence and/or levels between GAgP and CP in this sample population. In particular, E. nodatum was strongly related to GAgP, whereas P. gingivalis and T. denticola were associated with CP.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota in adult Down syndrome periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The subgingival microbiota in Down syndrome and non-Down syndrome adults receiving periodic dental care was examined for 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization and the results were related to clinical periodontal attachment loss. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 44 Down syndrome, 66 non-Down syndrome mentally retarded and 83 mentally normal adults were clinically evaluated. This involved, for each subject, the removal of subgingival specimens from three interproximal sites on different teeth; all subgingival samples per subject were then pooled and assessed for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial species using species-specific whole-genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Significant group differences in species proportions averaged across subjects were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and associations between subgingival species and mean subject attachment loss within Down syndrome and non-Down syndrome subject groups were quantified using Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Down syndrome subjects exhibited greater attachment loss than non-Down syndrome subjects (p=0.05). Most microbial species were present in Down syndrome subjects at levels similar to non-Down syndrome subjects, except for higher proportions of Selenomonas noxia, Propionibacterium acnes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus oralis in Down syndrome subjects compared with non-Down syndrome study subjects, higher proportions of Treponema socranskii in Down syndrome subjects compared with non-Down syndrome mentally retarded subjects, and higher proportions of Streptococcus constellatus in Down syndrome subjects compared with mentally normal subjects. Down syndrome adults classified with periodontitis revealed higher subgingival levels of T. socranskii than Down syndrome subjects with no periodontitis (p=0.02). Higher subgingival proportions of S. constellatus, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, S. noxia and Prevotella nigrescens showed significant positive correlations (r=0.35-0.42) and higher proportions of Actinomyces naeslundii II and Actinomyces odontolyticus showed negative correlations (r=-0.36 to -0.40), with increasing mean subject attachment loss in Down syndrome adults. CONCLUSION: Individuals with Down syndrome show higher levels of some subgingival bacterial species and specific associations between certain subgingival bacterial species and loss of periodontal attachment. These findings are consistent with the notion that certain subgingival bacteria may contribute to the increased level of periodontal disease seen in Down syndrome individuals and raise the question as to the reason for increased colonization in Down syndrome.
TI  - Molecular detection of in-vivo microbial contamination of metallic orthodontic brackets by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Knowing the microbiota that colonizes orthodontic appliances is important for planning strategies and implementing specific preventive measures during treatment. The purpose of this clinical trial was to evaluate in vivo the contamination of metallic orthodontic brackets with 40 DNA probes for different bacterial species by using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (CDDH) technique. METHODS: Eighteen patients, 11 to 29 years of age having fixed orthodontic treatment, were enrolled in the study. Each subject had 2 new metallic brackets bonded to different premolars in a randomized manner. After 30 days, the brackets were removed and processed for analysis by CDDH. Data on bacterial contamination were analyzed descriptively and with the Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn post tests (alpha = 0.05). Forty microbial species (cariogenic microorganisms, bacteria of the purple, yellow, green, orange complexes, "red complex +Treponema socranskii," and the cluster of Actinomyces) were assessed. RESULTS: Most bacterial species were present in all subjects, except for Streptococcus constellatus, Campylobacter rectus, Tannerella forsythia, T socranskii, and Lactobacillus acidophillus (94.4%), Propionibacterium acnes I and Eubacterium nodatum (88.9%), and Treponema denticola (77.8%). Among the cariogenic microorganisms, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus were found in larger numbers than L acidophillus and Lactobacillus casei (P <0.001). The periodontal pathogens of the orange complex were detected in larger numbers than those of the "red complex +T socranskii" (P <0.0001). Among the bacteria not associated with specific pathologies, Veillonella parvula (purple complex) was the most frequently detected strain (P <0.0001). The numbers of yellow and green complex bacteria and the cluster of Actinomyces were similar (P >0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Metallic brackets in use for 1 month were multi-colonized by several bacterial species, including cariogenic microorganisms and periodontal pathogens, reinforcing the need for meticulous oral hygiene and additional preventive measures to maintain oral health in orthodontic patients.
TI  - Detection of nine microorganisms from the initial carious root lesions using a TaqMan-based real-time PCR.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to quantify nine selected cariogenic bacteria in plaque from sound root surfaces and initial carious root lesions using TaqMan PCR and to analyse a putative dependence on the kind of initial periodontal treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-four subjects with generalized chronic periodontitis were randomly allocated to one of the following initial periodontal therapies: full-mouth disinfection, full-mouth scaling and root planing or scaling and root planing within 7 days. Plaque samples were taken before and after periodontal treatment and analysed by TaqMan PCR. RESULTS: The quantity of the cariogenic bacteria Actinomyces spp., Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacilllus spp., Rothia dentocariosa, Parvimonas micra, Propionibacterium acnes and Neisseria mucosa were significantly higher, while the quantity of Veillonella parvula was significantly lower on initial carious lesions than on the sound surfaces both before and after periodontal therapy. No significant differences could be found in any of the tested bacteria except P. micra on initial carious lesions and sound surfaces for both examinations between the groups. CONCLUSION: All the nine species analysed were found to be present in initial carious root lesions as well as sound root surfaces but in different quantities, independent of the different periodontal therapies.
TI  - Comparison of the in vivo antimicrobial effectiveness of sodium hypochlorite and  chlorhexidine used as root canal irrigants: a molecular microbiology study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this clinical study was to compare the antimicrobial effects of 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) when used as irrigants during treatment of teeth with apical periodontitis. METHODS: Forty-seven single-rooted single-canal teeth with necrotic pulps and asymptomatic apical periodontitis were selected for this study according to stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria. Bacterial samples were taken at the baseline (S1) and after (S2) chemomechanical preparation using 2.5% NaOCl (n = 30) or 0.12% CHX (n = 17) as the irrigant. Bacterial, archaeal, and fungal presence was evaluated by broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR), whereas bacterial identifications were performed by a closed-ended reverse-capture checkerboard approach targeting 28 candidate endodontic pathogens. RESULTS: All S1 samples were PCR positive for bacterial presence but negative for both archaea and fungi. Both NaOCl- and CHX-based protocols were significantly effective in reducing the bacterial levels and number of taxa. No significant differences were observed between them in all tested parameters including the incidence of negative PCR results in S2 (40% for NaOCl vs 47% for CHX, p = 0.8), reduction in the number of taxa per canal (p = 0.3), and reduction in the bacterial levels (p = 0.07). The most prevalent taxa in S2 samples from the NaOCl group were Propionibacterium acnes, Streptococcus species, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Selenomonas sputigena. In the CHX group, the most prevalent taxa in S2 were Dialister invisus, Actinomyces israelii, Prevotella baroniae, Propionibacterium acidifaciens, and Streptococcus species. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment protocols using irrigation with either NaOCl or CHX succeeded in significantly reducing the the number of bacterial taxa and their levels in infected root canals, with no significant difference between these substances.
TI  - Effects of Er:YAG laser irradiation on biofilm-forming bacteria associated with endodontic pathogens in vitro.
AB  - With the development of dental laser delivery systems that can enter into the root canals, it is possible to use Er:YAG lasers to remove the residual biofilm associated with infected root canals. We examined their effects against biofilms made of Actinomyces naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei, Propionibacterium acnes, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, or Prevotella nigrescens in vitro. After Er:YAG laser irradiation with energy densities ranging between 0.38-0.98 J/cm(2), the biofilm samples on hydroxyapatite disks were quantitatively and morphologically evaluated. The Er:YAG laser was effective against biofilms of 6 of the bacterial species examined, with the exception of those formed by L. casei. After irradiation, the numbers of viable cells in the biofilms were significantly decreased, whereas atrophic changes in bacterial cells and reductions in biofilm cell density were seen morphologically. Er: YAG lasers might be suitable for clinical application as a suppressive and removal device of biofilms in endodontic treatments.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the effect of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine on oral microorganisms.
AB  - The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effects of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine on the viability of some oral bacterial species. It also evaluated the ability of these bacteria to metabolize those substances. Single-species biofilms of Streptococcus gordonii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, or Fusobacterium nucleatum and dual-species biofilms of S. gordonii -- F. nucleatum and F. nucleatum -- P. gingivalis were grown on hydroxyapatite discs. Seven species were studied as planktonic cells, including Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces naeslundii, and the species mentioned above. The viability of planktonic cells and biofilms was analyzed by susceptibility tests and time-kill assays, respectively, against different concentrations of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine. High-performance liquid chromatography was performed to quantify nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations in the culture media after the assays. Susceptibility tests and viability assays showed that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine cannot reduce or stimulate bacterial growth. High-performance liquid chromatography results showed that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations were not altered after bacteria exposure. These findings indicate that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine, in the concentrations used, cannot affect significantly the growth of these oral bacterial strains. Moreover, these species do not seem to metabolize these substances.
TI  - [Granulomatous diseases and pathogenic microorganism].
AB  - Granuloma formation is a chronic inflammatory reaction where macrophage system and other inflammatory cells are involved. After some antigen exposure and processing, T cells, macrophages, epithelioid cells, and giant cell are activated, and granulomas are formed. Granuloma is considered as a defense mechanism against antigens, which stay in the organs without inactivation. Granulomas including fibroblasts extra-cellular matrix surround and isolate the antigens. Granulomas are classified to noninfectious granulomas and infectious granulomas. However recent studies revealed pathogenic microorganism are suspected to be a cause of granuloma in non-inflammatory diseases. Balance between pathogenic microorganisms and defense mechanisms of the host might be important in the special immunologic reaction. In some cases, it is hard to clearly classify infectious and noninfectious granulomas. Recently, Eishi et al. reported that latent infection of Propionibacterium acnes might be cause of sarcoidosis. Several hypersensitivity pneumonias are considered to be caused by exogenous microorganisms. The symposium was organized to know and clarify the new mechanisms of non-infectious granulomatous lung diseases and pathogenic microorganisms. This report is a summary of a symposium entitled "Granulomatous Diseases and Pathogenic Microorganism", organized in the 82nd Japanese Society for Tuberculosis (president Dr. Mitsunori Sakatani, M.D.). 1. Imaging of Granulomatous Lung Diseases: Masanori AKIRA (Department of Radiology, National Hospital Organization Kinki-chuo Chest Medical Center) High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is a useful tool in the evaluation of parenchymal changes in patients with a granulomatous lung disease. In sarcoidosis, the HRCT findings include small, well-defined nodules in relation to lymphatic roots, lymph node enlargement, and middle or upper lobe predominance. The appearances of subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis include ill-defined centrilobular nodules, ground-glass opacity, and air trapping especially on expiratory CT scan. Those of Langerhans cell histiocytosis include bizarre thin-walled lung cysts, centrilobular nodules and upper lobe predominance. Each of granulomatous lung disease has some characteristic HRCT appearances, but they all are non-specific for diagnosis. HRCT is also useful for grading of parenchymal changes in granulomatous lung diseases. 2. Histopathology of granulomatous lung diseases with special reference to differential diagnosis of infectious disease: Tamiko TAKEMURA (Department of Pathology, Japanese Red Cross Medical Center) The lung is commonly involved by various granulomatous diseases of various etiology. It is difficult to pathologically differentiate these granuloumatous diseases to conduct appropriate therapy, because of morphological similarity of epithelioid cell granuloma, variable etiology, and difficulty of identification of causative agents. Granulomatous diseases generally are divided into infectious and non-infectious ones for treatment. Although infectious granulomas usually reveal necrosis and abscess, non-infectious ones occasionally also reveal necrosis. In cases with granulomas in the lung, it is necessary to explore the etiologic agents including environmental ones. 3. Sarcoidosis and Propionibacterium acnes: Yoshinobu EISHI (Department of Pathology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University) P. acnes can cause latent infection in peripheral lung tissue and the mediastinal lymph nodes and persist intracellularly in a cell-wall-deficient form. This dormant form of P. acnes can be activated endogenously under certain environmental conditions (hormones, stress, living habits, etc.) and proliferate in cells at the sites of latent infection. Granulomatous inflammation occurs in sarcoidosis patients with hypersensitivity to intracellular proliferation of the cell-wall-deficient bacteria, which can infect other cells or organs when spread via the lymphatic or blood streams. The timely use of antibiotics may not only kill the bacteria proliferating at the site of disease activity, but also prevent endogenous activation of P. acnes. If long term administration of antibiotics eradicates dormant forms of the bacteria persistent in organs, it may lead to complete remission of sarcoidosis. 4. Farmer's lung and thermophilic actinomycetes: Takashi MOURI (Pulmonary Division, Iwate Prefectural Kitakami Hospital), Kohei YAMAUCHI, Hiroshi INOUE (Third Department of Internal Medicine, Iwate Medical University, School of Medicine), Kazuki KONISHI (Morioka Tsunagi Onsen Hospital) Farmer's lung is caused by the allergic reaction to inhalation of thermophilic actinomycetes. Acute symptoms are chill, fever, cough and dyspnea. Fine crackles is characteristic. Pathologically, alveolitis with lymphocytes infiltration and epithelioid cell granuloma and Masson's body are characteristics. Bronchoalveolar lavage analysis shows elevated lymphocytes and diverse CD4/8 ratio (high in average). Isolation from the environment improves the symptoms. Sometimes patients need steroid therapy, 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg of predonisolone. Pulse therapy can be applied for severe cases. SLX analogue can prevent lymphocytes infiltration and granuloma formation in mice model. Some of acute farmer's lung show poor long term prognosis, showing emphysematous, fine granular or small nodules in chest CT. These chronic farmer's lung might be diagnosed as IIPs. 5. Hot tub lung: Takashi OGURA (Kanagawa Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center) Hot Tub Lung (HTL) is a disorder caused by exposure to Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) organisms contaminating hot tub water. Whether this disease represents true infection or hypersensitivity pneumonitis is contoroversial. Recent reports support the theory that this disease represents a hypersensitivity pneumonitis rather than infection. The physicians should suspect a hypersensitivity pneumonitis reaction to MAC in the investigation of patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis of unknown cause.
TI  - Identification of anaerobic nonsporeforming gram-positive bacilli by biochemical  tests and gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - There are many methods to identify anaerobic nonsporeforming bacilli: histological, bacteriological (biochemical test, microsystem API 20 A), serological, cell wall composition analysis, molecular methods and gas-liquid chromatography (GLC). A comparison between biochemical tests and gas-liquid chromatography was made in this study for the identification of this group of microorganisms. GLC conditions were established with the aid of reference strains. These conditions were then applied to ten strains which were previously identified by biochemical tests. Strains were grown in PYG broth and fermentation end products were analyzed, volatile and non volatile fatty acids. Their qualitative determination was made by comparing the retention time of known standards and the chromatographic pattern of reference strains. In addition, a semiquantitative analysis was made. The results of identification by biochemical tests were: five strains belonged to Actinomyces genus; three were Propionibacterium acnes; one Propionibacterium granulosum and one P. propionicum. By the GLC only seven strains were identified: four were Actinomyces and three P. acnes. Only six strains showed identification correlation by both biochemical tests and GLC. GLC is a presumptive identification method that can be used along with other complementary tests for a definitive identification at genus level.
TI  - Association between the presence of bacterial 16S RNA in prostate specimens taken during transurethral resection of prostate and subsequent risk of prostate cancer (Sweden).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study bacterial 16S RNA in archival prostate samples from 352 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and evaluate whether the presence of bacterial DNA was different in those who later developed prostate cancer (n = 171) and in the matched controls that did not progress to cancer (n = 181). METHODS: 16S DNA PCR followed by cloning and sequencing the positive samples. RESULTS: In 96/352 (27%) of the prostate tissue specimens 16S RNA were detected. Sequence analysis revealed Propionibacterium acnes as the predominant microorganism (23% of 16S RNA positive patients). The second most frequent isolate-Escherichia coli was found in 12 (12%) patients. The other isolates included Pseudomonas sp. (3 patients), Actinomyces sp. (2), Streptococcus mutans (1), Corynebacterium sp. (2), Nocardioides sp. (1), Rhodococcus sp. (1) Veillonella sp. (2). In P. acnes positive samples 62% exhibited severe histological inflammation versus 50% in the bacteria-negative group (p = 0.602). The presence of P. acnes in the prostate was associated with prostate cancer development (OR 2.17, 95% CI 0.77-6.95). CONCLUSIONS: This study has revealed P. acnes as the most common bacteria in the prostate in BPH. Further studies are needed to clarify its role in contributing to the development of prostatic inflammation and prostate cancer.

TI  - In vivo evaluation of the effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on salivary bacteria using the checkerboard method.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on different species of the oral microbiota. METHODOLOGY: Saliva samples were collected from 20 subjects with good oral health, diluted and plated onto blood agar medium. The subjects were asked to place the strip (Listerine PocketPaks) on the tongue allowing it to dissolve. After 30 minutes, new saliva samples were collected again and the plates with the samples were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees C for seven days. Colony counts (CFU/mL) were determined for each sample. The colonies on the plates were washed with 1 mL of TE buffer, and the bacterial suspensions were processed for the identification of 24 species by DNA probes and the Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. Differences in total counts, prevalence, and levels of the species evaluated before and after placement of the strips were determined by Wilcoxon sign rank and Chi-square tests. RESULTS: A modest increase in the total bacterial number in saliva from 1.4 x 10(8) to 1.7 x 10(8) bacterial cells was observed 30 minutes after the strip placement, although this change was not significant (p = 0.632). Most of the species reduced in frequency and/or levels, including the pathogens A. actinomycetemcomitans, C. rectus, E. corrodens, Fusobacterium spp., P. intermedia, and S. noxia, as well as the beneficial species A. meyeri, A. georgia, A. gerencseriae, A. odontolyticus, and P. acnes after strip placement. In contrast, A. viscosus, P. melaninogenica, P. gingivalis, P. micros, Streptococcus spp., T. forsythensis, and V. parvula presented an increase in prevalence and/or levels. These changes were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (p > 0.0022). CONCLUSION: The use of the essential oil-containing oral strips resulted in a short-term small increase in the total number of salivary microorganisms. In addition, a not significant decrease of certain periodontopathogens, and an increase in species compatible with oral health were observed.
TI  - Multiple bacteria in aortic aneurysms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to reexamine the possibility that bacteria, particularly anaerobes, are present in aortic aneurysms. METHODS: From December 2000 to November 2001, 53 samples from aneurysm walls were collected from 49 patients during reconstructive surgery. The tissue specimens were sectioned and cultured under anaerobic conditions. Twenty-eight specimens were also subjected to scanning or transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: Anaerobic cultivation yielded bacteria in 14 of the 53 samples (26.4%). All bacteria were gram-positive cocci or rods from nine genera and 12 species. Five cultures (35%) were mixed, containing two bacterial species. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic species were found in four samples (28.5%). Anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 10 of 14 positive cultures (71%). Among anaerobes found were Propionibacterium acnes, Propionibacterium granulosum, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Eggerthella lenta. Coaggregating bacteria of different sizes and structure were found on the aneurysm walls and inside the intravascular plaque at electron microscopy. Bacteria were found in 20 of the 28 samples (71%) examined with scanning or transmission electron microscopy. CONCLUSION: Multiple bacteria, many of which did not belong to the indigenous skin microflora, colonize aortic aneurysms. It is not clear whether the bacteria contribute to weakening of the aortic wall by eliciting inflammation or whether they are secondary colonizers of aneurysms.
TI  - Meningitis and shunt infection caused by anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology and management of meningitis and shunt infections caused by anaerobic bacteria in children. The predominant anaerobes recovered in meningitis are Bacteriodes spp., Bacteriodes fragilis, Fusobacterium spp., and Clostridium spp. Peptostreptococcus, Veillonella, Actinomyces, Propionibacterium acnes, and Eubacterium are less commonly isolated. The predisposing conditions for meningitis are acute or chronic middle-ear infection, sinusitis, pharyngitis, and pulmonary infections. In newborn and preterm infants the predisposing conditions are rupture of membranes, amnionitis, fetal distress, necrotizing enterocolitis, gastric perforation and subsequent ileus followed by bacteremia, aspiration pneumonitis and septicemia, infected ventriculoperitoneal or ventriculoatrial shunt, and complicating dermal sinus tract infections. Shunt infection with Propionibacterium spp. has been reported in children, especially in association with ventriculoauricular and ventriculoperitoneal shunts. Clostridium perfringens has been recovered from infants with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Multiple-organism meningitis was reported as a complication of ventriculoperitoneal and lumboperitoneal shunts that perforated the gastrointestinal tract. Early recognition and effective therapy are essential to recovery. Management of meningitis includes the use of antimicrobials effective against anaerobes that penetrate the blood-brain barrier. These include metronidazole, chloramphenicol, the combination of a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor, and carbapenems. The treatment of shunt infection includes antimicrobial therapy and removal of the shunt.
TI  - Effects of instrumentation, irrigation and dressing with calcium hydroxide on infection in pulpless teeth with periapical bone lesions.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the fate of microorganisms in root canals of teeth with infected pulps and periapical bone lesions with and without the use of calcium hydroxide medication. METHODOLOGY: Endodontic samples were cultured and microorganisms were counted and identified in 43 teeth before (sample 1) and after (sample 2) treatment during the first visit and before (sample 3) and after (sample 4) treatment during the second visit. In the first visit teeth were instrumented and half of the teeth were filled with a thick slurry of calcium hydroxide in sterile saline. The other teeth were obturated with gutta-percha and AH-2 6 sealer. After 4 weeks the teeth with calcium-hydroxide were accessed again and after microbiological sampling they were obturated with gutta-percha and AH-26 sealer. RESULTS: The mean total colony forming unit (CFU) counts of positive samples dropped significantly as a result of canal preparation during the first visit from 1.0 x 10(6) to 1.8 x 10(3) (between samples 1 and 2) but increased to 9.3 x 10(3) in the period between the two visits (sample 2 and 3). There was no difference in mean total CFU counts of positive samples between the end of the first (sample 2) and the end of the second visit (sample 4). The most frequently isolated species were Prevotella intermedia, Capnocytophaga spp.. Actinomyces odontolyticus. Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus micros. CONCLUSIONS: Although a calcium hydroxide paste was placed in the prepared canals, the number of positive canals had increased in the period between visits. However, the number of microorganisms had only increased to 0.93% of the original number of CFU (sample 1). It is concluded that a calcium hydroxide and sterile saline slurry limits but does not totally prevent regrowth of endodontic bacteria.
TI  - Assessment of periradicular microbiota by DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - In the present study the "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. Thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. In Group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in Group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. The gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. Bacterial DNA was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. The mean number (+/- SD) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in Group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in Group 2 (P < 0.001). The majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from Group 1 than from Group 2. The differences were most notable for Campylobacter gracilis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Propionibacterium acnes, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, Streptococcus constellatus and Actinomyces naeslundii I. Bacterial species such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. Also, P. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. The data supported the idea that following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. The study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. The detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.
TI  - Red light kills bacteria via photodynamic action.
AB  - With the increase in the number of antibiotic resistant strains of microorganism, the search for alternative treatments of microbial infections becomes all the more important. We report a novel method for bacterial inactivation based on the optical excitation of the naturally occurring (endogenous) photosensitzing porphyrins by red light. In particular, the pathogenic Gram-positive porphyrin producing ATCC strains Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces odontolyticus and Porphyromonas gingivalis were investigated. Sensitive autofluorescence spectroscopy revealed that these bacteria naturally synthezise the fluorescent photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX. In addition, bacterial plaque samples of periodontitis patients were studied. Non-labeled fluorescent bacterial colonies were exposed to red light at 632.8 nm, 100 mW/cm2 light intensity and 360 J/cm2 energy density using a helium-neon laser. The survival rate after a single phototreatment with red light was found to be 0.58 +/- 0.09 in the case of Propionibacterium acnes, 0.30 +/- 0.04 in Actinomyces odontolyticus and 0.59 +/- 0.10 in Porphyrormonas gingivalis compared to non-exposed bacteria suspensions. No photoeffect was found for the bacterium Streptococcus mutans which exhibited no detectable porphyrin autofluorescence. Red-light exposed plaque samples of patients showed significant reduction of colony forming units by 50% as well as a pronounced photoeffect on the pigmented species Prevotella intermedia. Taken together, these results suggest the treatment with red light can be potentially employed as an therapeutic method to inactivate certain pathogenic strains of porphyrin producing bacteria without the use of external photosensitizers.
TI  - beta-Hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms in apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis.
AB  - Thirteen teeth with necrotic pulps and apical periodontitis and nine severe periodontal pockets were cultured for presence of beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms. Samples were dispersed and plated on two non-selective and one selective growth media and incubated anaerobically and in 10% CO2 in air. A total of 59 beta-hemolytic colonies were purified and identified. Eight beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates were obtained from three of the severe marginal periodontitis sites. All were identified as belonging to the Streptococcus sanguis group. No beta-hemolytic streptococci were detected in apical periodontitis samples. Twenty obligately anaerobic isolates were detected, all of which were known periodontal and endodontic pathogens. Isolates from apical periodontitis sites were identified as Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actionomyces odontolyticus and Peptostreptococcus micros, while severe marginal periodontal sites contained the same species with the addition of Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces meyeri. Of 19 staphylococci and micrococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant isolate in both apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis sites. However, less commonly known organisms such as Staphylococcus cohnii and Micrococcus sp. were identified in severe marginal periodontitis sites. The isolation of Bacillus sp. (12 isolates) in one severe marginal periodontitis and two apical periodontitis subjects was especially interesting, warranting consideration of this organism as a legitimate isolate and potential pathogen in oral disease.
TI  - Bacterial eradication from root dentine by ultrasonic irrigation with sodium hypochlorite.
AB  - The study aimed to evaluate intracanal irrigation procedures in eradicating bacteria from surface, shallow and deep layers of root dentine using extracted human teeth. Artificial bacterial smear layer was successfully produced by rubbing a mixture of dental plaque and artificially decalcified dentine or carious dentine on root canal walls. The reservoir holes were 3.5 mm in depth, 1 mm in diameter prepared 1.5 mm apart and parallel to the root canals on the decrowned planes, in which five separate bacterial species were placed (Actinomyces israelii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Propionibacterium acnes, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis). Bacterial eradication after irrigation of the prepared canals was determined by bacterial recovery (i) from the root canal surfaces and shallow layers where bacteria were smeared artificially and (ii) from deeper layers of root canal dentine reservoir holes. Ultrasonic irrigation with 5.5% and 12% NaOCl eradicated bacteria from artificial smear layer (P < 0.0001), whilst 12% NaOCl irrigation with a syringe was insufficient. Ultrasonic irrigation with water or 15% EDTA-failed to eradicate bacteria from smeared surfaces. Ultrasonic irrigation with 12% NaOCl killed A. israelii, F. nucleatum, P. acnes, S. mutans, and S. sanguis placed in reservoir channels, although for F. nucleatum, a very small number of bacteria remained in five samples out of 12. Ultrasonic irrigation with less concentrated NaOCl failed to eliminate bacteria completely from reservoir channels in most samples. Ultrasonic irrigation with 12% NaOCl appeared to eliminate bacteria efficiently from surface, shallow and deep layers of root dentine.
TI  - Ribotyping of bacteria from root canal and blood of patients receiving endodontic therapy.
AB  - DNA restriction patterns and corresponding ribotypes of 26 bacterial isolates (Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus intermedius, and Streptococcus sanguis) recovered from patients with infected root canals and their peripheral blood, collected during and after endodontic therapy, were examined. Eleven additional reference strains including type strains were also examined. Purified DNA was digested with BglI,EcoRI, and HindIII. Hybridization was carried out with a digoxigenin-labeled cDNA probe obtained by reverse transcription of Escherichia coli 16S + 23S rRNA. Ribotypes of the bacteria recovered from root canal and blood showed identical characteristics within the patients, and differed between the patients. The results were confirmed when the similarity coefficient (S(AB)) of the ribotypes from the isolates were assessed by the Dendron computer-assisted system. These results suggested that the bacteria isolated from the blood originated from the root canal.
TI  - Electrophoresis of whole-cell soluble proteins of microorganisms isolated from bacteremias in endodontic therapy.
AB  - We have previously demonstrated that anaerobic bacteria are the microorganisms most frequently isolated from blood following endodontic therapy of teeth with apical periodontitis. Phenotypic characterisation of the isolates suggested that the bacteria in the blood originated from the root canal. The present experiment using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out in an effort to verify these findings, and to further study the microorganisms involved in endodontic bacteremias. Soluble cellular proteins were extracted from 11 reference strains and 26 bacterial isolates recovered from the root canal and blood. These included Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia. Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus sanguis. The electrophoretic patterns mostly confirmed the identity of the isolates as determined by the biochemical and antimicrobial resistance tests. Furthermore, with this typing method the species Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens could be differentiated. These species had been recovered from both root canal and blood. Also, differences between subspecies of Fusobacterium nucleatum became evident with SDS-PAGE, and the results indicated that the organism recovered from the root canal and blood was Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincentii. The electrophoretic patterns of the different organisms isolated from the root canal and the blood were similar, providing further evidence that the bacteria found in the blood originated from the root canal.
TI  - Salivacin 140, a novel bacteriocin from Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius T140 active against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Fifteen of 353 environmental isolates of lactic acid bacteria consistently showed activity against Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, and/or Propionibacterium acnes. Strain T140, isolated from the surface of Japanese pampas grass leaves and identified as Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius, also had activity against several Lactobacillus species, Staphylococcus aureus and Yersinia enterocolitica. Since the antagonistic factor(s) produced by T140 was sensitive to a proteolytic enzyme, it was concluded that a bacteriocin (named salivacin 140) was involved in the inhibition activity. Strain T140 required a high initial pH (7.5-8.5) in agar plates for bacteriocin production.
TI  - Distribution of thiols in microorganisms: mycothiol is a major thiol in most actinomycetes.
AB  - Mycothiol [2-(N-acetylcysteinyl)amido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl- (1-->1)-myo-inositol] (MSH) has recently been identified as a major thiol in a number of actinomycetes (S. Sakuda, Z.-Y. Zhou, and Y. Yamada, Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 58:1347-1348, 1994; H. S. C. Spies and D. J. Steenkamp, Eur. J. Biochem. 224:203-213, 1994; and G. L. Newton, C. A. Bewley, T. J. Dwyer, R. Horn, Y. Aharonowitz, G. Cohen, J. Davies, D. J. Faulkner, and R. C. Fahey, Eur. J. Biochem. 230:821-825, 1995). Since this novel thiol is more resistant than glutathione to heavy-metal ion-catalyzed oxidation, it seems likely to be the antioxidant thiol used by aerobic gram-positive bacteria that do not produce glutathione (GSH). In the present study we sought to define the spectrum of organisms that produce MSH. GSH was absent in all actinomycetes and some of the other gram-positive bacteria studied. Surprisingly, the streptococci and enterococci contained GSH, and some strains appeared to synthesize it rather than import it from the growth medium. MSH was found at significant levels in most actinomycetes examined. Among the actinobacteria four Micrococcus species produced MSH, but MSH was not found in representatives of the Arthrobacter, Agromyces, or Actinomyces genera. Of the nocardioforms examined, Nocardia, Rhodococcus, and Mycobacteria spp. all produced MSH. In addition to the established production of MSH by streptomycetes, we found that Micromonospora, Actinomadura, and Nocardiopsis spp. also synthesized MSH. Mycothiol production was not detected in Propionibacterium acnes or in representative species of the Listeria, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Bacillus, and Clostridium genera. Examination of representatives of the cyanobacteria, purple bacteria, and spirochetes also gave negative results, as did tests of rat liver, bonito, Candida albicans, Neurospora crassa, and spinach leaves. The results, which indicate that MSH production is restricted to the actinomycetes, could have significant implications for the detection and treatment of infections with actinomycetes, especially those caused by mycobacteria.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of coaggregation-defective (Cog-) mutants of Streptococcus gordonii DL1 (Challis).
AB  - Streptococcus gordonii DL1 (Challis) bears coaggregation-mediating surface adhesins which recognize galactoside-containing surface polysaccharides on Streptococcus oralis 34, Streptococcus oralis C104, and Streptococcus SM PK509. Fifty-nine spontaneously-occurring coaggregation-defective (Cog-) mutants of S. gordonii DL1 unable to coaggregate with partner streptococci were isolated. Six representative Cog- mutants were characterized by their coaggregation properties with four Actinomyces naeslundii strains (T14V, PK947, PK606, PK984), Veillonella atypica PK1910, and Propionibacterium acnes PK93. The six representative Cog- mutants showed altered coaggregation with their streptococcal partners, A. naeslundii PK947, and P. acnes PK93. Based on the coaggregation phenotypes of these mutants, a model for the lactose-inhibitable coaggregation between S. gordonii DL1 and its partner bacteria is proposed. The potential use of these mutants in studies of oral biofilms is discussed.
TI  - Bacteremia in conjunction with endodontic therapy.
AB  - This study characterizes oral microorganisms believed to have spread from the root canal into the blood stream during and after endodontic therapy of teeth with Asymptomatic apical periodontitis. Microbiological samples were taken under aseptic conditions from the root canal of 26 single-rooted teeth in 26 patients. In the endodontic treatment of 13 of the patients (Group 1), the first 3 reamers, sizes 15, 20 and 25, were used to a level 2 mm beyond the apical foramen. In the other 13 patients (Group 2), the instrumentation ended inside the root canal 1 mm short of the apical foramen. Blood samples were taken from the patients during the instrumentation and 10 min after the treatment was completed. Anaerobic microorganisms were isolated from all root canals. In 7 patients of Group 1, Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were recovered from the blood. In 4 patients of Group 2, P. intermedia, Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus intermedius and Streptococcus sanguis were isolated from the blood. Biochemical tests and antibiograms revealed that the isolates from the root canal and blood had identical profiles within the patients, strongly suggesting that the microorganisms isolated from the blood had the root canal as their source.
TI  - [Comparative in vitro activity of ampicillin, cefoperazone and their combinations with sulbactam, as well as that of other antibiotics against anaerobic organisms].
AB  - Susceptibility of 180 strains of anaerobic organisms to ampicillin, cefoperazone  and their combinations with sulbactam, as well as that to cefoxitin, imipenem and metronidazole was studied with the method of serial microdilutions. 100 per cent of the strains was susceptible to the ampicillin + cefoperazone combination. Only 1 strain of Bacteroides fragilis was resistant to imipenem. 73.4 and 57.8 per cent of the B. fragilis strains were susceptible to cefoxitin and cefoperazone respectively. No resistance to metronidazole was detected. 100 per cent of the strains belonging to Bacteroides spp. fragilis (gr.) and Prevotella spp. was resistant to all the antibiotics except ampicillin. Gram-positive anaerobic cocci were susceptible to all the antibiotics. The strains of Actinomyces spp. and Propionibacterium acnes were resistant to metronidazole. Only 48.7 per cent the Actinomyces strains was susceptible to cefoxitin.
TI  - Anaerobic flora of the conjunctival sac in patients with AIDS and with anophthalmia compared with normal eyes.
AB  - Relatively few investigations of anaerobic bacteria as ocular flora have been conducted, and their results have been contradictory. The conjunctival sacs of 22 normal subjects and of 14 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and 22 anophthalmic sockets were cultured for anaerobic bacteria Thirty-four (77.3%) of the 44 eyes of normal subjects harbored anaerobic bacteria; Propionibacterium acnes was present in 28 eyes (63.6%), Lactobacillus species in 6 eyes (13.6%), and Veillonella species in 7 eyes (15.9%). The finding were very similar for anophthalmic sockets (p = 0.01), with 17 (77.3%) of the 22 sockets harboring anaerobes; Propionibacterium acnes was the organism identified in 16 (72.7%) of these sockets; Veillonella was identified in 4 (18.1%), Peptococcus niger in 3 (13.6%) and P. granulosum in 2 (9.0%) of these sockets. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients had the highest incidence of anaerobic organisms, with positive cultures obtained from 24 (85.7%) of the 28 eyes. Propionibacterium species were isolated from 16 (57.1%) of these eyes. Clostridium species from 10 (35.7%) eyes and Actinomyces species from 8 (28.6%) eyes. It thus appears that anaerobic organisms are common flora in normal conjunctival sacs and in anophthalmic sockets, as well as in the sacs of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients, but the latter group had a higher incidence (x2 = 0.87) and a spectrum of organisms that was different from that of the other two groups.
TI  - A quantitative comparison of selected bacteria in human carious dentine by microscopic counts.
AB  - The levels of selected cariogenic and obligately anaerobic bacteria have been compared in carious dentine taken from fissures, smooth surfaces, and root surfaces. The numbers of infected dentinal tubules were determined by immunohistological staining using species-specific antisera against selected bacteria. Selective localization was observed; mutans streptococci were the predominant bacteria in dentine from fissures and smooth surface coronal caries, but not from root surface caries. The proportion of mutans streptococci was higher in the shallow and middle layers of dentine from fissures and smooth surface coronal carious lesions than from the deep layers. In root surface caries, Actinomyces spp. were the predominant bacteria, and were present at higher levels in the deep layer of root lesions than in the shallow and middle layers. The proportion of Lactobacillus spp. was relatively low despite its high detection frequency in all layers of the three types of carious lesion. Immunohistological staining with species-specific antisera was able to reveal the distribution and the localization of various bacteria in carious dentine.
TI  - Isolation and properties of the Capnocytophaga ochracea bacteriocin.
AB  - A bacteriocin from a subgingival plaque isolate of Capnocytophaga ochracea was purified and characterized. It was isolated from cell extract and had a molecular weight of 100,000. Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans and Propionibacterium acnes were susceptible to the bacteriocin.
TI  - Enumeration of subgingival species on primary isolation plates using colony lifts.
AB  - This study evaluated the feasibility of using a colony lift method and DNA probes to enumerate bacterial species cultured on primary isolation plates. Fourteen digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal DNA probes representing 12 subgingival species were validated by hybridization with colony lifts prepared from 249 reference strains of 51 species grown on Trypticase soy agar plates supplemented with 5% sheep blood. Colonies of reference strains were lifted onto Nytran filters from plates and treated to lyse cells, remove cellular proteins, denature and fix microbial DNA to the filters. Positive reactions were detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and revealed by bromo-chloro-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. Cross-reactions were not observed for 13/14 probes, but 2 strains of Streptococcus mitis reacted with the probe to Streptococcus sanguis II. Subgingival plaque samples were taken by means of a sterile curette from mesiobuccal surfaces of teeth present in each of 26 subjects with differing periodontal disease states. Samples were dispersed, diluted, plated and incubated anaerobically for 7 d at 35 degrees C. Colonies were lifted as described above. Filters were cut into sections and hybridized with the 14 digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes. The probes were used to enumerate the test species and the total number of isolates was determined in 711 plaque samples. The colony lift method and DNA probes provided a sensitive, economical and quantitative method for enumerating cultivable microbial species in subgingival plaque samples. In addition, the amplification provided by growing the organisms on agar plates facilitated determination of numbers of organisms in small plaque samples, such as those from healthy sites.
TI  - Microbiology of chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  - To better understand the factors involved in chronic sinusitis in childhood, we cultured the sinuses, middle meatus, and nasopharynx in 39 children requiring surgical intervention. Sixty-nine percent of these patients had other medical problems, including asthma (49%) and immunologic compromise (18%). We cultured coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 18 patients, Streptococcus viridans in 14 patients, normal flora in 10 patients, Staphylococcus aureus in nine patients, group D streptococcus in five patients, Corynebacterium in five patients, Haemophilus influenzae in three patients, Neisseria in three patients, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces, and an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus in one patient each. Cultures yielded no growth in nine patients. A strong association between cultures of the middle meatus obtained ipsilaterally and cultures of the maxillary (83%) and ethmoid sinuses (80%) occurred. A poor correlation was found between cultures of the nasopharynx and maxillary (45%) and ethmoid sinuses (49%). All seven patients who had both maxillary and ethmoid sinus cultures showed the same organisms in both sinuses. Only 41% of organisms were found on both sides when procedures were performed bilaterally. Cultures of the middle meatus appear to be sensitive and specific for organisms within sinuses. The presence of predominantly nonvirulent organisms in low titers suggests that additional factors other than bacterial overgrowth contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis in children.
TI  - Chronic postoperative endophthalmitis associated with Actinomyces species.
AB  - Actinomyces species, gram-positive, non-spore-forming anaerobic bacilli were isolated from intraocular fluid obtained from four otherwise healthy patients with a delayed onset of postoperative endophthalmitis. One patient had a mixed anaerobic infection with recovery of both Actinomyces israelii and Propionibacterium acnes. In all four patients, early postoperative visual acuity was good but was eventually markedly reduced by intraocular inflammation that was first observed between 21 days and 4 months following uneventful extracapsular cataract extraction and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation. Inflammation was characterized by anterior segment and vitreous cellular debris in all cases. All eyes responded to therapy that included intraocular, topical, and systemic antibiotics as well as pars plana vitrectomy and partial iridectomy. These cases further illustrate the need for microbiologic investigation, including anaerobic cultures, in all cases of chronic postoperative inflammation following extracapsular cataract extraction, regardless of the time of onset.
TI  - Susceptibility of oral bacteria to phenoxyethanol and phenoxyethanol/chlorhexidine combinations.
AB  - A total of 57 bacterial strains (26 different species) which may be isolated from subgingival plaque were tested for their in vitro susceptibility to phenoxycthanol, a commonly-used antiseptic and preservative. Ninety-five percent of the strains, including those associated with chronic inflammatory periodontal disease, were susceptible to concentrations of phenoxyethanol used topically (2% w/v). Phenoxyethanol at a concentration of 1% (w/v) was also found that to have a rapid bactericidal effect achieving a 99.9% kill in 5 minutes or less for species such as Bacterodides gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, and Wolinella recta. Addition of chlorhexidine to phenoxyethanol resulted in a mixture with increased antibacterial activity. For most bacterial strains, the presence of chlorhexidine resulted in at least a four-fold decrease in the concentration of pheoxyethanol required for inhibition of growth. These results imply that phenoxyethanol may be useful in the treatment of chronic inflammatory periodontal disease either by itself or in combination with chlorhexidine.
TI  - [Lysis of the cells of Propionibacterium acnes by the culture supernatant of Actinomyces viscosus].
AB  - Ecologically there seemed to be antagonistic relations between Actinomyces viscosus and Propionibacterium acnes. The Supernatant of A. viscosus was shown to possess a lytic activity on the growing cells of P. acnes. The results obtained were as follows: 1. Only a small number of P. acnes was isolated in samples from which numerous A. viscosus were isolated. On the other hand, P. acnes were frequently isolated in samples from which few cells of A. viscosus were isolated. 2. The concentrate with ammonium sulfate of the anaerobic culture supernatant of A. viscosus was used as a lytic factor. When P. acnes was grown in broth with the lytic factor, for a short time optical density of the culture increased and then decreased. Release of 3H-thymidine was observed from the radio-labeled cells of P. acnes, suggesting the release of DNA due to the disruption of the cells. 3. Gram positive staining during early stage of cell lysis began to turn to Gram negative and disrupted cells were observed at later stages. Using an electronic microscope it was observed that cell poles were broken with cytoplasm flowing out. 4. The lytic factor lysed the growing cells, but did not lyse either the resting cells or the dead cells. 5. Radio-labeled high molecular substances were released into the supernatant from the growing cells of P. acnes which were radio-labeled by 3H-glycerol or 14C-alanine. This suggested the release of lipoteichoic acid or peptidoglycan. 6. The lytic factor did not release radio-labeled substances from the isolated peptidoglycan which was radio-labeled by both 3H-glucosamine and 14C-alanine. 7. Lysis of P. acnes by the lytic factor was inhibited by adding chloramphenicol which was assumed to inhibit the release of lipoteichoic acid. 8. From the results mentioned above, the lytic factor seemed to cause the cellular lysis of P. acnes by the release of lipoteichoic acid followed by activation of the autolytic enzyme. This mode of action is similar to that of penicillin, but the molecule of the lytic factor seemed to have the nature of protein.
TI  - The microbiology of periapical granulomas.
AB  - Of the 16 periapical granulomas studied, 14 (88%) yielded a positive growth when  homogenized and cultured. The concentration of colony-forming units per milliliter of the suspension ranged from 10(1.3) to 10(4.0) (mean 10(2.2)). A total of 47 isolates comprising 26 (55%) facultative anaerobes and 21 (45%) strict anaerobes were obtained. The organisms most commonly cultured were Veillonella species (15%), Streptococcus milleri (11%), Streptococcus sanguis (11%), Actinomyces naeslundii (11%), Propionibacterium acnes (11%), and Bacteroides species (10%). Most of the organisms (96%) were sensitive to either amoxicillin, clindamycin, or tetracycline, whereas only 45% were sensitive to metronidazole.
TI  - Mechanism of gram variability in select bacteria.
AB  - Gram stains were performed on strains of Actinomyces bovis, Actinomyces viscosus, Arthrobacter globiformis, Bacillus brevis, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Clostridium tetani, Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum, Corynebacterium parvum, Mycobacterium phlei, and Propionibacterium acnes, using a modified Gram regimen that allowed the staining process to be observed by electron microscopy (J. A. Davies, G. K. Anderson, T. J. Beveridge, and H. C. Clark, J. Bacteriol. 156:837-845, 1983). Furthermore, since a platinum salt replaced the iodine mordant of the Gram stain, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy could evaluate the stain intensity and location by monitoring the platinum signal. These gram-variable bacteria could be split into two groups on the basis of their staining responses. In the Actinomyces-Arthrobacter-Corynebacterium-Mycobacterium-Propionibacterium group, few cells became gram negative until the exponential growth phase; by mid-exponential phase, 10 to 30% of the cells were gram negative. The cells that became gram negative were a select population of the culture, had initiated septum formation, and were more fragile to the stress of the Gram stain at the division site. As cultures aged to stationary phase, there was a relatively slight increase toward gram negativity (now 15 to 40%) due to the increased lysis of nondividing cells by means of lesions in the side walls; these cells maintained their rod shape but stained gram negative. Those in the Bacillus-Butyrivibrio-Clostridium group also became gram negative as cultures aged but by a separate set of events. These bacteria possessed more complex walls, since they were covered by an S layer. They stained gram positive during lag and the initial exponential growth phases, but as doubling times increased, the wall fabric underlying the S layer became noticeably thinner and diffuse, and the cells became more fragile to the Gram stain. By stationary phase, these cultures were virtually gram negative.
TI  - Ischaemic mouse thigh model for evaluation of pathogenicity of non-clostridial anaerobes.
AB  - A mouse thigh model has been devised in which the growing culture of non-clostridial anaerobe in the ischaemic tissue produces inflammatory swelling and death. The swelling of the right thigh served as an index of pathogenicity of the test strain in comparison to the negatively reacting left thigh which received injection of the control strain of Bifidobacterium infantis. Actinomyces naeslundii exceptionally caused death in all animals within 24 h. Mortality and thigh swelling were pronounced (greater than 75%) in case of Fusobacterium gonidiaformans and Propionibacterium acnes but less (less than 50%) in Acidaminococcus fermentans. High (less than 75%) rate of thigh swelling was also encountered in case of Bacteroides oralis, Bacteroides corrodens, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Fusobacterium plauti, Peptococcus prevotii, Streptococcus intermedius, Eubacterium lentum and Propionibacterium freudenreichii ss. shermanii.
TI  - Susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The antimicrobial susceptibility of 1,117 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined by the agar dilution technique. Metronidazole was the most active agent; only Propionibacterium acnes and Actinomyces sp. isolates were resistant. Clindamycin and chloramphenical were the next most effective agents. Beta-lactam antibiotics, with the exception of penicillin, were active against most anaerobes other than the Bacteroides fragilis group. At a breakpoint of 8 mg/l, 25% of Fusobacterium spp. and 30% of the non-fragilis Bacteroides spp. were resistant to penicillin. The highest resistance to beta-lactams was seen in the B. fragilis group. Within the indole-positive members of the group, resistance rates of 71% were seen for cefoxitin, 49% for moxalactam, 79% for cefotaxime, 22% for piperacillin and 89% for penicillin. We conclude that metronidazole has the most predictable in vitro activity against common clinical anaerobic isolates and that resistance to beta-lactams was frequent and of potential clinical importance as these latter agents are frequently used in the prophylaxis and therapy of mixed anaerobic infections.
TI  - Distribution of metronidazole susceptibility factors in obligate anaerobes.
AB  - The distribution of metronidazole susceptibility factors in clinically important  bacteria was studied to determine why obligate anaerobes were susceptible to metronidazole and facultative ones were not. With obligate and facultative anaerobes, nitroreductase activity, metronidazole uptake, pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity and drug susceptibility were estimated. Nitroreductase activity was distributed in the obligate anaerobes and some facultative ones such as Streptococcus faecalis. Propionibacterium acnes, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Actinomyces israelii and most of the facultative anaerobes had no such activity. Bacteria with nitroreductase activity were able to absorb the drug. Pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity was distributed in all of the obligate anaerobes, whereas Prop. acnes, Bif. adolescentis, A. israelii and all of the facultative anaerobes had no such activity. Distribution of metronidazole susceptibility was the same as that of pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity. Therefore metronidazole may selectively inhibit obligate anaerobes with pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity. Nitroreductase activity may be necessary for drug uptake as well.
TI  - Ability of oral bacteria to degrade fibronectin.
AB  - The fibronectin-degrading ability of 116, mainly oral, strains was assayed by using plasma-derived fibronectin adsorbed to a polystyrene surface. Ability to degrade fibronectin was revealed in strains of Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides loeschii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptococcus prevotii, Clostridium sporogenes, and Propionibacterium acnes. The fibronectinolytic activity of subgingival bacteriological samples was found to be related to the presence of B. gingivalis and B. intermedius. In addition, strains of the nonoral Bacteroides species B. asaccharolyticus and B. fragilis showed fibronectin-degrading ability. No such ability was detected in the oral strains tested of Streptococcus, Veillonella, Actinomyces, Lactobacillus, Actinobacillus, Capnocytophaga, Fusobacterium, or Haemophilus species.
TI  - [Microbial pathogenesis of Whipple's disease].
AB  - In a case of Whipple's disease with electron microscopic demonstration of rod-shaped bacteria we could isolate Propionibacterium acnes (former name: Corynebacterium anaerobium), Actinomyces, and Lactobacillus from duodenal biopsies by the aid of modern anaerobic culture technique. Simultaneously we found a dysbiosis (increase of anaerobic coca and anaerobes) in du odenal juice. After antibiotic treatment Propionibacterium and Lactobacillus disappeared and an other type of dysbiosis (appearance of Bacteroides) was to be seen. In discussion is a change of immunologic state and following disturbed regulation of microbial colonization in the small bowel of patients with Whipple's disease.
TI  - Normal cultivable microflora in upper jejunal fluid in children without gastrointestinal disorders.
AB  - Bacteriological studies of uncontaminated upper jejunal fluid were performed in 51 Danish children without gastrointestinal disorders. Thirty-seven percent of the samples were sterile [less than 10(1) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml]. In 25% of the cases, the total number of microorganisms exceeded 10(5) CFU/ml. The microorganisms isolated most frequently were: Streptococcus, sp. ("Viridans group"), Veillonella parvula, Hemophilus parainfluenzae, Lactobacillus, sp., Corynebacterium, sp., Actinomyces, sp., Bacteroides, sp., and Hemophilus influenzae, each found in more than 10% of the children. The upper range for the number of microorganisms isolated exceeded 10(5) CFU/ml for most of the species isolated of which the vast majority belonged to an "oral type" of flora. Enterococci were isolated in small numbers in three children, and Enterobacteriaceae were not found.

TI  - A longitudinal study of Actinomyces israelii in the female genital tract.
AB  - A prospective longitudinal investigation was performed to study variations in the occurrence of Actinomyces israelii with reference to four microorganisms, staphylococci, E. coli, P. acnes and C. albicans, in the female genital tract. Fifteen healthy women were studied during all phases of the menstrual cycle. Sampling was made from the cervix, vagina and perineal area three times a week during two consecutive menstrual periods and during menstruation from napkins and tampons. Altogether 1108 samples were taken on 349 sampling occasions for different cultural procedures. A. israelii was identified in all women, in varying frequencies (range 4 to 74% of sampling occasions). As a mean, A. israelii was recovered in 24% of the perineal samples, 13% of the vaginal and 6% of the cervical samples. The occurrence of A. israelii was related neither to the recovery of reference microorganisms nor to the phase of the menstrual cycle, the amount of bleeding or discharge, the pH of the vaginal specimens, the contraceptive method used, or to the use of different sanitary products. It is our conclusion that A. israelii appears to be a part of the indigenous genital flora of healthy women.
TI  - Production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from Staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  - Staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. These strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of Staphylococcus aureus FDA209P. The frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. Strain IYS2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. IYS2 was identified to be S. aureus, based on its biological properties. The bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. Its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. The isoelectric point was 10.0. In amino acid composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. The bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. The bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. An analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that Streptococcus salivarius, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium parvulum, and Actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacterionema matruchotii, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. The majority of S. aureus tested were susceptible, and all Staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.
TI  - Recovery of microorganisms from synovial and pleural fluids of animals using hyperosmolar media.
AB  - L-phase (CWD) broth and plate media were used in parallel with conventional microbiological media during a 3-year period for culturing synovial and pleural fluids of animals. Two kinds of recoveries were obtained where parallel conventional methods were negative: (1) parent or normal bacteria, in very low numbers; and (2) Type B CWD variants in equally low numbers. Organisms in group 1 were: Streptococcus zooepidemicus from horses (2x); beta-hemolytic streptococci, Lancefield Gp. G (2x); Staphylococcus aureus; Actinobacillus, and Actinomyces viscosus. Group 2 consisted of Bacteroides sp., Propionibacterium acnes, and three "Nocardia-like" sp. Catalase + Actinomyces was not recovered equally well on CWD plates as on conventional media with fluids obtained during ampicillin treatment. This occurred in spite of the fact that the CWD media was shown to support growth and reversion of laboratory induced L-phase variants of Nocardia caviae and N. asteroides, and had facilitated recovery of a Bacteroides L-phase variant from a pleural fluid. The nature of this fault in the media is under investigation in this laboratory.
TI  - [Antibiotic resistance of anaerobic bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  - Reference data on the overall resistance patterns of anaerobic bacteria are needed since in individual clinical cases susceptibility testing is complicated by the long generation time and difficulties of test conditions. Benzylpenicillin and tetracyclines are the drugs of choice against Clostridium perfringens. Newer cephalosporins are also active, whereas other Clostridium species have been found resistant. Beta-lactam antibiotics show high activity against Peptococcaceae; resistance to clindamycin should be noted, however. The good in vitro activity of tetracyclines, clindamycin and erythromycin against Propionibacterium acnes could be confirmed in the systemic and local therapy of acne vulgaris. In contrast to gram-positive anaerobic bacteria, only some penicillin and cephalosporin derivatives are sufficiently active against gram-negative rods of the Bacteroides group. Sporadic resistance is seen to the newer tetrayclines, nitroimidazole compounds and to lincomycins. Nevertheless, these substances must be considered as standard therapeutics for infections caused by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. It should be mentioned that cefoxitin may offer new therapeutic possibilities.
TI  - Kinetic parameters of lactate dehydrogenases of some rumen bacterial species, the anaerobic ciliate Isotricha prostoma and mixed rumen microorganisms.
AB  - A number of kinetic parameters of the lactate dehydrogenases of three rumen bacterial species (Peptostreptococcus productus, Propionibacterium acnes and Actinomyces viscosus), the rumen ciliate Isotricha prostoma and mixed rumen microorganisms (MRM) with respect to NADH, pyruvate, fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FDP) as well as the effects of several nucleotide phosphates were studied. Partially purified LDH of Peptostr. productus had the same kinetic parameters as in crude cell free extracts. Values for Km, determined by Michaelis-Menten kinetics with pyruvate as the substrate, were in the same range for all lactate dehydrogenases. After feeding a cow, changes in the apparent Km and Vmax values for NADH of the total LDH activity in MRM were followed. It is suggested that of the factors studied the ratio NADH/NAD(H) and ATP are the most important regulatory factors for the lactate dehydrogenases of mixed rumen microorganisms.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria in late infections following orthopedic surgery.
AB  - Twelve patients with late anaerobic infection following hip or knee arthroplasty  or tibia osteosynthesis are presented. Peptococci (Peptococcus asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. prevotii) and peptostreptococci (Peptostreptococcus micros, P. anaerobius, P. parvulus) were present in nine of the cases. Anaerobic gram-positive or -negative rods were found in three cases (Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces israelii, and Bacteroides fragilis). Antibodies against the isolated bacteria were detected in sera of nine patients. Anaerobic bacteria seem to be responsible for some of the late reactions that may follow arthroplasty or osteosynthesis.
TI  - Complement activation by the alternative pathway and macrophage enzyme secretion  in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation.
AB  - A number of stimuli known to induce acid hydrolase secretion from cultured macrophages were examined for their ability to activate C3 via the alternative pathway of the complement system. Loss of haemolytically active C3 was checked in normal and C4-deficient guinea-pig serum. For comparison the interactions of cultured macrophages with other agents well known as potent activators of the alternative pathway of the complement system have been investigated. As judged by their activity in these assays, group A streptococcal cell walls, different carrageenan preparations, dental plaque and Actinomyces viscosus were all capable of initiating the alternative pathway but differed with respect to their potency and their ability to inhibit C3 turnover at high concentrations. Zymosan, some carrageenans, polyanethol sulphonate, and Corynebacterium parvum all induce the release of hydrolytic enzymes from macrophages in culture, even in the absence of serum in the medium. The release is time- and dose-dependent and is not associated with loss of the cytoplasmic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase or any other sign of cell death. The parallelism between the capacity of several agents to activate the complement system via the alternative pathway and to induce inflammatory responses in vivo and selective lysosoma enzyme secretion from cultures of macrophages is discussed.

TI  - Importance of Actinomyces and certain gram-negative anaerobic organisms in the transformation of lymphocytes from patients with periodontal disease.
AB  - Dental plaque deposits are known to be potent stimulants of lymphocyte transformation in patients with periodontal disease but not in normal subjects. Since plaque deposits consist mainly of whole bacteria, the cell walls of the most commonly found organisms in plaque were tested for their capacity to induce lymphocyte transformation. There was a direct correlation between the severity of peridontal disease and the amount of transformation induced by the cell walls of oral bacteria and by solubilized dental plaque. Cord blood leukocytes and lymphocytes from clinically normal people did not respond, which indicates that these stimulants are antigens rather than mitogens. Of the eleven bacteria tested, four members of the family Actinomycetaceae (Actinomyces viscosus, A. israelii, A. naeslundii, and Arachnia propionica), the related Propionibacterium acnes, and an anaerobic gram-negative anaerobic rod (27N). The high prevalence of the former organisms in the mature dental plaque that forms around the gingival crevice area and the potent efficacy with which they stimulate lymphocytes indicates that Actinomyces and certain gram-negative anaerobes may be important etiological agents in chronic periodontal inflammation in man.
TI  - Serological studies of Actinomyces israelii by crossed immunoelectrophoresis: taxonomic and diagnostic applications.
AB  - Crossed immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) with intermediate gel was applied to the serological analysis of Actinomyces israelii to develop a test with high efficiency in the laboratory diagnosis of human actinomycosis and classification of A. israelii. Recently developed standard antigen-antibody systems for A. israelii by CIE were used as reference. The reference systems were based on standard preparations of cytoplasmic and whole cell-associated antigens of A. israelii and a standard immunoglobulin G pool purified from rabbit antisera to formalin-treated whole cells and cell lysates of A. israelii. The specificity of the standard antigens for A. israelii was evaluated in CIE studies by screening for antibodies to components of the antigens in rabbit antisera raised against related bacteria. The standard system for A. israelii based on cytoplasmic antigens formed species-specific precipitins whereas antisera raised against A. naeslundii and/or Propionibacterium acnes precipitated components of the other standard antigens. As a result of these analyses, the standard system for A. israelii based on 10 cytoplasmic antigens was used as reference for CIE studies to detect humoral antibodies to A. israelii in sera from nine patients with actinomycosis. All the sera from the patients formed at the time of diagnosis one or more precipitins in terms of the 10 reference precipitins. Up to five precipitins were found in single sera. Follow-up studies covering a period of one-half year after treatment showed a gradually decreased precipitin response in the course of time. In control sera from patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis, nocardiosis, deep Candida infection, and aspergillosis, and in sera from healthy blood donors, no antibodies were detected with specificity for the reference antigens.
TI  - Level of redox potential as a possible contributing influence in the pathogenicity of oral anaerobes.
AB  - Dental plaque anaerobes may be associated with the etiology of periodontal disease. This has created an interest in the potential pathogenicity of oral anaerobes. We compared the metabolic activity of anaerobic corynebacteria (C. parvum, C. anaerobium) and corresponding aerobic species (C. diphtheriae, C. xerosis). The anaerobes exhibited lower levels of RNA synthesis, ranging from 5 to 10 fold over the aerobes. We further examined these anaerobes, plus Actinomyces naeslundi N16 (isolated from the anaerobic region of periodontally-diseased tissues), for the influence of redox potential on RNA level and antigenic function. Notable increases in RNA were found at specific Eh levels; the extent and direction of the changes varied with the different organisms. This environmental feature appeared to effect corresponding changes in agglutinability and PCA reactivity with antisera against the anaerobes cultured at different redox potentials. For example, while antisera against certain organisms (C. parvum, A. naeslundi) cultured under the most reuced conditions showed an intense PCA reaction, other antisera against the same organism cultured under less reduced conditions were non-reactive. Hence, alterations in redox potential may lead to alteredetabolism and to altered antigencity. Our results imply such a microbial response to environmental stress.

TI  - Identification of Actinomyces, Arachnia, Bacterionema, Rothia, and Propionibacterium species by defined immunofluorescence.
AB  - Fractionated fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated immunoglobulin G (dye-to-protein ratio <10), produced against whole cells of Actinomyces spp., Arachnia, Bacterionena, Rothia, and Propionibacterium spp., give species-specific conjugates with controlled nonspecific staining reactions when appropriately diluted on the basis of their antibody content (10 mg/ml). Using this standardization in immunofluorescence, serotype-specific conjugates are also available after dilution for all serotypes of these organisms except for Actinomyces viscosus type 2, and Propionibacterium acnes type 1. Adequately adsorbed conjugates could be used to differentiate these serotypes from A. viscosus type 1 and P. acnes type 2, respectively. A serological classification in defined immunofluorescence corresponded to species and serotype designation proposed on the basis of other serological analysis and biochemical characteristics. This includes a separation in immunofluorescence of two serotypes of Propionibacterium acnes. The detection of certain actinomycetes of the family Actinomycetaceae and Propionibacterium species by the defined immunofluorescence in direct smears prepared from clinical specimens agreed to 88% with parallel culturing when including a prereduced (PRAS) medium technique for isolation. Qualitative studies revealed that single cells of these organisms could be specifically identified by immunofluorescence when admixed with morphologically similar bacteria and a large number of other contaminants.
TI  - SEROLOGICAL GROUPING OF ACTINOMYCES BY MEANS OF FLUORESCENT ANTIBODIES.
AB  - Slack, John M. (West Virginia University, Morgantown), Ann Winger, and Dane W. Moore, Jr. Serological grouping of actinomyces by means of fluorescent antibodies. J. Bacteriol. 82:54-65. 1961.-Serological groups A, B, C and D of actinomyces were established using fluorescent antibody techniques. One hundred and thirty-eight cultures were included in the study. Eighty-nine were classed in group A, 15 in B, 13 in C, and 21 in D. The isolates were from patients and animals with actinomycosis and from healthy human beings. There was no correlation between source of the isolate and serological group. Furthermore, no one species could be placed exclusively in one group although the majority of those designated as Actinomyces bovis were in group A. Seventeen anaerobic diphtheroids and seven Corynebacterium acnes isolates were placed in group A. One diphtheroid was in each of groups B and D. On this basis it is suggested that these organisms be included in the genus Actinomyces.Additional species of Corynebacterium as well as Lactobacillus Propionibacterium, Streptomyces, and Nocardia did not fluoresce with any of the group antisera.
