comparative genomics of lactobacillus crispatus suggests novel mechanisms for the competitive exclusion of gardnerella vaginalis.
background: lactobacillus crispatus is a ubiquitous micro-organism encountered in a wide range of host-associated habitats. it can be recovered from the gastrointestinal tract of animals and it is a common constituent of the vaginal microbiota of humans. moreover, l. crispatus can contribute to the urogenital health of the host through competitive exclusion and the production of antimicrobial agents. in order to investigate the genetic diversity of this important urogenital species, we performed a comparative genomic analysis of l. crispatus. results: utilizing the completed genome sequence of a strain st1 and the draft genome sequences of nine other l. crispatus isolates, we defined the scale and scope of the pan- and core genomic potential of l. crispatus. our comparative analysis identified 1,224 and 2,705 ortholog groups present in all or only some of the ten strains, respectively. based on mathematical modeling, sequencing of additional l. crispatus isolates would result in the identification of new genes and functions, whereas the conserved core of the ten strains was a good representation of the final l. crispatus core genome, estimated to level at about 1,116 ortholog groups. importantly, the current core was observed to encode bacterial components potentially promoting urogenital health. using antibody fragments specific for one of the conserved l. crispatus adhesins, we demonstrated that the l. crispatus core proteins have a potential to reduce the ability of gardnerella vaginalis to adhere to epithelial cells. these findings thereby suggest that l. crispatus core proteins could protect the vagina from g. vaginalis and bacterial vaginosis. conclusions: our pan-genome analysis provides insights into the intraspecific genome variability and the collective molecular mechanisms of the species l. crispatus. using this approach, we described the differences and similarities between the genomes and identified features likely to be important for urogenital health. notably, the conserved genetic backbone of l. crispatus accounted for close to 60% of the ortholog groups of an average l. crispatus strain and included factors for the competitive exclusion of g. vaginalis, providing an explanation on how this urogenital species could improve vaginal health.
phase i randomized safety study of twice daily dosing of acidform vaginal gel: candidate antimicrobial contraceptive.
background: acidform gel, an acid-buffering product that inactivates spermatozoa, may be an effective topical non-hormonal contraceptive. this study was designed to evaluate the safety of vaginal dosing and effects of acidform on mucosal immune mediators, antimicrobial properties of genital secretions, and vaginal microbiota. methods: thirty-six sexually abstinent u.s. women were randomized to apply acidform or hydroxyethylcellulose (hec) placebo gel twice daily for 14 consecutive days. safety was assessed by symptoms and pelvic examination. the impact of gel on mucosal immunity was assessed by quantifying cytokines, chemokines, antimicrobial proteins and antimicrobial activity of genital secretions collected by cervicovaginal lavage (cvl) at screening, 2 hours after gel application, and on days 7, 14 and 21. vaginal microbiota was characterized at enrollment and day 14 using species-specific quantitative pcr assays. results: the median vaginal and cervical ph was significantly lower 2 hours after application of acidform and was associated with an increase in the bactericidal activity of cvl against e. coli. however, 65% of women who received acidform had at least one local adverse event compared with 11% who received placebo (p = 0.002). while there was no increase in inflammatory cytokines or chemokines, cvl concentrations of lactoferrin and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra), an anti-inflammatory protein, were significantly lower following acidform compared to hec placebo gel application. there were no significant changes in lactobacillus crispatus or lactobacillus jensenii in either group but there was a decrease in gardnerella vaginalis in the acidform group (p = 0.08). conclusions: acidform gel may augment mucosal defense as evidenced by an increase in bactericidal activity of genital secretions against e. coli and a decrease in gardnerella vaginalis colonization. however, acidform was associated with more irritation than placebo and lower levels of antimicrobial (lactoferrin) and anti-inflammatory (il-1ra) proteins. these findings indicate the need for additional safety studies of this candidate non-hormonal contraceptive. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct00850837.
temporal variability of human vaginal bacteria and relationship with bacterial vaginosis.
background: little is known about short-term bacterial fluctuations in the human  vagina. this study used pcr to assess the variability in concentrations of key vaginal bacteria in healthy women and the immediate response to antibiotic treatment in women with bacterial vaginosis (bv). methodology/principal findings: twenty-two women assessed for bv using amsel's criteria were evaluated daily for 7 or 14 days, then at 2, 3 and 4 weeks, using a panel of 11 bacterium-specific quantitative pcr assays. participants with bv were treated with 5 days of intravaginal metronidazole. participants without bv had vaginal biotas dominated by lactobacilli, whose levels fluctuated with menses. with onset of menstruation, quantities of lactobacillus jensenii and lactobacillus crispatus decreased and were found to be inversely related to gardnerella vaginalis concentrations (p<0.001). women with bv had a variety of fastidious bacteria whose concentrations dropped below detection thresholds 1-5 days after starting metronidazole. recurrent bv was characterized by initial profound decreases of bv-associated bacteria after treatment followed by subsequent increases at relapse. conclusions/significance: the microbiota of the human vagina can be highly dynamic. healthy women are colonized with lactobacillus species, but levels can change dramatically over a month. marked increases in g. vaginalis were observed during menses. participants with bv have diverse communities of fastidious bacteria that are depleted by vaginal metronidazole therapy. women with recurrent bv initially respond to antibiotic treatment with steep declines in bacterial concentrations, but these bacteria later reemerge, suggesting that antibiotic resistance in these bacteria is not an important factor mediating bv recurrence.
lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginal microbiota of healthy women inhibit prevotella bivia and gardnerella vaginalis in coculture and cell culture.
the purpose of this study was to investigate how human vaginal isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus crispatus inhibit the vaginosis-associated pathogens gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia. results show that all the strains in coculture condition reduced the viability of g. vaginalis and p. bivia, but with differing degrees of efficacy. the treatment of g. vaginalis- and p. bivia-infected cultured human cervix epithelial hela cells with l. gasseri strain ks120.1 culture or cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs) results in the killing of the pathogens that are adhering to the cells. the mechanism of the killing activity is not attributable to low ph and the presence of lactic acid alone, but rather to the presence of hydrogen peroxide and proteolytic enzyme-resistant compound(s) present in the cfcss. in addition, coculture of g. vaginalis or p. bivia with l. gasseri ks120.1 culture or ks120.1 bacteria results in inhibition of the adhesion of the pathogens onto hela cells.
antibiotic susceptibility of atopobium vaginae.
background: previous studies have indicated that a recently described anaerobic bacterium, atopobium vaginae is associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv). thus far the four isolates of this fastidious micro-organism were found to be highly resistant to metronidazole and susceptible for clindamycin, two antibiotics preferred for the treatment of bv. methods: nine strains of atopobium vaginae, four strains of gardnerella vaginalis, two strains of lactobacillus iners and one strain each of bifidobacterium breve, b. longum, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii were tested against 15 antimicrobial agents using the etest. results: all nine strains of a. vaginae were highly resistant to nalidixic acid and colistin while being inhibited by low concentrations of clindamycin (range: < 0.016 microg/ml), rifampicin (< 0.002 microg/ml), azithromycin (< 0.016-0.32 microg/ml), penicillin (0.008-0.25 microg/ml), ampicillin (< 0.016-0.94 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (0.023-0.25 microg/ml) and linezolid (0.016-0.125 microg/ml). we found a variable susceptibility for metronidazole, ranging from 2 to more than 256 microg/ml. the four g. vaginalis strains were also susceptible for clindamycin (< 0.016-0.047 microg/ml) and three strains were susceptible to less than 1 microg/ml of metronidazole. all lactobacilli were resistant to metronidazole (> 256 microg/ml) but susceptible to clindamycin (0.023-0.125 microg/ml). conclusion: clindamycin has higher activity against g. vaginalis and a. vaginae than metronidazole, but not all a. vaginae isolates are metronidazole resistant, as seemed to be a straightforward conclusion from previous studies on a more limited number of strains.
