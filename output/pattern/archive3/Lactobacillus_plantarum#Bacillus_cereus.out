purification and characterization of a novel plantaricin, kl-1y, from lactobacillus plantarum kl-1.
three bacteriocins from lactobacillus plantarum kl-1 were successfully purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase hplc. the bacteriocin peptides kl-1x, -1y and -1z had molecular masses of 3053.82, 3498.16 and 3533.16 da, respectively. all three peptides were stable at ph 2-12 and 25 degrees c and at high temperatures of 80 and 100 degrees c for 30 min and 121 degrees c for 15 min. however, they differed in their susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes and their inhibition spectra. kl-1y showed broad inhibitory activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis dmst 17368, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 15442, p. aeruginosa atcc 9027, escherichia coli o157:h7 and e. coli atcc 8739. kl-1x and -1z inhibited only gram-positive bacteria. kl-1x, kl-1y and kl-1z exhibited synergistic activity. the successful amino acid sequencing of kl-1y had a hydrophobicity of approximately 30 % and no cysteine residues suggested its novelty, and it was designated "plantaricin kl-1y". plantaricin kl-1y exhibited bactericidal activity against bacillus cereus jcm 2152(t). compared to nisin, kl-1y displayed broad inhibitory activities of 200, 800, 1600, 800, 400 and 400 au/ml against the growth of bacillus coagulans jcm 2257(t), b. cereus jcm 2152(t), listeria innocua atcc 33090(t), staphylococcus aureus tistr 118, e. coli o157:h7 and e. coli atcc 8739, respectively, whereas nisin had similar activities against only b. coagulans jcm 2257(t) and b. cereus jcm 2152(t). therefore, the novel plantaricin kl-1y is a promising antimicrobial substance for food safety uses in the future.
antioxidant and antibacterial activities of exopolysaccharides from bifidobacterium bifidum wbin03 and lactobacillus plantarum r315.
the objective of this study was to investigate the antioxidant and antibacterial  activities of exopolysaccharide (eps) from bifidobacterium bifidum wbin03 (b-eps) and lactobacillus plantarum r315 (l-eps). the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (dpph)-radical scavenging, hydroxyl radical-scavenging, and superoxide radical-scavenging abilities were measured to evaluate antioxidant activity. inhibition of erythrocyte hemolysis and lipid peroxidation was also measured. both b-eps and l-eps had strong scavenging ability against dpph and superoxide radicals at high concentration. the inhibitory effect of b-eps on erythrocyte hemolysis was stronger than that of l-eps in a concentration range from 0.30 to 1.00 mg/ml, whereas the hydroxyl scavenging ability of l-eps (39.15 +/- 0.58%) was significantly higher than that of 0.15 mg/ml ascorbic acid (24.33 +/- 1.17%) and b-eps (17.89 +/- 3.30%) at 0.10 mg/ml. the inhibition of lipid peroxidation of 0.50 mg/ml b-eps and l-eps was 13.48 +/- 1.74% and 12.43 +/- 0.51%, respectively, values lower than that of ascorbic acid at the same concentration (23.20 +/- 1.41%). furthermore, all these abilities were enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner. agar diffusion assay showed that both eps exhibited antibacterial activities against tested pathogens such as cronobacter sakazakii, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, staphyloccocus aureus, candida albicans, bacillus cereus, salmonella typhimurium, and shigella sonnei at 300 mug/ml. in conclusion, both eps have antimicrobial and antioxidant activities and could have applications in the food industry.
soy whey based medium for optimized phytase activity in saccharomyces cerevisiae  mtcc 5421 and alpha-d-galactosidase and antibacterial activities in lactobacillus plantarum mtcc 5422 by response surface methodology.
soy whey based growth medium for yeast enabled the native isolate of saccharomyces cerevisiae mtcc 5421 to produce 198 u/ml of phytase activity against that of 135 u/ml in potato dextrose broth. in the same medium for lactic acid bacteria, the isolate of lactobacillus plantarum mtcc 5422 was able to elaborate alpha-d-galactosidase activity of 10.6 u/ml in comparison to 6 u/ml in lactobacillus mrs broth. using this formulated medium, a central composite experimental design based on 5 variables of 3 factors namely incubation temperature, ph level and incubation period showed that s. cerevisiae could produce 200 u/ml of phytase in 36 h at 30 degrees c and ph 3.5. similarly, l. plantarum in 33 h at 37 degrees c and ph 6.6 exhibited 14.2 u/ml of alpha-d-galactosidase activity, whereas the antibacterial activity of 14.4 au/ml against bacillus cereus was evident in 42 h at 42 degrees c and ph 6.0. the phytase and antibacterial activity units visualized in response surface plots were more or less close to those obtained with the experimental design treatments.
partial characterization of bacteriocins produced by two lactobacilus strains with probiotic properties.
the probiotic characteristics of lactobacillus brevis bg18 and lb. plantarum bg33, isolated from traditional turkish tulum cheese were assessed. these two bacteriocinproducer strains exhibited good probiotic characteristics such as resistance in media containing 0.3% bile salt, pepsin (3 mg ml(-)(1)), and pancreatine (1 mg ml(-)(1)) as well as acid resistance at ph 2. they were also adhered to caco-2 epithelial cells in a manner comparable to escherichia coli lmg3083 (etec) and salmonella typhimurium sl1344. the strains produced a heat-stable antimicrobial compound that was shown to be proteinaceous in nature, and therefore, referred to as bacteriocins. the bacteriocins were able to inhibit growth of a number grampositive bacteria such as listeria monocytogenes, clostridium botulinum, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus. tricine-sds-page of the active fraction resulted in single bands with estimated molecular masses of 2.5 kda and 2.7 kda for lb. brevis bg18 and lb. plantarum bg33 bacteriocins, respectively.
inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (mangifera indica l.).
this study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-o-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were gram-negative bacteria. the mics of gallotannins against bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, clostridium botulinum, campylobacter jejuni, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. the use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of s. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. supplementation of lb medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of s. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. hepta-o-galloylglucose sensitized lactobacillus plantarum tmw1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (mdr) transporter hora. carbohydrate metabolism of lactococcus lactis mg1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-o-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. in conclusion, the inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.
characterization and purification of a new bacteriocin with a broad inhibitory spectrum produced by lactobacillus plantarum lp 31 strain isolated from dry-fermented sausage.
aims: characterization and purification of a new bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum lp 31 strain, isolated from argentinian dry-fermented sausage. methods and results: lactobacillus plantarum lp 31 strain produces an antimicrobial compound that inhibits the growth of food-borne pathogenic bacteria. it was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, was stable to heat and catalase and exhibited maximum activity in the ph range from 5.0 to 6.0. consequently, it was characterized as a bacteriocin. it was purified by rp (reverse-phase) solid-phase extraction, gel filtration chromatography and rp-hplc. plantaricin produced by lact. plantarum lp 31 is a peptide with a molecular weight of 1558.85 da as determined by maldi-tof mass spectrometry and contains 14 amino acid residues. it was shown to have a bactericidal effect against pseudomonas sp., staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus and listeria monocytogenes. conclusions: the bacteriocin produced by lact. plantarum lp 31 may be considered as a new plantaricin according to its low molecular weight and particular amino acid composition. significance and impact of the study: in view of the interesting inhibitory spectrum of this bacteriocin and because of its good technological properties (resistance to heat and activity at acidic ph), this bacteriocin has potential applications as a biopreservative to prevent the growth of food-borne pathogens and food spoilage bacteria in certain food products.
antimicrobial and cytotoxic knotwood extracts and related pure compounds and their effects on food-associated microorganisms.
knotwood or bark extracts prepared from 30 species of hard and soft wood trees as well as selected pure compounds (lignans, stilbenes and flavonoids) were assayed for their antimicrobial activity against a battery of both gram positive and negative bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi (bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, lactobacillus plantarum, escherichia coli, salmonella infantis, pseudomonas fluorescens, candida albicans, saccharomyces cerevisiae, aspergillus fumigatus and penicillium brevicompactum). by far the most consistent antibacterial and antifungal properties were associated with extracts of pinus species. these extracts showed also cytotoxicity against a mouse hepatoma cell line. both antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties correlated with the stilbene content of the extracts. purified stilbenes showed the most consistent antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities, while purified lignans had marginal effects, only. the results suggest that stilbenes account both for the antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties of pinus knotwood extracts.
antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from tenerife cheese: initial characterization of plantaricin tf711, a bacteriocin-like substance produced by lactobacillus plantarum tf711.
aims: the screening and initial characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria (lab) from raw tenerife goats' cheese with possible application as biopreservatives or ripening accelerators for tenerife cheese. methods and results: one hundred and eighty lab of the genera lactobacillus (95), leuconostoc (64) and lactococcus (21) isolated from raw tenerife goats' cheese were screened for the production of antimicrobial substances. lactobacillus plantarum tf711, which had the broadest spectrum of antimicrobial activity, was selected for further characterization. the antimicrobial compound was determined as a proteinaceous substance, as it was sensitive to proteases. the bacteriocin-like substance, which we called plantaricin tf711, was active against the gram-positive bacteria bacillus cereus, clostridium sporogenes and staphylococcus aureus; and against the enterobacteriaceae shigella sonnei and klebsiella pneumoniae. it was stable to heat and to treatment with surfactants and organic solvents. highest antimicrobial activity was found between ph 1 and 9. plantaricin tf711 exhibited primary metabolite kinetics, a bacteriostatic mode of action and a molecular mass of c. 2.5 kda as determined by tricine sds-page. conclusions: lact. plantarum tf711 produces a low molecular mass bacteriocin-like compound with a wide spectrum of activity and interesting technological properties (thermostability, good ph stability and stability against surfactants and organic solvents). significance and impact of the study: plantaricin tf711 was found to have potential for use as a biopreservative in the food industry.
antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. there are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. however, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. this study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the mics and mbcs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. the results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and staphylococcus aureus, with mics of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. a concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactococcus lactis, and paenibacillus polymyxa. the mics for listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. no activity was detected against lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.
inhibition of bacillus cereus atcc 14579 by plantaricin ug1 in vitro and in food.
the inhibition of bacillus cereus atcc 14579 viable growth by lactobacillus plantarum ug1 bacteriocin (plantaricin ug1) in vitro and in food (pasteurized milk and minced meat) was studied. the inhibitory effect against b. cereus food-borne pathogen noticed in this study was due to plantaricin ug1, but not due to lactic acid produced by the l. plantarum ug1 culture. plataricin ug1 negative clone did not affect viable growth of b. cereus in both broth and meat or pasteurized milk. the inhibitory effect of l. plantarum ug1 and its bacteriocion was apparently more in liquid systems (bhi broth & pasteurized milk) than in minced meat. the inhibitory effect of plantaricin ug1 against b. cereus was dependent on its concentration. the 22880 au/ml concentration appeared to be an ideal preservative against b. cereus atcc 14579 in liquid systems.
isolation, purification and partial characterization of plantaricin 423, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum.
lactobacillus plantarum 423, isolated from sorghum beer, produces a bacteriocin (plantaricin 423) which is inhibitory to several food spoilage bacteria and food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, clostridium sporogenes, enterococcus faecalis, listeria spp. and staphylococcus spp. plantaricin 423 is resistant to treatment at 80 degrees c, but loses 50% of its activity after 60 min at 100 degrees c and 75% of its activity after autoclaving (121 degrees c, 15 min). plantaricin 423 remains active after incubation at ph 1-10 and is inactivated when treated with pepsin, papain, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and proteinase k. plantaricin 423 was partially purified and its size estimated at 3.5 kda, as determined by tricine-sds-page. the mechanism of activity of plantaricin 423 is weakly bactericidal, as determined against oenococcus oeni (previously leuconostoc oenos). high dna homology was obtained between the plasmid dna of strain 423 and the pediocin pa-1 operon of pediococcus acidilactici pac 1.0, suggesting that plantaricin 423 is plasmid-encoded and related to the pediocin gene cluster.
plantaricin lp84, a broad spectrum heat-stable bacteriocin of lactobacillus plantarum ncim 2084 produced in a simple glucose broth medium.
lactobacillus plantarum ncim 2084 produced an antibacterial substance when grown  at 40 degrees c for 36 h in a laboratory medium. the antibacterial substance was active against a wide range of bacteria comprising gram positive and negative foodborne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. however, related mesophilic lactobacilli were not inhibited, except for l. amylovorus dsm 20531. the antimicrobial activity was observed between late log and stationary growth phases. the antibacterial substance was partially purified through concentration under vacuum, followed by extraction with methanol and acetone (m-a extract). on fractionation of the m-a extract through sephadex g-25, the activity was present in an eluant volume of 85 to 100 ml (peak i), indicating an apparent molecular mass of between 1 and 5 kda and the purification attained was 80-fold. the antimicrobial principle was stable to heat (121 degrees c for 20 min) and catalase, but sensitive to trypsin and chymotrypsin, indicating it to be a bacteriocin. the m-a extract exhibited a bactericidal and lytic effect against bacillus cereus f 4810 and escherichia coli d 21. the ability of l. plantarum ncim 2084 to produce an effective bacteriocin in a simple growth medium is of potential interest in its application as a biopreservative in traditional fermented foods.
inhibition of microbial growth by ajoene, a sulfur-containing compound derived from garlic.
ajoene, a garlic-derived sulfur-containing compound that prevents platelet aggregation, exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. growth of gram-positive bacteria, such as bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, mycobacterium smegmatis, and streptomyces griseus, was inhibited at 5 micrograms of ajoene per ml. staphylococcus aureus and lactobacillus plantarum also were inhibited below 20 micrograms of ajoene per ml. for gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and xanthomonas maltophilia, mics were between 100 and 160 micrograms/ml. ajoene also inhibited yeast growth at concentrations below 20 micrograms/ml. the microbicidal effect of ajoene on growing cells was observed at slightly higher concentrations than the corresponding mics. b. cereus and saccharomyces cerevisiae were killed at 30 micrograms of ajoene per ml after 24 h of cultivation when cultivation was started at 10(5) cells per ml. however, the minimal microbicidal concentrations for resting cells were at 10 to 100 times higher concentrations than the corresponding mics. the disulfide bond in ajoene appears to be necessary for the antimicrobial activity of ajoene, since reduction by cysteine, which reacts with disulfide bonds, abolished its antimicrobial activity.
antibacterial activity of lactobacillus plantarum ug1 isolated from dry sausage:  characterization, production and bactericidal action of plantaricin ug1.
lactobacillus plantarum ug1 isolated from dry sausage produced an antimicrobial substance that inhibited other strains of the genera lactobacillus and lactococcus, and some foodborne pathogens including listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and clostridium sporogenes. this antibacterial substance was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes and showed a bactericidal mode of action. consequently, it was characterized as a bacteriocin, and was designated plantaricin ug1. this bacteriocin was stable in the ph range 4.5 to 7.0, partially inactivated by amylolytic enzymes and relatively thermostable. it was not affected by organic or lipolytic enzymes. production of plantaricin ug1 was ph- and temperature-dependant and maximum yields were obtained in mrs broth cultures maintained at initial ph 6.5, and incubated at 25 degrees c to 30 degrees c, in the exponential to the early stationary growth phase of the producer organism. ultrafiltration studies indicated that plantaricin ug1 has a molecular weight between 3 and 10 kda. curing experiments with l. plantarum ug1 resulted in the appearance of variants that lost bacteriocin production ability but were still immune to the bacteriocin. plantaricin ug1 production appeared to be chromosomal encoded. sensitive and insensitive gram-positive bacteria adsorbed plantaricin ug1 irrespective of their susceptibility to it. in contrast, gram-negative bacteria did not adsorb plantaricin ug1. the bactericidal action of plantaricin ug1 did not depend on the physiological state of the indicator culture and did not cause cell lysis. the resistance of two indicator strains to plantaricin ug1 has been studied.
the occurrence and growth of microorganisms during the fermentation of fish sausage.
minced fish (mullet) sausage mixes containing added sugar, salt, nitrate, nitrite and spices were fermented (48 h, 30 degrees c) by indigenous flora or by a starter culture (pediococcus acidilactici) and the microbial ecology and behaviour of various bacteria was monitored. pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus plantarum dominated the indigenous fermentation, achieving populations of 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g by 48 h, and decreasing the ph of the mix to 4.5-4.7. significant growth (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g) of staphylococcus warneri, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis. micrococcus varians and micrococcus luteus also occurred during this fermentation. less growth was exhibited by bacillus megaterium and yeasts. pediococcus acidilactici dominated the fermentation when it was inoculated as a starter culture, but indigenous lactic acid bacteria (p. pentosaceus and l. plantarum) also grew to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g. the growth of other bacteria and yeasts was restricted during fermentation with starter culture. inoculated escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella sofia, and staphylococcus aureus grew to 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g in the sausage mix during indigenous fermentation. lesser growth occurred for bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and vibrio parahaemolyticus. growth of these bacteria was significantly inhibited in sausage mix fermented with p. acidilactici.
growth of bacillus cereus in fermenting tempeh made from various beans and its inhibition by lactobacillus plantarum.
counts of bacillus cereus reached ca 10(8) cfu/g within 40 h in fermenting unacidified horsebean tempeh and resulted in complete spoilage of the product. in fermenting unacidified pea, chickpea and soybean tempeh, b. cereus counts reached 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g, although the products were not spoiled. inoculation of these unacidified beans with lactobacillus plantarum decreased the final count of b. cereus by 2 log units, but had no effect on its growth in unacidified horsebean tempeh and its subsequent spoilage. acidification of the beans during soaking resulted in a lower rate of b. cereus growth during fermentation. inoculation of acidified beans with lact. plantarum resulted in a markedly lower growth rate of b. cereus. in an associative broth culture study, b. cereus was completely inhibited by lact. plantarum at ph values of about 5.5. lactobacillus plantarum may be used to control the growth of b. cereus during tempeh production.
