TI  - Conversion of a chaperonin GroEL-independent protein into an obligate substrate.
AB  - Chaperones assist protein folding by preventing unproductive protein aggregation  in the cell. In Escherichia coli, chaperonin GroEL/GroES (GroE) is the only indispensable chaperone and is absolutely required for the de novo folding of at least approximately 60 proteins. We previously found that several orthologs of the obligate GroE substrates in Ureaplasma urealyticum, which lacks the groE gene in the genome, are E. coli GroE-independent folders, despite their significant sequence identities. Here, we investigated the key features that define the GroE dependence. Chimera or random mutagenesis analyses revealed that independent multiple point mutations, and even single mutations, were sufficient to confer GroE dependence on the Ureaplasma MetK. Strikingly, the GroE dependence was well correlated with the propensity to form protein aggregates during folding. The results reveal the delicate balance between GroE dependence and independence. The function of GroE to buffering the aggregation-prone mutations plays a role in maintaining higher genetic diversity of proteins.
TI  - Vaginal infections among pregnant women at Omdurman Maternity Hospital in Khartoum, Sudan.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Microbial infections of the vagina in pregnant women are health problems that lead to serious medical complications and consequences. This study aimed to investigate and determine antimicrobial susceptibilities of the causative agents of vaginal infections in pregnant women. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study of pregnant women (n = 200) was conducted between August and December 2008 at Omdurman Maternity Hospital, Khartoum, Sudan. Vaginal and cervical swabs were obtained from each subject and processed for isolation and identification of pathogenic microorganisms using standard methods of wet mount preparation, direct Gram smear, Nugent scoring system, direct immunofluorescence, and cultural techniques. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacterial isolates was performed using standard procedures. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS program version 12.0.1. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of the 200 pregnant women enrolled, BV was detected in 49.8%, followed by Chlamydia trachomatis (31.3%) and Candida albicans (16.6%), with low frequencies of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (1.8%) and Trichomonas vaginalis (0.5%). Higher infection rates were recorded among subjects in the third trimester (71.6%) than in the second trimester of gestation (28.4%). No significant association (p = 0.7) between history of abortions and C. trachomatis infections was found. Gentamicin was the most active agent against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Clarythromycin was the most active against Mycoplasma species. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with vaginal complaints revealed various positive microbiology results. Such cases may require specific medication. Routine culture of vaginal and cervical samples should be performed on all pregnant women during prenatal visits.
TI  - Microbiological etiology of bacterial prostatitis in general hospital and primary care clinic in Korea.
AB  - PURPOSE: The National Institutes of Health classification of prostatitis reported the proportion of chronic bacterial prostatitis, especially category II, at 3% to 10%. Because of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnosis technique, chronic prostatitis syndrome (CPS) with a known bacterial origin has increased recently. In this study, we evaluated the proportion of chronic bacterial prostatitis in a general hospital and a primary care clinic (PCC) in addition to the distribution of the microorganism in chronic bacterial prostatitis in Korea. METHODS: Two hundred and ninety-three patients were enrolled in this study. One hundred and five patients in the general hospital and 188 patients in the PCC were enrolled in the study. Using a questionnaire, all patients were checked for symptoms of urinalysis, expressed prostate secretion (EPS), EPS or V3 culture and PCR of EPS or VB3 for Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Mycoplasma genetalia, and Trichomatis vaginalis. RESULTS: In routine EPS or VB3 culture, 12 of 105 patients (11.4%) in the general hospital showed positive culture, but 77 of 188 patients (40.9%) in the PCC showed a positive culture. Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas were isolated in routine culture. In the PCR diagnosis, 37 of 105 patients (35.2%) in the general hospital were PCR positive, and 65 of 188 patients (34.5%) in the PCC were PCR positive. In the general hospital, C. trachomatis was the most common (49%), followed by U. urealyticum (24%), M. genetalia (16%), M. hominis (10%), and T. vaginalis (2%). In the PCC, U. urealyticum was the most common (45%), followed by C. trachomatis (34%), M. hominis (13%), M. genetalia (7%) and T. vaginalis (1%). The proportions of chronic bacterial prostatitis were 46.6% (49/105) and 67.5% (127/188) in the general hospital and PCC, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The total portion of chronic bacterial prostatitis was 59.3% (174/293). Culture-positive patients in the PCC were significantly higher than in the general hospital, but the number of PCR positive patients in the PCC was the same as in the general hospital.
TI  - Pathogen profile in men with inflammation of paraurethral glands.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pathogen profile in men with inflammation of the paraurethral glands. METHODS: We enrolled 40 patients with first-onset, drug-naive inflammation of the paraurethral glands. Discharge from the lesions was collected for Gram staining. Microscopy was performed for screening for trichomonads and detecting Gram-negative intracellular diplococci within phagocytes. Cultures for detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Ureaplasma urealyticum and other bacteria, and Chlamydia-trachomatis-associated antigens were performed. PCR was conducted for herpes simplex virus type 1 or 2. RESULTS: From these 40 patients, there were nine microbial species, which included Gram-negative bacteria (23 cases, 54.8%), Gram-positive bacteria (15 cases, 35.7%) and other pathogens (4 cases, 9.5%). The top three pathogens were gonococci (38.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (16.7%) and Escherichia coli (14.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Inflammation of paraurethral glands in men may be caused by a variety of pathogens and not just by gonococcal infection.
TI  - Bacterial infections of the lower genital tract in fertile and infertile women from the southeastern Poland.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to investigate the detection rates of  Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis, showing no clinical signs of an ongoing, acute inflammatory state of the vagina and/or the cenrvix, in fertile and infertile women. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study encompassed 161 women, including 101 women treated for infertility and 60 fertile women who had already given birth to healthy children. The material for the presence of C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, M. genitalium, M. hominis and U. urealyticum was collected from the cervical canal and analyzed by PCR. Furthermore, BD ProbeTec ET system was used to detect C. trachomatis infection. Vaginal swabs were collected for classification of bacterial vaginosis and aerobic vaginitis and assessed according to the Nugent score, as well as by traditional culture methods. RESULTS: U. urealyticum was identified in 9% of the infertile women and in 8% of controls. Presence of M. hominis was demonstrated only in the former (4%) and C. trachomatis only in latter (3%). N. gonorrhoeae and M. genitalium were not found in any of the examined women. The frequency of aerobic vaginitis in both groups was estimated at 12%. There were 7% bacterial vaginosis cases in the study group, and none in the control group (p=0.0096). CONCLUSIONS: Despite having no symptoms of an ongoing acute inflammation of the reproductive tract, many women may experience permanent or periodic shifts of equilibrium of the vaginal and/or cervical microflora. BV develops more frequently in infertile patients when compared to the fertile women.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of abnormal vaginal discharges microorganisms in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of bacterial strains and fungal strains infecting the vaginal tract and test their sensitivity to antibiotics in women attending Saint Camille Medical Centre in Ouagadougou. METHODS: From January 2008 to December 2009, a total of 2 000 vaginal swabs were cultivated for bacterial and fungal identification and isolation. Furthermore, bacterial strains were tested for their susceptibility to several antibiotics used in routine in the centre. RESULTS: The results revealed that microbial isolation and identification was attempted for 1 536/2 000 sample, a positivity rate of 76.80%. Candida albicans (48.76%), followed by Escherichia coli (16.67%), Streptococcus agalactiae (8.14%) and Staphylococcus aureus (7.55%) were the major agents of genital tract infections in patients. Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum combined accounted for less than 7%. Trichomonas vaginalis was identified in 1.04% cases. The antimicrobial tests revealed that the microorganisms developed resistance to several antibiotics including beta lactams. However, antibiotics such as cefamenzol, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin were still active on these bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: The results reveal that many sexually active women are infected by one or more microbial pathogens, probably because of the lack of hygiene or the adoption of some risky behaviors, such as not using condoms or having multiple sexual partners. Efforts should be made to address these points in the country.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and molecular mechanism of the CRES protein.
AB  - Cystatin-related epididymal spermatogenic (CRES) protein, a member of the cystatin superfamily of cysteine protease inhibitors (also known as CST8), exhibits highly specific, age-dependent expression in mouse testis and epididymis. The CRES protein possesses four highly conserved cysteine residues which govern the overall conformation of the cystatins through the formation of two disulfide bonds. Previous studies have revealed that other cystatin family members, such as cystatin 3 and cystatin 11, show antibacterial activity in vitro. This prompted us to investigate the potential antimicrobial activity of the CRES protein. Colony forming assays and spectrophotometry were used to investigate the effects of recombinant CRES protein on Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Ureaplasma urealyticum (Uu), respectively, in vitro. After incubation of E. coli with CRES recombinant protein fused with glutathione-S-transferase (GST), a substantial decrease in colony forming units was observed, and the effect was dose and time dependent. Furthermore, it took longer for Uu to grow to plateau stage when incubated with GST-CRES recombinant protein compared with the control GST. The antibacterial and Anti-Uu activities were not impaired when the cysteine residues of CRES protein were mutated, indicating that the antimicrobial effect was not dependent on its disulfide bonds. Functional analysis of three CRES polypeptides showed that the N-terminal 30 residues (N30) had no antimicrobial activity while N60 showed similar activity as full-length CRES protein. These results suggest that the active center of CRES protein resides between amino acid residues 31 and 60 of its N-terminus. Mechanistically, E. coli membrane permeabilization was increased in a dose-dependent manner, and macromolecular synthesis was inhibited on treatment with GST-CRES. Together, our data on the antimicrobial activities of CRES protein suggest that it is a novel and innate antimicrobial protein which protecting the male reproductive tract against invading pathogens.
TI  - Amniotic fluid and maternal race influence responsiveness of fetal membranes to bacteria.
AB  - Spontaneous preterm birth (PTB) and preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (pPROM) occur more frequently in African-American women than in other racial groups. This may be due to an enhanced inflammatory response to pathogens associated with the condition. It is also possible that amniotic fluid (AF) has different immunomodulatory properties in African-American women that increase their risk of PTB and pPROM. To test this, we cultured fetal membranes from European-American and African-American women with sterile medium (control), Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Group B streptococci (GBS), Polyporphorans gingivalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum or Ureaplasma parvum in the presence and absence of 50% autologous AF. Cytokine concentrations were quantified in the conditioned medium. All bacterial species increased IL-8 production. IL-1beta and TNF-alpha production were stimulated by LPS, E. coli, and G. vaginalis compared with control, but responses to Group B streptococci and P. gingivalis were limited to IL-1beta and TNF-alpha respectively. Genital mycoplasmas stimulated TNF-alpha and IL-10 but had no effect on IL-1beta production. African-Americans had twice the IL-1beta response to E. coli as European-Americans (P=0.031). Conversely, European-Americans produced more IL-8 in response to LPS than African-Americans (P=0.026). AF had both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties that varied between races and pathogens. These results suggest that the host response to fetal membrane infections is complex and not generalizable. Interventions to prevent PTB and pPROM may need to be customized based on a patient's race, type of bacterial infection and factors in her AF.
TI  - Bacterial modulation of human fetal membrane Toll-like receptor expression.
AB  - PROBLEM: Preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes (pPROM) occurs in 30-40% of spontaneous preterm births (PTB) and is associated with intra-amniotic infection and inflammation. The membranes may sense and respond to microbes via Toll-like receptors (TLRs); however, little is known about their expression and regulation in this tissue. The objective of this study was to evaluate the expression of TLRs 1-10 in fetal membranes after exposure to pathogens associated with intra-amniotic infection and PTB. METHOD OF STUDY: Normal human term fetal membrane explants were exposed to various bacteria. After 24 hrs, RNA was extracted and quantitative RT-PCR performed for TLRs1-10. RESULTS: Treatment of fetal membranes with Mycoplasma hominis increased expression of TLR4, TLR6, and TLR8 mRNA. Ureaplasma parvum upregulated TLR8 mRNA, and Porphyromonas gingivalis significantly increased fetal membrane TLR7 expression. In contrast, treatment with Gram-negative Escherichia coli (and its cell wall component lipopolysaccharide) downregulated TLR10 mRNA. No effect was detected for Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, or Group B Streptococcus. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that different types of bacteria have distinct effects on fetal membrane TLR expression patterns. Moreover, these findings highlight the disparity of fetal membrane responses to infection and thus suggest heterogeneity in the mechanisms by which infection-associated pregnancy complications, such as pPROM and PTB, arise.
TI  - Preserved ex vivo inflammatory status in decidual cells from women with preterm labor and subclinical intrauterine infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the inflammatory response preserved ex vivo by decidual cells isolated from women who experienced preterm labor with and without subclinical intrauterine infection. METHODS: Fetal membranes were obtained after cesarean section from 35 women who delivered before 37 weeks of gestation following spontaneous preterm labor, with no clinical evidence of intrauterine infection. Decidua was microbiologically tested and cultured. Concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-10), pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, MMP-8, MMP-9) were measured in the supernatants using Bio-Plex, and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) was measured by enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: Subclinical infection was confirmed in 10 women (28.5%). Microorganisms isolated were Ureaplasma urealyticum (4), group B streptococci (3), Gardnerella vaginalis (1), and Escherichia coli (2). We found a significant increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a significant decrease of anti-inflammatory cytokines in supernatants from decidual cells obtained from women with preterm labor and subclinical intrauterine infection compared to women without infection. Secretion of MMP-1, MMP-8, MMP-9 and PGE(2) was significantly higher in infected women. Secretion of IL-8 by decidual cells from infected women persisted upon repeated in vitro culture passages. CONCLUSIONS: Almost 30% of idiopathic preterm labor cases were associated with subclinical intrauterine infection, and decidual cells isolated from these cases preserved an ex vivo inflammatory status after in vivo bacterial exposure.
TI  - Microbiological findings in endometrial specimen: our experience.
AB  - PURPOSE: Collection of an endometrial specimen for investigating infectious agents in the endometrial cavity is an invasive technique that is at times difficult and painful. In order to avoid the need for endometrial sampling in the cases of suspected or evident endometrial pathology, the aim of this study is to investigate the reliability of cervical cultures for detecting infectious agents present at the endometrial level, comparing the results between cervical cultures and endometrial cultures in women with clinical signs of endometrial inflammation. METHODS: In a prospective diagnostic study, in the period from January 2009 to October 2010, we enrolled 404 women referred to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology for diagnostic hysteroscopy. All the patients underwent cervical and endometrial sampling. Cultures for common bacteria, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, yeast, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were performed. RESULTS: The most frequent infectious agents detected at the endometrial level were common bacteria, which accounted for 69% of all cases. In particular, streptococci were found in 27% of cases, and bacteria from intestinal flora (Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli) was recovered in 31% of cases. U. urealyticum was detected in 10% and Mycoplasma in only one patient (0.2% of cases). No cases of N. gonorrhoeae were found. CONCLUSIONS: Cervical culture has a low concordance with endometrial culture. In fact in only 33% of cases was the microorganism found in the cervix the same as that found in the endometrium. These results infer that an endometrial culture is a useful investigative tool for determining the microorganisms in endometrial pathology.
TI  - An intrauterine device as a possible cause of change in the microbial flora of the female genital system.
AB  - AIM: An intrauterine device (IUD), used by millions of women worldwide, is one of the most efficient methods of contraception. The goal of our study was to compare a group of women using the IUD to a control group. MATERIAL & METHODS: The survey included 236 women of fertile age from gynaecological practices in the area of Split and Dalmatia County, Croatia. The subjects were divided into two groups: IUD users and a control group (women not using any contraception methods). Sampling, transportation, sample processing in the laboratory and interpretation of results were conducted using standard microbiological procedures and methods. RESULTS: Opportunistic bacteria were statistically more frequently isolated among IUD users (P < 0.001). The most frequently isolated bacteria in both groups were Escherichia coli and Ureaplasma urealyticum with significantly higher rates in IUD users (P < 0.001). Both colonization and infection had higher rates in IUD users (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences either in the frequency of bacteria isolation regarding different IUD types (P = 0.93), or in relation to duration of IUD use (P = 0.67). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the data in our study IUD users have an increased chance of developing a cervical infection caused by the bacteria Escherichia coli and Ureaplasma urealyticum. Therefore, before IUD insertion women should be screened and treated for asymptomatic vaginal or cervical infections to prevent possible serious IUD-associated infections.
TI  - Bacterial species present in the lower male genital tract: a five-year retrospective study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify bacterial species present in the lower genital tract of males and to investigate the relationship with semen quality. METHODS: The microscopic analyses and cultures of 696 semen specimens, collected over five years from males investigated for subfertility, were retrospectively assessed. RESULTS: Semen cultures were sterile in 48%; they showed a polymicrobial flora (more than two bacterial species) in 30%, and were positive (>1 x 10(3) colony forming units/ml) in 22% of the cases. Gardnerella vaginalis was the most frequently isolated bacterium, followed by Escherichia coli and Enterococcus sp. Ureaplasma urealyticum was recovered from 13 of 147 samples (9%). Of patients with bacteriospermia 42% had leukospermia (>10(6) leukocytes/ml of semen). Bacteriospermia and leukospermia did not correlate with each other although a positive correlation was found between the presence of leukocytes and G. vaginalis isolation. Semen parameters were correlated with the bacterial species isolated most frequently. In comparison with controls, sperm concentration, motility and morphology were mostly deteriorated in the presence of G. vaginalis and U. urealyticum. CONCLUSIONS: Positive seminal fluid cultures must be interpreted with caution, taking into account both raised colony counts of single isolates and leukocyte concentration in the semen. Thus the common misdiagnosis of genital tract infection, based on the presence of seminal bacteria, and unnecessary treatment with antibiotics may be avoided.
TI  - [Can introduction of guidelines for use of an intrauterine device reduce changes  in microbial flora of female genital system in IUD-users?].
AB  - The intrauterine device (IUD), one of the most effective and most common methods  of reversible contraception, is used by millions of women worldwide. Although various studies indicate the benefits of its use as a contraceptive method, the greatest concern regarding IUDs is the potential risk for infection. The presence of the IUD gives a solid surface for bacterial attachment and biofilm formation. Infections due to biofilm formation are chronic and difficult to resolve. However, women should be screened and treated for asymptomatic vaginal or cervical infections before IUD insertion. Based on the data in the literature and the data in study conducted in Croatia, it can be concluded that IUD users are at increased risk for development of infection. Treatment strategies in Croatia should take into consideration that Escherichia coli and Ureaplasma urealyticum are dominant causative agents. We conclude that guidelines for the use of IUD in Croatia are a necessity.
TI  - Cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells of women with a history of preterm birth.
AB  - Preterm birth is associated with elevated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFalpha at the maternal-fetal interface. Previous studies have suggested that women with a history of preterm birth produce aberrantly strong inflammatory responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). However many intrauterine infections in women are associated with pathogens including Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus) that contain pro-inflammatory factors other than LPS. We evaluated whether peripheral blood leukocytes from women with a history of preterm birth produce elevated amounts of TNFalpha upon stimulation with pathogens associated with preterm birth and if pre-treatment with aspirin, an anti-inflammatory medication, decreases the ex vivo production of this cytokine. Heat-killed bacteria elicited increased TNFalpha production from leukocytes in a dose-dependent manner, but no differences in TNFalpha production between leukocytes from women with preterm birth and control women with term birth were detected. In women who consumed aspirin each day for one week, TNFalpha production was increased in leukocytes from control women stimulated with Escherichia coli and U. urealyticum, but was reduced or unchanged in leukocytes from women with preterm birth. Similar trends were observed for a subset of samples stimulated with U. urealyticum and assayed for IL-6, IL-10, IL-1beta and TNFalpha by bead array. We conclude that leukocytes from women with a history of preterm birth do not have elevated pro-inflammatory responses to pathogens, and that reproductive history is associated with different effects of aspirin on pro-inflammatory cytokine production.
TI  - Vaginal and endocervical microorganisms in symptomatic and asymptomatic non-pregnant females: risk factors and rates of occurrence.
AB  - Physiological or non-physiological factors may affect the vaginal flora. The occurrence of genital microorganisms in non-pregnant females of all ages was studied, as were the risk factors associated with each microorganism. A retrospective analysis of vaginal and endocervical cultures and wet smears from 27,172 non-pregnant women, between 1996 to 2005, was performed taking into consideration clinical and socio-demographic characteristics. No microorganisms were observed in 55.7% of the individuals studied and 44.3% had positive cultures. There was no microbiological aetiology in 49% of women with genital symptoms. Poor hygiene, chemical irritants, sexual behaviour, vaginal blood, birth control type, and/or the lack of an oestrogen effect may have caused the symptoms. The highest occurrence of Gram-negative bacteria (p<0.01), mainly Escherichia coli, was observed in prepubescent girls. The highest occurrence of Candida species (p<0.01) was in women of childbearing age, and of Gram-positive bacteria (p<0.01) in menopausal women. Adolescents, particularly asymptomatic girls, carried more frequently Ureaplasma urealyticum and Chlamydia trachomatis (p<0.01). Hormonal contraception and consistent condom use was protective against bacterial vaginosis and U. urealyticum colonization. Users of intrauterine devices had an increased risk of bacterial vaginosis or of contracting U. urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis and Candida species. Genital complaints were an independent indicator of Candida species, Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, Trichomonas vaginalis and bacterial vaginosis.Chlamydia trachomatis infections were often asymptomatic. It is concluded that the hormonal milieu and non-physiological factors are major determinants of the vaginal flora. If diagnosis of genital infections is based on symptoms alone and not on culture results, it may be erroneous. Sexual abuse should be investigated when a child presents with a sexually transmitted disease.
TI  - Comparison of clinical symptoms scored according to the National Institutes of Health chronic prostatitis symptoms index and assessment of antimicrobial treatment in patients with chronic prostatitis syndrome.
AB  - We examined a total of 194 patients over 18 years of age with chronic prostatitis syndrome and no evidence of structural or functional lower genitourinary tract abnormalities. The following data were obtained for each patient: clinical history--the severity of chronic prostatitis symptoms scored by a Croatian translation of the NiH CPSI questionnaire, clinical status including digitorectal examination, urethral swab specimens, and selective samples of urine and expressed prostatic secretion, according to the 4-glass localization test (meares and Stamey localization technique). Patients were treated orally with antimicrobial agents in doses and duration according to clinical practice in Croatia. An infectious etiology was determined in 169 (87%) patients. Chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 38 (20%), Trichomonas vaginalis in 35 (18%), Enterococcus in 36 (19%) and Escherichia coli in 35 (18%) patients. In the remaining 25 patients the following causative pathogens were found: Ureaplasma urealyticum, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Comparison of symptoms scores and effect on quality of life has shown that the most severe clinical presentation of disease was recorded in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by E. coli and Enterococcus (p<0.001). Clinical success was paralleled by bacteriological eradication in chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by C. trachomatis, Enterococcus and E. coli (kappa >0.2<0.5), but not in inflammatory chronic pelvic pain syndrome caused by T. vaginalis.
TI  - Does progesterone inhibit bacteria-stimulated interleukin-8 production by lower genital tract epithelial cells?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Progesterone (P(4)) has been clinically shown to prevent the recurrence of preterm birth. The mechanism(s) of action is unclear, but may involve modulation of the immunologic inflammatory response of the lower genital tract. We evaluated the effects of P(4) on interleukin-8 (IL-8) production by vaginal and cervical epithelial cells stimulated with bacterial species that are commonly associated with preterm birth. METHODS: Vaginal and endocervical epithelial cells were incubated with up to 10,000 ng/mL P(4) overnight and stimulated with heat-killed Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, or Ureaplasma urealyticum. Concentrations of IL-8 in conditioned medium were quantified by ELISA and viability of the cell cultures was measured by the reduction of a tetrazolium salt. RESULTS: E. coli, G. vaginalis and U. urealyticum-stimulated IL-8 production for both cell lines. P(4) inhibited basal and bacteria-stimulated IL-8 production for vaginal epithelial cells but enhanced IL-8 production by endocervical cells. P(4) reduced the number of viable cells for both cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: P(4) inhibits IL-8 production by vaginal epithelial cells stimulated with pathogens associated with preterm birth, possibly by reducing the number of viable cells or by inhibiting their proliferation. Although P(4) also reduces proliferation of endocervical cells it also increases their production of IL-8.
TI  - Infection and stillbirth.
AB  - Infection may cause stillbirth by several mechanisms, including direct infection, placental damage, and severe maternal illness. Various organisms have been associated with stillbirth, including many bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. In developed countries, between 10% and 25% of stillbirths may be caused by an infection, whereas in developing countries, which have much higher stillbirth rates, the contribution of infection is much greater. In developed countries, ascending bacterial infection, both before and after membrane rupture, with organisms such as Escherichia coli, group B streptococci, and Ureaplasma urealyticum is usually the most common infectious cause of stillbirth. However, in areas where syphilis is prevalent, up to half of all stillbirths may be caused by this infection alone. Malaria may be an important cause of stillbirth in women infected for the first time in pregnancy. The two most important viral causes of stillbirth are parvovirus and Coxsackie virus, although a number of other viral infections appear to be causal. Toxoplasma gondii, Listeria monocytogenes, and the organisms that cause leptospirosis, Q fever, and Lyme disease have all been implicated as etiologic for stillbirth. In certain developing countries, the stillbirth rate is high and the infection-related component so great that achieving a substantial reduction in stillbirth should be possible by reducing maternal infections. However, because infection-related stillbirth is uncommon in developed countries, and because those that do occur are caused by a wide variety of organisms, reducing this etiologic component of stillbirth much further will be difficult.
TI  - A novel diagnostic tool for detecting neonatal infections using multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In newborns with infections, it is necessary to detect various pathogens rapidly and accurately, because the infections are often fatal when diagnosis is delayed. However, no diagnostic tools that rapidly detect pathogens causing neonatal infectious diseases are available. OBJECTIVES: To establish a rapid diagnostic tool using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect 8 major pathogens that often cause neonatal infections, including Group B Streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Ureaplasma urealyticum, herpes simplex virus, Cytomegalovirus, and Candida albicans, and to validate this tool in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). METHODS: One hundred and thirty clinical samples were obtained from newborns with any infectious signs or histories. DNA was extracted from these samples and multiplex PCR was performed with a mixture of 8 primer pairs, all designed to amplify pathogenic DNA and produce different sizes of amplicons. Seventy-seven samples with suspicion of bacterial infections were also examined by bacterial culture to evaluate the accuracy of the multiplex PCR results. RESULTS: Six of the 8 pathogens could be rapidly detected by our multiplex PCR method, within 3.5-4.5 h. These positive results led us to immediately diagnose and select proper drugs against each pathogen. In comparison with culture results, our test characteristics were as follows: specificity: 93%, negative predictive value: 96%, and concordance rate: 90%. CONCLUSIONS: We have established and validated a rapid diagnostic tool for detecting pathogens using multiplex PCR, which may be useful for the confirmed diagnosis of neonatal infections in the NICU.
TI  - Effect of progesterone on proinflammatory cytokine production by monocytes stimulated with pathogens associated with preterm birth.
AB  - PROBLEM: A number of clinical trials have demonstrated that supplemental progesterone (P4) can prevent preterm birth. Although P4 can decrease the production of mediators of inflammation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages, a majority of infections associated with preterm birth are due to Ureaplasma urealyticum, which does not contain LPS. Therefore, we studied whether P4 could lower the production of proinflammatory cytokines by monocytes stimulated with U. urealyticum. METHOD OF STUDY: Human monocytes (THP-1 cells) were treated with P4 and then stimulated with heat-killed Escherichia coli or U. urealyticum. Cytokine concentrations in the conditioned medium were then measured by ELISA and relative viability of the cells was assessed colorimetrically. The impact of P4 on interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL-8 production was assessed by comparing levels across different P4 dosages and organism concentrations. RESULTS: Both organisms increased IL-1alpha, TNF-alpha and IL-8 production in a dose-dependent manner. P4 enhanced the production of IL-1beta and IL-8, but inhibited TNF-alpha production by monocytes stimulated with either organism. CONCLUSION: P4 modulates cytokine production by E. coli and U. urealyticum-stimulated monocytes in a similar manner and is not strictly immunosuppressive. This suggests that P4 does not prevent preterm birth by simply suppressing bacteria-stimulated cytokine production.
TI  - Characterization of chorioamnionitis in 2nd-trimester C-section placentas and correlation with microorganism recovery from subamniotic tissues.
AB  - Prolonged exposure to infection appears to influence fetal/neonatal development.  We characterize the relationship between histologic patterns of inflammation and microorganism recovery from the placentas of live born infants delivered before the 28th postmenstrual week. The subamniotic parenchyma of 835 placentas delivered by cesarean section were cultured and evaluated for specific histologic patterns of inflammation in a blinded fashion. Cases with prolonged membrane rupture were excluded. Microorganisms were recovered from 41% of placentas. Microorganisms found more frequently in placentas with high-grade chorionic plate inflammation include Actinomyces, Prevotella bivia, Corynebacterium sp., Escherichia coli, Peptostreptococcus magnus, multiple species of Streptococci, and Mycoplasma sp., including Ureaplasma urealyticum. These microorganisms were also associated with fetal vasculitis (neutrophilic infiltration of chorionic plate stem vessels or umbilical cord). Recovery of microorganisms from placental parenchyma is associated with histologic inflammation. The same microorganisms responsible for inciting high-grade chorionic plate inflammation are also most likely to promote fetal inflammation.
TI  - Codon evolution is governed by linear formulas.
AB  - When nucleotide (G, C, T and A) contents were plotted against each nucleotide, their relationships were clearly expressed by a linear formula, y = alphax + beta in the coding and non-coding regions. This linear relationship was obtained from the complete single-stranded DNA. Similarly, nucleotide contents at all three codon positions were expressed by linear regression lines based on the content of each nucleotide. In addition, 64 codon usages were also expressed by linear formulas against nucleotide content. Thus, the nucleotide content not only in coding sequence but also in non-coding sequence can be expressed by a linear formula, y = alphax + beta, in 145 organisms (112 bacteria, 15 archaea and 18 eukaryotes). Based on these results, the ratio of C/T, G/T, C/A or G/A one can essentially estimate all four nucleotide contents in the complete single-stranded DNA, and the determination of any ratio of two kinds of nucleotides can essentially estimate four nucleotide contents, nucleotide contents at the three different codon positions and codon distributions at 64 codons in the coding region. The maximum and minimum values of G content were approximately 0.35 and approximately 0.15, respectively, among various organisms examined. Codon evolution occurs according to linear formulas between these two values.
TI  - Low folding propensity and high translation efficiency distinguish in vivo substrates of GroEL from other Escherichia coli proteins.
AB  - MOTIVATION: Theoretical considerations have indicated that the amount of chaperonin GroEL in Escherichia coli cells is sufficient to fold only approximately 2-5% of newly synthesized proteins under normal physiological conditions, thereby suggesting that only a subset of E.coli proteins fold in vivo in a GroEL-dependent manner. Recently, members of this subset were identified in two independent studies that resulted in two partially overlapping lists of GroEL-interacting proteins. The objective of the work described here was to identify sequence-based features of GroEL-interacting proteins that distinguish them from other E.coli proteins and that may account for their dependence on the chaperonin system. RESULTS: Our analysis shows that GroEL-interacting proteins have, on average, low folding propensities and high translation efficiencies. These two properties in combination can increase the risk of aggregation of these proteins and, thus, cause their folding to be chaperonin-dependent. Strikingly, we find that these properties are absent in proteins homologous to the E.coli GroEL-interacting proteins in Ureaplasma urealyticum, an organism that lacks a chaperonin system, thereby confirming our conclusions.
TI  - Chronic endometritis: correlation among hysteroscopic, histologic, and bacteriologic findings in a prospective trial with 2190 consecutive office hysteroscopies.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the type and etiopathogenic role of infectious agents detected in endometrial cultures obtained from women with chronic endometritis (CE). DESIGN: Prospective controlled study. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENT(S): 2190 women undergoing hysteroscopy for different indications. INTERVENTION(S): Vaginal and endometrial samples were collected from 438 women with a CE diagnosis at hysteroscopy and 100 women with no signs of CE (controls). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Histology and cultures for common bacteria, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Mycoplasma, and molecular biology testing for Chlamydia were performed. RESULT(S): We compared results of vaginal and intrauterine cultures obtained from women with and without CE. Histologic results were positive in 388 of these cases (88.6%), and at least one microorganism was found in 320 endometrial samples (73.1%). In the control group, histologic results and endometrial culture were positive in only 6% and 5% of cases, respectively. The most frequent infectious agents detected at the endometrial level were common bacteria (58% of cases). Ureaplasma urealyticum was detected in 10% and Chlamydia in only 2.7% of positive endometrial cultures. In only 143 (32.6%) cases were the same infectious agent isolated in endometrial and vaginal cultures. CONCLUSION(S): More than 70% of CE cases resulted from nongonococcal, nonchlamydial infections. Common bacteria and Mycoplasma were the most frequent etiologic agents. Vaginal cultures have low concordance with endometrial cultures.
TI  - Etiology of chronic prostatitis syndrome in patients treated at the university hospital for infectious diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljevic" from 2003 to 2005.
AB  - A total of 835 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis syndrome and no evidence of structural or functional lower genitourinary tract abnormalities were examined in a three year period at the Outpatient Department for Urogenital Infections, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljevic" Zagreb, Croatia. Disease etiology was determined in 482 (57.72%) patients. Chlamydia trachomatis was proved to be the causative pathogen in 161 patients, Trichomonas vaginalis in 85, Escherichia coli in 68, Enterococcus in 51, Proteus mirabilis in 20, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 9, Streptococcus agalactiae in 15, Ureaplasma urealyticum in 49 patients with chronic prostatitis. Other patients had mixed infection. In 257 (53.32%) of 482 patients, the inflammatory finding (>10 WBCs/hpf) was found in EPS or VB3. Normal WBCs/hpf (<10) was found in 103 (63.98%) of 161 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis in whom C. trachomatis was detected in EPS or VB3, in 50 (58.82%) of 85 patients in whom Trichomonas vaginalis was isolated, and in 23 (46.94%) of 49 patients in whom Ureaplasma urealyticum was isolated.
TI  - Canine cathelicidin (K9CATH): gene cloning, expression, and biochemical activity  of a novel pro-myeloid antimicrobial peptide.
AB  - Cathelicidins, a group of cationic peptides found in leukocytes and epithelial cells, play a central role in the early innate immune defense against infection. Although these host defense peptides have been reported in several mammalian species, including primates, no cathelicidins have been identified in carnivores. Here we report the cloning, tissue expression and biological activity of a novel canine cathelicidin (K9CATH). The full-length cDNA sequence of K9CATH encodes a predicted 172 amino acid pre-propeptide that is 60-70% similar to other mammalian cathelicidins. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the 38 aa mature K9CATH peptide was present in neutrophil granule contents. Synthetic K9CATH displayed broad antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus; MICs (minimal inhibitory concentrations) 0.5 and 50 microM, respectively), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella serotype Typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis; MICs 1.25 microM, Salmonella serotype Enteritidis; MIC 0.5 microM, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; MIC 0.06 microM), and yeast (Candida albicans; MIC 12.5-50 microM). K9CATH demonstrated high antimicrobial activity against Ureaplasma canigenitalium, and lower activity against Ureaplasma urealyticum (MIC 0.06 and 50 microM, respectively). Similar to its ovine congener SMAP-29, K9CATH possesses salt-independent antimicrobial activity and LPS binding capacity. K9CATH displayed minimal hemolytic activity against human, dog and chicken erythrocytes. The potency and broad antimicrobial activity of K9CATH suggest that this peptide may act as a fundamental contributor to the innate immune responses in this carnivore species.
TI  - Bacteria trigger oxygen radical release and sperm lipid peroxidation in in vitro  model of semen inflammation.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the in vitro effect of five bacterial strains isolated from  semen samples (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus oralis, Bacteroides ureolyticus, and Ureaplasma urealyticum) on reactive oxygen intermediate (ROI) release and lipid sperm membrane peroxidation in the coincubated suspensions of white blood cells (WBC) with spermatozoa. DESIGN: An in vitro model of semen infection. SETTING: Basic research laboratory. PATIENT(S): Healthy normozoospermic volunteers and healthy blood donors. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Chemiluminescent assay was used to evaluate ROI generation by WBC. Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration was determined in sperm lysates using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULT(S): Of the bacterial strains tested, B. ureolyticus, S. haemolyticus, and E. coli caused the greatest damage to sperm membrane lipids. An increase in MDA levels in sperm lysates was a natural consequence of bacteria-induced ROI generation. The WBC usually enhanced harmful activity of the infectious agent toward the cell membranes. CONCLUSION(S): The harmful effect of bacteria on spermatozoa depends on the type and species of microorganisms invading, colonizing, or infecting the male genital tract and is associated with the accompanying oxidative stress. The presence of leukocytes in semen appears to be the additional factor enhancing the sperm lipid membrane peroxidation, which may affect the fertility status.
TI  - The joint effect of vaginal Ureaplasma urealyticum and bacterial vaginosis on adverse pregnancy outcomes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine associations of vaginal Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU) and bacterial vaginosis (BV) with preterm delivery (PTD), small for gestational age (SGA), and low birth weight (LBW). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A population-based, prospective cohort study of 2,927 pregnancies. After exclusion of multiples and antibiotic use sample size was 2,662. BV (Amsel's criteria) and UU (culture) were assessed in week 17. Gestational age was determined by last menstrual period, confirmed by ultrasound measurement in 97.5%. SGA infants were calculated from intrauterine fetal growth measurements. RESULTS: There was no increased risk for spontaneous PTD among women with BV only (crude odds ratio 1.0, 95% CI 0.4-2.7), among women with UU only (1.3, 0.8-2.0), nor among women with UU + BV (0.9, 0.4-2.3) compared to women without UU and BV. However, there was a threefold increased risk of a LBW birth in women with UU + BV (3.1, 1.8-5.4), a twofold risk of a LBW birth among women with UU only (1.9, 1.3-2.9), but no increased risk among women with BV only (0.8, 0.3-2.2). Similarly, women with UU + BV had over a twofold increased risk of an SGA birth (2.3, 1.3-4.0), women with UU only had a 70% increase (1.7, 1.1-2.5), whereas a nonsignificant increase was found in women with BV only (1.3, 0.6-2.9). Adjustment by established confounders (smoking, previous PTD, previous LBW, and Escherichia coli) did not affect risk estimates. CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests that UU is independently associated with fetal growth and LBW and that BV with UU may enhance the risk of these outcomes.
TI  - Value of counting white blood cells (WBC) in semen samples to predict the presence of bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the correlation between the presence of white blood cells (WBC) without the use of specific stain to differentiate leukocytes and the presence of bacteria in semen samples of infertile men. METHODS: A total of 143 semen samples of men who attended an andrologic clinic for the evaluation of fertility were investigated using routine semen analysis (according to WHO laboratory guidelines) and bacterial culture. RESULTS: WBC were found in 43.4% (62/143). There were no WBC in 56.6% (81/143) of the samples (group I) while WBC were found in 43.4% (62/143) of the samples (group II). Pathogenic bacteria were detected in 48.2% (39/81) in group I and in 54.9% (34/62) in group II, all in all Bacteriospermia was present in 51.1% (73/143). The most common bacteria were Ureaplasma urealyticum, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli (23.8%, 16.8%, and 7.0% of samples, respectively). The sensitivity/specificity for detecting bacteria was 0.47/0.60 at a cut-off level of 0.25 Mio/mL WBC and 0.16/0.84 at a cut-off level of WBC 1 Mio/mL, representing likelihood ratios of 1.16 and 1.04, respectively. The greatest ratio between sensitivity and specificity (0.37/0.72) was found at a cut-off level of 0.5 Mio/mL WBC, with a likelihood ratio of 1.29. CONCLUSIONS: Counting WBC instead of a specific stain for the detection of leukocytes has only a poor sensitivity/specificity for the detection of bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial flora of the low male genital tract in patients consulting for infertility.
AB  - The physiological aerobic bacterial flora of the low male genital tract was determined. This prospective study was performed on 600 semen specimens collected from 543 asymptomatic males consulting for infertility. Semen cultures were sterile in 28.8%, with a polymicrobial flora and/or absence or low titres of Ureaplasma urealyticum in 49.3%, and with one or two aerobic and facultative bacteria > or =1 x 10(3) CFU ml(-1) and/or U. urealyticum with titres > or =10(4) CCU ml(-1) (colour changing units) in 21.8%. In standard aerobic cultures, Gardnerella vaginalis was the most commonly isolated species (26.1%), followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (15.7%) and Streptococcus anginosus (14.2%). Ureaplasma urealyticum was absent in 84.5% of semen samples, but when recovered, high (> or =10(4) CCU ml(-1)) and low titres (< or =10(3) CCU ml(-1)) were counted in 7.2% and 8.3% respectively. Of 48 patients, the follow-up of semen cultures showed marked variations in time. This study shows that (i) there was no relationship between the bacterial flora and the leucocytospermia; (ii) low titres of U. urealyticum in semen were not associated with a disturbance of the ecosystem; (iii) the critical threshold for U. urealyticum should be raised to > or =10(4) CFU ml(-1) and (iv) a positive semen culture should be repeated before any treatment.
TI  - Bacterial infection and semen quality.
AB  - We have analyzed two infertile male cohorts with (n=39) and without genital tract infection (n=14) comparing their selected seminological parameters with healthy controls (n=30). Genital tract infection (GTI) has been defined by the presence of leukocytes and pathological bacterial strains identified with Bio-Merieux tests. We have found statistically significant deteriorated semen volume, sperm concentration, motility, morphology and vitality in ejaculated samples of patients with genital tract infection in comparison to healthy controls. Statistically significant negative influence towards sperm reproductive potential has been revealed in case of Escherichia coli, Ureaplasma urealyticum and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - A cluster analysis of bacterial vaginosis-associated microflora and pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  - Controversy surrounds the association between bacterial vaginosis (BV) and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Women (N = 1,140) were ascertained at five US centers, enrolled (1999-2001), and followed up for a median of 3 years. Serial vaginal swabs were obtained for Gram's stain and cultures. PID was defined as 1) histologic endometritis or 2) pelvic pain and tenderness plus oral temperature >38.8 degrees C, leukorrhea or mucopus, erythrocyte sedimentation rate >15 mm/hour, white blood cell count >10,000, or gonococcal/chlamydial lower genital infection. Exploratory factor analysis identified two discrete clusters of genital microorganisms. The first correlated with BV by Gram's stain and consisted of the absence of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, anaerobic gram-negative rods, and, to a lesser degree, Ureaplasma urealyticum. The second, unrelated to BV by Gram's stain, consisted of Enterococcus species and Escherichia coli. Being in the highest tertile in terms of growth of BV-associated microorganisms increased PID risk (adjusted rate ratio = 2.03, 95% confidence interval: 1.16, 3.53). Carriage of non-BV-associated microorganisms did not increase PID risk. Women with heavy growth of BV-associated microorganisms and a new sexual partner appeared to be at particularly high risk (adjusted rate ratio = 8.77, 95% confidence interval: 1.11, 69.2). When identified by microbial culture, a combination of BV-related microorganisms significantly elevated the risk of acquiring PID.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of three beta-defensins from canine testes.
AB  - Mammalian beta-defensins are small cationic peptides possessing broad antimicrobial and physiological activities. Because dogs are particularly resilient to sexually transmitted diseases, it has been proposed that their antimicrobial peptide repertoire might provide insight into novel antimicrobial therapeutics and treatment regimens. To investigate this proposal, we cloned the full-length cDNA of three canine beta-defensin isoforms (cBD-1, -2, and -3) from canine testicular tissues. Their predicted peptides share identical N-terminal 65-amino-acid residues, including the beta-defensin consensus six-cysteine motif. The two longer isoforms, cBD-2 and -3, possess 4 and 34 additional amino acids, respectively, at the C terminus. To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of cBD, a 34-amino-acid peptide derived from the shared mature peptide region was synthesized. Canine beta-defensin displayed broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus; MICs of 6 and 100 mug/ml, respectively), gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; MICs of 20 to 50, 20, and 50 mug/ml, respectively), and yeast (Candida albicans; MIC of 5 to 50 mug/ml) and lower activity against Ureaplasma urealyticum and U. canigenitalium (MIC of 200 mug/ml). Antimicrobial potency was significantly reduced at salt concentrations higher than 140 mM. All three canine beta-defensins were highly expressed in testis. In situ hybridization indicated that cBD-1 was expressed primarily in Sertoli cells within the seminiferous tubules. In contrast, cBD-2 was located primarily within Leydig cells. The longest isoform, cBD-3, was detected in Sertoli cells and to a lesser extent in the interstitium. The tissue-specific expression and broad antimicrobial activity suggest that canine beta-defensins play an important role in host defense and other physiological functions of the male reproductive system.
TI  - Amniotic cavity cultures, blood cultures, and surface swabs in preterm infants--useful tools for the management of early-onset sepsis?
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the potential benefit of amniotic fluid and amniotic/placental  membrane cultures for the management of early-onset sepsis in preterm infants. METHODS: The results of amniotic cavity cultures obtained during cesarean section and of peripheral blood cultures and surface swabs obtained from the preterm infant at the time of admission were analyzed with respect to the diagnosis of clinical sepsis in 221 preterm infants <34 weeks of gestation. RESULTS: 136 (61.5%) patients had negative amniotic cavity culture results or growth of contaminants, 56 (25.3%) had growth of Ureaplasma urealyticum, and 29 (13.1%) of other pathogens. The corresponding numbers for surface swabs were 82.8%, 11.6%, and 5.6%. A positive blood culture was found in only two neonates. Fifty-four patients (24.4%) had clinical early-onset sepsis. Patients with amniotic cavity culture results that were positive for other pathogens were significantly more likely to experience clinical sepsis than patients with negative culture results (51.7% vs 15.1%, OR 6.1, p<0.0001). Regarding surface swabs, this correlation did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: The strong association between positive amniotic cavity culture results and clinical early-onset sepsis supports the existence of a causal relation and provides evidence for the potential value of amniotic and/or placental membrane sampling in the management of early-onset sepsis in preterm infants. Surface swabs add no additional information and hence should not be performed routinely.
TI  - Bacterial risk and sperm cryopreservation.
AB  - Prior to sperm cryopreservation, French guidelines only recommend viral screening for serological status towards human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C viruses and Treponema palidum. The probability of semen infection by other bacterial pathogens is not taken into consideration by the current recommendations. The objective of the present study was to evaluate this risk and a strategy to reduce it prospectively. Ninety-six patients consulting for sperm cryopreservation underwent a semen culture simultaneously to cryopreservation. The patients were classified into three groups following semen culture results: negative culture (group 1, 77/96, 80.2%), positive culture with saprophytic agents (group 2, 9/96, 9.4%) and positive culture with pathogen agents (group 3, 10/96, 10.4%). For six patients of the latter group showing a genital infection with Ureaplasma urealyticum, a discontinuous gradient selection performed on the cryopreserved sample was efficient to discard bacteria. These data emphasize the usefulness to cultivate semen simultaneously to cryopreservation and demonstrate the ability to remove some microbial agents from semen before its use in assisted reproductive techniques.
TI  - The role of unusual pathogens in prostatitis syndrome.
AB  - A total of 1442 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis were examined over  a 4-year period at the Outpatient Department for Urogenital Infections, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljevic", Zagreb, Croatia. An infectious aetiology was determined in 1070 (74.2%) patients. In 561 of 1070 (52.4%) patients the inflammatory finding (>10 WBC/hpf) was found in expressed prostatic secretions (EPS) or voided bladder urine (VB(3)). Normal, <10 WBCs/hpf was found in 362 of 536 (67.5%) patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis in whom Chlamydia trachomatis was detected in EPS or VB(3), in 51 of 151 (33.8%) patients with isolated Trichomonas vaginalis and in 40 of 72 (55.6%) patients with isolated Ureaplasma urealyticum. Escherichia coli was the causative pathogen in 95, Enterococcus in 68, Proteus mirabilis in 37, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 16, Streptococcus agalactiae in 19, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 3 patients with chronic prostatitis. Other patients had a mixed infection. In patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) caused by E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae, E. or S. agalactiae, an inflammatory finding was regularly found in EPS or VB(3).
TI  - [Abnormal bacterial colonisation of the vagina and implantation during assisted reproduction].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficiency of our treatment of vaginal infection for couples included in an IVF program. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Microbiologic screening of vaginal flora and semen has been performed one month prior to in vitro fertilization for 951 couples in 2000. Antibiotic treatment was prescribed in case of positive culture. RESULTS: Positive microbial growths were observed from endocervical and vaginal cultures in 218 women (22.9%). The clinical pregnancy rate was 30.29% in the group of patients without growth and 30.27% in the group with positive microbial growth. The implantation rate was significantly diminished in case of bacterial growth: 14.6 compared to 19.3% (P <0.02) for sterile endocervical culture. Five main bacterial species were found at the cervical level: Candida albicans (69 cases), Ureaplasma urealyticum (49 cases), Gardnerella vaginalis (43 cases), Streptococcus B or D (24 cases) and Escherichia coli (22 cases). Positive cultures from both vagina and semen were observed for 77 couples whose clinical pregnancy rate was 19.5 vs 36.2% in case of vaginal infection alone (P <0.01) with a spontaneous miscarriage rate of 46.7 compared to 17.6% (P <0.01). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Endocervical microorganisms, even treated with adapted antibiotics, may affect embryonic implantation. Positive culture from both female and male partner may enhance this negative effect. In this case, the best strategy would be to cancel the IVF treatment.
TI  - Cervical immunoglobulin A and altered vaginal flora in pregnant women with threatened preterm delivery.
AB  - The aim of our study was to investigate the cervical immunoglobulin A concentration in women with threatened preterm delivery. Immunoglobulin A concentration in the cervical mucus of 80 women with symptoms of preterm delivery was measured using radial immunodiffusion. The results were compared with those of 60 healthy pregnant women. Concentrations of immunoglobulins in maternal serum were also measured. There was no significant difference of cervical immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentration between women with threatened preterm delivery and controls: 53.98 (0.0-189.7) mg/l vs. 61.7 (1.4-400.9; p<0.4) mg/l (median, range). The median of cervical IgA levels in the group of threatened preterm delivery did not differ significantly between patients delivered preterm (n=34) or at term (n=46): 38.3 (0.0-187.9) vs. 65.7 (1.4-189.7; p<0.2) mg/l. Women with a normal vaginal flora showed a significantly higher cervical IgA concentration than those with a pathological colonization: 72.7 (0.0-187.9) vs. 42.5 (0.0-189.7) mg/l. Patients with a pathological vaginal smear and preterm delivery had the lowest IgA levels (35.0; 0.0-187.9 mg/l). Measurement of cervical IgA concentration does not differentiate between women who deliver before or at term.
TI  - Molecular characterization of thymidine kinase from Ureaplasma urealyticum: nucleoside analogues as potent inhibitors of mycoplasma growth.
AB  - Ureaplasma urealyticum (U. urealyticum), belonging to the class Mollicutes, is a  human pathogen colonizing the urogenital tract and causes among other things respiratory diseases in premature infants. We have studied the salvage of pyrimidine deoxynucleosides in U. urealyticum and cloned a key salvage enzyme, thymidine kinase (TK) from U. urealyticum. Recombinant Uu-TK was expressed in E. coli, purified and characterized with regards to substrate specificity and feedback inhibition. Uu-TK efficiently phosphorylated thymidine (dThd) and deoxyuridine (dUrd) as well as a number of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues. All natural ribonucleoside/deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, except dTTP, served as phosphate donors, while dTTP was a feedback inhibitor. The level of Uu-TK activity in U. urealyticum extracts increased upon addition of dUrd to the growth medium. Fluoropyrimidine nucleosides inhibited U. urealyticum and M. pneumoniae growth and this inhibitory effect could be reversed by addition of dThd, dUrd or deoxytetrahydrouridine to the growth medium. Thus, the mechanism of inhibition was most likely the depletion of dTTP, either via a blocked thymidine kinase reaction and/or thymidylate synthesis step and these metabolic reactions should be suitable targets for antimycoplasma chemotherapy.
TI  - The infectious origins of stillbirth.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the relationship between various types  of perinatal infections and stillbirths. STUDY DESIGN: By use of various textbooks on perinatal infections, multiple MEDLINE searches, and the reference list of all appropriate manuscripts, the appropriate English language literature was reviewed to define the relationship between various perinatal infections and stillbirths. RESULTS: Infection may cause stillbirth by a number of mechanisms, including direct infection, placental damage, and severe maternal illness. A large variety of organisms have been associated with stillbirth, including many bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. In developed countries, between 10% and 25% of stillbirths may be caused by an infection, whereas in developing countries, which often have much higher stillbirth rates, the contribution of infection is much greater. Ascending bacterial infection, both before and after membrane rupture, with organisms such as Escherichia coli, group B streptococci, and Ureaplasma urealyticum is usually the most common infectious cause of stillbirth. However, in areas where syphilis is very prevalent, up to half of all stillbirths may be caused by this infection alone. Malaria may be an important cause of stillbirth in women infected for the first time in pregnancy. The two most important viral causes of stillbirth are parvovirus and Coxsackie virus, although a number of other viral infections appear to be causal. Toxoplasma gondii, leptospirosis, Listeria monocytogenes, and the organisms that cause leptospirosis, Q fever, and Lyme disease have all been implicated as etiologic for stillbirth. CONCLUSION: Because infection-related stillbirth is relatively rare in developed countries, and those that do occur are caused by a wide variety of organisms, reducing this etiologic component of stillbirth much further will be difficult. However, in certain developing countries, the stillbirth rate is so high and the infection-related component so great that achieving a substantial reduction in stillbirth should be possible simply by reducing maternal infections.
TI  - Role of genital mycoplasmata and other bacteria in urolithiasis.
AB  - Urease-producing bacteria have been shown to affect the formation of infection stones by splitting urea into ammonia, bicarbonate and carbonate. An increase in alkaline pH results in urinary supersaturation of the ions. The increase in ammonia also causes injury to the urothelial glycosaminoglycan layer. Non-urease-producing bacteria have been speculated to form urinary stones. Midstream voided bladder urine and fractured stone nidus samples from 72 patients undergoing surgery for urolithiasis were cultured on specific media for genital mycoplasmata and on conventional media. Urine samples were obtained from a control group of 40 healthy subjects. Genital mycoplasmata and other bacteria were evaluated with regard to the composition of urinary stones. Compared with other origins of stones, the relation between isolation of Ureaplasma urealyticum and infection stone disease was statistically proven. Isolation of genital mycoplasmata was significantly higher in women than in men in the study group. The urinary stones comprised 84.7% calcium stones, 8.3% uric acid stones and 6.9% infection (magnesium ammonium phosphate) stones. Coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium spp., Enterobacterium spp. and U. urealyticum were cultured from stone samples. The results suggests that non-urease-producing bacteria, as well as urease-producing bacteria, may influence the formation of urinary stones.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence-based multitarget identification.
AB  - MULTIGEN technology (T. Vinayagamoorthy, U.S. patent 6,197,510, March 2001) is a  modification of conventional sequencing technology that generates a single electropherogram consisting of short nucleotide sequences from a mixture of known DNA targets. The target sequences may be present on the same or different nucleic acid molecules. For example, when two DNA targets are sequenced, the first and second sequencing primers are annealed to their respective target sequences, and then a polymerase causes chain extension by the addition of new deoxyribose nucleotides. Since the electrophoretic separation depends on the relative molecular weights of the truncated molecules, the molecular weight of the second sequencing primer was specifically designed to be higher than the combined molecular weight of the first sequencing primer plus the molecular weight of the largest truncated molecule generated from the first target sequence. Thus, the series of truncated molecules produced by the second sequencing primer will have higher molecular weights than those produced by the first sequencing primer. Hence, the truncated molecules produced by these two sequencing primers can be effectively separated in a single lane by standard gel electrophoresis in a single electropherogram without any overlapping of the nucleotide sequences. By using sequencing primers with progressively higher molecular weights, multiple short DNA sequences from a variety of targets can be determined simultaneously. We describe here the basic concept of MULTIGEN technology and three applications: detection of sexually transmitted pathogens (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum), detection of contaminants in meat samples (coliforms, fecal coliforms, and Escherichia coli O157:H7), and detection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the human N-acetyltransferase (NAT1) gene (S. Fronhoffs et al., Carcinogenesis 22:1405-1412, 2001).
TI  - [Role of bacteria associated with sexually transmitted infections in the etiology of lower urinary tract infection in primary care].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infections (UTI) are the second most frequent type of infectious pathology treated in primary care clinics. The participation of microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted infection has been reported as a cause of UTI; nevertheless this concept is still controversial. To gather data on this subject, we carried out a search for Gardnerella vaginalis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis and Streptococcus agalactiae besides the common microorganisms involved in UTI. METHODS: A total of 1507 urine cultures from patients with a clinical diagnosis of low UTI were analyzed. Samples were inoculated onto 5% sheep blood agar and McConkey agar, as well as HBT medium for G. vaginalis, and U9B broth and agar E broth for M. hominis and U. urealyticum. The following parameters were analyzed as possible risk factors: age, sex, pregnancy and diabetes status. RESULTS. There were 436 (28.9%) positive urine cultures. Escherichia coli was isolated in 44.34% of cases. Microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted disease were found in 162 (37%): G. vaginalis (25.7%), U. urealyticum (5.9%), S. agalactiae (3.4%) and M. hominis (2%). UTI were more frequent among the 20 to 40 year-old age group, in women and in diabetic patients. CONCLUSIONS: Microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted disease were found in a large percentage of cultures, indicating the need for studies to clarify their role in the etiology of UTI.
TI  - Vaginal bacterial flora activates rat peritoneal mast cells.
AB  - Sixteen strains of physiological and pathological vaginal bacteria were tested for their ability to secrete histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. We noticed that Mycoplasma hominis-induced histamine release was very high (up to 53.6%). The stimulation of rat mast cells with Staphylococccus cohnii, Staphylococcus coagulase(-) (two strains), Ureaplasma urealyticum, Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides capillosus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae resulted in lower but significant histamine secretion (11.2%-17.5%). Other bacteria strains (Staphylococcus epidermidids, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Actinomyces naeslundii (two strains) and Lactobacillus fermentum (two strains) caused very low (4.2% - 8.8%) histamine release.
TI  - Aetiology of chronic prostatitis.
AB  - A total of 388 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis and inflammatory findings in expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) or in a urine sample collected immediately after prostate massage, were examined over a 2 year period at the Outpatient Department for Urogenital Infections, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases 'Dr Fran Mihaljevic', Zagreb, Croatia. The infective aetiology was determined in 276 (71.13%) patients. Chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 109 patients, Trichomonas vaginalis in 52, Escherichia coli in 26, enterococci in 25, Proteus mirabilis in 14, Klebsiella pneumoniae in six, Streptococcus agalactiae in eight, Ureaplasma urealyticum in seven patients with chronic prostatitis. Other patients had a mixed infection.
TI  - [Cervicovaginal infection as a risk factor for premature labor].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the possible association between cervicovaginal infections (CVI) and preterm delivery. DESIGN: Cohorts. REFERENCE FRAME: Instituto Nacional de Perinatologia, Hospital Central Militar and Hospital General Regional No. 1, IMSS, Culiacan, Sinaloa, Mexico. PATIENTS: Four hundred and sixty eight patients attending prenatal control and delivery care. INTERVENTIONS: Fresh smears, Gram stain, and cervicovaginal sample culture from samples obtained during the following gestational stages: First sample at 16-24 weeks, second sample at 25-32 weeks, and third sample at 33-42 weeks. The following microorganisms were studied: Candida albicans, Gardnerella vaginalis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Streptococcus agalactiae, Mycoplasma hominis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Chlamydia trachomatis. In case of a positive culture, the specific treatment was indicated. MEASUREMENTS: Positive or negative culture for each of the studied pathogens, and the presence or absence of a preterm delivery for each of the patients included in the study. RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety eight were still present at the end of the study, of which 156 had a CVI and 242 had no CVI. No differences between both groups were observed concerning preterm delivery. Significant relative risks were: In the first stage, Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis with RR = 9.0 (6.81, 11.8); in the second stage, Ureaplasma urealyticum with RR = 6.2 (3.30, 11.7) and Escherichia coli with RR = 3.4 (1.33, 8.6); in the third stage, Ureaplasma urealyticum with RR = 9.19 (6.93, 12.1). The logistic regression analysis identified Ureaplasma urealyticum during the second stage with OR = 16.6 (2.9, 93.7), statistically significant with p = 0.001. The survival analysis showed differences between the two groups concerning pregnancy duration (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There is a difference in the duration in pregnancy in patients with CVI and without CVI. Ureaplasma urealyticum is consistently associated with preterm delivery.
TI  - [Genital infection and infertility].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genital infection is the most important cause of infertility worldwide, affecting not only Fallopian tubes but all anatomic urogenital sites, both male and female. METHODS: We present a randomized,prospective and normalized study about sexually transmitted diseases(STD). We include 487 patients, 376 of whom were infertile and the remaining 111 were not and act as control group. RESULTS: 47.3% of infertile patients showed at least one infection: 10.7% had Chlamydia trachomatis infection, whereas only 0.3% had gonococal infection. We found none syphilis. 12.9% of the patients showed yeast belonging to genus Candida, 5% bacterial vaginosis, 3.8% Escherichia coli and 0.3% Klebsiella pneumoniae. The percentage of isolation of Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis were 23.5% and 4.8%, respectively. We detected antibodies against Hepatitis B (any serological marker) in 7.8% of the cases. Chlamydial infection and the presence of U. urealyticum were related with infertility (X 12=6,070, p<0.005 and X12=8,782, p<0.005,respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We think these results conclude that is necessary to perform routine tests to screen for C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and for infections caused by micoplasma as well, among infertile patients. These patients must be considered of being at risk of acquiring STD, since the percentage of these diseases is higher than the percentage we found among the control group. It is important to insist on prevention and early diagnosis and treatment as a main goal to decrease the number of tubal occlusion and infertile couples.
TI  - Nonspecific aerobic vaginitis and pregnancy.
AB  - During the period 1996-1998, cervical swabs of 50 pregnant women with subacute amniotic infection syndrome (AIS) and the semen of their consorts were bacteriologically analyzed. In the control group were 50 healthy pregnant women and their consorts too. Pathogenic bacteria (the most common were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Chlamydia trachomatis and Ureaplasma urealyticum) were isolated from the cervical swab of 50 pregnant patients with AIS in 86.0% of them, while in the control group of healthy pregnant women in 28.0%. Pathogenic bacteria were present in 70.0% of semen of consorts pregnant women with AIS and only in 30.0% of semen of the control group. The congruity of pathogenic bacteria in the cervical swab and semen in the investigated group was 69.2%, while only 35.7% in the control group. Following erythromycin, cefuroxime and local tetracyclin treatment, the negativization of the cervical swab resulted in 30 pregnant patients with AIS, while the colonization persisted in 20 of them. The outcome of pregnancy was significantly better in cases with negativization of the cervical swab: perinatal loss was 6.7%, while in cases with persistent infection it was 55.0%. The authors presume the amniotic infection syndrome should be ascending manifestation of nonspecific vaginitis, which is maintained by the consort's urogenital infection. AIS should be classified as a 'sexually-transmitted disease'.
TI  - rho is not essential for viability or virulence in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - We have identified the gene for transcription termination factor Rho in Staphylococcus aureus. Deletion of rho in S. aureus reveals that it is not essential for viability or virulence. We also searched the available bacterial genomic sequences for homologs of Rho and found that it is broadly distributed and highly conserved. Exceptions include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803, all of which appear not to possess a Rho homolog. Complementation studies indicate that S. aureus Rho possesses the same activity as Escherichia coli Rho and that the Rho inhibitor bicyclomycin is active against S. aureus Rho. Our results explain the lack of activity of bicyclomycin against many gram-positive bacteria and raise the possibility that the essentiality of rho may be the exception rather than the rule.
TI  - Detection of cervical immunoglobulin A in normal pregnancy.
AB  - The aim of our study was to evaluate a feasible method to quantify the immunoglobulin A concentration in the cervical mucus of women with a normal singleton pregnancy. In 60 immunologic healthy pregnant women cervical mucus samples were taken at a random time in pregnancy using an absorbing cylindrical cotton-swab stick. In this cervical mucus immunoglobulin A concentration was measured by radial immunodiffusion. A vaginal bacterial swab was taken from each woman. Concentration of immunoglobulins in maternal serum was estimated. There was no statistically significant difference of cervical immunoglobulin A concentration between the investigated groups (p = 0.952): 18-24 gestational weeks (gw): 52.8 (6.6-258.4) mg/l; 25-29 gw: 89.3 (4.8-193.8) mg/l; 30-34 gw: 55 (1.4-326) mg/l; 35-40 gw: 59.2 (4-400.9) mg/l. Women with a normal vaginal flora showed a significantly higher cervical immunoglobulin A concentration than those with a pathological colonization: 92.2 (6.6-400.9) mg/l vs. 42.5 (1.4-326) mg/l (p < 0.05). The serum levels of immunoglobulins A, A1, A2, M and G do not correlate to cervical immunoglobulin A levels nor to gestational age. In normal pregnancy, cervical immunoglobulin A concentration does not change with advancing gestational age, but a pathological vaginal colonization seems to be associated with decreased immunoglobulin A levels.
TI  - Intrauterine infection and spontaneous midgestation abortion: is the spectrum of  microorganisms similar to that in preterm labor?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether microorganisms associated with intrauterine infection and preterm labor play a contributing role in midgestation abortion. METHODS: A 4 year retrospective review of spontaneous midgestation abortions for which autopsy and microbiological cultures of placental and fetal tissue were performed was conducted for a tertiary obstetrics hospital, which included a regional referral service for perinatal and fetal pathology. One hundred twenty-nine spontaneously delivered, nonmacerated, midgestation fetuses or stillbirths (of between 16 and 26 weeks' gestation) and placentas were examined and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, yeasts, and genital mycoplasmas. RESULTS: Microorganisms were recovered in 85 (66%) cases (57% placentas, 49% fetuses). Among the culture positive cases, 81% had histological chorioamnionitis, 28% fetal pneumonitis, 38% clinical signs of infection, and 62% ruptured membranes at the time of miscarriage. These differed significantly from culture-negative cases (44%, 5%, 13%, and 34%, respectively). Group B streptococcus (GBS) was the most significant pathogen, recovered in 21 cases, 13 as the sole isolate, 94% with chorioamnionitis, and 47% in women with intact membranes. Escherichia coli and Ureaplasma urealyticum (22 and 24 cases, respectively) occurred mostly as mixed infections, with ruptured membranes. GBS, MU urealyticum, and Streptococcus anginosus group were individually associated with chorioamnionitis, Bacteroides/Prevotella and S. anginosus with fetal pneumonitis. The spectrum of microorganisms was similar to that in preterm labor at later gestations; however, GBS appeared to be the most significant pathogen in midgestation miscarriage, especially with intact membranes. CONCLUSIONS: Unsuspected intrauterine infection underlies many spontaneous midgestation abortions. GBS is a key pathogen in this setting.
TI  - [Microorganisms isolated in cases of pertussis-like syndrome].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the etiologic study of the pertussis-like syndrome, not only as far as Bordetella genus is concerned but also regarding the causative role of other microorganisms for a 11-year period (1988-1998). METHODS: In all specimens from patients suffering from pertussis-like cough the presence of Bordetella spp., other bacteria, viruses, and mycoplasma was investigated. The analysed data included microbiological findings and epidemiologic issues (age, sex, hospital admission area, yearly distribution and seasonal period). RESULTS: A total of 1,063 specimens were investigated, most of them nasopharyngeal aspirates (910), corresponding to 905 patients; a positive culture was obtained form 56.9 of these patients. B. pertussis was isolated from 10.5% of patients. As for other bacteria, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were also isolated, in 16.9% and 15.8% of occasions, respectively. The respiratory syncitial virus was isolated from 10.7% of patients and other viruses in 9.4%. Among mycoplasma, Ureaplasma urealyticum predominated, with a recovery rate of 2.9%. The male/female ratio was 495/410; the ages of 67.2% of patients ranged from 0 to 6 months; a total of 689 (76.1%) required hospital admission. The recovery of B. pertussis and adenoviruses predominated during spring and summer months. In contrast, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and respiratory syncitial virus were recovered more frequently during winter months. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with pertussis-like syndrome are children aged less than 6 months. The recovery percentages of B. pertussis and respiratory syncitial virus are identical and therefore we think that the investigation of their presence in this syndrome is fully warranted as well as the search for other microorganisms, since clinical symptoms are commonly non-specific among infants.
TI  - Symptomatic bacteriuria due to Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma in adults.
AB  - 314 women, and 52 men were screened during 18 months, for the presence of Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis in a midstream specimens of urine. All the patients were adults with symptoms of urinary tract infection who consulted a physician at a Primary Health Center "Jose Castro Villagrana" in Tlalpan, D.F. Mexico. Ureaplasma urealyticum was isolated in 54 (17.1%) of the women and 8 (15.4%) of the men. Only Escherichia coli and Gardnerella vaginalis were isolated more frequently in both groups, 36.6% and 25.4%, respectively in women and 58.5% and 30.8% in men Mycoplasma hominis was isolated in 12 (3.8%) in women and 4 (7.7%) in men. The bacteriuria due to fastidious bacteria or Ureaplasmas that is not detected by routine culture methods are relatively common and would not necessarily respond to antibiotic treatment for conventional urinary tract pathogens.
TI  - Association of oligohydramnios in women with preterm premature rupture of membranes with an inflammatory response in fetal, amniotic, and maternal compartments.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to examine whether oligohydramnios in women  with preterm premature rupture of membranes is associated with evidence of fetal, amniotic, and maternal inflammatory responses. STUDY DESIGN: Amniotic fluid index was measured before the performance of amniocentesis in patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes. Fifty-nine patients who were delivered of preterm neonates (gestational age </=35 weeks) within 3 days of amniocentesis were included in this study. Amniotic fluid was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and for genital mycoplasmas. The intensity of the inflammatory response was evaluated by the following: presence of clinical and histologic chorioamnionitis; amniotic fluid concentrations of interleukin 6, interleukin 1beta, and tumor necrosis factor alpha; amniotic fluid white blood cell count; and interleukin 6 concentrations in umbilical cord plasma at birth. Proinflammatory cytokines were measured with specific and sensitive immunoassays. RESULTS: Thirty-two percent (19/59) of patients had an amniotic fluid index </=5 cm. Patients with an amniotic fluid index </=5 cm had significantly higher rates of positive amniotic fluid culture results and clinical and histologic chorioamnionitis; higher median amniotic fluid concentrations of interleukin 6, interleukin 1beta, and tumor necrosis factor alpha; and higher median cord plasma concentrations of interleukin 6 than did those with an amniotic fluid index >5 cm (positive amniotic fluid culture result, 79% [15/19] vs 30% [12/40]; clinical chorioamnionitis, 37% [7/19] vs 5% [2/40]; histologic chorioamnionitis, 100% [17/17] vs 69% [24/35]; median amniotic fluid interleukin 6 concentration, 13.5 ng/mL; range, 0.2-142.2 ng/mL vs 3.0 ng/mL and 0.001-115.2 ng/mL; median amniotic fluid interleukin 1beta concentration, 348.0 pg/mL; range, 0.7->80, 000 pg/mL vs 36.6 pg/mL and 0-2075 pg/mL; median amniotic fluid tumor necrosis factor alpha concentration, 132.0 pg/mL; range, 0-1600 pg/mL vs 11.2 pg/mL and 0-1305 pg/mL; median cord plasma interleukin 6 concentration, 49.7 pg/mL; range, 4.4-7400 pg/mL vs 9. 1 pg/mL and 0-5211 pg/mL; P <.05 for each). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups of patients in the mean umbilical artery pH at birth. CONCLUSION: Oligohydramnios in women with preterm premature rupture of membranes is associated with an inflammatory response in the fetal, amniotic, and maternal compartments.
TI  - [Pathogen spectrum of urethritis in the man].
AB  - 545 male patients with a tentative diagnosis "urethritis" were examined between November 1984 and December 1994 in the Department of Dermatology and Venerology of the Military Hospital in Ulm. The patients, aged from 18 to 58 years (mean age 24.1 years), were examined according to a standardized diagnostic procedure: Smear preparations from the urethra with subsequent gram staining, bacterial cultures for aerobic bacteria, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (cultures and Phadebact gonococcus test), mycoplasma cultures (Mycoplasma hominis (M. hom.); Ureaplasma urealyticum (U. u), and Chlamydia trachomatis using several methods, primarily DIFT (Syva Micro-Trak). Trichomonas vaginalis counts in urine sediment 441 patients (81%) had 4 or more leukocytes per high-power (x1000) field in the gram stained specimens. In these 441 urethritis-patients the following germs could be detected: Trichomonas vagin 3 (1%), N. gonorrhoeae 80 (18%), Mycoplasma 94 (21%) [U. u. 59, M. hom. 24, both 11], C. trachomatis 114 (26%), other pathogenic bacteria 135 (31%). In 114 patients (26%) no bacteria could be identified. A single infection was diagnosed in a total of 242 patients (55%), a double infection was determined in 71 patients (16%) while a triple infection was found in 14 patients (3%). The spectrum determined in the single infection included the following: N. gonorrhoeae 41 (9%), Mycoplasma 45 (10%), C. trachomatis 67 (15%), other pathogenic bacteria 89 (20%) (most frequently found germs were Enterococcus, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Staph. aureus). In the double infections combinations with aerobic bacteria dominated. In triple infections, mycoplasma were most common. During the investigation period the number of patients with urethritis symptoms declined at a constant rate.
TI  - Influence of urogenital infections on sperm functions.
AB  - Many studies have examined the impact of genital tract infections on male fertility; however, the effect of bacteriospermia on sperm quality is still controversial. Bacterial infections are more frequently found in semen samples from asymptomatic infertile patients than in those from fertile men. Bacteriospermia is also a common problem of male partners from couples undergoing IVF. Therefore, the effects of microorganisms on human sperm acrosome reaction of oocytes have been studied in vitro and in vivo. Incubation of spermatozoa with Escherichia coli or Mycoplasma hominis in vitro resulted in reduced sperm motility and inducibility of acrosome reaction (delta AR) after exposure to calcium ionophore A23187. To show possible effects of E. coli and mycoplasma species on sperm functions in vivo, data from 488 patients were evaluated, in whose ejaculates microbiological examinations and determinations of acrosome reaction after exposure to low temperature had been performed. U. urealyticum and E. coli were found in semen samples from 52 and 31 men, respectively. M. hominis was only present in a minor number of samples and was not included in this study. Semen concentrations of E. coli and U. urealyticum ranged between 500-100,000 cfu x ml-1 and 100-80,000 cfu x ml-1. No correlation was found between delta AR and concentration of bacteria (Spearman rank correlation coefficient, E. coli: r-0.081, P = 0.6644; U. urealyticum: r = -0.081, P = 0.5698). In 69% of cases with U. urealyticum infection and reduced inducibility of acrosome reaction, this sperm function was normal after antibiotic therapy. However, improvement of acrosomal function may only be due to intra-individual variations of acrosome reaction. While E. coli and mycoplasma species affect sperm functions in vitro, the present data and a review of the literature fail to demonstrate similar effects in vivo.
TI  - Sequencing multimegabase-template DNA with BigDye terminator chemistry.
AB  - Using the recently introduced BigDye terminators, large-template DNA can be directly sequenced with custom primers on automated instruments. Cycle sequencing conditions are presented to sequence DNA samples isolated from a number of microbial genomes including 750-kb Ureaplasma urealyticum, 1.2-Mb Mycoplasma fermentans, 2.3-Mb Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 4.6-Mb Escherichia coli. Average read lengths of >700 bp from unique primer annealing sites are often sufficient to fill final gaps in microbial genome sequencing projects without additional manipulations of template DNA. The technique can also be applied to sequence-targeted regions, thereby bypassing tedious subcloning steps.
TI  - Bacterial and Ureaplasma colonization of the airway: radiologic findings in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We designed this retrospective study to compare radiologic findings in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in whom gram-positive cocci (GPC), gram-negative bacilli (GNB), or Ureaplasma urealyticum were colonized. Another objective was to correlate the radiologic findings of these patients with the clinical severity of BPD. STUDY DESIGN: We correlated serial tracheal aspirates with radiographic findings from 183 infants whose birth weight was < or = 1250 gm. BPD severity was assessed by oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age (36 w PCA) and at the time of discharge. Two radiologists independently scored films taken at birth and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days of life. RESULTS: Of the study population, 55% were male and 35% were black; 80% received surfactant and 69% received dexamethasone; 91% survived. GPC isolates from throat cultures were mainly Staphylococcus [corrected] epidermidis and Streptococcus haemolyticus. A superimposed GNB colonization was present in 37% of these infants. Most common isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Escherichia coli. Sepsis caused by GPC developed in 16% of all patients; 7% had sepsis caused by GNB. Infants infected with GNB remained receiving oxygen at 36 w PCA and at the time of discharge twice as often as those noninfected. RADIOLOGIC FINDINGS: Hyperinflation, interstitial changes, and generalized or localized emphysema were prominent features throughout. Mean radiologic scores increased over time in a pattern similar among GPC, GNB, and U. urealyticum infected and noninfected infants. High radiologic scores were not predictive at any time of infants who needed supplemental oxygen at 28 days and at 36 w PCA. Infants infected with U. urealyticum were neither clinically nor radiologically different than noncolonized neonates. CONCLUSION: GPC, GNB, and U. urealyticum airway colonization is not associated with particular radiographic changes at any time. GNB-infected infants had the most severe BPD course, and yet they were radiologically indistinguishable from the other patients. U. urealyticum colonization does not result in more clinically severe BPD or demonstrate a unique radiologic course.
TI  - In-vitro activity of trovafloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - Trovafloxacin (CP-99,219) was very active against Gram-negative species examined  including Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella spp., Neisseria spp. and Escherichia coli (MIC90s < or = 0.03 mg/L). In general trovafloxacin was twice as active as ofloxacin but only half as active as ciprofloxacin against Gram-negative species. Trovafloxacin was active against Gram-positive organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90s < or = 0.25 mg/L). Against these organisms activity was eight to 16 times greater for trovafloxacin than for either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. In addition, Chlamydia spp., Mycoplasma spp. and Ureaplasma urealyticum were eight to 16 times more susceptible to trovafloxacin than to either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. These in-vitro data show that trovafloxacin is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone with greater activity against clinically important Gram-positive species compared with ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin.
TI  - The effect of positive semen bacterial and Ureaplasma cultures on in-vitro fertilization success.
AB  - A total of 342 couples planning to undergo in-vitro fertilization (IVF) were examined for the presence of bacteria in semen prior to and during the procedure. Pregnancy rates were analysed retrospectively to ascertain any adverse affects if > 10000 colony forming units (CFU)/ml bacteria were detected in the semen sample. The most common bacteria isolated from semen were Enterococcus spp. (73%). The presence of these bacteria did not affect the pregnancy rate of the patients with positive cultures prior to (32%) or during (37%) the IVF procedure compared with those patients in whom no bacteria were detected (32%). Those patients with semen cultures positive for Escherichia coli prior to the IVF procedure, but which cleared after treatment had a higher pregnancy rate (60%) compared with those patients who were positive for E.coli at the time of the attempt. The group of patients with Staphylococcus aureus in the semen at the time of IVF also demonstrated a low pregnancy rate (17%). Of the patients. 36 (11%) had positive Ureaplasma cultures from the screening test carried out on the semen and 22% became pregnant after successful treatment. None of the three patients with persistently positive cultures became pregnant. In conclusion, the presence of Enterococcus in semen does not affect pregnancy rates following IVF. E.coli, S.aureus and Ureaplasma urealyticum may have a negative effect and should be treated.
TI  - Organization of Ureaplasma urealyticum urease gene cluster and expression in a suppressor strain of Escherichia coli.
AB  
TI  - [Microbial associations in Trichomonas urethritis].
AB  - The results on isolation of associated microflora from 190 patients suffering from Trichomonas urethritis are given. Microorganisms belonged to the species: Mycoplasma hominis. Ureaplasma urealyticum. Streptococcus pyogenes. Escherichia coli. Klebsiella pneumoniae. Proteus mirabilis. Moraxella lacunata. Acinetobacter Calcoaceticus and Candida. Staphylococcus cultures which were isolated from 100% patients belonged to 8 species: Staphylococcus aureus, S. intermedius, S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis, S. capitis, S. hominis, S. warneri, S. saprophyticus. Most of Staphylococcus cultures had pathogenic features. Structure of Trichomonas vaginalis and interaction between them and associated microflora were studied by electron microscopy.
TI  - Organization of Ureaplasma urealyticum urease gene cluster and expression in a suppressor strain of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Ureaplasma urealyticum is a pathogenic ureolytic mollicute which colonizes the urogenital tracts of humans. A genetic polymorphism between the two biotypes of U. urealyticum at the level of the urease genes was found. The urease gene cluster from a biotype 1 representative of U. urealyticum (serotype I) was cloned and sequenced. Seven genes were found, with ureA, ureB, and ureC encoding the structural subunits and ureE, ureF, ureG, and a truncated ureI) gene encoding accessory proteins. Urease expression was not obtained when the plasmid containing these genes was incorporated into an opal suppressor strain of Escherichia coli, although this enzymatic activity was found in the same E. coli strain transformed with pC6b, a plasmid with previously cloned urease genes from the U. urealyticum T960 strain of biotype 2 (serotype 8). Although there are 12 TGA triplets encoding tryptophan within urease genes, the level of expression obtained was comparable to the levels reported for other bacterial genes expressed in E. coli. Nested deletion experiments allowed us to demonstrate that ureD is necessary for urease activity whereas another open reading frame located downstream is not. The promoter for ureA and possibly other urease genes was identified for both serotypes.
TI  - Intra-uterine infection in women with preterm premature rupture of membranes: maternal and neonatal characteristics.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the prevalence of intra-uterine infection in patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes and to evaluate the clinical characteristics of women and neonates according to the presence or absence of intrauterine infection. STUDY DESIGN: Trans-abdominal amniocentesis was performed in 90 consecutive patients admitted with preterm premature rupture of membranes. Maternal clinical parameters evaluated included maternal age, origin, gravidity, parity, habitual abortion, previous perinatal death, previous preterm birth, urinary tract infection, fetal distress, abruptio placentae, gestational diabetes, admission-delivery interval and cesarean rate. Neonatal clinical parameters evaluated were gestational age at delivery, birth weight, Apgar score, neonatal gender, perinatal death and neonatal sepsis. RESULTS: The prevalence of intra-uterine infection was 66.6% (60/90). No differences between patients with intra-uterine infection and those without intra-uterine infection were observed in maternal age, origin, gravidity, parity, habitual abortion, previous perinatal death, fetal distress, abruptio placentae, gestational diabetes, admission-delivery interval, cesarean section, neonate's gender, Apgar score at 5 min and neonatal sepsis. On the other hand, gestational age at delivery, birth weight and Apgar score at 1 min were significantly different between the groups. CONCLUSION: An intra-uterine infection was found in two thirds of women presenting with preterm premature rupture of membranes. Women presenting with preterm premature rupture of membranes and intra-uterine infection had a lower gestational age at delivery and consequently had a lower neonatal birth weight than those without intra-uterine infection.
TI  - A prospective study of cortical scarring in acute febrile pyelonephritis in adults: clinical and bacteriological characteristics.
AB  - Previous reports have demonstrated lesions on computerized axial tomography (CT), and nuclear scintigraphy (DMSA) in acute pyelonephritis (PN). We undertook a prospective study of all patients presenting to our hospital with PN over 40 months. Patients who fulfilled diagnostic criteria, were treated with intravenous antibiotics. Excluding two who were pregnant, all patients had imaging by intravenous urography (IVU), CT and DMSA during their admission. Urine samples were collected prior to treatment. Patients without IVU evidence of cortical scarring but with parenchymal defects on CT and/or DMSA underwent a repeat DMSA three or more months after the acute episode. Of the 164 patients, 142 were female. E. coli was found in 116 patients. Forty-six patients had an abnormality on IVU. Of the 106 patients without IVU evidence of cortical scarring, 59 had a defect on CT and/or DMSA. Late DMSA scans in 35 of these 59 patients showed a persistent abnormality in 77%. E. coli characteristics such as P-fimbriae and Type 1 fimbriae were not predictive of acute imaging abnormalities. Inhibition of E. coli growth by the addition of EDTA was highly predictive of acute CT and DMSA abnormalities with a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 82.8%. Acute pyelonephritis is often associated with acute CT and/or DMSA abnormalities which may evolve into renal cortical scars. Acute scan abnormalities can be predicted by the presence of E. coli which were susceptible to EDTA in culture. Late scarring could not be predicted by clinical features, response to treatment or antibiotic used.
TI  - Tumour necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 2 in normal and infected human seminal fluid.
AB  - The presence of cytokines such as the tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and interleukin 2 (IL2) in human spermatozoa is still to be defined. The aim of this study was to measure the concentration of both soluble factors in seminal fluid. Data from normal semen samples (n = 24) confirmed the presence of IL2 (258 +/- 84 fmol/ml corresponding to 953 +/- 369 fmol/total volume of ejaculate) and TNF alpha (62.2 +/- 16.4 fmol/ml corresponding to 231.3 +/- 86 fmol/total volume of ejaculate). A significant positive correlation (r = 0.59; P < 0.01) was observed between the TNF alpha and the IL2 concentrations. The concentrations of these cytokines were not related to sperm parameters. In contrast, IL2 concentrations (196.9 +/- 60.4 fmol/ml; 686.2 +/- 236.7 fmol/total volume of ejaculate) evaluated in 16 seminal fluids with identified bacterial agents were lower than in the control group, whereas TNF alpha concentrations (68.6 +/- 12.3 fmol/ml; 241.3 +/- 78.9 fmol/total volume of ejaculate) were not significantly different from the controls. Further studies are needed to determine the potential role of these cytokines in the physiology of semen and their usefulness as indicators of reproductive pathology.
TI  - The relationship of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli to bacterial vaginosis and genital microflora in pregnant women.
AB  - Lactobacilli provide an important microbial defense against genital colonization  by pathogens. The role of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the control of genital microflora was explored in a cross-sectional study of 275 women in the second trimester of pregnancy. Vaginal cultures were obtained for detection of H2O2-positive and H2O2-negative lactobacilli and other members of the genital microflora. Compared with women with H2O2-negative lactobacilli, women colonized by H2O2-positive lactobacilli were less likely to have bacterial vaginosis, symptomatic candidiasis, and vaginal colonization by Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and viridans streptococci (P less than or equal to .05 for each comparison). In addition to the above organisms, women without vaginal lactobacilli were more likely than those women with H2O2-positive lactobacilli to have Chlamydia trachomatis, and less likely to be colonized by Enterococcus or coagulase-negative staphylococci (P less than .05 for each comparison). Vaginal colonization by group B streptococci or Escherichia coli was not related to the presence of H2O2-positive lactobacilli. These data suggest that the presence of H2O2-positive lactobacilli in the vagina is inversely correlated with infection by some genital pathogens in pregnant women.
TI  - Prostatitis--diagnostic criteria, classification of patients and recommendations  for therapeutic trials.
AB  - Infections of the prostate may occur despite the numerous host defences of the male urogenital tract. It is important to distinguish patients with genuine inflammation of the gland from the larger number of men with symptoms but no signs of an inflammatory response (prostatodynia). To define prostatitis, the degree of the inflammatory reaction must first be determined. Increased numbers of leucocytes in expressed prostatic secrections (EPS) are essential for this diagnosis. Careful lower urinary tract studies may then be used to classify the patients into two major groups of bacterial and nonbacterial prostatitis. Chronic bacterial prostatitis is primarily due to Escherichia coli. Gram-positive prostatitis is debatable. In chronic bacterial prostatitis, secretory dysfunction is common. The increased alkalinity of the pH of expressed prostatic secretions is one of the reasons for poor results of antibiotic therapy. Uncommon microorganisms, such as Chlamydia trachomatis and Ureaplasma urealyticum may be involved in some cases of the "nonbacterial" form. Routine culture for these microorganisms is not recommended.
TI  - Chlamydia trachomatis induces an inflammatory response in the male genital tract  and is associated with altered semen quality.
AB  - U. urealyticum with 15.8% and C. trachomatis antibodies with 15.4% were the most  prevalent microbiological findings in 209 male infertility patients. The inflammatory marker granulocyte-elastase was significantly increased in men with C. trachomatis; these men also showed significantly decreased citric acid levels indicating inflammatory damage of the prostate induced by C. trachomatis.
TI  - Prostaglandin production by amnion and decidual cells in response to bacterial products.
AB  - Media from bacterial cultures have been tested for actions on prostaglandin biosynthesis by human amnion and decidual cells. The bacterial species, which are commonly associated with intrauterine infections, were Group B streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhea, Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum. Overall, low doses of bacterial products were stimulatory of amnion prostaglandin production, whereas high doses were inhibitory. A similar pattern of results was obtained for effects on decidual prostaglandin production, although stimulatory actions at low doses were less pronounced. In all experiments interleukin 1 beta consistently induced a stimulation of prostaglandin production that greatly exceeded that caused by any bacterial product. It is possible that the inhibitory action of high doses of bacterial products on prostaglandin biosynthesis may contribute to the poor course of labor experienced by women with chorioamnionitis. Furthermore, these data lend credence to the view that the host response to infection (i.e. cytokine secretion) is the major mediator of subsequent preterm labor.
TI  - Ampicillin/sulbactam versus clindamycin in the treatment of postpartum endomyometritis.
AB  - Sixty-eight patients with postpartum endomyometritis were enrolled in this open randomized comparative study. Forty-two patients received ampicillin/sulbactam and 26 received clindamycin. The cure rates were similar in the two groups: 83% in the ampicillin/sulbactam group and 88% in the clindamycin group. The most frequent endometrial bacterial isolates were Bacteroides bivius, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Ureaplasma urealyticum. Bacteremia was present in 15 of 68 (22%), the most frequent isolates being Mycoplasma (four cases) and B bivius (three cases). Clindamycin-resistant species were S faecalis, E coli, and Proteus mirabilis. There were seven treatment failures in the ampicillin/sulbactam group; only one isolate (an E coli) was resistant to ampicillin/sulbactam. In a significant number of these failures, Mycoplasma was isolated. Ampicillin/sulbactam and clindamycin were found to be equally efficacious in the treatment of postpartum endometritis.
TI  - [In-vitro rates of fertilization and culture to blastocyst stage of mouse oocytes following co-incubation of murine spermatozoa with Escherichia coli and Ureaplasma urealyticum].
AB  - Mouse-spermatozoa were released of the ductus deferens and coincubated with different strains of E. coli resp. U. urealyticum before inseminated with oocytes of superovulated female mice. Daily light microscopic observations of embryonic development took place. Coincubation of spermatozoa with bacteria concentration of 10(3) cfu/ml E. coli revealed no changes in fertilization or culture rates as compared to the uninfected control group. In the same way a coincubation with 10(6) cfu/ml had no influence on the fertilization rates in vitro, however the culture rates were considerably reduced. Only one strain of ureaplasma urealyticum effected after coincubation with spermatozoa a reduced fertilization rate, the embryonic development into blastocysts after in vitro fertilization of spermatozoa infected with ureaplasma urealyticum showed a marked reduction in all but two strains.
TI  - Cloning of Ureaplasma urealyticum DNA sequences showing genetic homology with urease genes from gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - DNA chromosomic sequences from Ureaplasma urealyticum were shown, by DNA hybridization, to possess homology with Providencia stuartii urease genes. The homologous ureaplasma DNA fragment was cloned in Escherichia coli and a DNA probe, designated IC61 probe was specific for only the urease-producing U. urealyticum among the Mollicutes. Genetic homology shown between the IC61 probe and urease genes from Campylobacter pylori, E. coli and P. stuartii suggests that (1) the cloned DNA fragment from U. urealyticum contains urease encoding sequences, and that (2) the urease genes possess conserved sequences among phylogenetically distant prokaryotes.
TI  - Morphological lesions of the rat urinary tract induced by inoculation of mycoplasmas and other urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - The effects on the urinary tract after inoculation of Ureaplasma urealyticum into the rat bladder were evaluated and compared to that seen after Mycoplasma hominis, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis inoculation. The inoculation of the urease-producing organisms P. mirabilis and U. urealyticum were associated with the formation of struvite bladder stones and predominantly hyperplastic lesions of the bladder. The P. mirabilis inoculated rats also displayed marked pyelonephritis. A similar but much less pronounced reaction also occurred in the kidneys of some of the U. urealyticum inoculated rats. P. mirabilis could frequently be recultured. In contrast, this was not possible with U. urealyticum, but the organism was detected by scanning electron microscopy 2 weeks after the inoculation. Inoculation of M. hominis was associated with a few mild lesions of the bladder, but inflammatory lesions were not present in the kidneys. The study confirms the potential of Ureaplasma to form struvite stones in rat urinary tract. It also demonstrates that it can induce inflammatory changes in both bladder and kidney of rats without concomitant stone formation.
TI  - In vitro activity of florphenicol.
AB  - Florphenicol was active at a lower concentration than chloramphenicol against over half of 234 recent clinical bacterial isolates. The majority (98%) of the isolates were inhibited by florphenicol at a concentration of 8 mg/l or less. Florphenicol was particularly effective against chloramphenicol resistant strains of Haemophilus influenzae. Klebsiella aerogenes and Bacteroides spp. Florphenicol was bacteristatic for salmonellae and Escherichia coli but bactericidal for Haemophilus influenzae. Florphenicol was slightly more active than chloramphenicol against Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae but less active against Ureaplasma urealyticum.
TI  - Sexually transmitted diseases in women with urethral syndrome.
AB  - Frequency of micturition and dysuria were prominent symptoms in 135 (57%) of 237  women with urethral syndrome. Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis and Chlamydia trachomatis were the principal organisms associated with the urethral syndrome (38.41%, 28.14% and 11.11%, respectively). Escherichia coli was cultured from four patients and Herepes genitalis and Neisseria gonorrhoea were isolated from five patients. Infections with more than one organism were frequent. Thirty-one of 135 patients were infected by two organisms, 27 by three and 4 patients by four microorganisms. Vaginitis due to Garnerella vaginalis, Candida spp. and Trichomonas vaginalis was discovered in 52 (39%) of 135 patients.
TI  - Adherence of urease-induced crystals to rat bladder epithelium following acute infection with different uropathogenic microorganisms.
AB  - Apart from urine supersaturation with respect to struvite and calcium phosphate,  crystal retention is considered to be necessary for the formation of infection stones. This study was performed to investigate the role of the mucous coat in rat bladders in the adhesion of sterile urease-induced crystals and to determine to what extent the adhesion was influenced by infection. Elimination of the mucous coat with 0.1 M HCl increased the adherence of crystals six times compared to that in bladders with an intact mucous coat. Infection with Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, enterococci and Ureaplasma urealyticum increased the adherence six, five, four and two times, respectively. Injury to the mucous coat may thus be one mechanism by which microorganisms can contribute to the formation of infection stones in the urinary tract.
TI  - A DNA probe for detecting Mycoplasma genitalium in clinical specimens.
AB  - Despite decades of careful study, the etiologies of all cases of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) have yet to be described. Mycoplasma genitalium is a newly described organism which has been implicated as a cause of both PID and NGU. Because of fastidious growth requirements, prolonged incubation time and frequent overgrowth in clinical specimens by Mycoplasma hominis, non-culture methods need to be developed for its detection. We have cloned M. genitalium DNA by transfection into Escherichia coli using M13 as the vector. Using these segments as templates, we synthesized radiolabelled cDNAs that were tested for specific hybridization with M. genitalium, and clinically isolated genital mycoplasmas presumptively identified as M. hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum. A 256 base-pair segment was found to hybridize with M. genitalium with a sensitivity of 10(2) colour-changing units (CCUs). No cross-hybridization was observed with M. hominis, and cross-hybridization was observed only with large concentrations (greater than 10(6) CCUs) of U. urealyticum. Because of our choice of M13 as the vector, which contains the Lac Operon of E. coli, slight hybridization occurred with E. coli as well. This cDNA can be used against clinical specimens to determine the ecologic niche and spectrum of disease caused by M. genitalium.
TI  - Analysis of rRNA operons in Ureaplasma urealyticum.
AB  - Physical maps of Ureaplasma urealyticum serotypes I and IV were obtained by differential hybridization of DNA restriction fragments to probes derived from the Escherichia coli rrnB operon. Each of the organisms contained two rRNA operons with genes linked in the typical order 5'-16S-23S-5S-3'. There was no BclI site in either of the operons, but there were several internal HindIII and EcoRI sites showing significant heterogeneity in their respective position in both of the serotypes.
TI  - Significance of sperm bacteriology for the in vitro fertilization of human and mouse oocytes.
AB  - The mouse oocyte was used to determine whether T-mycoplasma or Escherichia coli affects the fertilization and embryonal development of oocytes. Ureaplasma urealyticum (T-mycoplasma) in the mouse oocyte system had little influence on the fertilization rates achieved in vitro; however, in all the experiments there was a marked reduction of embryonal development after in vitro fertilization (IVF) of spermatozoa infected with Ureaplasma. Even in oocytes incubated with Ureaplasma only after having reached the two-cell stage, there was reduced development into blastocysts. Changes in the Ureaplasma concentration and incubation time had no major influence on the development into blastocysts. During IVF of mouse oocytes with spermatozoa infected with E. coli concentrations of 10(3)/mL, there were no changes in the fertilization or culture rate as compared to the control group. However, after insemination with 10(6) bacteria/milliliter there was no change in the IVF rates in the mouse oocyte; however, the culture rates were considerably reduced (19.5% as compared to 64.4% in the control group). Whether there are additional changes in the pregnancy rate after the transfer of blastocysts obtained after insemination of oocytes with infected spermatozoa remains a matter for future investigation.
TI  - Demonstration of antispermatozoal antibodies in varicocele-related infertility with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
AB  - To assess the existence of a possible immunologic factor in varicocele-associated infertility, we searched for antispermatozoal antibodies in serum, seminal plasma, and bound to spermatozoa in 32 infertile men with varicocele and 22 infertile patients without palpable varicocele, with the use of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, we performed morphologic and microbiologic analyses of the semen and urethral smears for isolation of Chlamydia trachomatis. Twenty-nine men from the varicocele group (90.6%) demonstrated antispermatozoal antibodies, compared with only 9 men (40.9%) in the control group. The antibodies in both groups, when present, were mainly serum and seminal plasma immunoglobulins IgA and IgM. A significant quantitative difference between the varicocele and control groups was also observed for serum IgA, seminal plasma IgA and IgM, and sperm-bound IgG, IgA, and IgM. Oligozoospermia and asthenozoospermia were significantly more prevalent in the varicocele men. An asymptomatic genital tract infection with C. trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Escherichia coli was traced in 40.6% of the varicocele men and in 45.5% of the control group. No interaction could be demonstrated between the infection and antispermatozoal antibody formation. These data suggest that an immunologic factor may play a role in varicocele-associated infertility; however, its impact on reproduction has yet to be assessed.
TI  - Concrement formation in the urinary bladder in rats inoculated with Ureaplasma urealyticum.
AB  - To study the concrement-forming ability of Ureaplasma urealyticum in the urinary  tract, viable and heat-killed ureaplasmas as well as urease and non-urease-producing bacteria were inoculated into the bladder in rats. Viable ureaplasmas, in contrast to heat-killed, caused the formation of bladder stones with a frequency corresponding to urease-producing bacteria (Proteus mirabilis). It was not possible to reculture the inoculated ureaplasmas from the urinary tract. Non-urease producing microorganisms (Escherichia coli and Mycoplasma hominis) only occasionally induced stone formation. The results indicate that U. urealyticum can initiate stone formation, a property that appears to be associated with the urease activity of the organism.
TI  - Ureaplasma urealyticum-induced crystallization of magnesium ammonium phosphate and calcium phosphates in synthetic urine.
AB  - Crystallization of struvite and calcium phosphates was studied in vitro as encrustations on glass rods immersed in synthetic urine, to evaluate the crystallization capacity of Ureaplasma urealyticum and compare it with that of known urease and non-urease-producing bacteria. Inoculation of the synthetic urine with Ureaplasma urealyticum resulted in alkalinization of the synthetic urine and crystallization of struvite and brushite. Inoculation with Proteus mirabilis caused a faster and more pronounced alkalinization as well as crystallization of struvite and apatite. The alkalinization and crystallization caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum and Proteus mirabilis was completely prevented by acetohydroxamic acid, a potent urease inhibitor, linking the crystallization to the urease activity of the microorganisms. When the synthetic urine was inoculated with urease-negative Escherichia coli no alkalinization and no crystallization were seen.
TI  - Effects of manganese on the growth and morphology of Ureaplasma urealyticum.
AB  - All of the 14 serotype standard strains of Ureaplasma urealyticum were inhibited  to varying degrees by manganese. A 1 mM concentration of this cation either stopped growth or reduced the rate of growth in liquid medium. The presence of manganese also altered colonial morphology and cellular ultrastructure. Inhibition was dose dependent and strain specific. This differential response allowed the serotype strains to be divided into two broad biotypes. For the first biotype (serotypes 1, 3, 6, and 14), inhibition of growth in broth was temporary. For the second biotype (serotypes 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12), inhibition was permanent. Serotype 13 gave an intermediate response and was not classified. The effect of manganese could be at least partially blocked by magnesium but not by calcium, cobalt, copper, iron, potassium, sodium, or zinc. The concentration of magnesium yielding the maximum blocking effect was directly related to manganese sensitivity. Wild-type isolates of ureaplasma and Mycoplasma hominis also showed a differential response to manganese. Laboratory-adapted strains representing species of the genus Mycoplasma (M. hominis, M. fermentans, and M. pneumoniae) were inhibited by 5 but not by 1 mM manganese. The latter concentration inhibited the growth of Acholeplasma laidlawii and Staphylococcus aureus, and 5 mM manganese had no effect on Escherichia coli.
TI  - [Results of treating infections of the cervical mucosa with doxycycline polyphosphate in 53 infertile women].
AB  - Our study was carried out on 53 women who had been infertile for more than a year and who had cervical mucus infection. In 13 cases (group A) there was no other known associated factor to cause the infertility. In 26 cases (group B) there was an obvious associated factor and in a further 14 cases there was a latent associated factor. The physical characteristics as well as the bacteriological appearances of the mucus (which included a systematic search for aerobic bacteria and for chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and for ureaplasma urealyticum (UU) were studied both before and 6-8 weeks after treatment with doxycycline polyphosphate given in doses of 100 mg twice daily. Before treatment the bacteria most often found were escherichia coli (20 cases) and enterococci (18 cases). CT was only found once and UU six times, usually in association with other bacteria. In 75.5% of cases the treatment made the affecting organism go; and cut down or removed entirely the number of leucocytes in the mucus in 73.5% of cases. But the physical characteristics of the mucus were only improved in 43% of cases, and in 18 cases a new infective organism was found in the mucus after treatment. However, it was in too low a concentration to determine its pathogenicity. There were nine pregnancies within 4 months of the start of treatment, which means that 30% in group A and 19% in group B became pregnant. Infection of the cervical mucus therefore does really seem to be a factor in lowered fertility in certain women CT and UU seem to be rarely the responsible organisms. Doxycycline phosphophate in an efficient and well tolerated treatment in these infections.
TI  - Bacteriuria due to Ureaplasma urealyticum and Gardnerella vaginalis in women with preeclampsia.
AB  - Certain fastidious organisms such as U urealyticum and G vaginalis can be isolated from the aspirated bladder urine of pregnant women more frequently than conventional urinary pathogens such as Escherichia coli [1]. They can be isolated even more often from the aspirated bladder urine of patients with renal disease, but rarely from that of healthy men or nonpregnant women [2]. We investigated the incidence of bacteriuria due to these two organisms--particularly U urealyticum--in patients with preeclampsia. U urealyticum was isolated more frequently (rate, 20%), and usually in higher colony counts, from the urine of patients with preeclampsia than from that of healthy pregnant women (rate, 7%). G vaginalis was isolated with approximately the same frequency as U urealyticum from specimens of bladder urine; both organisms were isolated from the urine of 11 patients (eight healthy women and three with preeclampsia). High colony counts of G vaginalis were also found more frequently in patients with preeclampsia. In both groups other fastidious organisms were isolated in a total of only five patients, and in four of these five cases U urealyticum and/or G vaginalis were also isolated from the same specimen. Urine cultures were more frequently positive in patients with moderately severe hypertension (blood pressure, greater than 160/100 mm Hg) than in those with mild hypertension (blood pressure, 140/90-160/100 mm Hg, occurring in nine (53%) of 17 patients and in nine (26.5%) of 34 patients, respectively. This difference was not statistically significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Culture of seminal fluid in a fertility clinic.
AB  - To determine whether the culture of seminal fluid in a fertility clinic is of importance, bacterial cultures were obtained in a consecutive series of 96 patients. Routine bacteriologic cultures were performed within 1 hour of collection. Ureaplasma urealyticum (T-mycoplasma) cultures were also obtained in the last 31 of the patients in this series. Of these 96 patients, 11% showed significant bacterial growth (greater than 10(4) colonies/ml) in the semen specimens, 8% in those patients with normal semen analyses and 14% in those with abnormal analyses. Fifty-eight per cent of semen specimens were positive for U. urealyticum. In reference to normal and abnormal semen analyses the distribution was the same regardless of the presence or absence of U. urealyticum. Antibiotic treatment resulted in minor changes in motility and morphology in a few patients despite conversion to a negative culture. Cultures were also coordinated with microscopic urinalysis and the presence of white blood cells or bacteria in stained smears of semen. There were no significant differences between groups with positive or negative cultures. Trichomonas vaginalis was not seen.
TI  - Acute epididymitis: etiology and therapy.
AB  - Fifty patients with acute epididymitis were evaluated prospectively by history, examination, and microbiologic studies, including cultures for aerobes, anaerobes, N. gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum. E. Coli was the predominant pathogen isolated from the urine of men over 35 years old and C. trachomatis and N. gonnorrheae were the predominant pathogens isolated from the urethra of men under 35. The etiologic role of E. Coli and C. trachomatis was confirmed by isolation from epididymal aspirates from a high proportion of men with positive urine of urethral cultures for these agents. C. trachomatis epididymitis accounted for two thirds of "idiopathic epididymitis" in men, and was often associated with oligozoospermia. Of nine female sexual partners of men with C. trachomatis infection, six had antibody to C. trachomatis, of whom two had positive cervical cultures for this organism, and the others had nongonococcal pelvic inflammatory disease. Antibiotic therapy with tetracycline was effective for the treatment of men with C. trachomatis epididymitis, and should be offered to their female sex partner.
TI  - Etiology, manifestations and therapy of acute epididymitis: prospective study of  50 cases.
AB  - There were 50 patients with acute epididymitis who were evaluated prospectively by history, examination and microbiologic studies, including cultures for aerobes, anaerobes, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis and Ureaplasma urealyticum. Escherichia coli was the predominant pathogen isolated from the urine of men more than 35 years old, while Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were the predominant pathogens isolated from the urethra of men less than 35 years old. The etiologic role of Escherichia coli and Chlamydia trachomatis was confirmed by isolation from epididymal aspirates from a high proportion of men with positive urine or urethral cultures for these agents. Chlamydia trachomatis epididymitis accounted for two-thirds of idiopathic epididymitis in young men and often was associated with oligospermia. Of 9 female sexual partners of men with Chlamydia trachomatis infection 6 had antibody to Chlamydia trachomatis, of whom 2 had positive cervical cultures for this organism and 2 others had non-gonococcal pelvic inflammatory disease. Antibiotic therapy with tetracycline was effective for the treatment of men with Chlamydia trachomatis epididymitis and should be offered to the female sex partners.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  - Semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group A) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group B). These 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. Overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group A were positive and 73% from group B were positive. Mixed bacterial flora were isolated from both groups but in group B they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group A. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. aureus, Corynebacterium species, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group A. Group B revealed these organisma plus Streptococcus pneumoniae type III, Strep. pyogenes group A, Strep. feacalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Eubacterium species. Semen samples from group A were of better quality than those from group B. In addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group A was greater than that from group B.
