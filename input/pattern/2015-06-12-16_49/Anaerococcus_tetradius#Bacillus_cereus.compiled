TI  - [The detection of Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus and Bacillus cereus in clinical materials from a child who died of sepsis with a fulminant clinical course].
AB  - A case of an acute disease with a rapid clinical course and a fatal outcome in the presence of irreversible toxicoinfectious shock, appearing in two children after the consumption of sheep kidneys, is described. The post mortem examination of the children revealed the presence of hemorrhagic, erosive and necrotic areas on the mucous membrane of the stomach, the duodenum and the upper section of the small intestine. From the material obtained by probing the stomach of one of the children 6 hours before death P.asaccharolyticus and B.cereus were isolated. Hemorrhage, erosions and necrosis were also found in experimental mice, injected with the centrifugates of the gastric secretions of the patient and the cultures of the isolated bacteria, which was indicative of the presence of highly active exotoxin. On the basis of the above facts, compared with similar data in the literature, this case was considered to be etiologically related anaerobic Peptostreptococcus in symbiosis with B.cereus.
TI  - Prospective study of blood culture during transesophageal echocardiography.
AB  - To ascertain the incidence and significance of bacteremia associated with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), 132 consecutive patients (aged 17 to 73 years) free of apparent infection who were undergoing 135 transesophageal echocardiographic procedures from October 1990 to August 1991, were prospectively studied. For each procedure, two sets of blood cultures were obtained for culture 30 to 60 minutes before TEE, immediately after, and 180 to 240 minutes after the procedure. For each blood culture, 10 ml of venous blood was evenly inoculated into aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles and inoculated for 7 days using a radiometric system. A throat swab was obtained immediately before each procedure. Three of 270 preprocedure blood cultures were positive for Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus simulans, and Peptostreptococcus species, respectively. No blood culture was positive in the immediate postprocedure period. Two of 270 late blood samples grew Staphylococcus epidermidis in the same patient. Nevertheless, the microorganisms isolated from blood cultures were different from those isolated from the throat swab. No patients had fever or evidence of infective endocarditis after TEE during the follow-up period. It is concluded that the incidence of TEE-related bacteremia is extremely low, and a general recommendation for antibiotic prophylaxis during TEE is not warranted.
