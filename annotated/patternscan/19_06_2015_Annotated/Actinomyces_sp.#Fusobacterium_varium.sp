TI  == activity of garenoxacin against 536 unusual anaerobes including 128 recovered from acute pelvic infections.
AB  == garenoxacin, a des-(f)6-quinolone, was tested using the agar dilution method against 536 anaerobic bacteria, composed of 408 unusual strains from various sources and 128 pelvic isolates. only 33/408 (8%) unusual isolates and 6/128 (4.7%) pelvic isolates had garenoxacin mics >/= 4 mug/ml, and 18 and 3 (4.4% and  2.3% of the respective totals) had mics >/= 8 mug/ml. less susceptible unusual isolates included 7/15 veillonella sp. from various clinical sources, 6/14 fusobacterium varium from predominantly abdominal infections, 5/5 f. russii (cat  bites), and 6/9 actinomyces israelii. overall, garenoxacin showed good activity against the isolates studied and has potential utility in mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections.

TI  == in vitro activities of ramoplanin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid, bacitracin, and four other antimicrobials against intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == by using an agar dilution method, the in vitro activities of ramoplanin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid, and five other agents were determined against 300 gram-positive and 54 gram-negative strains of intestinal anaerobes. ramoplanin was active at <or=2 microg/ml against 287 of 300 (95.7%) gram-positive organisms, including 18 strains of clostridium difficile for which mics of ramoplanin were 0.25 to 0.5 microg/ml; for 3 of these, linezolid mics were 8 to 16 micro g/ml. nineteen clostridium innocuum strains for which the vancomycin mic at which 90% of strains were inhibited was 16 microg/ml were susceptible to ramoplanin at 0.06 to 0.25 microg/ml and to teicoplanin at 0.125 to 1.0 microg/ml. all strains of eubacterium, actinomyces, propionibacterium, and peptostreptococcus spp. were inhibited by <or=0.25 microg of ramoplanin per ml and <or=1 microg of vancomycin per ml. ramoplanin was also active at <or=4 microg/ml against 15 of 22 of the prevotella and porphyromonas strains tested, but ramoplanin mics for all 31 strains of the bacteroides fragilis group, the fusobacterium mortiferum-fusobacterium varium group, and veillonella spp. were >or=256 microg/ml. ramoplanin displays excellent activity against c. difficile and other gram-positive enteric anaerobes, including vancomycin-resistant strains; however, it has poor activity against most gram-negative anaerobes and thus potentially has a lesser effect on the ecological balance of normal fecal flora.

TI  == association of early onset periodontitis microbiota with aspartate aminotransferase activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == objectives: the objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the activity of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (ast) in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) using the colorimetric periogard (ptm) test and the subgingival microflora in early onset periodontitis lesions. material and methods: the study population consisted of 25 otherwise healthy individuals exhibiting early onset periodontitis (eop). in each patient four experimental sites were identified comprising one deep periodontal pocket (pd >5 mm) randomly  chosen in each quadrant. bacterial samples were obtained from the experimental sites, consecutively cultured anaerobically and in 10% co(2) using selective and  nonselective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional  biochemical tests and various identification kits. clinical measurements as well  as ast activity, assessed either as positive or negative using the ptm, were recorded at the same sites. results: sixty-two sites exhibited ast positive and 38 ast negative activity. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann whitney u-test) showed that streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides forsythus, camplobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus and selenomonas sputigena were significantly higher in sites with ast-positive activity. the odds ratio of having high prevalence of s. intermedius, p. micros, c. concisus, b. forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus and s.  sputigena in the presence of a positive ast site was very high (range: 3.5-17.0). streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, gemella morbillorum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium varium, eubacterium lentum and prevotella oralis were detected in significantly higher proportions in sites with ast negative activity and manifested a negative odds ratio in the presence of ast positive sites. the logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking and bleeding upon probing showed a significant association with ast activity, while plaque and suppuration were not found to be significant predictors of ast activity. the co-infection of porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus and p. micros, or p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and c. rectus were found  to be significantly associated with the ast activity (p<0.001). ast positive sites revealed significantly higher occurrence of co-infections by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. sputigena or by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. intermedius than ast negative sites (p<0.001). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. naeslundii co-infection was found significantly higher in the ast negative sites (p<0.001).  conclusions: the present study found a high level of agreement between the presence of putative periodontal pathogens and positive ast scores at periodontal sites that clinically were considered to be potentially disease active. prospective studies should be performed to confirm the findings.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of abt-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of abt-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. mics at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for actinomyces spp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium spp., and porphyromonas spp. the mic(50)s and mic(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for eubacterium spp., lactobacillus spp., clostridium difficile, and clostridium ramosum. the mic(90) for bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides ureolyticus, and campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for prevotella bivia and other prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. the mic(90) for fusobacterium nucleatum was 8  microg/ml, and that for fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. the mic(90)s for the bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for b. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides distasonis, and bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. telithromycin mics for the b. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than abt-773 mics. for all strains, abt-773  was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.

TI  == activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) compared to those of other oral antimicrobial agents against unusual anaerobes.
AB  == the activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) and comparator agents were determined by an agar dilution method against 419 clinical strains of less-commonly identified species of anaerobes. gemifloxacin was generally more active than trovafloxacin against gram-positive strains by one to two dilutions.  peptostreptococci (peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, peptostreptococcus magnus, peptostreptococcus micros, and peptostreptococcus prevotii) and porphyromonas spp. (porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas gingivalis, and porphyromonas macacae) were all susceptible to </=0.25 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml. the mics of gemifloxacin at which 90% of the following strains were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=2 microgram/ml: actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, clostridium innocuum, clostridium clostridioforme, anaerobiospirillum spp., bacteroides tectum, bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides gracilis (now campylobacter gracilis), prevotella intermedia, prevotella heparinolytica, and the prevotella oris-buccae  group. fusobacterium naviforme and fusobacterium necrophorum were also susceptible to </=2 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml, while fusobacterium varium  strains exhibited a bimodal pattern; the other fusobacterium species, such as fusobacterium ulcerans and fusobacterium russii, as well as veillonella spp., the prevotella melaninogenica group, prevotella bivia, clostridium difficile, and bilophila wadsworthia were relatively resistant to gemifloxacin (mic(90)s, >/=4 microgram/ml).

TI  == subgingival microbiota of shallow periodontal pockets in individuals after head and neck irradiation.
AB  == this study aimed at investigating the subgingival plaque microorganisms of shallow pockets (< or = 5 mm) in subjects who previously received irradiation in  the head and neck region for treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. direct microscopy and anaerobic culture were used. subgingival paper point samples were  taken from 6 tooth-sites (one/sextant) per subject for direct microscopy (n = 108). another set of paper points was taken from the deepest of the previously selected sites (one per subject) with: group a) no bleeding on probing to the sulcus depth (n = 9) and group b) bleeding on probing to the sulcus depth (n = 6) for microscopic and anaerobic culture study. under the microscope, the microflora was found to be a complex mixture comprising gram-positive and gram-negative cocci, rods and filaments, fusiforms, curved rods and spirochetes. low level of fungi were observed and mycelia were occasionally detected. there was no significant variation in the plaque bacterial morphotypes observable according to sites of isolation and no significant difference between group a and group b in morphotypes of the different microflora. the predominant cultivable microflora comprised several species of facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria: gemella, peptostreptococcus, staphylococcus, stomatococcus, streptococcus, actinomyces, eubacterium, lactobacillus, propionibacterium, neisseria, veillonella, bacteroides, campylobacter, capnocytophaga, fusobacterium, kingella, porphyromonas and prevotella species. there was no difference between the two groups except the significantly higher proportion of kingella dentrificans isolated from group b sites. however, colonization of the gingival sulcus in these individuals by microbes that are normal flora of: skin (peptostreptococcus  prevotii and propionibacterium granulosum) and gut (eubacterium aerofaciens, fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium) was detected. these findings appear to suggest that the major components of the subgingival microflora of shallow sites in previously head- and neck-irradiated individuals are similar to  that of gingivitis sites in the normal population although they may contain bacterial or fungal species uncommon in normal subjects.

TI  == recently described clinically important anaerobic bacteria: taxonomic aspects and update.
AB  == a new method of identifying bacteria, phylogenetic 16s rrna sequencing, has led to major reorganizations among most genera of anaerobic bacteria. the pigmented prevotella species now comprise seven species including p. nigrescens and p. tannerae; p. intermedia/p. nigrescens-like organisms await inclusion. the former  mitsuokella dentalis and hallella seregens were transferred to prevotella as one  species, p. dentalis. p. enoeca is a new nonpigmenting prevotella. the genus porphyromonas currently includes 11 pigmented species and one nonpigmented species, p. catoniae; p. levii-like and p. endodontalis-like organisms are candidates for the genus. fusobacterium nucleatum currently has five subspecies,  and f. varium includes the former f. pseudonecrophorum. former wolinella recta and wolinella curva now are campylobacter rectus and campylobacter curvus; campylobacter showae is a new species. isolates included in the bile-sensitive former bacteroides gracilis now are campylobacter gracilis; the bile-resistant b. gracilis isolates were transferred to a new genus, sutterella, as s. wadsworthensis. the new actinomyces species include two subspecies of the a. neuii and the a. radingae-a. turicensis complex. the genus eubacterium sensu stricto is represented by e. limosum, and the former e. alactolyticum was reclassified in a new genus, pseudoramibacter, as p. alactolyticus. recent entries include e. saphenum, e. minutum, e. exiguum, e. infirmum, and e. tardum.  a new genus, atopobium houses some former lactobacilli and streptococci. the genus peptostreptococcus also have four new species; p. hydrogenalis, p. lacrimalis, p. lactolyticus, and p. vaginalis.
