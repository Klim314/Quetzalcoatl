TI  - [Role of infectious agents in the emergence of malignant tumors].
AB  - According to the data of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC),  at least 6 virus species (HPV, EBV, HHV-8/KSHV, HTLV-1, HBV, HCV), 4 helminthes species (Schistosoma haematobium and japonicum, Opisthorchis viverrini, Clonorchis sinensis) and I bacterium species (Helicobacter pylori) have been proved to be capable of causing the development of cancer. The analysis of the data available shows that Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), John Cunningham polyomavirus (JCV), monkey virus 40 (SV40), cytomegalovirus (CMV), xenotropic murine leukemia virus (XMRV), Helicobacter bilis and hepaticus, Campylobacter jejuni, Fusobacterium varium, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Prevotella spp., Streptococcus bovis and anginosus, Treponema denticola, Salmonella typhi, paratyphi and typhimurium, Borrelia burgdorferi, Bartonella spp., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, trachomatis and psittaci, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Propionibacterium acnes, Tropheryma whippelii, Schistosoma mansoni, Opistorchis felineus, Strongyloides stercoralis, Taenia solium, Candida spp., Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Histoplasma capsulatum and Trichomonas vaginalis can also be potential etiological agents of cancer. Apparently, detection of new associations between infectious agents and risk of the development of cancer will facilitate progress in elaboration of prophylaxis measures, early diagnostic methods and, probably, methods of treatment of malignant tumors.
TI  - Susceptibility of some oral microorganisms to chlorhexidine and paramonochlorophenol.
AB  - Since the use of antimicrobial agents is required in endodontic therapies, this study aimed at determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of chlorhexidine digluconate and paramonochlorophenol (PMC) against microorganisms commonly found in endodontic infections. Both agents were tested by agar dilution tests against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella denticola and Prevotella melaninogenica. The MIC of chlorhexidine ranged from 2.67 to 80.00 microg/ml, and the MIC of PMC from 46.67 to 213.33 microg/ml. The highest MIC value of PMC was detected for E. faecalis whereas E. coli was the most susceptible microorganism to this agent. The highest MIC values of chlorhexidine were observed for P. aeruginosa whereas E. coli and P. denticola were the most susceptible microorganisms to this agent. Since the MIC values observed are much lower than the concentrations currently used in the endodontic therapy, it is suggested that both agents are effective in reducing the microbiota in the root canal.
TI  - Implant therapy following liver transplantation: clinical and microbiological results after 10 years.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of immunocompromised patients is increasing as a consequence of successful organ transplantation. Placing dental implants in these patients has been questioned because of their increased risk for infections. The 10-year follow-up data of a 71-year-old liver transplant recipient with long-term immunosuppressive therapy is reported. Six months after liver transplantation, two interforaminal implants were inserted in the edentulous mandible, and an overdenture using non-rigid telescopic attachments was fabricated 3 months later. METHODS: Oral clinical parameters included the modified plaque index, sulcus fluid flow rate, modified bleeding index, probing depth, distance implant mucosa, attachment level, width of the keratinized mucosa and mobility values. The distance implant bone (DIB) was determined on digital panoramic radiographs. The levels of eight periodontal marker organisms were established using DNA probe technology. Additionally, swabs of the edentulous oral mucosa were taken for microbiological culture and antimicrobial resistance testing. RESULTS: The peri-implant parameters were within normal ranges indicating a stable osseointegration with moderate vertical bone loss. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Tannerella forsythensis, Campylobacter rectus, and Treponema denticola were not detected. Low levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Eikenella corrodens were found. Prevotella intermedia was the only bacterium with a level higher than 10(4). The mucosal swabs indicated the presence of an abundant normal oral flora, including Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. The antibiogram revealed multiple resistance to antibiotics. CONCLUSION: This case report suggests that immunocompromised patients can be successfully rehabilitated with dental implants.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. A total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabillis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobactor baumannii, Acinetobactor lwoffii, Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lwoffii throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in antibacterial activities of CZOP against B. cepacia, and H. influenzae was suggested.

The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in the antibacterial activity of CZOP against H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Treponema denticola detection in oral plaque samples using the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Detection of putative pathogens is critical for delineating the etiology and progression of periodontitis. In the present study, we have used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay utilizing primers specific for the lkt A gene of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, the fimbrial gene of Porphyromonas gingivalis, and tdp A gene of Treponema denticola in order to determine the presence of these pathogens in subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis sites. These gene specific primers were also used to assess the detection of different strains of bacteria in the PCR assays. Primers for P. gingivalis detected P. gingivalis strain 33277, but no product was detected when primers were used with extracts from 4 species of Capnocytophaga, 3 species of Prevotella, 2 species of Porphyromonas other than P. gingivalis, Bacteroides levii, Escherichia coli, 3 strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans and 3 strains of T. denticola. PCR analysis using primers for the lkt A gene of A. actinomycetemcomitans also did not result in a product with any of these bacteria with the exception of a positive result with 3 different strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans. Primers selected from the tdp A gene of T. denticola did not identify any of the bacteria strains tested except T. denticola serovars a, b, and c. Thus, these primers were shown to amplify gene segments that are specific to either P. gingivalis (33277), A. actinomycetemcomitans (33384, 43717 and 43718) or T. denticola (35405, 33521 and 35404). The PCR assay may be used to rapidly detect the presence of periodontal pathogens in the future.
TI  - Characterization of hemolytic bacteria in subgingival plaque.
AB  - Three-quarters of the patients with periodontal diseases surveyed in this study had one or more distinct types of hemolytic bacteria in their subgingival plaque. Twelve different species of bacteria were identified, belonging to five genera (Actinomyces, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Prevotella, and Actinobacillus). Nine hemolytic isolates, consisting of four Prevotella denticola strains, two Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 strains, and one each of P. melaninogenica, Streptococcus constellatus, and A. naeslundii genospecies 1 strains were characterized. Incorporation of pronase into blood agar medium inhibited hemolysis by all of the isolates, suggesting a proteinaceous component for each of their hemolysins. With one exception, hemolysin production appeared to be regulated by the concentration of environmental iron: exogenous hemin was found to inhibit hemolysin production, and the iron scavenging compound, 2,2'- dipyridyl, was found to promote hemolysin production by all of the strains except for the S. constellatus isolate. Genomic libraries of each of the hemolytic plaque isolates were prepared in Escherichia coli using pBR322. Hemolytic clones were isolated on blood agar medium containing ampicillin at frequencies ranging from 1-6.7 x 10(-4). Extensive restriction mapping revealed regions of homology in the case of clones derived from three P. denticola strains isolated from the same subjects. Two of the P. denticola-derived clones were virtually identical throughout the entrety of their > 5 Kb inserts. The clone derived from the third strain showed good homology to the other two within a 1.3 Kb region, but the flanking DNA showed no homology even though all three P. denticola isolates were shown to be clonally related by ribotyping.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
