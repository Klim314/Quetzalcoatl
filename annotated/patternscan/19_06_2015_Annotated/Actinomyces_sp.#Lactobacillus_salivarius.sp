TI  == molecular detection of bacteria associated to dental caries in 4-12-year-old tunisian children.
AB  == the occurrence of several microbial species in the oral cavity of 4-12-year-old tunisian children was investigated. samples were taken from 158 children (81 caries actives and 77 caries free). genomic dna was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 17 microbial species using a polymerase chain reaction assay. all samples were positive for at least one of the target microbial strains. streptococcus mutans was the most prevalent species (76.5%) detected in genomic dna collected from carious lesions. other prevalent species were candida spp (63%), streptococcus salivarius (59%) and streptococcus oralis (42%). the frequency of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus casei-group in caries lesions was 29.5%, 34.5% and 22% respectively. pathogenic bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus was found in 28.5% of carious lesion samples compared to 15.5% in the control. frequency of porphyromonas endodontali, actinomyces radicidentis and treponema denticola recovery did not differ significantly between origins of samples. pcr analysis of genomic dna detect various oral bacteria that differ between caries actives and caries-free children. in addition, the association of same aciduric bacteria (s.  mutans, s. salivarius, l. acidophilus) and caries formation was noticed.

TI  == antibacterial efficacy of a human beta-defensin-3 peptide on multispecies biofilms.
AB  == introduction: the aggregation of mixed bacterial flora into sessile biofilms on root canal surfaces can be one of the causes of persistent apical periodontitis.  the aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3) peptide on multispecies biofilms by using confocal laser scanning microscopy. methods: actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus salivarius, streptococcus mutans, and enterococcus faecalis were cultured in a peptone-yeast-glucose broth, and their culture suspensions were combined in equal proportions. the mixed bacteria were inoculated on sterile coverslips placed into the wells of tissue culture plates to permit the formation of mixed species biofilm. after incubation for 3 weeks, the samples were treated for 24 hours with saline (control), saturated calcium hydroxide solution (ch), 2% chlorhexidine solution (chx), and 50 mug/ml hbd3 solution. a commercial biofilm/viability assay kit was used to assess cell viability and analyze the 3-dimensional architecture  of biofilms. the percentage of dead cells was determined from the ratio of biovolumes for the red subpopulation and the total biofilm. results: three medication groups showed a significant reduction of biovolume within the biofilms compared with the control group (p < .001). the hbd3-treated biofilms had a higher percentage of dead cells than the other medication groups (p < .05). the ch and chx groups showed higher levels of bactericidal activity than saline (p <  .05), and there was no significant difference between the 2 groups (p > .05). conclusions: hbd3 peptide exhibited more antibacterial activity against mature multispecies biofilms in vitro than either ch or chx.

TI  == effect of metalloporphyrins on red autofluorescence from oral bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the red autofluorescence from bacterial species related to dental caries and periodontitis in the presence of different nutrients in the growth medium. bacteria were grown anaerobically on tryptic soy  agar (tsa) supplemented with nutrients, including magnesium-porphyrins from spinach and iron-porphyrins from heme. the autofluorescence was then assessed at  405 nm excitation. on the tsa without additives, no autofluorescence was observed from any of the species tested. on the tsa containing sheep blood, red autofluorescence was observed only from parvimonas micra. when the tsa was supplemented with blood, hemin, and vitamin k, red autofluorescence was observed  from actinomyces naeslundii, bifidobacterium dentium, and streptococcus mutans. finally, on the tsa supplemented with spinach extract, red autofluorescence was observed from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a. naeslundii, enterococcus  faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus salivarius, s. mutans, and veillonella parvula. we conclude that the bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal disease exhibit red autofluorescence. the autofluorescence characteristics of the tested strains depended on the nutrients present, such as  metalloporphyrins, suggesting that the metabolic products of the oral biofilm could be responsible for red autofluorescence.

TI  == development of a multispecies biofilm community by four root canal bacteria.
AB  == introduction: the development of multispecies biofilm models are needed to explain the interactions that take place in root canal biofilms during apical periodontitis. the aim of this study was to investigate the ability of 4 root canal bacteria to establish a multispecies biofilm community and to characterize  the main structural, compositional, and physiological features of this community. methods: four clinical isolates isolated from infected root canals, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus salivarius, streptococcus gordonii, and enterococcus faecalis, were grown together in a miniflow cell system. simultaneous detection of the 4 species in the biofilm communities was achieved by fluorescence in situ  hybridization in combination with confocal microscopy at different time points. the live/dead baclight technique (molecular probes, carlsbad, ca) was used to assess cell viability and to calculate 3-dimensional architectural parameters such as biovolume (mum(3)). redox fluorescence dye 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride was used to assess the metabolic activity of biofilm bacteria. results: the 4 species tested were able to form stable and reproducible biofilm communities. the biofilms formed in rich medium generally showed continuous growth over time, however, in the absence of glucose biofilms showed significantly smaller biovolumes. a high proportion of viable cells (>90%) were generally observed, and biofilm growth was correlated with high metabolic activity of cells. the community structure of biofilms formed in rich medium did  not change considerably over the 120-hour period, during which e. faecalis, l. salivarius, and s. gordonii were most abundant. conclusions: the ability of 4 root canal bacteria to form multispecies biofilm communities shown in this study  give insights into assessing the community lifestyle of these microorganisms in vivo. this multispecies model could be useful for further research simulating stresses representative of in vivo conditions.

TI  == antibacterial and antifungal activities of punica granatum peel extracts against  oral pathogens.
AB  == objective: punica granatum has been used for many years in folk medicine due to several purposes. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of methanolic extract of punica granatum peel (mepgp) against streptococcus mutans,  staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguinis, staphylococcus epidermidis, actynomyces viscosus, lactobacillus acidophilus and candida albicans. materials and methods: in this in vitro study, the mentioned oral organisms were cultured in blood agar and mueller-hinton media and then paper disks containing mepgp at concentrations of 4 mg/ml, 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml were inserted on medias. the antimicrobial activity was evaluated by agar disk diffusion method. the effects of three different concentrations of mepgp against  microorganisms were compared using one-way anova and tukey tests. results: all concentrations of mepgp had antibacterial activity against s. aureus and s. epidermidis. only at concentration of 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml mepgp was effective against l. acidophilus, s. mutans and s. salivarius. furthermore; no concentrations of mepgp inhibited a. viscosus and c. albicans. conclusion: this study suggests that mepgp might be used as an antibacterial agent in controlling  oral infections.

TI  == in situ analysis of multispecies biofilm formation on customized titanium surfaces.
AB  == many studies to identify surfaces that enhance the incorporation of dental implants into bone and soft-tissue have been undertaken previously. however, to succeed in the clinical situation, an implant surface must not support development of microbial biofilms with a pathogenic potential. as a first step in investigating this, we used two-species and three-species biofilm models with 16s ribosomal rna fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal laser scanning microscopy to examine the effect of surface characteristics on biofilm formation  by species that can colonize titanium implants in vivo: streptococcus sanguinis,  actinomyces naeslundii and lactobacillus salivarius. surfaces blasted with al(2)  o(3) (s(a) = 1.0-2.0 mum) showed a seven-fold higher bacterial adhesion after 2 h than turned surfaces (s(a) = 0.18 mum) whereas porous surfaces, generated by anodic oxidation (s(a) = 0.4 mum), showed four-fold greater adhesion than turned  surfaces. hence, increased roughness promoted adhesion, most likely through protection of bacteria from shear forces. chemical modification of the blasted and oxidized surfaces by incorporation of ca(2+) ions reduced adhesion compared with the corresponding non-modified surfaces. after 14 h, biofilm growth occurred in the three-species model but not in the two-species consortium (containing s. sanguinis and a. naeslundii only). the biofilm biovolume on all surfaces was similar, suggesting that the influence of surface characteristics on adhesion was compensated for by biofilm development.

TI  == the effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  == objectives: our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. methods: twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (ms) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. the polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. the samples were cultured for ms, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. a part of the samples were subjected to dna-dna hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: actinomyces naeslundii, a. viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. paracasei, l. rhamnose, l. plantarum, streptococcus gordonii, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, veillonella parvula. results: the ms counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (p<.01) in the  xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. also the plaque ms percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (p<.01). the salivary ms counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. the dna-dna hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. conclusions: within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced ms counts in plaque  but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.

TI  == degree of conversion and antimicrobial activity of etch-and-rinse versus self-etching adhesives.
AB  == purpose: this study was designed to compare the self-etching with the etch-and-rinse adhesives regarding the degree of conversion and antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria. materials and methods: the materials used were adhese (two-step self-etching), adper prompt l-pop (self-etching, single-step) and excite (etch-and-rinse) adhesives. the degree of conversion was  measured using fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy. the absorbance peaks of infrared rays by the aliphatic c=c was detected at 1632 to 1637cm-1 and the aromatic c=c peak at 1610 to 1500 cm-1.the antimicrobial activity was evaluated using the microorganisms streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus salivarius, and actinomyces odontolyticus, with a disk diffusion method. chlorhexidine digluconate solution 0.2% was used as a positive control. zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed and measured. results: adhese showed the highest degree of conversion, followed by excite, while adper prompt l-pop had the lowest values. a significant difference in the degree of conversion was found between excite and adper prompt l-pop as well as adhese and adper prompt l-pop. on the other hand, there was no significant difference between excite and adhese. adper  prompt l-pop showed an antimicrobial effect against streptococcus mutans and actinomyces odontolyticus while it was unable to inhibit the growth of lactobacillus salivarius. adhese could inhibit the growth of streptococcus mutans only. excite did not produce inhibition zones to the tested microorganisms. conclusion: adper prompt l-pop showed the worst degree of conversion. adhese and  excite had the highest degree of conversion. appreciable antimicrobial activity was noted with self-etching adhesives, while the etch-and-rinse demonstrated no antimicrobial action.

TI  == diagnodent measurements of cultures of selected oral bacteria and demineralized enamel.
AB  == objective: carious tissue fluoresces with a wavelength different from sound tissue when stimulated by light with a wavelength of 655 nm. this difference is thought to have a bacterial origin rather than indicating demineralization. this  study aimed to measure fluorescence emitted by normal cultivable caries-associated bacterial flora and typical porphyrin-producing bacteria with diagnodent, and to verify earlier findings that demineralization of the dental hard tissue does not affect diagnodent readings. material and methods: bacterial  samples were collected from five occlusal caries lesions in three subjects. from  these, mixed anaerobic flora, lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were cultured  in up to three different kinds of culture medium. colonies of lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were also measured after transferring them to glass slides. laboratory teaching strains of prevotella spp., porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces odontolyticus were cultured anaerobically and fluorescence measured directly after an appropriate incubation period. sound enamel surfaces of 15 extracted premolars were demineralized and changes in fluorescence measured. results: diagnodent readings > 20 were only obtained from young colonies of prevotella and from colonies of mutans streptococci cultured on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. higher measurements were obtained as the bacterial colonies aged. lower measurements were obtained after transferring colonies to glass slides. demineralization of enamel did not affect the diagnodent measurements. conclusions: the change in fluorescence measured with diagnodent has a bacterial origin rather than occurring as a result of demineralization. the measurements are presumably dependent on bacterial metabolites rather than bacteria themselves, and probably record synergistic effects during the carious process rather than the quantity or species of bacteria involved.

TI  == the effect of antibacterial monomer mdpb on the growth of organisms associated with root caries.
AB  == mdpb, 12-methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide, was tested for its ability to  inhibit the growth of organisms associated with active root caries lesions and to modify the growth characteristics of these organisms at sub-mics. mics and mbcs of mdpb for independent isolates (n=5) of the following taxa: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces gerensceriae, actinomyces odontolyticus, lactobacillus spp., and candida albicans were determined, and the effects at sub-mic on microbial growth kinetics were assessed. all isolates were sensitive to inhibition by mdpb. the median mics and mbcs of mdpb for these organisms were  in the range of 3.13 to 25.0 microg/ml and 6.25 to 50.0 microg/ml, respectively.  as for the influence of ph, inhibition was sensitive to acidic ph. even at sub-mics, the growth of all strains, measured as cell yield and doubling time, was significantly reduced. based on the results of this study, mdpb exhibited the potential to inhibit the growth of microbiota associated with active root caries  lesions.

TI  == characterisation of prototype nurmi cultures using culture-based microbiological  techniques and pcr-dgge.
AB  == undefined nurmi-type cultures (ntcs) have been used successfully to prevent salmonella colonisation in poultry for decades. such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. these cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. in this study, 10 batches of prototype ntcs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), were applied to characterise  these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the ntcs were identical. culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology,  gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (api, biomerieux, france). two sets of pcr-dgge studies were performed. these involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (lab)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16s rrna gene by pcr. resultant amplicons were subjected to dgge. sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant dgge profiles using the basic local alignment search tool (blast). microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera lactobacillus, lactococcus, bifidobacterium, enterococcus, clostridium, escherichia, pediococcus and enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, actinomyces, bacteroides, propionibacterium, capnocytophaga, proteus, and klebsiella. bacteroides, enterococcus, escherichia, brevibacterium, klebsiella, lactobacillus, clostridium, bacillus, eubacterium, serratia, citrobacter, enterobacter, pectobacterium and pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the ntcs using universal pcr-dgge analysis. a number of the sequences detected by lab-specific pcr-dgge were homologous to those of a number of lactobacillus spp., including l. fermentum, l. pontis, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, l. casei, l. suntoryeus, l. vaginalis, l. gasseri, l. aviaries, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. mucosae  in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. while ntcs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the ntc cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. pcr-dgge proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. in conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or pcr-dgge alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of ntcs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype ntcs during their development, pcr-dgge overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and  unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. this study demonstrated that pcr-dgge is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various ntcs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during ntc production.

TI  == effects of extracts of miswak and derum on proliferation of balb/c 3t3 fibroblasts and viability of cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == objectives: this study examined the effects of extracts of two chewing sticks on  proliferation of fibroblasts and viability of cariogenic bacteria. methods: aqueous extracts of miswak (salvadora persica; arak tree) and derum (juglans regia; walnut tree) were prepared and their effects investigated on growth of balb/c 3t3 mouse fibroblasts by measuring the mitochondrial succinic dehydrogenase activity. furthermore, the effects on the viability of various cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus casei and actinomyces viscosus) was also determined. results: the data revealed that balb/c 3t3 fibroblasts exposed to aqueous extracts of miswak or derum showed an increase in cell proliferation by 156% and 255%, respectively, in comparison with controls (p < 0.0001). furthermore, extracts from both miswak  and derum had adverse effects on the growth of the cariogenic microorganisms, with derum having significantly greater antimicrobial effects than miswak and at  much lower concentrations against all the bacteria tested. the most sensitive organisms were a. viscosus, followed by s. mutans, s. salivarius, with l. casei being the most resistant. conclusion: the results show that aqueous extracts of miswak and derum enhance the growth of fibroblasts and inhibit the growth of cariogenic bacteria, with the derum extract showing greater activity than miswak.

TI  == the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence.
AB  == some novel caries detection and excavation devices rely on the ability of bacteria to produce red fluorescing compounds. the aim of this study was to examine the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence. streptococcus mutans, s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus fermentans, l. casei, l. rhamnosus, actinomyces naeslundi, a. israelii, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum were inoculated onto columbia  agar with haemin and vitamin k and incubated anaerobically for up to 7 days in the dark. the resulting bacterial colonies were excited using filtered xenon light (405 +/- 20 nm) and digitally photographed through a 530-nm high-pass filter. the red and green portions of the colony fluorescence were analyzed using a computer program and the red/green ratio was calculated. all colonies emitted both red and green fluorescence. the green outweighed the red portion for the following species (in descending order) s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. mutans, f. nucleatum and s. sobrinus. the red portion was higher for the following species (in descending order) p. intermedia, a. naeslundi, a. israelii, l. fermentans, l. rhamnosus and l. casei. with all the bacteria examined, one color portion generally outweighed the other, giving the visual impression of either red or green fluorescence. we conclude that red fluorescence is well suited to detection of the bacteria which cause dentin caries but it is not suitable as an indicator  of the presence and activity of the streptococci involved in initial caries.

TI  == [the effect of galla chinensis on the growth of cariogenic bacteria in vitro].
AB  == objective: the purples of this study was to investigate the role of different components of galla chinensis extract on the growth of 6 kinds of cariogenic bacteria, and to find out the most effective components of galla chinensis extract. methods: four different components (gce1, gce2, gce3 and gce4) were separated from galla chinensis and there antibacterial activities to streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556, streptococcus  salivarius ss 196, actinomyces naeslundii wvu 627, actinomyces viscosus atcc 19246 and lactobacillus rhamnosus ac 413 were checked. there effects on the growth curve of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 were also investigated. results:  the most effective part of galla chinensis was found to be gce2 and gce4, which were found to be a mixture of polyphenol-rich fractions. all of the different components had an inhibitory effect to the growth of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175. conclusion: all of the 4 different components of galla chinensis extract could inhibit the growth of the tested bacteria. these results suggest that the antibacterial activity of galla chinensis extract is caused by a synergistic effect of monomeric polyphenols, which can easily bind to proteins.

TI  == the acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacterial species associated with childhood caries.
AB  == although substantial epidemiologic evidence links streptococcus mutans to caries, the pathobiology of caries may involve more complex communities of bacterial species. molecular methods for bacterial identification and enumeration now make  it possible to more precisely study the microbiota associated with dental caries. the purpose of this study was to compare the bacteria found in early childhood caries (ecc) to those found in caries-free children by using molecular identification methods. cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16s ribosomal dnas from a healthy subject and a subject with ecc were used for identification of novel species or uncultivated phylotypes and species not previously associated with dental caries. ten novel phylotypes were identified. a number of species or  phylotypes that may play a role in health or disease were identified and warrant  further investigation. in addition, quantitative measurements for 23 previously known bacterial species or species groups were obtained by a reverse capture checkerboard assay for 30 subjects with caries and 30 healthy controls. significant differences were observed for nine species: s. sanguinis was associated with health and, in order of decreasing cell numbers, actinomyces gerencseriae, bifidobacterium, s. mutans, veillonella, s. salivarius, s. constellatus, s. parasanguinis, and lactobacillus fermentum were associated with  caries. these data suggest that a. gerencseriae and other actinomyces species may play an important role in caries initiation and that a novel bifidobacterium may  be a major pathogen in deep caries. further investigation could lead to the identification of targets for biological interventions in the caries process and  thereby contribute to improved prevention of and treatment for this significant public health problem.

TI  == inhibitory effect of zncl(2) on glycolysis in human oral microbes.
AB  == although the inhibition of bacterial glycolysis by zinc ions might be expected to moderate dental caries, there has not been a comparison of the effect of zn on different organisms under both fixed ph and free-fall conditions. here, the effect of zncl(2) on streptococcus salivarius, strep. mutans, strep. sobrinus, actinomyces naeslundii and lactobacillus casei, as well as on mixtures of oral organisms outgrown from human dental plaque and saliva, was surveyed. ph-stat experiments were performed at ph 7, 6 or 5 in a solution containing 5% glucose and a suspension of the test organism; ph-fall experiments started at ph 7. in both cases, acid production was monitored for 60 min, when samples were taken for zn and lactate determinations. under ph-stat conditions, acid production was inhibited by zn most strongly in strep. sobrinus and strep. salivarius. in terms  of total acid production averted, however, the effect of zn under both ph-stat and ph-fall conditions was clearly greatest with strep. salivarius. a. naeslundii was inhibited the least strongly under ph-stat conditions. cultured oral organism mixtures were more sensitive to moderate concentrations of zinc (0.2-0.3mm initial concentration) than were the single species to higher concentrations (1mm). packed cell layers responded to zn quite differently from suspensions, the ph often falling in the presence of 1mm zn at a rate similar to the no zn control. as streptococci had the highest acidogenesis rates in both ph-stat and ph-fall experiments, it seems likely that inhibition of acid production with these organisms would be of more value in moderating caries than the inhibition of less acidogenic organisms such as a. naeslundii.

TI  == identification by 16s rrna gene sequencing of lactobacillus salivarius bacteremic cholecystitis.
AB  == an anaerobic, nonsporulating, gram-positive bacterium was isolated from blood and bile pus cultures of a 70-year-old man with bacteremic acute cholecystitis. the api 20a system showed that it was 70% actinomyces naeslundii and 30% bifidobacterium species, whereas the vitek ani system and the atb id32a expression system showed that it was "unidentified." the 16s rrna gene of the strain was amplified and sequenced. there were 3 base differences between the nucleotide sequence of the isolate and that of lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius or l. salivarius subsp. salicinius, indicating that the isolate was a  strain of l. salivarius. the patient responded to cholecystectomy and a 2-week course of antibiotic treatment. identification of the organism in the present study was important because the duration of antibiotic therapy would have been entirely different depending on the organism. if the bacterium had been identified as actinomyces, penicillin for 6 months would have been the regimen of choice. however, it was lactobacillus, and a 2-week course of antibiotic was sufficient.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  == bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of  ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.

TI  == alteration of the coadherence of candida albicans with oral bacteria by dietary sugars.
AB  == interactions between bacterial oral flora and candida albicans are important in denture plaque formation. this study therefore first aimed to quantify the coadherence of c. albicans and bacteria by the use of a bioluminescent adenosine  triphosphate (atp) assay based on the firefly luciferase-luciferin system. the second aim was to examine the effect of i) dietary sugars (used for preculture) and ii) enzymatic digestion of fungi on the coadherence. when yeast was preincubated in yeast nitrogen base medium (ynb) supplemented with 250 mm glucose, the yeast coadhered with all isolates of streptoccus mutans and streptococcus sanguis, and no significant coadhesion was observed with the isolates of streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus and actinomyces. however, when the yeast was precultured in ynb supplemented with 500 mm galactose, the yeast coadhered with s. salivarius and actinomyces, which was not observed when the yeast was grown in ynb with glucose. in addition, the coadherence of the yeast with the isolates of s. sanguis was significantly reduced. enzymatic digestion of yeast and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay revealed that expression of at least two types of proteinaceous adhesins are involved in these phenomena.

AB  == this study examined the antibacterial activities of the bonding systems syntac, ebs and scotchbond 1, the polyacid-modified composite resins hytac and compoglass, and the composite resins tetric, z100 and scalp-it. they were evaluated using the cariogenic bacteria streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus salivarius, streptococcus sorbinus and actinomyces viscosus in vitro with a modified cylinder drop plate agar diffusion assay. all adhesives of the dentin bonding systems and the polyacid-modified composite resins exhibited various degrees of antibacterial activity against all of the test bacteria. on the contrary, composite resins did not affect bacterial growth. the data suggest that the use of these adhesives and polyacid-modified composite resins may reduce the  consequences of microleakage owing to their antibacterial properties.

TI  == acid-regulated proteins induced by streptococcus mutans and other oral bacteria during acid shock.
AB  == our previous research has demonstrated that with the more aciduric oral bacteria, an acid shock to sub-lethal ph values results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that protects the cells at extremely low ph (ph 3.0-4.0) that  kills unadapted control cells maintained at ph 7.5 (oral microbiol immunol 1997:  12: 266-273). in this study, we were interested in comparing the protein profiles of acid-shocked and control cells of nine organisms from three acid-ogenic genera that could be categorized as strong, weak and non-acid responders in an attempt to identify proteins that could be classified as acid-regulated proteins and which may be important in the process of survival at very low ph. for this, log-phase cultures were rapidly acidified from ph 7.5 to 5.5 in the presence of [14c]-amino acids for varying periods up to 2 h, the period previously shown to be required for maximum induction of the acid response. the cells were extracted  for total protein and subjected to one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide chromatography with comparable control and acid-shocked protein profiles compared by scanning and computer analysis. of particular interest were the proteins in the acid-shocked cells that showed enhanced labeling (i.e., synthesis) over the control cells, since these were considered acid-regulated proteins of importance in ph homeostasis. streptococcus mutans lt11 generated the most rapid and complex pattern: a total of 36 acid-regulated proteins showing enhanced synthesis, with 25 appearing within the first 30 min of acid shock. the enhanced synthesis was transient with all proteins, with the exception of two with molecular weights of 50/49 and 33/32 kda. within the acid-regulated proteins were proteins having molecular weights comparable to the  heat shock proteins and the various subunits of the membrane h+/atpase. by comparison, the strong responder, lactobacillus casei 151, showed the enhanced formation of only nine proteins within the first 30 min of the acid shock, with a total of 11 acid-regulated proteins formed during the 2-h adaptation period with  enhanced synthesis transient for seven of these proteins. streptococcus salivarius at2 and streptococcus gordonii th12 had the formation of 6 and 8 proteins enhanced, while the weakly responding organisms, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10,556 and streptococcus oralis atcc 10,557, exhibited 8 and 6 such proteins, respectively. even non-responding strains unable to survive at very low ph, such as streptococcus sobrinus ch125/43, streptococcus mitis atcc 12,261 and  actinomyces naeslundii 301-13 showed the initial formation of 3-9 acid-regulated  proteins, but protein synthesis was not sustained over the entire adaptation period. clearly, the survival of oral bacteria at very low ph is related, not to  the total number of the acid-regulated proteins induced per se but to the formation of key proteins that function to augment normal ph homeostasis.

TI  == inhibition of purified enolases from oral bacteria by fluoride.
AB  == enolase activity in strains of oral streptococci previously has been found to be  inhibited by 50% (ki) by fluoride concentrations ranging from 50 to 300 microm or more in the presence of 0.5 to 1.0 mm inorganic phosphate ions. in this study, enolase was extracted and partly purified by a two-step process from five oral bacterial species and the effect of fluoride on the kinetics of enolase examined. the molecular weight of the putative enolase proteins was 46-48 kda. the vmax values ranged from 20 to 323 iu/mg and k(m) for glycerate-2-phosphate from 0.22 to 0.74 mm. enolase activity was inhibited competitively by fluoride, with ki values ranging from 16 to 54 microm in the presence of 5 mm inorganic phosphate ions. ki values for phosphate ranged from 2 to 8 mm. the enolase from streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556 was more sensitive to fluoride (ki = 16 +/- 2) than was enolase from streptococcus salivarius atcc 10575 (ki = 19 +/- 2) or streptococcus mutans nctc 10449 (ki = 40 +/- 4) and all three streptococcal strains were more sensitive to fluoride than either actinomyces naeslundii wvu 627 (ki = 46 +/- 6) or lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469 (ki = 54 +/- 6) enolases. the levels of fluoride found to inhibit the streptococcal enolases in this study are much lower than previously reported and are likely to be present in plaque, especially during acidogenesis, and could exert an anti-glycolytic effect.

TI  == salivacin 140, a novel bacteriocin from lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius t140 active against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == fifteen of 353 environmental isolates of lactic acid bacteria consistently showed activity against listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and/or propionibacterium acnes. strain t140, isolated from the surface  of japanese pampas grass leaves and identified as lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius, also had activity against several lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus and yersinia enterocolitica. since the antagonistic factor(s) produced by t140 was sensitive to a proteolytic enzyme, it was concluded that a bacteriocin (named salivacin 140) was involved in the inhibition activity. strain t140 required a high initial ph (7.5-8.5) in agar plates for bacteriocin production.

TI  == microbial induction of dentinal caries in human teeth in vitro.
AB  == the ability of lactobacillus casei, streptococcus sobrinus, actinomyces viscosus, and streptococcus salivarius to induce dental caries was determined in vitro. a class i cavity (depth: 2mm) was prepared in extracted human caries-free premolars to make dentin blocks. the blocks were inoculated with these four bacterial strains in a monoinfective fashion and were incubated under anaerobic conditions. in addition to the monoinfection groups, mixed-infection groups of l. casei with  s. sobrinus or a. viscosus were also prepared. half of the culture medium was renewed every 3 days, and the ph of the medium was measured. after 4 or 12 wk, these dentin blocks were prepared by brown-brenn staining and by contact microradiography for light microscopic observation and for immunohistochemical staining. the final ph of the s. salivarius group was the highest among the experimental groups, at approximately 5.1; that of the others was approximately 4.3. bacterial invasion into the dentinal tubules was observed in all but the s.  salivarius group. among the monoinfection groups, the s. sobrinus group showed the highest invasion rate, followed by the a. viscosus group and the l. casei group. the invasion rate was also high in the mixed-infection groups. immunohistochemical staining revealed invasion only by l. casei, and not by s. sobrinus and a. viscosus. the invasion rate by l. casei was higher in the mixed-infection group with either s. sobrinus or a. viscosus than in the monoinfection groups. these findings suggest that lactobacillus might play an important role in the initiation and progress of dentinal caries, and that this bacterial species might exhibit a cooperative cariogenicity when it coexists with other bacterial species that surpasses its individual cariogenicity.

AB  == the ability of oral lactobacilli to coaggregate with streptococci and actinomycetes was investigated. of the 7 species of lactobacilli studied, only two were capable of coaggregation and the coaggregation was restricted to streptococci. lactobacillus salivarius strains (2/4) coaggregated with streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus crista and tufted streptococcus sanguis ii strains. lactobacillus fermentum (2/3) coaggregated with s. gordonii and s. sanguis. the coaggregation between l. salivarius and s. salivarius, s. gordonii or tufted s. sanguis ii strains was mediated by a protein on the surface of the lactobacilli and was not inhibited by lactose. the coaggregation between l. fermentum and the streptococci was mediated by protein on the surface of the streptococci and was inhibited by lactose.

TI  == antibacterial activity of dentinal bonding agents.
AB  == the susceptibility of five bacterial species to seven dentinal bonding agents was examined in vitro. agar diffusion tests using filterpaper disks containing 10 microl each of conditioner, primer, or resin were performed on blood agar and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar. chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. after incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. of  all the compounds tested, gluma cleanser and gluma etchant showed the strongest growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. no antibacterial effect was noted for prisma universal bond 2 and superlux universal bond 2 systems. the primers of gluma, denthesive, and scotchbond 2 displayed antibacterial activity that, in some cases, was comparable to that of 0.2% chlorhexidine. zones of inhibition were seen for the resin materials of scotchbond 2 and tripton with streptococcus  mutans, streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces viscosus. no inhibition was seen after these resins were cured, whereas the antibacterial effect of xr-bond on s sanguis and a viscosus was not affected by light curing.

TI  == multibacterial artificial plaque. a model for studying carious process.
AB  == a multibacterial artificial plaque was established in vitro on enamel slabs incubated in mixed culture of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans (serotype c), streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus casei and actinomyces viscosus. typical structure same as natural plaque was seen under microscope. the caries-like lesion produced under the plaque was observed in enamel sections. the lesion was similar in appearance to natural ones under optic and scanning electron microscopes. the acids produced in both culture media and artificial plaque were similar in composition and type to those produced in natural plaque after sugar attack. it is suggested that this kind of plaque model may be useful  in studying carious process in vitro, because it is easily controlled either by changing the composition of bacteria or by adding different kinds of nutrient in  the media. moreover, the results will be easier to explain than those produced in natural ones.

TI  == the influence of sucralose on bacterial metabolism.
AB  == sucralose (1',4',6' trideoxy-trichloro-galactosucrose) is a nontoxic, intensely sweet sucrose derivative that has been shown to be non-cariogenic in experimental animals. the purpose of this study was to determine whether certain oral bacteria could utilize sucralose. sucralose, as a sole carbon source, was unable to support growth of ten strains of oral bacteria and dental plaque. when sucrolose  was incorporated into a liquid medium containing glucose or sucrose, all organisms tested displayed similar ph falls, compared with controls. the incorporation of 126 mmol/l sucralose into glucose agar medium caused total inhibition of growth of streptococcus sobrinus 6715-17, streptococcus sanguis 10904, streptococcus sanguis challis, streptococcus salivarius, and actinomyces viscosus wvu627. sucralose had no effect on ips production. sucralose was not bound to, nor taken up by, cells. sucralose inhibited the formation of glucan and fructan polymers in proportion to the sucralose-to-enzyme ratio, but independent  of the sucrose concentration in the assay mixture. no radioactive polymer was formed from 14c-u-sucralose added to mixtures containing glucosyltransferase (gtf) or fructosyl-transferase (ftf). inhibition of gtf and ftf by sucralose was  removed following dialysis of the enzyme/sucralose mixture. these results show that sucralose was not utilized by the oral bacteria tested and that the inhibitory effect of sucralose on gtf and ftf was non-competitive and reversible. the results further support the concept that sucralose is non-cariogenic.

TI  == bacterial involvement in denture-induced stomatitis.
AB  == denture and mucosal plaque samples were collected from eight full-denture wearers of whom four suffered from denture-induced stomatitis (dis). cultures were made,  and a proportional identification to species level was carried out of bacteria and yeasts. an inventory was made of the predominant flora. results showed that the predominant microflora of both groups, both on dentures and the denture-bearing mucosa, consisted mainly of gram-positive bacteria. differences in the proportions of cocci were found between the predominant bacterial flora on the dentures. in the control group, 69% of the denture flora consisted of cocci,  while on the dentures of the dis group a mean of 33% cocci was found. neither group of palates revealed any differences in the proportions of cocci. on these locations a mean of 69% was found. the plaque of dentures and the palates of the  healthy group showed means of 35% and 31%, respectively, of obligate anaerobic bacteria, while in the dis group these percentages were 56% and 43%, respectively. no obligately aerobic bacteria were found. candida species was detected in both groups, both on dentures and palates in very low numbers (dis group, median palates 0.02%, median dentures 0.25%). the predominant organisms were streptococcus species, of which s. salivarius was mostly present on the palates of both groups. other species which were regularly found at different locations were veillonella parvula and species of lactobacillus, bacteroides, and actinomyces.

TI  == degradation of starch and its hydrolytic products by oral bacteria.
AB  == selected strains of oral bacteria were analyzed for their ability to degrade wheat starch, maltose, maltotriose, and maltoheptaose. s. sanguis iuom-11m and jc804, s. mutans 6715, s. salivarius iuom-8, a. viscosus iuom-62, and a. naeslundii atcc 12104 degraded all four substrates. s. mutans nctc 10449 degraded starch, maltose, and maltotriose, while a. viscosus atcc 15987 degraded starch and maltose, and s. sanguis ss34 degraded only maltose. l. casei iuom-14 did not  degrade any of the substrates. analysis of starch degradation products from s. sanguis iuom-11m and a. viscosus iuom-62 demonstrated oligosaccharides, maltose,  and trace amounts of glucose for the former and oligosaccharides, maltotriose, and maltose for the latter. s. sanguis iuom-11m alpha-glucosidase (ec 3.2.1.20) demonstrated a ph optimum of 6.5 and greatly enhanced activity from maltose-cultured cells as compared with cells cultured in glucose or fructose. the presence of fructose in the growth medium prevented this enhancement of activity by maltose. maltose inhibited sucrose-dependent synthesis of s. sanguis  iuom-11m insoluble polysaccharide and both primer-dependent and primer-independent synthesis of soluble polysaccharide. maltoheptaose inhibited primer-dependent but not primer-independent soluble polysaccharide synthesis. several oral bacteria have the ability to hydrolyze starch and to degrade further the products to acidogenic substrates. these products may also inhibit sucrose-dependent synthesis of polysaccharides, which enhances the production of  the acidogenic substrate fructose. the results add further support to the growing body of evidence suggesting that caries-promoting properties of starch may be expressed only when starch is present in diets containing sucrose.

TI  == effect of monoclonal antibodies against lipoteichoic acid from the oral bacterium streptococcus mutans on its adhesion and plaque-accumulation in vitro.
AB  == five monoclonal antibodies directed against streptococcus mutans strain jbp lipoteichoic acid (lta) were characterized. they were all similarly reactive with the immunizing lta-containing extract, with intact strep. mutans jbp cells and with lta purified from lactobacillus casei. immobilized anti-lta antibodies removes lta from lta-containing extracts. the binding of antibodies to lta was inhibited by the aqueous extract but not by the organic extract of de-acylated lta, indicating reactivity with the polyglycerol-phosphate portion of the molecule. antibodies were reactive with all serotypes of strep. mutans, as well as with strains of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis and l. casei,  but not with lta-negative species streptococcus mitis or actinomyces viscosus. anti-lta antibodies at doses of 0.3 or 3.0 micrograms/ml, had no effect on the adherence of strep. mutans jbp to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite, but enhanced adherence 150-300 per cent at 30 micrograms/ml. there was no effect of anti-lta antibodies in a chemostat model which measured sucrose-dependent plaque accumulation by strep. mutans. the results argue against a major role for lta in strep. mutans adherence or plaque accumulation in vitro.

AB  == streptococcus mutans alone or cell-free glucosyltransferase (g-tase)-together with either streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces viscosus, or lactobacillus casei cells-formed artificial dental plaque that firmly adhered to glass electrodes in a continuous culture system containing sucrose. the ph in these artificial plaque samples decreased more than did that of the surrounding medium. in the absence of gtase, the bacteria other than s. mutans did not form firmly-adhering plaque on glass electrodes. the ph of the plaque formed with gtase alone did not show the ph decrease seen when the plaque  contained bacteria, but, because it catalyzed the synthesis of glucan, it is suggested that the glucan acts as a diffusion barrier to retard acid loss from plaque containing acid-producing bacteria.

TI  == sucrase and maltase activities in supragingival dental plaque in humans of streptococcal, actinomyces and lactobacilli species.
AB  == 20 reference strains and 72 isolated strains from dental plaque of streptococci,  actinomyces, and lactobacilli species were examined for sucrase and maltase activities. the type of sucrase in the different strains was determined by use of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, acarbose. the enzyme activities were determined  as formation of monosaccharide, and quantitated spectrophotometrically. although  variations occurred in enzyme activities between reference and isolated strains,  the same general pattern was noticed. strains of streptococcus mutans and s. salivarius showed regularly the highest sucrase activities, followed by strains of actinomyces viscosus and a. naeslundii. most lactobacilli belonged to the bacteria with low sucrase activity like s. sanguis and s. mitior. in some lactobacilli strains, however, a high sucrase activity was observed. the level of sucrase activity in s. mutans strains was dependent on biotype/serotype, as strains of biotype v/serotype e showed high activities, biotypes i and iv corresponding to serotypes c, f, and d showed intermediate activity, and biotype  iii/serotype a always showed low activity. in most of the strains the sucrases were composed of enzymes with specificity against both alpha-glucosidic linkage and beta-fructosidic linkage of the sucrose molecule, but in varying ratios. in all species, exept s. sanguis and s. mitior, lower maltase than sucrase activity  was observed, but even in the two species mentioned the maltase activities were relatively low. on the basis of observations of selected reference strains in every species examined both sucrases and maltases are to some extent inducible.

TI  == role of bacterial interactions in the colonization of oral surfaces of actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == the effects of several microbial residents of human oral cavities on the attachment of actinomyces viscosus t14v to tooth surfaces were assessed by using  the saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha) in vitro system. attachment to sha by a. viscosus t14v was not inhibited in the presence of streptococcus mutans gs5, either in the presence or absence of sucrose. precoating sha beads with s. mutans in the presence of sucrose also did not retard strain t14v attachment. however, the presence of streptococcus sanguis m5 during strain t14v attachment markedly inhibited the interaction of a. viscosus t14v with sha, whereas another s. sanguis strain, strain g9b, produced relatively weak inhibition. the inhibitory effect of s. sanguis m5 appeared to result from the direct interaction of this organism with a. viscosus t14v. conversely, the presence of strain t14v markedly  increased the attachment of s. sanguis m5 to sha while partially inhibiting the attachment of s. sanguis g9b. moreover, sha beads precoated with a. viscosus t14v bound much higher levels of s. sanguis m5 relative to uncoated sha, whereas s. sanguis g9b attachment was only weakly inhibited. it was also observed that sha beads precoated with either s. sanguis m5 or g9b inhibited subsequent attachment  by strain t14v. these results suggest the possibility that the attachment sites for both s. sanguis strains partially overlap those for a. viscosus t14v. streptococcus mitis weakly inhibited attachment of strain t14v to sha, and both streptococcus salivarius and lactobacillus casei had little effect on attachment. in addition, both a radioisotope attachment assay and fluorescent microscopy demonstrated no significant attachment of a. viscosus t14v to human epithelial cells.

AB  == the lectin concanavalin a (con a) agglutinated the cells of 13 of 15 strains of the seven serotypes of streptococcus mutans in an 18-h incubation period. strains of types a, d, f, and g agglutinated within 2 h. strains of a, d, and f were also agglutinated in 2 h by the castor bean lectin rca. s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s.  bovis, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, and lactobacillus plantarum were agglutinated within 2 h. the s. mutans type f polysaccharide was precipitated by  con a. the a, b, c, d, and e polysaccharides were not precipitated. glucan from d and e strains of s. mutans and dextran t2000 were also precipitated by con a. d-glucose inhibited the agglutination of type f cells by con a and the agglutination of type d cells by d-galactose. the quantity of [acetyl-3h]con a bound was not proportional to the degree of agglutination. cells grown in sucrose medium bound more con a than those grown in glucose medium. after treatment with  dextranase, the sucrose-grown cells bound two- to fourfold more con a. the binding of con a to the type-specific polysaccharide or to teichoic acid could not be determined by the use of specific antibody due to the binding of con a to  the antibody globulin on the cell surface. con a bound to s. mutans cells did not inhibit the activity of cell-bound glucosyltransferase, glucan synthesis, and in  vitro adherence. bound con a also did not inhibit the ability of heat-treated cells to bind glucosyltransferase, synthesize glucan, and produce in vitro adherence.

TI  == immunoadjuvant activities of cell walls and their water-soluble fractions prepared from various gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the cell walls from all 21 species of gram-positive bacteria examined, except lysozyme-susceptible micrococcus lysodeikticus (nctc 2665) and lysozyme-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (atcc 155), were found to be definitely adjuvant-active in both stimulation of increased serum antibody levels and induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity to ovalbumin when administered to guinea-pigs as water-in-oil emulsions. using various cell wall lytic enzymes, the immunoadjuvant principles were solubilized with full retention of the adjuvant activities from walls of staphylococcus aureus (copenhagen), streptococcus pyogens (group a, type 6; s43/100), streptococcus salivarius (ifo 3350), streptococcus faecalis (ifo 12580), streptococcus mutans (bht), lactobacillus plantarum (atcc 8014), bacillus megaterium (ifo 12068), corynebacterium diphtheriae (park-williams no. 8), mycobacterium smegmatis, and actinomyces viscous (atcc 15987). evidence was obtained that the non-peptidoglycan portion of the cell walls is not essential for manifestation of immunoadjuvancy.

TI  == evaluation of human oral organisms and pathogenic streptococcus for production of iga protease.
AB  == iga protease is a proteolytic enzyme found in whole human saliva and in dental plaque that cleaves both secretory and myeloma iga of human origin to yield intact fabalpha and fcalpha fragments. to determine which bacteria are capable of producing this enzyme, we have examined a variety of strains normally found in the human oral cavity and a number of streptococci of known lancefield group serotype. streptococci of groups a, b, c, d, f, g, h, m, and n, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus faecalis, veillonella, lactobacillus, actinomyces, propionibacterium, bacteroides, and fusobacterium were grown in liquid medium, and fluids were examined for iga protease activity. only s. sanguis and clinically isolated group h streptococci elaborated iga protease under the culture conditions used. negative strains could not be stimulated to produce the  enzyme when cultured in the presence of secretory iga. among the natural oral bacteria, capacity to produce iga protease is restricted to certain species of streptococcus, notably those of the group h serotype. since secretory immunity is mediated by the iga class of antibody, the presence of this enzyme at mucosal surfaces could modify the secretory immune function.

TI  == mutanolysin, bacteriolytic agent for cariogenic streptococci: partial purification and properties.
AB  == mutanolysin partially purified from the culture filtrate of streptomyces globisporus 1829 consists of two main lytic enzymes with an isoelectric point near ph 8.5 and 10, respectively, and proteolytic enzyme is associated with the latter lytic enzyme. mutanolysin exhibited maximal lytic activity at 60 c in the  ph range 6.5 to 7.0 and was stable at 50 c in the acid range. n-bromosuccinimide  caused complete inhibition of lytic activity at 1 mm, whereas calcium and magnesium ions at the same concentration caused activation. mutanolysin had lytic or bactericidal activity against the living cells of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus, which are considered to be etiologic agents of dental caries, but had no activity against s. aureus and all gram-negative strains tested. the lytic activity was well retained in human saliva. digestion of the cell walls of s. mutans bht by mutanolysin was accompanied by the liberation of free amino groups and reducing sugars. mutanolysin may be expected to be a useful agent for dental caries control.
