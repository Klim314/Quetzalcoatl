TI  == occurrence of pathogens in wild rodents caught on swedish pig and chicken farms.
AB  == a total of 207 wild rodents were caught on nine pig farms, five chicken farms and five non-farm locations in sweden and surveyed for a selection of bacteria, parasites and viruses. lawsonia intracellularia and pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica were only detected in rodents on pig farms (9% and 8% prevalence,  respectively) which indicate that these agents are more likely to be transmitted  to rodents from pigs or the environment on infected farms. brachyspira hyodysenteriae (1%), brachyspira intermedia (2%), campylobacter jejuni (4%), campylobacter upsaliensis (2%), leptospires (7%) and encephalomyocarditis virus (9%) were also detected from rodents not in contact with farm animals. giardia and cryptosporidium spp. were common, although no zoonotic types were verified, and salmonella enterica was isolated from 1/11 mice on one farm but not detected  by pcr from any of the rodents. trichinella spp. and toxoplasma gondii were not detected.
