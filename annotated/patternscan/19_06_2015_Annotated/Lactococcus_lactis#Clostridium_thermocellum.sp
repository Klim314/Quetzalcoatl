TI  == effects of synthetic cohesin-containing scaffold protein architecture on binding  dockerin-enzyme fusions on the surface of lactococcus lactis.
AB  == background: the microbial synthesis of fuels, commodity chemicals, and bioactive  compounds necessitates the assemblage of multiple enzyme activities to carry out  sequential chemical reactions, often via substrate channeling by means of multi-domain or multi-enzyme complexes. engineering the controlled incorporation  of enzymes in recombinant protein complexes is therefore of interest. the cellulosome of clostridium thermocellum is an extracellular enzyme complex that efficiently hydrolyzes crystalline cellulose. enzymes interact with protein scaffolds via type 1 dockerin/cohesin interactions, while scaffolds in turn bind  surface anchor proteins by means of type 2 dockerin/cohesin interactions, which demonstrate a different binding specificity than their type 1 counterparts. recombinant chimeric scaffold proteins containing cohesins of different specificity allow binding of multiple enzymes to specific sites within an engineered complex. results: we report the successful display of engineered chimeric scaffold proteins containing both type 1 and type 2 cohesins on the surface of lactococcus lactis cells. the chimeric scaffold proteins were able to  form complexes with the escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase fused to either type  1 or type 2 dockerin, and differences in binding efficiencies were correlated with scaffold architecture. we used e. coli beta-galactosidase, also fused to type 1 or type 2 dockerins, to demonstrate the targeted incorporation of two enzymes into the complexes. the simultaneous binding of enzyme pairs each containing a different dockerin resulted in bi-enzymatic complexes tethered to the cell surface. the sequential binding of the two enzymes yielded insights into parameters affecting assembly of the complex such as protein size and position within the scaffold. conclusions: the spatial organization of enzymes into complexes is an important strategy for increasing the efficiency of biochemical pathways. in this study, chimeric protein scaffolds consisting of type 1 and type 2 cohesins anchored on the surface of l. lactis allowed for the controlled positioning of dockerin-fused reporter enzymes onto the scaffolds. by binding single enzymes or enzyme pairs to the scaffolds, our data also suggest that the size and relative positions of enzymes can affect the catalytic profiles of the resulting complexes. these insights will be of great value as we engineer more advanced scaffold-guided protein complexes to optimize biochemical pathways.

TI  == engineering the cell surface display of cohesins for assembly of cellulosome-inspired enzyme complexes on lactococcus lactis.
AB  == background: the assembly and spatial organization of enzymes in naturally occurring multi-protein complexes is of paramount importance for the efficient degradation of complex polymers and biosynthesis of valuable products. the degradation of cellulose into fermentable sugars by clostridium thermocellum is achieved by means of a multi-protein "cellulosome" complex. assembled via dockerin-cohesin interactions, the cellulosome is associated with the cell surface during cellulose hydrolysis, forming ternary cellulose-enzyme-microbe complexes for enhanced activity and synergy. the assembly of recombinant cell surface displayed cellulosome-inspired complexes in surrogate microbes is highly  desirable. the model organism lactococcus lactis is of particular interest as it  has been metabolically engineered to produce a variety of commodity chemicals including lactic acid and bioactive compounds, and can efficiently secrete an array of recombinant proteins and enzymes of varying sizes. results: fragments of the scaffoldin protein cipa were functionally displayed on the cell surface of lactococcus lactis. scaffolds were engineered to contain a single cohesin module, two cohesin modules, one cohesin and a cellulose-binding module, or only a cellulose-binding module. cell toxicity from over-expression of the proteins was  circumvented by use of the nisa inducible promoter, and incorporation of the c-terminal anchor motif of the streptococcal m6 protein resulted in the successful surface-display of the scaffolds. the facilitated detection of successfully secreted scaffolds was achieved by fusion with the export-specific reporter staphylococcal nuclease (nuca). scaffolds retained their ability to associate in vivo with an engineered hybrid reporter enzyme, e. coli beta-glucuronidase fused to the type 1 dockerin motif of the cellulosomal enzyme  cels. surface-anchored complexes exhibited dual enzyme activities (nuclease and beta-glucuronidase), and were displayed with efficiencies approaching 104 complexes/cell. conclusions: we report the successful display of cellulosome-inspired recombinant complexes on the surface of lactococcus lactis.  significant differences in display efficiency among constructs were observed and  attributed to their structural characteristics including protein conformation and solubility, scaffold size, and the inclusion and exclusion of non-cohesin modules. the surface-display of functional scaffold proteins described here represents a key step in the development of recombinant microorganisms capable of carrying out a variety of metabolic processes including the direct conversion of  cellulosic substrates into fuels and chemicals.

TI  == expression of clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase gene in lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus johnsonii and characterization of the genetically modified probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == endoglucanase a from clostridium thermocellum resistant to pancreatic proteinase  was selected out of a range of microbial cellulases expressed in lactobacilli. two lactobacillus-e. coli expression vectors, harboring the endoglucanase gene from c. thermocellum under the control of its own promoter (psd1) and the lactococcus lactis lac a promoter (psd2), were constructed separately. intestinal lactobacillus strains, l. gasseri and l. johnsonii, were electrotransformed with  psd1 and psd2, and the stability of each plasmid was evaluated. the endoglucanase activities of 0.722 and 0.759 u/ml were respectively found in culture medium of l. gasseri and l. johnsonii containing psd1, and of 0.407 u/ml in medium of l. gasseri harboring psd2. when the probiotic characteristics such as acid-tolerance, bile-salt tolerance, and antibiotic susceptibility were investigated, l. gasseri and l. johnsonii were resistant to low phs of 2 and 3. also, l. johnsonii was bile-salt resistant in the presence of 0.5% oxgall and porcine bile extract. l. johnsonii and l. gasseri showed a rather homogeneous resistant pattern against tested antibiotics. both strains were resistant to amikacin, bacitracin, gentamicin, streptomycin, kanamycin, and colistin.
