TI  == [profile and susceptibility to antibiotics in urinary tract infections in children and newborns from 2012 to 2013: data from 1879 urine cultures].
AB  == introduction: we present recent data on the bacteriological profile and antibiotic susceptibility of uropathogenic bacteria isolated in children and newborns in our region over the past 2years. materials and methods: a retrospective study on the positive urine cultures from pediatric and neonatal populations during 2012-2013. bacteria were identified using conventional methods. susceptibility testing was performed and interpreted as recommended by the committee of the susceptibility of the french society of microbiology (ca-sfm). results: we collected 1879 non-redundant bacteria with more than 73% escherichia coli. children and infants (mean age, 32months [range, 1month to 14years]) accounted for 84% of the bacteria collected and newborns (mean age, 12days [range, 1day to 1month]) 16%. a female predominance was observed in the pediatric population (m:f sex ratio, 3.2), whereas for the neonatal population, the proportions were almost identical in both sexes (m:f sex ratio, 1.1). most of the positive urine cultures (n=1234) were from the community. hospitalized patients (n=636) were divided into pediatric (60%) and neonatal units (40%). five bacterial genera dominated the bacteriological profile: e. coli, klebsiella sp.,  proteus sp., enterobacter sp., and enterococcus. the susceptibility of the main bup antibiotics used for treatment of frequent uti showed the effectiveness of furadoine, imipenem, fosfomycin, and colistin. amoxicillin kept constant activity against enterococcus and streptococcus agalactiae. the rates of resistance of enterobacteriaceae to beta-lactam antibiotics were high, especially in the neonatal population. the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) was noted in 12.8% of pediatric enterobacteria vs. 22.6% of the neonatal strains. for community enterobacteriaceae, the activity of beta-lactam antibiotics was limited with 11.2% resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (c3g), including 8.6% esbl production. conclusion: the impact of widespread use of beta-lactam antibiotics in neonatal and pediatric environments is felt. colistin, imipenem, and fosfomycin are the most frequently used antibiotics active against bacteria responsible for neonatal and pediatric uti; however, they cannot be used as probabilistic treatment. nitrofurans seem to be active antibiotics on uti, but they present limits in their use in neonatal and pediatric populations. their indication in case of pyelonephritis should be discussed.

TI  == bacterial community structure associated with elective cesarean section versus vaginal delivery in chinese newborns.
AB  == objectives: increasing attention is being paid to the potential for cesarean birth to influence the taxa of the bacteria that compose the infant intestinal microbiota. the present study characterized the diversity of the intestinal microbiota in newborn infants delivered vaginally (vd) or by cesarean section (cd). methods: a cross-sectional study was performed using fecal specimens collected on days 2 and 4 of postnatal life from 25 vd infants and 16 cd infants. profiles of the fecal microbiota were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis in combination with 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequencing of the clones corresponding to the degenerating gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) bands. results: on days 2 and 4 of postnatal  life, vd and cd infants did not differ in the richness and evenness of the fecal  bacterial community; however, the taxa of the fecal microbiota were significantly different between the 2 groups. in vd infants, escherichia coli, bacteroides sp,  and bifidobacterium longum were the dominant microbes. in cd infants, staphylococcus sp, clostridium sp, enterobacter sp, and streptococcus sp were more common. conclusions: these results demonstrate that delivery method has a profound influence on the structure of the intestinal microbiota in chinese newborn infants. this is in accordance with data reported in other regions.

TI  == chemical composition of essential oil from ripe fruit of schinus terebinthifolius raddi and evaluation of its activity against wild strains of hospital origin.
AB  == the essential oil (eo) composition of ripe fruit of s. terebinthifolius raddi was analyzed by gc-ms. the oil extraction yielded 6.54 +/- 1.06% (w/w). seventeen compounds were identified, accounting for 91.15% of the total oil, where monoterpenes constituted the main chemical class (85.81%), followed by sesquiterpenes (5.34%). the major monoterpene identified was delta-3-carene (30.37%), followed by limonene (17.44%), alpha-phellandrene (12.60%) and alpha-pinene (12.59%). trans-caryophyllene (1.77%) was the major sesquiterpene identified. the antibacterial activity of the essential oil was evaluated against wild strains of hospital origin (escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp., klebsiella oxytoca, corynebacterium sp., staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter sp., enterobacter agglomerans, bacillus sp., nocardia sp. and streptococcus group d).  the essential oil of the ripe fruit of s. terebinthifolius raddi has shown to be  active against all tested wild strains, with minimum inhibitory concentration ranging from 3.55 mug/ml to 56.86 mug/ml. however, it has revealed some differences in susceptibility: the general, gram-positive species showed greater  sensitivity to the action of eo, which is probably due to the lower structural complexity of their cell walls.

TI  == causes, diagnosis and therapy of common diseases in neonatal puppies in the first days of life: cornerstones of practical approach.
AB  == neonatal diseases and losses are a common and often unavoidable problem within breeding kennels. altogether, morbidity and mortality ranges, according to the literature, from 5 to 35%. among non-infectious causes besides hypoxia during birth, hypothermia, hypoglycaemia and dehydration are mostly responsible for puppy diseases and losses. approximately 90% of all deaths in hypoxaemic pups occur during the first 2 days. of 183 pups with hypoxia, 63 died, 92.7% of them within 48 h after birth. among infectious causes, bacterial infection is the most common cause of neonatal mortality. escherichia coli, streptococci, staphylococci, pseudomonas sp., klebsiella sp., enterobacter sp. and some other micro-organisms are regularly involved in neonatal infections. post-mortem findings especially document e. coli, staphylococcus sp. and streptococcus sp. as responsible bacteria. the dam and the environment are suspected as sources of neonatal infections as it was shown by genetic relatedness of responsible bacterial strains isolated in both puppies and their dams. from a total of 517 puppies with bacterial infections, the treatment results documented that parenteral administration of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in 308 neonates showed the best result. diagnosis of diseases is often made difficult by the absence of  variability in clinical signs contrary to adult dogs. findings during a physical  examination in pups differ from those in adults. furthermore, treatment recommendations have to meet the special conditions in neonates concerning drug metabolism and excretion.

TI  == identification of polybacterial communities in patients with postoperative, posttraumatic, and endogenous endophthalmitis through 16s rrna gene libraries.
AB  == endophthalmitis is a potential vision-threatening complication following surgical procedures (postoperative endophthalmitis [poe]), trauma (posttraumatic endophthalmitis [pte]), and bacteremic seeding of the eye from a distant infection site (endogenous endophthalmitis [ee]). several studies have revealed the polybacterial characteristics of endophthalmitis, which make the administration of antibiotics to treat the disease challenging. however, until now, the polybacterial communities of poe, pte, and ee have not been precisely studied. hence, the present study was designed to identify the bacterial community of endophthalmitis through 16s rrna gene libraries. of the 40 intraocular samples tested, 30 libraries were constructed with bacterial nested-pcr-positive samples. the obtained recombinant clones were screened through amplified rrna gene restriction analysis (ardra) to identify unique clones. the multiple types of ardra patterns (p=0.345) and diverse bacterial sequences (p=0.277) within the libraries revealed the polybacterial nature of infection in poe, pte, and ee. moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on polybacterial infection in ee. gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus spp. (n=19), streptococcus spp. (n=18), staphylococcus spp. (n=6), exiguobacterium spp. (n=3), gemella spp. (n=2), enterococcus spp. (n=2), a lysinibacillus sp. (n=1), a clostridium sp. (n=1), and a nocardia sp. (n=1), and  gram-negative bacteria, including serratia spp. (n=18), pseudomonas spp. (n=10),  enterobacter spp. (n=8), acinetobacter spp. (n=3), pantoea spp. (n=3), a haemophilus sp. (n=1), and a massilia sp. (n=1), were identified. interestingly,  among them, 10 bacterial species were not previously reported to be associated with endophthalmitis or other ocular infections. besides, the presence of 4 unidentifiable clones suggests the possibility of novel organisms that might cause eye infections. therefore, it is recommended that, in addition to the polybacterial nature of poe, pte, and ee infections, the spectrum of the pathogenic bacterial community identified in this work should be considered while administering antibiotic therapy in suspected endophthalmitis cases.

TI  == [diversity analysis of biofilm bacteria on tracheal tubes removed from intubated  neonates].
AB  == objective: the catheter-related infections caused by mechanical ventilation have  become a intractable clinical problem, and it is related to the formation of bacterial biofilm (bf) on the surface of the implanted material. the majority of  natural biofilms are formed by multiple bacterial species. however, there always  only one or limited species were detected on tracheal tubes removed from intubated neonates by using traditional methods including bacterium culture and antigen detection. the aims of this study were to observe the bacterial communities diversity of bf on endotracheal tube (ett), and discuss the difference between traditional bacterium culture methods and the use of molecular biology techniques on the basis of denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), to provide new ideas for clinical prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections. method: thirty-five etts were obtained from 26 neonates on  mechanical ventilator (from october 2012 to march 2013) in department of neonatology of children's hospital. among the patients, 18 were boys and 8 girls, and 19 patients were < 37 weeks gestational age and 7 patients >/= 37 weeks. dgge profiling of 16s rdna gene amplicons was used to assess the diversity of the bacterial population by using the software of quantity one. ta cloning kit and sequencing were used to investigate the distribution of bacteria and common dominant bacteria in ett-bf. result: the mean bands of 35 etts cases were 13.8 +/- 5.4 from 16s rdna pcr-dgge, and the mean shanon-wiener indexes was 2.42 +/- 0.38. the 16 etts were collected in different stages of diseases from the 7 patients. the indwelling days of 6/7 patients' etts increased, the shanon-siener  indexes were decreased. among the 6 cases from different basic illnesses, and there were different shanon-siener indexes. the result of molecular cloning and sequencing for 24 dominant bands showed that 35 cases (100%) contained klebsiella sp., 28 cases (80%) had pseudomonas sp., 27 cases (77%) had streptococcus sp., and 32 cases (91%) had uncultured bacterium, while more than 2 bacterial species  were found in 34 cases (97%). 28/35 (80%) klebsiella sp. and 22/27(82%) streptococcus sp. were accompanied by pseudomonas sp.. there were 22 positive results of sputum culture from 26 newborns, including 10 strains (45%) of klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 strains (9%) of acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae and non-cultured bacterium in each patient (5%), but only one bacterium isolated from every sputum. eight sputum samples had normal flora only, corresponding to the etts on which klebsiella and other bacterial genuses were found. conclusion: the diversity of microbiota in bf on ett was confirmed. 16s rdna pcr-dgge could produce a more complete picture of bacterial community than traditional bacterium culture method. klebsiella, pseudomonas and streptococcus were common dominant bacteria in ett-bf, and there might be interactions among them in the formation of bf.

TI  == bacterial superinfection in zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis.
AB  == background: zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (zcl) is a polymorphic disease. it is generally accepted that bacterial superinfection may play a role in the clinical appearance of the lesions and may delay or prevent the healing process.  however, the pattern of bacterial pathogens involved has rarely been investigated. material/methods: the aim of this study was to identify the bacterial species contaminating the suspected zcl and their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics. microscopic examination of stained smears and cultures were used to differentiate zcl from non-zcl lesions in a rural area north of isfahan, iran from july to december 2009. bacteria were isolated from the lesions and identified and antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard microbiological techniques. results: the results show that 602 (68%) of 855 patients were positive for zcl, of which 83.4% with volcano-shape, 8.8% psoriasiform, 6.6% popular form and 1.2% with other atypical forms of zcl. the bacteria were isolated from 66.8% of zcl (70% of volcano-shape, 60% of psoriasiform and 25% of popular form) and 64.7% of non-zcl lesions. the most common species were staphylococcus aureus (41.7%) and s. epidermidis (28%) followed by bacillus sp. streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., proteus sp., enterobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeroginosa. ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, cefazolin and clindamycin were the most effective antibiotics. conclusions: bacterial superinfection appears to be very common in zcl, but its prevalence is not different from that of non-zcl lesions and it has little effect on the clinical appearance of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (acl). local  lesion care and management of bacterial superinfection must be considered in the  treatment of zcl.

TI  == potential application of extracts from indian almond (terminalia catappa linn.) leaves in siamese fighting fish (betta splendens regan) culture.
AB  == indian almond (terminalia catappa linn.) leaves with green and red coloration were tested for bactericidal activity with pathogenic bacteria and their acute toxicity to siamese fighting fish (betta splendens regan). powder of indian almond leaves was extracted with water at the ratio of 1:10 (w/v) and then freeze-dried to a dry powder. bactericidal efficacy was tested against 28 isolates of pathogenic bacteria (aeromonas hydrophila, edwardsiella tarda, enterobacter spp., plesiomonas shigelloides, pseudomonas spp., shewanella putrefaciens, staphylococcus sp. and streptococcus sp.) isolated from siamese fighting fish. a paper disc diffusion method was tested on mueller hinton agar (mha) by inoculating 1 x 106 cfu/ml of each bacterial suspension. paper disks (5  mm) were impregnated with either 10 microl of green or red indian almond leaf extract at a concentration of 12,000 ppm, then laid on the surface of the mha. the results revealed that aqueous extract of red indian almond leaves could inhibit the growth of tested bacteria better than the green extract. the minimal  inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) were  determined. extracts of green and red leaves were diluted in mueller hinton broth (mhb) to obtain a starting extract concentration of 6,000 ppm then twofold serially diluted in a 96-well microtitre plate. the pathogenic bacteria were inoculated into each well at a density of 1 x 105 cfu/ml and incubated at 35 degrees c for 24 h. the growth of bacteria was detected by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliium bromide. the mic of the red leaf extract ranged from 187.5 to 375 ppm which was lower than for green leaf extract (375-750 ppm). the mbc range of the red leaf extract was 375-750 ppm which was lower than for the green leaf extract (750-1,500 ppm). acute toxicity tests (96-h lc50) of indian almond green and red leaf water extracts in siamese fighting fish were conducted. a logarithmic-spaced series of indian almond leaf extract concentrations (6 concentrations) between the highest concentration that  did not kill fish and the lowest concentration that killed all fish were used. each concentration had three replicates (20 fish/replication). mortality was observed after 96 hours. the lc50 value was calculated using probit analysis. the 96-h lc50 value for green and red leaf extracts was 1,765.69 and 1,651.21 ppm, respectively. when siamese fighting fish were cultured in water added with indian almond water extract at 5 concentrations for 5 days and then challenged with aeromonas hydrophila at a concentration of 1 x 106 cfu/ml, the survival rate of the siamese fighting fish infected by a. hydrophila could be decreased by bathing with indian almond red leaf extract at 750 ppm while green leaf indian almond extract was effective for aeromonad septicemia therapy in siamese fighting fish when used at a concentration of 1,000 ppm. in conclusion, red leaf indian almond  aqueous extract had high potential for the control of pathogenic bacteria at a concentration of 750 ppm which should be safe for siamese fighting fish taking into consideration the toxic level of the extract.

TI  == antibiotic activity of tigecycline against clinical pathogens by the micro dilution method.
AB  == resistant pathogens are the cause of clinical infections which threatening the patients lives and challenging the health systems through their economic importance. therefore, new antibacterial agents with a broader spectrum of activity that protect against development of resistance are required. tigecycline (tygacil, wyeth) is a relatively new fda and emea approved glycylcycline antimicrobial with an expanded broad-spectrum activity against pathogens involved in complicated skin and skin structure infections. in this study we evaluated the in vitro activity of tigecycline in comparison to 14 other antibiotics against 182 clinical pathogens by use of the micro dilution method. in overall, tigecycline exhibited the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values in almost all bacteria with a mean of 0.52 +/- 1.25mg/l, followed by meropenem and levofloxacin (mean mic values 1.29 +/- 2.52 and 1.45 +/- 3.078 mg/l, respectively). mic50 and mic90 values of tigecycline were: 0.06 and 0.15 mg/l for e. coli, 0.12 and 1.00 mg/l for klebsiella sp., 0.12 and 0.85 mg/l for various enterobacter sp., 1.00 and 8.00 mg/l for pseudomonas sp., 0.25 and 1.00 mg/l for  acinetobacter sp., 0.06 and 0.12 mg/l for serratia sp., 0.12 and 0.25mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, 0.5 and 5.00 mg/l for streptococcus sp. the mic values recorded were among the lowest in recent literature for acinetobacter sp. (included a. baumannii), and comparable to those obtained for klebsiella, serratia and enterobacter indicating that tigecycline has a promising in vitro activity.

TI  == effect of neem extract against the bacteria isolated from marine fish.
AB  == marine ornamental fishes are exceedingly valuable due to their high demand in domestic and international markets. there is a growing global interest to rear the fishes in captivity. but problem due to bacteria and fungi are the major hitch in captive condition. since, the use of antibiotics is banned, an attempt was made to ascertain in vitro assay of the neem leaves extract against the bacterial pathogens isolated from infected fishes. bacterial strains isolated from infected regions of the clown fishes amphiprion sebae and a. ocellaris were  identified as aeromonas hydrophila, enterobacter sp., e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus sp., streptococcus sp., vibrio cholerae, v. alginolyticus, v. parahaemolyticus and yersinia enterocolitica. ethanol and methanol extracts were  highly inhibitory to the bacterial isolates when compared to other solvents. ethanol extracts exhibited low minimum inhibitory concentration (75-250 microg ml(-1)) as compared to other extracts. the present finding revealed that the neem leaf extract significantly reduces the bacterial pathogens and their infection in marine ornamental fishes.

TI  == the use of culture-independent tools to characterize bacteria in endo-tracheal aspirates from pre-term infants at risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == although premature infants are increasingly surviving the neonatal period, up to  one-third develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd). despite evidence that bacterial colonization of the neonatal respiratory tract by certain bacteria may  be a risk factor in bpd development, little is known about the role these bacteria play. the aim of this study was to investigate the use of culture-independent molecular profiling methodologies to identify potential etiological agents in neonatal airway secretions. this study used terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) and clone sequence analyses to  characterize bacterial species in endo-tracheal (et) aspirates from eight intubated pre-term infants. a wide range of different bacteria was identified in  the samples. forty-seven t-rf band lengths were resolved in the sample set, with  a range of 0-15 separate species in each patient. clone sequence analyses confirmed the identity of individual species detected by t-rflp. we speculate that the identification of known opportunistic pathogens including s. aureus, enterobacter sp., moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus sp., within the airways of pre-term infants, might be causally related to the subsequent development of bpd. further, we suggest that culture-independent techniques, such as t-rflp, hold important potential for the characterization of  neonatal conditions, such as bpd.

TI  == the pathological newborn in small animals: the neonate is not a small adult.
AB  == the rate of perinatal death is variable but highest during parturition, immediately after birth and in the first days of life. infectious diseases, above all bacterial, are the second most important cause of mortality after losses during parturition. a lot of factors are involved predisposing puppies and kittens to bacterial infections: respiratory distress, hypothermia, hypoglycaemia, dehydration, congenital abnormalities. e. coli, streptococci and staphylococci, klebsiella sp., pseudomonas sp., enterobacter sp., proteus sp. and anaerobes are regularly involved in bacterial infections in neonates. postmortem  findings especially document e. coli, staphylococcus or streptococcus species as  causes of disease and death shortly after birth. the environment and mothers are  suspected as sources of infection (vaginal discharge, milk, faeces, oropharynx, skin) for puppies and kittens. genetic relatedness of bacterial strains in puppies and their mothers was found in staphylococci and e.coli. these results indicate that for repeated cases of bacterial infections in neonates diagnostic procedures of milk, vaginal and faecal swabs from bitches result in isolation of  the responsible bacteria with a high probability and suggest that preterm treatment could help to control bacterial diseases and losses in pups.

TI  == bacteria fauna from the house fly, musca domestica (l.).
AB  == the house fly, musca domestica has long been considered a potential agent for disease transmission ever since its existence. the general truth of this assertion remains undisputed till the present day in spite of increasing awareness toward an improved sanitation and better hygiene. the habitual movement of house fly from filthy substrata such as human faeces, animal excreta, carcasses, garbage, etc. makes them ideal candidates for disease transmission such as cholera, shigellosis, salmonellosis and others when settling on food. fly as a potential mechanical vector of pathogenic bacteria was elucidated in this study by examining flies from various breeding sites such as food courts, dumping ground, food processing areas and poultry farm in peninsular malaysia. the flies  were baited with 10% sugar solution on a glass slide in the field. all materials  used for collection of samples were sterile. bacteria from fly sample were isolated using the normal isolation technique. bacillus sp., coccobacillus sp., staphylococcus sp., microccus sp., streptococcus sp., acinetobacter sp., enterobacter sp., proteus sp., escherichia sp., klebsiella sp. and yeast cells were isolated from feaces, vomitus, external surfaces and internal organs of house fly. newly emerged house fly did not harbour any bacteria.

TI  == molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

TI  == the influence of endoscopic procedures upon the contamination of helicobacter pylori cultures.
AB  == background: among the various diagnostic methods for the detection of helicobacter pylori infection, histological examination and microbiological processing of gastric biopsy samples are assumed to be the gold standard techniques. aims: since h. pylori culture can be affected by the presence of non-h. pylori bacteria, we evaluated the efficacy of endoscope disinfection and the influence of endoscopic procedures on culture contamination. patients and methods: the procedures used during the first two routine endoscopies were evaluated during 28 consecutive days. endoscopy room, forceps and endoscopic channel were analyzed before and after the beginning of normal procedures. after  disinfection, a biopsy simulation was performed to verify the gastric bacteria. results: endoscope disinfection removed all organisms from forceps and endoscopic channel with 100% efficacy. the most frequent non-h. pylori bacteria detected were streptococcus bovis, enterobacter hormaechei, and staphylococcus aureus. the sensibility of the h. pylori culture was affected by the presence of non-h. pylori bacteria. conclusion: the risk of transmission of microorganisms was not detectable when sterilized biopsy forceps and stringent disinfection standards were employed. whilst s. bovis and e. hormaechei may be common in gastric microbial flora, the presence of p. aeruginosa and s. aureus indicated that the manipulation of biopsies could be responsible for culture contamination with these bacteria.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  == aim: the present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. methods: we identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp). results: nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. a single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per ml of bile (> 105 cfu/ml). the predominant gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). the predominant gram-positive bacteria were enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. all gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (cim90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/ml. gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. although all five isolates of e. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) e. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. conclusion: e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. faecalis and streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.

TI  == changing pattern of bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.
AB  == adequate infection prophylaxis and empirical antibiotic therapy are of critical importance after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (hsct). we examined the  evolution of bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics in 492 patients (198 allografts and 294 autografts) transplanted between 1982 and 1999 and evaluated whether ciprofloxacin prophylaxis and an empirical antibiotic regimen (glycopeptide + third-generation cephalosporin) were still valid. we collected all susceptibility tests performed during the initial hospitalization on blood cultures as well as routine surveillance cultures and analyzed susceptibility to  ciprofloxacin and to major antibiotics used in our unit. gram-positive cocci rapidly became resistant to ciprofloxacin (susceptibility around 70% in 1990 to less than 20% in 1998) but sensitivity to glycopeptides remained unaltered. there was a rapid decline in the number of patients colonized with gram-negative bacilli in the early years of ciprofloxacin prophylaxis. however, susceptibility  to ciprofloxacin fell sharply from around 90% in 1990 to around 30% in 1999. in parallel, susceptibility to ceftazidime also decreased to less than 80% in recent years. piperacillin (+/- tazobactam) did not show any variation over time and its efficacy remained too low (about 60%). imipenem as well as recently introduced cefepim and meropenem showed stable and excellent profiles (>90% susceptibility). in conclusion: (1) quinolone prophylaxis has now lost most of its value; (2) the  choice of a third-generation cephalosporin for empirical antibiotic therapy may no longer be the best because of the emergence of gram-negative strains resistant to beta-lactamases, such as enterobacter sp. more appropriate regimens of empirical antibiotic therapy in hsct recipients may be based on the use of a carbapenem or fourth-generation cephalosporin.

TI  == 16s rdna-based identification of bacteria from conjunctival swabs by pcr and dgge fingerprinting.
AB  == purpose: establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. methods: from 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and dna was extracted. fragments of 200 bp, spanning the v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rdna, were amplified by polymerase  chain reaction (pcr) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). for phylogenetic identification, dgge bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16s rdna clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened  by dgge. sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the embl database. furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from  conventional cultivation. results: 16s rdna could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. the following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: staphylococcus (n = 8),  corynebacterium (n = 7), propionibacterium (n = 7), streptococcus (n = 6), bacillus (n = 2), acinetobacter (n = 3), pseudomonas (n = 3), proteus (n = 1), and brevundimonas (n = 1). four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. they had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of pantoea and enterobacter (n = 1), kingella and neisseria (n = 1), serratia and aranicola (n = 1), and leuconostoc and weissella (n = 2), respectively. culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), corynebacteria (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), streptococcus sp. (n = 1), proteus sp. (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). in total, 45% of  the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were pcr positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. no sample positive by culture gave negative results by pcr. conclusions: 16s rdna sequence analyses and dgge fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.

TI  == evaluation of the in vitro activity of 9 antimicrobials against bacterial strains isolated from patients in intensive care units in brazil: mystic antimicrobial surveillance program.
AB  == multi-resistant bacterial strains are increasingly prevalent in hospital environments. bacterial resistance is an important problem, especially for practitioners in intensive care units (icus) because of the selective pressure on the prevalent bacteria in these environments. the mystic (meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection) study has been monitoring the performance of carbapenems and other antibiotics in different hospitals for at least 3 years. the in vitro activities of meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, piperacilin/tazobactam, gentamicin, and tobramycin were compared against 452 recent clinical aerobic isolates. the isolates consisted of 19 species of gram-negative bacteria (n=290) including k. pneumoniae (n=49), e. coli (n=48), a. baumannii (n=47), enterobacter spp. (n=41), and p. aeruginosa (n=33) and 9 species of gram-positive bacteria (n=162) including staphylococcus aureus (n=63), enterococcus faecalis (n=22), streptococcus pneumoniae (n=22) and coagulase negative staphylococci (n=21). all  isolates were collected from icu patients. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by etest methodology, using standardized and controlled procedures. meropenem and imipenem showed the lowest mic(90) for all species tested. gram-negative isolates showed the following overall resistance percentages to the other 7 drugs: tobramycin (43.1%), cefotaxime (38.6%), gentamicin (34.1%), ceftazidime (31.7%), ciprofloxacin (25.5%), piperacillin/tazobactam (26.9%), and cefepime (18.6%). carbapenems were the most  active drugs overall and only p. aeruginosa presented some degree of resistance (18.2%). we also evaluated the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) among all enterobacteriaceae members (n=176) by etest/esbl strip. esbl production was detected in 51 strains (29.0%). among them, klebsiella pneumoniae  was the most prevalent at 59.2%, followed by enterobacter spp. (19.5%) and e. coli (14.6%). the high level of resistance against several antimicrobials and the alarming rate of esbl production may restrict therapeutic choice to the carbapenems in this selected group of patients.

TI  == cocaine and lidocaine with phenylephrine as topical anesthetics: antimicrobial activity against common nasal pathogens.
AB  == topical anesthetics are commonly used in the evaluation of nasal pathology. the anesthetics routinely used, 4% lidocaine with phenylephrine, or 4% cocaine, have  been demonstrated to have varying inhibitory effects on bacterial cultures. the present study examined the antimicrobial activity of these topical anesthetics used in nasal procedures. the pathogens used were branhamella catarrhalis, enterobacter sp., haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. organisms were against two-fold serial dilutions of stock preparations of 4% lidocaine with 0.25% phenylephrine, 0.25% phenylephrine, 0.1% methylparaben, 250 mg/ml ampicillin, and 4% cocaine. the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration for each of the solutions were obtained. the bacteria  studied varied gently in their susceptibility to lidocaine with phenylephrine versus cocaine: cocaine consistently exhibited greater antimicrobial activity than lidocaine. phenylephrine and methylparaben showed slight antimicrobial activity. these topical anesthetics have slight bactericidal activity against nasal pathogens, which can sometimes lead to false-negative results. otolaryngologists should recognize the possible antimicrobial effects of topical  anesthetics when culturing specimens. this is especially important when the specimen will be used for guidance of antimicrobial therapy, as in the case of the critically ill patient who requires aspiration for organism-specific therapy. further studies, specifically in vivo experiments, are needed to determine if use of the drugs produces a significant change in the ability to culture organisms from these sites. this type of study would, however, be difficult to perform, since most patients requiring aspiration are already on high-dose antibiotics that would inhibit the growth of most microorganisms. a modified aspiration technique using a less concentrated topical anesthetic will likely be required to increase the chances of obtaining positive cultures.

TI  == bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with bloodstream infection: frequencies of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (united states and canada, 1997).
AB  == the sentry program was established in january 1997 to measure the predominant pathogens and antimicrobial resistance patterns of nosocomial and community-acquired infections over a broad network of sentinel hospitals in the united states (30 sites), canada (8 sites), south america (10 sites), and europe  (24 sites). during the first 6-month study period (january to june 1997), a total of 5,058 bloodstream infections (bsi) were reported by north american sentry participants (4,119 from the united states and 939 from canada). in both the united states and canada, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli were the most common bsi isolates, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci. klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic streptococci were also among the 10  most frequently reported species in both the united states and canada. although the rank orders of pathogens in the united states and canada were similar, distinct differences were noted in the antimicrobial susceptibilities of several  pathogens. overall, u.s. isolates were considerably more resistant than those from canada. the differences in the proportions of oxacillin-resistant s. aureus  isolates (26.2 versus 2.7% for u.s. and canadian isolates, respectively), vancomycin-resistant enterococcal isolates (17.7 versus 0% for u.s. and canadian  isolates, respectively), and ceftazidime-resistant enterobacter sp. isolates (30.6 versus 6.2% for u.s. and canadian isolates, respectively) dramatically emphasize the relative lack of specific antimicrobial resistance genes (meca, vana, and vanb) in the canadian microbial population. among u.s. isolates, resistance to oxacillin among staphylococci, to vancomycin among enterococci, to  penicillin among pneumococci, and to ceftazidime among enterobacter spp. was observed in both nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens, although in almost  every instance the proportion of resistant strains was higher among nosocomial isolates. antimicrobial resistance continues to increase, and ongoing surveillance of microbial pathogens and resistance profiles is essential on national and international scales.

(4.3%). on analysis of the temporal evolution an increase was observed in gram positives (27.4% in 1988 and 46.4% in 1996). enterococcus sp. increased in surgical infections (5.8% in 1988 and 15.8% in 1996) and in the urinary tract (8.5% in 1988 and 25.6% in 1996). contrary to the s. epidermidis, the ncs increased in importance mainly in infections at the site of surgery (0% in 1988 to 5.1% in 1996). the appearance of klebsiella sp., enterobacter sp. and proteus sp. decreased. conclusions: a great variation was observed in the etiology of nosocomial infections in surgery departments not only over time but also based on the localization of the infection. in recent years gram positive infections have  increased with a rise in the incidence of staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci, in addition to greater protagonism by candida sp.

TI  == results of quantitative cultures of urine by free catch and catheterization from  healthy adult horses.
AB  == quantitative urine cultures were performed on 11 male and 11 female healthy adult horses. urine was collected by free catch and catheterization using standard methods. results showed that all samples collected by free catch contained less than 20,000 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. all samples collected by catheterization contained 500 cfu/ml or less. a significant difference was found  between collection methods (p < .005), with catheterization having less contamination. in samples collected by free catch, females had significantly greater contamination than did males (p < .03). predominant bacterial species isolated included streptococcus spp., escherichia coli, enterobacter sp., bacillus sp., staphylococcus spp., diptheroids sp., proteus spp., and enterococcus sp. many samples contained multiple bacterial species. bacterial isolates were representative of the normal bacterial flora of the equine urogenital tract. this paper establishes reference values for quantitative urine  culture results in healthy adult horses to aid in the diagnosis of urinary tract  infections.

TI  == [infection by strongyloides stercoralis in the county of safor, spain].
AB  == background: strongyloides stercoralis is an endemic nematode in tropical and subtropical regions, but almost unknown in spain. patients and methods: in order  to know some epidemiological, clinical and analytic features of this infection in our area (la safor, valencia), we performed a prospective study for 19 months. through the search for the parasite in feces of patients with eosinophilia, we identified 37 subjects who were studied at diagnosis and 4 months later. results: thirty-three patients (89%) were currently, or had been agricultural workers, and thirty had worked barefooted and/or had drunk contaminated irrigation water. twenty-three patients (62%) had a chronic or immunosuppressive diseases, and two  of them on steroid treatment, developed a disseminated strongyloidiasis. thirteen patients (35%) were asymptomatic; the rest had clinical manifestations attributed s. stercoralis, mainly digestive. two of the patients with disseminated strongyloidiasis also had concomitant bacterial infections by streptococcus bovis, streptococcus faecalis and enterobacter sp. at diagnosis, besides eosinophilia, 86.5% had raised levels of ige. four months later treatment, the number of eosinophils was normal and ige levels significantly decreased. the diagnostic yield of parasitic study of feces was increased with the number of samples examined. thiabendazole achieved erradication of the parasite in 35 patients, and the other two died because of disseminated strongyloidiasis. conclusions: the presence of eosinophilia in patients from rural areas with subtropical climate should raise suspicion about infection by s. stercoralis, which, although sometimes is asymptomatic, may cause systemic bacterial infections in cases of hyperinfestation, specially when glucocorticoid treatment  is given.

TI  == treatment of permcath-related sepsis in uremic patients.
AB  == patients who use permcath as the vascular access for long-term hemodialysis are occasionally confronted with catheter-related infections. recently, we have treated 17 patients suffering from permcath-related sepsis. the clinical presenting features were leukocytosis in 14/17, high fever and shaking chill during dialysis in 12/17, and signs of exit site infection in 3/17. no shock was  found. all patients received clinical evaluation to exclude infection sources other than from blood and inside the catheter, such as pulmonary, genitourinary,  hepatobiliary and cutaneous systems. blood drawn from both permcath and peripheral vein was sent for bacterial culture. bacterial culture of the blood samples from permcath revealed staphylococcus sp. in 7/17, pseudomonas sp. in 5/17, enterobacter sp. in 4/17, streptococcus sp. in 1/17. fourteen blood samples from peripheral vein showed positive culture results identical to those from permcath, but negative study were noted in three other patients. the patients were divided into two treatment groups: group i: systemic antibiotics without permcath removal in 7, group ii: "locked-in" retention in addition to systemic anti-biotics in 10. antibiotics were empirically chosen according to bacteriological studies. in the "locked-in" retention treatment, antibiotics were retained into both the inflow and outflow permcath lumens in the exact volume of  each lumen for 24 hours. the antibiotics solutions were replaced on a daily basis. the same antibiotics were also given intravenously. duration of treatment  depended on clinical progression and follow-up blood culture results and ranged between 13 and 24 days. the schedule of dialysis was not changed through the period of permcath-related sepsis. the sepsis was cured in all group ii cases but not in 2 of group i and resulted in mortality in these 2 patients. the permcaths  were preserved in 5/7 in group i with two mortality cases and all except one preserved in group ii patients without mortality. we suggested that "locked-in" retention in addition to systemic antibiotics is the treatment of choice for the  patients with permcath-related sepsis. this method also preserves the functional  integrity of permcath, which is the lifeline vascular access of the patients with exhausted native vessels.

TI  == bacterial infection and semen characteristics in infertile men.
AB  == semen samples of 190 men attending an andrology clinic were evaluated with bacteriological culture and categorized as negative (group i) and positive (group ii); the effect of bacteriospemia on semen characteristics was also analyzed. semen samples from both groups were simultaneously analyzed for routine parameters such as volume, sperm count, motility, viability and morphology. the semen culture was negative in 34% and positive in 66% of the samples. from 123 samples, 157 aerobes and 8 anaerobes were recovered. the most commonly isolated organism was staphylococchs epidermidis (in 63% of the samples), followed by streptococchs viridans (28%), escherichia coli (9%), staphylococcus aureus (5%),  streptococcus faecalis (5%), beta-hemolytic streptococcus (4%), and enterobacter  agglomerans (4%). other microorganisms, including klebsiella sp, candida sp., and proteus mirabilis, were recovered in fewer than 4% of the specimens. the comparison of semen characteristics between infected and noninfected men showed that motile spermatozoa and viability were lower when the microorganisms were present in the semen. it would appear that the bacteria can have a direct effect  on semen quality with negative consequences in fertility.

TI  == antibiotics, biliary sepsis, and bile duct stones.
AB  == bacteriologic studies of bile and blood cultures of 579 patients with ductal stones and infected bile revealed that 121 patients (21%) had associated bacteremia. analysis of bile and stone cultures showed that escherichia coli, klebsiella sp, enterobacter sp, enterococcus sp, and streptococcus sp were the most commonly isolated bacteria. two-thirds of the patients with bacteremia had similar organisms isolated from blood and bile. pharmacokinetic studies of the hepatic/biliary excretion profiles of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, imipenem, netilmicin, and ciprofloxacin were performed by ercp and nasobiliary catheter drainage. the bile samples obtained immediately after cannulation from patients with complete biliary obstruction contained low or undetectable levels of the antibiotics administered--the exception being ciprofloxacin, which was present at a concentration of 20% of the serum level. in vitro determination of minimum inhibitory concentration of the aforementioned antibiotics against 199 isolates of biliary pathogens revealed imipenem and ciprofloxacin to have the highest antimicrobial activity. based on pharmacokinetic studies and in vitro susceptibility findings, we conclude that ciprofloxacin is superior to the other  tested antibiotics in prophylaxis and treatment of biliary sepsis.

TI  == [clinical bacteriology and empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in the elderly at a national leprosarium].
AB  == hospital-acquired pneumonia is one of the most important fatal respiratory diseases in the elderly. prompt and precise empiric therapy is essential for recovery. fourteen isolates from twelve elderly lepromatous leprosy patients (9 men, 3 women, mean age of 75.8 years) with hospital-acquired pneumonia were studied. subsequently, empiric therapy with gentamicin and beta-lactams for nosocomial pneumonia in the elderly was examined. fourteen types of bacteria isolated from expectorated sputum specimens consisted mainly of ten strains of gram-negative bacilli (71%) six of klebsiella pneumoniae, one each of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, serratia liquefaciens, and aeromonas hydrophilia and four strains of gram-positive cocci (29%) two of staphylococcus sp., one each of streptococcus sp. and streptococcus pneumoniae. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas sp. were not detected. resistance rates of the etiologic agents to the antibiotics showed that gentamicin was 7.7%, ceftazidime 0%, and cefmetazole 23.1%. cephalosporins were superior to penicillins. as a result of empiric therapy, six elderly leprosy patients with nosocomial pneumonia were cured and one improved temporarily. this  study shows the necessity of specific empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in a hospital with many elderly patients. the combination of gentamicin and beta-lactams is of value as an initial antibiotic therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in the elderly.

TI  == microbiological studies of abscesses complicating bothrops snakebite in humans: a prospective study.
AB  == forty patients with abscesses at the site of bothrops bite were evaluated. ten brought the snake responsible for the bite, bothrops jararaca in all cases. on admission a sample was collected from each case for aerobic and anaerobic culture, and no abscesses drained spontaneously. none of the patients had received antibacterial therapy at this time. the bacteria most frequently isolated were morganella morganii (23 patients), providencia rettgeri (7) enterobacter sp. (4), escherichia coli (3), group d streptococcus (11) and bacteroides sp. (6). all enterobacteria tested were sensitive to chloramphenicol, aminoglycosides and cefotaxime. group d streptococci were sensitive to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and penicillin g, whereas anaerobic bacteria were sensitive to chloramphenicol and tetracycline. these results suggest that in cases of abscess formation secondary to bothrops bite, chloramphenicol alone is a good choice, being both safe and cheap.

TI  == bacterial meningitis in children: etiology and clinical features, an 11-year review of 618 cases.
AB  == during the period january 1980 to december 1990 (11 years) a retrospective study  of patients with bacterial meningitis who were admitted to bangkok children's hospital was carried out. there were 618 patients with 77 cases (12.5%) occurring below the age of one month (neonatal meningitis), and 541 cases (87.5%) between one month to 15 years (childhood meningitis). pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common pathogenic organism (16.9%) in neonatal meningitis; other causative agents in this age group included klebsiella pneumoniae (13.0%), group b streptococcus (11.7%), escherichia coli and enterobacter sp (10.4% each). in childhood meningitis, haemophilus influenzae was the most common causative organism (42.3%), and followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (22.2%) and salmonella sp (12.4%). excluding a 13 year-old leukemic patient, salmonella meningitis occurred exclusively in infants, 87% of them were under six months, and 13% of them developed relapsing meningitis. presenting symptoms and signs on admission of neonatal meningitis such as fever (81.8%), convulsions (45.4%), neck stiffness (22.5%), bulging fontanelle (33.3%) and brudzinski sign (11.5%) were significantly less frequent than in the patients beyond the neonatal period (p <  0.05). the overall fatalities during 1980-1990 were 45.4% and 17.3% for neonatal  meningitis and childhood meningitis, respectively. the fatalities of the two age  groups declined significantly during 1987-1990 to 26.3% and 11.4% respectively.

TI  == the management of lateral sinus thrombosis.
AB  == the standard recommended treatment for lateral sinus thrombosis is intravenous antibiotics. for those that fail, some authors recommend anticoagulant therapy, others internal jugular vein ligation. despite these recommendations, there is still a significant mortality in all reported large series and the main reason this is that the cause of the failure has not been found or investigated. over a  six-year-period, from january 1985 to december 1990, 36 patients were admitted with lateral sinus thrombosis. the initial treatment consisted of intravenous antibiotics and surgery. the surgery included cortical mastoidectomy for non-cholesteatomatous ears and modified radical mastoidectomy for cholesteatomatous ears and drainage of the intracranial collection of pus in patients with subdural empyema and brain abscess. there were nine failures (25 per cent) with this treatment regimen. blood cultures and pus swab of the ears were taken from these patients. the blood cultures were positive in four patients and the organisms isolated included beta-haemolytic streptococcus sp. in two, proteus mirabilis and streptococcus pneumoniae in one each. from the ear swab mixed cultures were found in eight and a single organism in one. gram-negative organisms were isolated in nine (100 per cent), proteus mirabilis in eight (89 per cent) and enterobacter sp. in two. both these organisms were resistant to ampicillin and penicillin but were sensitive to amikacin. amikacin was then added to the treatment regimen and a dramatic response with a fall in the temperature,  and improvement in the patients' general condition was noted within 24 hours, in  all patients.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (ipm/cs) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. there were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9  with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with  fever of unknown origin. forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. the overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. the efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. bacteriologically, staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), streptococcus  pneumoniae (5), streptococcus pyogenes (1), other gram-positive coccus (1), klebsiella pneumoniae (8), haemophilus influenzae (4), pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), serratia marcescens (3), escherichia coli (3), branhamella catarrhalis (1),  citrobacter freundii (1), klebsiella oxytoca (1), enterobacter sp. (1), and peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. p. aeruginosa (3) and acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. s. aureus (1), s. epidermidis (1), p. aeruginosa (5), and s. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. the eradication rate was 83.7%. six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of s-got 2. but all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. these findings indicate that ipm/cs is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.

TI  == oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  == two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (peptostreptococcus (1); eubacterium (9); clostridium (6); veillonella (6); megasphera (1); bacteroides (28); fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (p. anaerobius (1); e. fossor (9); c. villosum (1); b. fragilis (1); b. tectum (2); b. heparinolyticus (2)). three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (lrt) or paraoral (po) bacterial infections. of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. among the obligately anaerobic species, gram-positive cocci including p. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, e. fossor 11% and other gram-positive rods (excluding  clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. the gram-negative rods comprised b. fragilis 5%, b. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented bacteroides 3% and other bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of fusobacterium (7%), and gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by pasteurella spp. 19%, escherichia coli 17%, actinomyces spp. 9%, streptococcus spp. 9%. incidental facultative isolates were enterococcus spp. 2%, enterobacter cloaceae 2%, actinobacillus spp. 2% and gram-negative corroding rods 5%. on the basis of the similarities (as determined by dna hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. e. fossor and b. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and lrt and po diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.

TI  == a randomized prospective study of ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with or without teicoplanin as an empiric antibiotic regimen for febrile neutropenic patients.
AB  == febrile neutropenic patients were randomized to receive ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with the addition of teicoplanin in cases with clinical suspicion of a hickman line-associated infection. at 48 h both clinical and bacteriological analyses were made. patients were categorized as: success, in cases of improvement or stability in the clinical condition; failure, if there was a deterioration of the clinical condition; and non-evaluable, in cases of protocol  violation or death due to other causes. a total of 86 patients have completed the study so far; 43 patients were randomized to the ceftazidime and 43 to the ciprofloxacin group. teicoplanin was added to the monotherapy in 12 patients in the ceftazidime group and 15 in the ciprofloxacin group. the diagnoses were: acute myelogenous leukaemia (25), non-hodgkin's lymphoma (34), hodgkin's disease  (17); acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (9) and chronic granulocytic leukaemia (1). forty-eight hour clinical assessment showed a response rate in the ceftazidime group of: success 18/31 (58%), failure 13/31 (42%); in the ceftazidime and teicoplanin group: success 8/12 (67%), failure 4/12 (33%); in the ciprofloxacin group: success 23/28 (82%), failure 5/28 (18%); and in the ciprofloxacin and teicoplanin group: success 11/15 (73%), failure 4/15 (27%). blood cultures were positive in 48/86 (56%) cases, with more than one organism isolated in seven of these 48 cases. organisms isolated were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (20), escherichia coli (13), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), staphylococcus aureus (3), diphtheroids (3), klebsiella sp. (3), enterobacter cloacae (2), streptococcus faecalis (2), ent. adenocarboxylata (1), clostridium septicum (1). strept. b (1), alpha streptococcus (1) and p. fluorescens (1), in-vitro testing showed that all  gram-positive organisms were sensitive to teicoplanin, and gram-negative organisms to ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime. there were seven cases of superimposed infections with eight organisms isolated, all cases occurring in patients receiving ciprofloxacin alone: coagulase-negative staphylococci (4), strep. sangius (1), strep. viridans (1), diphtheroids (1) and p. maltophilia (1). both ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime are comparable in efficacy as empirical monotherapy for febrile neutropenic patients. there is, however, a significant increase in the incidence of superimposed infection in patients receiving only ciprofloxacin. in view of the very high incidence of gram-positive septicaemia, we suggest that  teicoplanin should be added as part of the initial empiric antibiotic regimen in  all febrile neutropenic patients.

TI  == use of potentially infected donor hearts for cardiac transplantation.
AB  == despite the nationwide shortage of heart donors, more patients, some of whom are  critically ill, are being accepted as candidates for transplantation. thus, on occasion, we have liberalized our donor criteria to meet the demand. we have recently transplanted 16 potentially infected donor hearts into critically ill recipients. of these 16 donors, 7 had multiple positive blood cultures as follows: streptococcus pneumoniae (3), staphylococcus aureus (2), klebsiella pneumoniae (1), and enterobacter sp (1). seven other donors were accepted despite high fevers (rectal temperature greater than 38.9 degrees c), leukocytosis (greater than 18 x 10(9)/l [greater than 18,000 cells/microl]), and pulmonary infiltrates with positive sputa (enterobacter [3], klebsiella pneumoniae [2], and staphylococcus [2]). two other donors with hepatitis b surface antigen positivity were deemed at high risk but were used because the recipients were in immediate need. early mortality (less than or equal to 30 days) among the recipients was 3/16 (18.7%) with 1 patient dying of uncontrolled allograft rejection, 1 of hepatic failure, and 1 of pseudomonas septicemia. late mortality (greater than 30 days after operation) occurred in 6 patients: 2 patients died of hepatic failure, 3 died of graft atherosclerosis, and 1 died of iatrogenic hemorrhage after a liver biopsy. only 1 patient died of infection unrelated to that of the donor, and the other patients had no infectious complications resulting from the organisms identified in their respective donors. use of potentially infected donor hearts resulted in surprisingly few infectious complications in this group  of recipients. this practice can be safe and should be considered when other options are unavailable.

TI  == evaluation of thiol broth for the culture of salmonella typhi and other bacteria  from blood.
AB  == thiol broth is known to neutralize various antimicrobial agents. positivity of growth of various species of bacteria from blood in thiol broth was reported as similar to that in tryptic soy broth (tsb). as blood cultures are often used for  the diagnosis of typhoid fever, and as patients may receive antimicrobial therapy before blood culture, the positivity and rapidity of growth of salmonella typhi in thiol broth were compared to those in tsb. routine blood culture samples from  yonsei medical center patients were inoculated in 50-ml amounts of tsb and thiol  broth. the media were prepared from dehydrated products and did not contain co2,  but tsb contained 0.025% sodium polyanethol sulfonate (sps). growth of s. paratyphi-a, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., serratia marcescens and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus were similar in both media. however, greater positivity and shorter incubation time for macroscopic detection were noted in tsb with s. typhi, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. it is concluded that thiol broth is inferior to tsb plus sps for the culture of s. typhi from blood.

TI  == [studies on 145 cases of septicemia in infancy and childhood--especially on septicemic patients with malignant and hematological diseases].
AB  == clinical and bacteriological data of 145 inpatients with septicemia, treated at the hospital of chiba university school of medicine from 1972 to 1987, were reviewed by dividing them into three stages. (stages i: 1972-76, stage ii: 1978-82, stage iii: 1983-87) patients with underlying diseases have been increasing: 91.8% of the total patients in stage iii. among the patients with underlying diseases, malignant and hematological diseases occupied about 60%, and in the other diseases, congenital heart diseases have been increasing in number.  as to the organisms isolated, gram positive bacteria have increased, while gram negative bacteria have decreased. in stage iii, the rate of gram positive organisms and gram negative ones accounted for 43.1% and 41.2% of all the isolates from the septic patients with malignant & hematological diseases, respectively. in patients with malignant & hematological diseases, alpha-streptococcus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, and fusobacterium sp. have been increasing, whereas, escherichia coli, enterobacter sp., klebsiella sp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa decreasing. in patients with other underlying diseases, s. aureus, cns, and non fermenters have been increasing. among the patients without underlying diseases, gram positive bacteria accounted for the major part. the decrease of gram negative organisms in patients with malignant and hematological diseases may partially depend on the introduction of polymixin  b as the drug of gut decontamination. the outcome of septicemia in the patients with malignant & hematological diseases has been markedly improving through all the three stages. during stage iii, episode mortality and case mortality rate proved to be 23% and 31%, respectively. the introduction of the third generation  cephems has decreased the mortality rate for gram negative organisms and contributed to the improvement of the total prognosis. the prognosis was worst in the case of p. aeruginosa, showing a mortality rate of 50% during stage iii. coincidence rate of blood and other cultures have been largest in the case of p.  aeruginosa, so, the drug sensitivity of the strain cultured from other sites is sometimes useful in the choice of antibiotics.

TI  == [in vitro susceptibility to a new antimicrobial agent (imipenem) of pathogens isolated from inpatients at various centers].
AB  == imipenem is a beta lactam antibiotic, a highly potent new carbapenem with broad antibacterial spectrum. to test the "in vitro" efficacy of this antimicrobial agent in pathogens more frequent in several medical centers in brazil, susceptibility testing with 10 mcg imipenem disks and, or corresponding mic were  carried out with 1231 recent isolates of 41 different bacterial species, obtained mainly from hospitalized patients in 5 different medical centers of the cities of s. paulo, rio de janeiro and salvador. our preliminary results with this antibiotic, in final phases of clinical and laboratorial experimentation in this  country, are very promissing with, 96.79% of susceptibility of test isolates to 10 mcg imipenem disks and corresponding mic correlation of up to 4 micrograms/ml. (92.31%). of the 9 bacterial species more frequently isolated totaling 1108 (82%) of the 1230 test isolates, disk susceptibility was 99% (e. coli), 93% (pseudomonas aeruginosas), 87% (staphylococcus aureus), 100% (klebsiella pneumoniae), 98% (klebsiella sp), 97% (proteus mirabiles), 94% (enterobacter sp), 100% (streptococcus faecalis) with good mic correlation (up to 8 mcg/ml) and 100% for the anaerobic species bacteroides sp (mic up to 4 micrograms/ml). "in vitro"  efficacy to hospital pathogens with high frequency of resistance to most antibiotics as pseudomonas aeruginosa and to anaerobes notably bacteroides sp is  emphasized.

(2), streptococcus faecalis, serratia sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, achromobacter xylosoxidans, aeromonas hydrophila and pseudomonas fluorescens (1 each). wound cultures failed to predict bone culture results in 12 of 16 patients (75%). nho recurred in 8 of 19 patients (42%) despite intravenously administered antibiotics for greater than 28 days and debridement in 7 of 8 patients. the indolent nature of nho complicates diagnosis, especially  in patients with recent compound fractures. only prompt bone culture can confirm  the presence of nho and reliably guide antimicrobial therapy.

(n = 35), and  streptococci (n = 51). the results for both cephalosporins were: 20-hour pre-diffusion produced larger zones than direct diffusion, regression studies for 20-hour pre-diffusion as compared to direct diffusion resulted in greater variation in zone sizes, numerically lower slopes, lower residual variances and higher correlation coefficients, and regression lines were significantly different for the 3 groups of bacteria with direct diffusion but not so with 20-hour pre-diffusion. considering the interpretation of zone sizes with disc diffusion for the cephalosporins tested, 20-hour pre-diffusion was superior to direct diffusion.

(1 strain), beta-streptococcus (1 strain), gram-positive rods (2  strains), enterobacter cloacae (1 strain), bacteroides bivius (1 strain), pseudomonas sp. (1 strain), pseudomonas cepacia (1 strain) and gram-negative rods (1 strain) were eradicated by the mk-0787/mk-0791 treatment. the safety of the drug was analyzed in 22 patients, effects occurred in 3 (13.6%). among those 3 patients, diarrhea occurred in 1 patient, rash in another and nausea and vomiting in yet another. one patient had an increased bun after the mk-0787/mk-0791 treatment. in the other 21 patients, no abnormalities in creatinine, got, gpt, or t. bil. values were observed. it may be concluded that mk-0787/mk-0791 is useful  for the treatment of obstetrical and gynecological infections.

AB  == a total of 222 cases of septicaemia was recorded at the university hospital of the west indies between june 1982 and june 1983. this gave an overall incidence of 16.1 per 1000 admissions. the 233 bacterial strains isolated comprised 100 gram-positive and 133 gram-negative organisms with klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus being the most frequent. highest rates of septicaemia were recorded in patients less than 1 year and over  50 years of age. septicaemia caused by gram-positive organisms was predominantly  a disease of children whereas that caused by gram-negative organisms arose more often in neonates and in patients over 50 years of age. a predisposing factor was noted in 104 patients of whom 42 had neoplastic disease. the most frequently identified initial sites of infection were the respiratory tract, the gastro-intestinal tract and the meninges. most blood stream infections were community-acquired, three quarters of all septicaemic patients being admitted to  the departments of medicine or paediatrics. there were 11 cases of polymicrobial  septicaemia caused predominantly by gram-negative organisms in patients with underlying disease. appropriate antimicrobial drugs were administered to 57% of septicaemic patients whereas 17% received superfluous antimicrobial therapy. in those patients who received inappropriate antimicrobial therapy there was a marked increase in mortality. forty of 61 deaths were attributed to septicaemia.  mortality from septicaemia caused by gram-negative organisms was 21% compared with 13% for that caused by gram-positive organisms. the organisms associated with the highest case fatality rates were escherichia coli, 53%; enterobacter sp., 27%; and beta-haemolytic streptococci 24%. there were no deaths from septicaemia caused by haemophilus influenzae, salmonella sp. or serratia sp. the  highest mortality rates were associated with neoplastic disease, diabetes, polymicrobial septicaemia, urinary tract infections and old age.

TI  == assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.

TI  == susceptibility of equine bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == in vitro antimicrobic susceptibility patterns of commonly isolated aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens of equine origin were determined, using the agar-plate dilution method. all organisms were recent clinical isolates and included corynebacterium (rhodococcus) equi, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, (coagulase positive) staphylococcus sp, streptococcus equi, streptococcus zooepidemicus, actinobacillus sp, enterobacter  cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella. in vitro susceptibility levels were outlined for 14 antimicrobics as  follows: amikacin less than or equal to 4.0 micrograms/ml, ampicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, amoxicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, cefadroxil less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, chloramphenicol less than or  equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, erythromycin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml,  gentamicin less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml, kanamycin less than or equal  to 4.0 micrograms/ml, penicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, tetracycline less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, sulfadimethoxine less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms/ml, ormetoprim/sulfadimethoxine less than or equal to 0.5/9.5 micrograms/ml, sulfadiazine less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms/ml, and trimethoprim/sulfadiazine less than or equal to 0.5/9.5 micrograms/ml.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of three new quinolone antibiotics against recent clinical isolates.
AB  == new orally absorbable quinolone derivatives, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin demonstrated excellent activity in vitro against clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, proteus mirabilis, proteus sp. indole-positive, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococci. none of the 3 drugs was more than moderately effective against bacteroides fragilis. ciprofloxacin was 2-4 times more effective against most gram-negative strains than was either norfloxacin or  ofloxacin, and was also the most effective against gram-positive strains, though  the difference was less marked. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were almost equally effective against s. aureus. results with agar and with broth were comparable. the activities of all 3 drugs were essentially independent of inoculum size, as the mic values increased less than one dilution step when the inoculum was increased from 10(3) to 10(6). the new quinolone derivatives would appear to be promising alternatives to injectable drugs such as the aminoglycosides and cephalosporins.

TI  == distribution and effects of a defined six-member murine-derived microflora in gnotobiotic gerbils.
AB  == the gnotobiotic gerbil was selected as a model with which to study the effects of colonization with a defined microflora on organ morphology, histology, and selected blood biochemical parameters. gerbils were maintained germfree for 13 months but failed to reproduce, presumably because of the enlarged cecum. a colony of gnotobiotic gerbils that was associated with a bacterial flora consisting of lactobacillus brevis, streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacteroides vulgatus, enterobacter aerogenes, and a fusobacterium sp. was established. these gnotobiotic gerbils had smaller ceca than germfree gerbils and proved capable of reproduction. except for the presence of large numbers of bacteroides organisms in the stomach and greater numbers of s. epidermidis in gnotobiotic gerbils, the number and location of gastrointestinal bacteria were similar in conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils. bacteroides sp. was the second most predominant microorganism present in gnotobiotic gerbils, whereas clostridia were reported to be the second most predominant microorganism  in conventional gerbils. microscopic examination of direct-impression smears indicated that fusobacteria were present on mucosal surfaces. intestines of gnotobiotic gerbils weighed twice as much as the intestines of conventional gerbils. intestinal tissue water weight values from conventional and gnotobiotic  gerbils were similar. histological examination of gerbil intestinal tissue revealed no cellular hypertrophy and no evidence of inflammation in gnotobiotic gerbil intestines. spleens of gnotobiotic gerbils showed no germinal center stimulation. statistical differences in total serum glucose, serum protein, and hematocrit levels were found between conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils.

TI  == [effect of solid substrates of microbial colony development].
AB  == bacteria have been found to grow differently at contact sites to both organic and anorganic solids as on pure agar media. of 16 ad hoc selected bacterial strains,  the following species (arranged in decreasing order) responded with stronger colony formation: bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, streptococcus sanguis, s. saprophyticus, s. faecalis, escherichia coli, micrococcus flavus, actinomyces viscosus, veillonella sp., enterobacter liquefaciens, yersinia enterocolitica. lactobacillus casei behaved neutral. proteus vulgaris, y. enterocolitica and chromobacterium violaceum grow on certain media only in the presence of solid particles. the yeasts endomyces lactis, saccharomyces cerevisiae, rhodotorula mucilaginosa and cryptococcus nigricans did not respond to solid particles during colony formation. the kind of protein-animal (meat) or vegetable (soy beans)-did  not influence the behaviour of the microorganisms in these experiments.

TI  == efficacy of ceftizoxime administered twice daily in hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections.
AB  == the efficacy and safety of ceftizoxime administered twice daily were evaluated in 215 hospitalized patients with documented lower respiratory tract infections. the majority of patients received 1 to 2 gm of ceftizoxime intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours; the mean dosage was 2 gm/day, and the mean duration of therapy was 8.9 days. clinical cure was achieved in 204 (95%) of the 215 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. one hundred and thirty-eight patients were both clinically and bacteriologically evaluable. the clinical response rates, by organism, were: streptococcus pneumoniae, 100% (50/50); haemophilus influenzae, 96% (25/26); gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter sp, serratia sp, pseudomonas sp, klebsiella sp, citrobacter sp, and morganella morganii), 86% (32/37); and staphylococcus aureus, 92% (12/13). in the other 77 patients with clinical symptoms, no pathogen was isolated or insufficient follow-up data were collected to assess bacteriologic response. adverse reactions, which were infrequent, were similar to those reported in other us trials of the drug. the findings indicate that ceftizoxime,  1 to 2 gm bid, is effective and safe in the treatment of lower respiratory tract  infections in hospitalized patients. this low-dose regimen can significantly reduce the cost of cephalosporin therapy.

AB  == we reviewed 15 cases of culture-proven corneal superinfections in 15 patients (eight men and seven women ranging in age from 41 to 86 years) with recurrent herpes simplex keratitis. the factors that appeared to increase the risk of superinfection were the presence of an epithelial defect (found in all 15 cases), a history of recurrent herpetic keratouveitis (found in ten cases), and the use of topical corticosteroids (found in 13 cases). eight of the 15 patients were taking antibiotics at the time the superinfections were diagnosed, indicating that topical antibiotics do not provide sufficient protection. gram-negative rods were found in six cases (proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and achromobacter sp.). gram-positive organisms, often in association with another infecting agent, were  found in six cases (staphylococcus epidermidis, three cases; s. aureus, two cases; and streptococcus sp., two cases). fungal superinfections were found in three cases (cephalosporium acremonium, candida albicans, and aspergillus fumigatus, one case each). mycobacterium cheloni was found in two cases.

TI  == direct dilution sampling, quantitation, and microbial assessment of open-system ventilation circuits in intensive care units.
AB  == in a systematic approach, 37 duplicate samples of open system circuits (bennett ma-1 ventilators) of patients in medical and surgical intensive care units were processed by direct and serial (apha guidelines) dilutions. the paired difference test on 15 of the in-use circuitry solution samples indicated no difference between the direct and serial dilution methods (p less than 0.001). seventy-seven additional respiratory therapy circuitry samples from similar intensive care patients were analyzed via a direct dilution method alone and processed microbiologically. the direct dilution procedure was a rapid and accurate means of evaluation of microbial contamination in the range of greater than or equal to 10 to less than or equal to 10(6) cfu/ml. high densities of organisms frequently  were found. sites of contamination included the proximal or patient end of the circuitry (heaviest), the nebulizer trap, and the distal or humidifier portions of the circuitry. the contaminants found were predominantly gram-negative nonfermenters: acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. antitratus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas maltophilia, and flavobacterium meningosepticum. fermenters were klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus sp., enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, and enterobacter agglomerans. infrequently, gram-positive streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp. were noted.

TI  == in vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  == norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. we examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including  anaerobic species. it inhibited 90% (mic90) of strains of escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, salmonella and shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. the mics of proteus mirabilis, morganella sp., proteus vulgaris, proteus rettgeri, and providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 of serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the mic50, the mic75, and the mic90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic50 of pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the mic90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. yersinia, arizona, and aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was campylobacter. the activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the mic90s of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. all listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. the activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, ph, or inoculum size. there was no major difference between mic and minimum bactericidal concentration values. norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.

AB  == the frequency with which various bacteria are isolated from samples of hospitalized patients and the occurrence of sensitivity to antimicrobial agents in these bacteria are described. data were collected and summarized by an electronic data processing system. sensitivity data were obtained with the disc diffusion test carried out by the bauer/kirby method. e. coli and s. aureus were  the most frequently isolated organisms. pseudomonas sp. (in 90% pseud. aeruginosa) took second place behind e. coli among gramnegative rod bacteria. as  a rule more than 50% of grampositive and gramnegative bacteria were sensitive to  betalactam antibiotics and broad spectrum agents. aminocyclitols were the most potent drugs. strains resistant to netilmicin or amikacin were only exceptionally observed. a comparison of the occurrence of sensitive bacteria from 1975 to 1980  revealed that with rare exceptions no decrease of sensitivity to standard drug occurred in e. coli, the klebsiella-enterobacter-serratia group, pseudo. aeruginosa and s. aureus.

TI  == formation of methyl mercury by bacteria.
AB  == twenty-three hg2+-resistant cultures were isolated from sediment of the savannah  river in georgia; of these, 14 were gram-negative short rods belonging to the genera escherichia and enterobacter, six were gram-positive cocci (three staphylococcus sp. and three streptococcus sp.) and three were bacillus sp. all the escherichia, enterobacter, and the bacillus strain were more resistant to hg2+ than the strains of staphylococci and streptococci. adaptation using serial  dilutions and concentration gradient agar plate techniques showed that it was possible to select a hg2+-resistant strain from a parent culture identified as enterobacter aerogenes. this culture resisted 1,200 mug of hg2+ per ml of medium  and produced methyl mercury from hgcl2, but was unable to convert hg2+ to volatile elemental mercury (hg0). under constant aeration (i.e., submerged culture), slightly more methyl mercury was formed than in the absence of aeration. production of methyl mercury was cyclic in nature and slightly decreased if dl-homocysteine was present in media, but increased with methylcobalamine. it is concluded that the bacterial production of methyl mercury may be a means of resistance and detoxification against mercurials in which inorganic hg2+ is converted to organic form and secreted into the environment.

AB  == bl-s 339 is a new broad-spectrum, parenterally effective cephalosporin whose expression of antibacterial activity in vitro is markedly affected by the nature  of the assay medium. when assayed in nutrient agar, bl-s 339 was more active than cephalothin against strains of diplococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter, and indole-positive proteus sp. however, when assayed in mueller-hinton medium, its activity, especially against gram-negative bacteria, was reduced substantially, whereas the activity of cephalothin was virtually unaffected by the assay medium. the in vivo activity of bl-s 339 correlated well with its activity in nutrient agar; when administered subcutaneously to mice, it was therapeutically more efficacious than cephalothin in infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. when bl-s 339 was administered intramuscularly to mice, the concentrations achieved in the blood were three times those achieved with cephalothin. bl-s 339 was bound to human serum proteins to the same extent as cephalothin. recovery of bl-s 339 in the urine within the 24-hr period after intramuscular administration to rats was three times that of cephalothin.

TI  == enhancing effect on alkalinization of the medium on the activity of erythromycin  against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of erythromycin was markedly enhanced by alkalinization of the culture medium or urine within the clinical range (ph 6.0 to 8.2). this effect was demonstrated against recent isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis. the urine of normal volunteers was made alkaline by ingestion of sodium bicarbonate or acetazolamide (diamox) during administration of 1.0 g of erythromycin every 8 hr; such urine was capable of inhibiting e. coli and k. pneumoniae even when diluted  up to (in one instance) 128 times with broth of the same ph as the urine. undiluted urine of the same subjects, without alkalinization, was seldom capable  of inhibiting these organisms. the range of ph (6.6 to 8.6) over which the antibacterial effect was enhanced coincided with that over which there was decreasing ionization of a basic group.
