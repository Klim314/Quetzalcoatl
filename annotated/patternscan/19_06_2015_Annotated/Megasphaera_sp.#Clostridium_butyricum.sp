TI  == impact of organic loading rate on biohydrogen production in an up-flow anaerobic  packed bed reactor (uanpbr).
AB  == this study assesses the impact of organic loading rate on biohydrogen production  from glucose in an up-flow anaerobic packed bed reactor (uanpbr). two mesophilic  uapbrs (uanpbr1 and 2) were tested at organic loading rates (olrs) ranging from 6.5 to 51.4 g cod l(-1)d(-1). to overcome biomass washout, design modifications were made in the uanpbr2 to include a settling zone to capture the detached biomass. the design modifications in uanpbr2 increased the average hydrogen yield from 0.98 to 2.0 mol-h2 mol(-1)-glucose at an olr of 25.7 g cod l(-1)d(-1). although, a maximum hydrogen production rate of 23.4 +/- 0.9 l h2 l(-1)d(-1) was  achieved in the uanpbr2 at an olr of 51.4 g cod l(-1)d(-1), the hydrogen yield dropped by 50% to around 1 mol-h2 mol(-1)-glucose. the microbiological analysis (pcr/dgge) showed that the biohydrogen production was due to the presence of the  hydrogen and volatile acid producers such as clostridium beijerinckii, clostridium butyricum, megasphaera elsdenii and propionispira arboris.
