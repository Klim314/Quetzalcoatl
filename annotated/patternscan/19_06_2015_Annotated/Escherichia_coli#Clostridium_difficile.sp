TI  == recombinant lipoproteins as novel vaccines with intrinsic adjuvant.
AB  == a core platform technology for high production of recombinant lipoproteins with built-in immunostimulator for novel subunit vaccine development has been established. this platform technology has the following advantages: (1) easily convert antigen into lipidated recombinant protein using a fusion sequence containing lipobox and express high level (50-150mg/l) in escherichia coli; (2) a robust high-yield up- and downstream bioprocess for lipoprotein production is successfully developed to devoid endotoxin contamination; (3) the lipid moiety of recombinant lipoproteins, which is identical to that of bacterial lipoproteins is recognized as danger signals by the immune system (toll-like receptor 2 agonist), so both innate and adaptive immune responses can be induced by lipoproteins; and  (4) successfully demonstrate the feasibility and safety of this core platform technology in meningococcal group b subunit vaccine, dengue subunit vaccine, novel subunit vaccine against clostridium difficile-associated diseases, and hpv-based immunotherapeutic vaccines in animal model studies.

TI  == intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases: a systematic review.
AB  == evidence suggests that possible imbalances in intestinal microbiota composition may be implicated in the occurrence of allergic diseases. although several studies published until 2006 indicated a correlation between microbiota composition and allergic symptoms, it has not been possible to distinguish protective microorganisms from those associated with increased risk of allergic diseases. therefore, the objective of this study was to review the studies published since 2007 that address the intestinal microbiota in allergic diseases. twenty-one studies were identified after excluding those that performed a clinical intervention before stool collection. in the early microbiota of children who later developed allergies, lower bacterial diversity was observed, with a predominance of firmicutes; a higher count of bacteroidaceae; a higher prevalence of the anaerobic bacteria bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, and  bifidobacterium longum; and a lower prevalence of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, and lactobacillus. in the microbiota of allergic children whose intestinal microbiota was assessed at the onset of allergic symptoms, there was a higher count of bacteroides; a lower count of akkermansia muciniphila, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and clostridium; a higher prevalence of b. adolescentis; a lower prevalence of b. catenulatum and staphylococcus aureus; and a lower bacterial diversity.

TI  == ecological effect of ceftazidime/avibactam on the normal human intestinal microbiota.
AB  == ceftazidime/avibactam is a new combination of the antibiotic ceftazidime with the novel, non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor avibactam. the purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of ceftazidime/avibactam on the human intestinal microbiota following intravenous (i.v.) administration. twelve healthy volunteers received ceftazidime/avibactam by i.v. infusion (2000mg ceftazidime and 500mg avibactam) given over 2h every 8h on days 1-6 (inclusive) and a single  dose on day 7. faecal samples were collected on day-1 (pre-dose), during administration on days 2, 5 and 7 and post-dose on days 9, 14 and 21. samples were cultured on non-selective and selective media. the number of escherichia coli and other enterobacteria decreased significantly during administration of ceftazidime/avibactam, whereas the number of enterococci increased. lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, clostridia and bacteroides decreased significantly during ceftazidime/avibactam administration. the effects on lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and bacteroides were similar in the 12 volunteers, whilst clostridia showed different ecological patterns among the volunteers. toxigenic clostridium difficile strains were detected in five volunteers during the study. in four of the volunteers, loose stools were reported as adverse events. plasma samples were collected on days -1, 2, 5 and 7. ceftazidime and avibactam concentrations in plasma (ceftazidime 0-224.2mg/l of plasma and avibactam 0-70.5mg/l of plasma) and faeces (ceftazidime 0-468.2mg/kg of faeces and avibactam 0-146.0mg/kg of faeces)  were found by bioassay. new colonising resistant clostridia were found in five volunteers and lactobacilli were found in three volunteers.

TI  == chemical communication in the gut: effects of microbiota-generated metabolites on gastrointestinal bacterial pathogens.
AB  == gastrointestinal pathogens must overcome many obstacles in order to successfully  colonize a host, not the least of which is the presence of the gut microbiota, the trillions of commensal microorganisms inhabiting mammals' digestive tracts, and their products. it is well established that a healthy gut microbiota provides its host with protection from numerous pathogens, including salmonella species, clostridium difficile, diarrheagenic escherichia coli, and vibrio cholerae. conversely, pathogenic bacteria have evolved mechanisms to establish an infection and thrive in the face of fierce competition from the microbiota for space and nutrients. here, we review the evidence that gut microbiota-generated metabolites play a key role in determining the outcome of infection by bacterial pathogens. by consuming and transforming dietary and host-produced metabolites, as well as secreting primary and secondary metabolites of their own, the microbiota define the chemical environment of the gut and often determine specific host responses.  although most gut microbiota-produced metabolites are currently uncharacterized,  several well-studied molecules made or modified by the microbiota are known to affect the growth and virulence of pathogens, including short-chain fatty acids,  succinate, mucin o-glycans, molecular hydrogen, secondary bile acids, and the ai-2 quorum sensing autoinducer. we also discuss challenges and possible approaches to further study of the chemical interplay between microbiota and gastrointestinal pathogens.

TI  == recognition of human milk oligosaccharides by bacterial exotoxins.
AB  == the affinities of the most abundant oligosaccharides found in human milk for four bacterial exotoxins (from vibrio cholerae and pathogenic escherichia coli) were quantified for the first time. association constants (k a) for a library of 20 human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) binding to shiga toxin type 2 holotoxin (stx2) and the b subunit homopentamers of cholera toxin, heat-labile toxin and shiga toxin type 1 (ctb5, hltb5 and stx1b5) were measured at 25 degrees c and ph 7 using the direct electrospray ionization mass spectrometry assay. notably, all four bacterial toxins bind to a majority of the hmos tested and five of the hmos  (2'-fucosyllactose, lacto-n-tetraose, lacto-n-fucopentaose i, lacto-n-fucopentaose ii and lacto-n-fucopentaose iii) are ligands for all four toxins. these five hmos are also reported to bind to other bacterial toxins (e.g. toxin a and toxin b of clostridium difficile). in all cases, the hmo affinities (apparent k a) are relatively modest (</=15,000 m-1). however, at the high concentrations of hmos typically ingested by infants, a significant fraction of these toxins, if present, is expected to be bound to hmos. binding measurements carried out with 2'-fucosyllactose or lacto-n-fucopentaose i, together with a high-affinity ligand based on the native carbohydrate receptor, revealed that all four toxins possess hmo-binding sites that are distinct from those of the native  receptors, although evidence of competitive binding was found for lacto-n-fucopentaose i with stx2 and 2'-fucosyllactose and lacto-n-fucopentaose i with hltb5. taken together, the results of this study suggest that, while hmos are expected to bind extensively to these bacterial toxins, it is unlikely that hmo binding will effectively inhibit their interactions with their cellular receptors.

TI  == extensive identification of bacterial riboflavin transporters and their distribution across bacterial species.
AB  == riboflavin, the precursor for the cofactors flavin mononucleotide (fmn) and flavin adenine dinucleotide, is an essential metabolite in all organisms. while the functions for de novo riboflavin biosynthesis and riboflavin import may coexist in bacteria, the extent of this co-occurrence is undetermined. the ribm,  ribn, rfuabcd and the energy-coupling factor-ribu bacterial riboflavin transporters have been experimentally characterized. in addition, impx, rfnt and  ribxy are proposed as riboflavin transporters based on positional clustering with riboflavin biosynthetic pathway (rbp) genes or conservation of the fmn riboswitch regulatory element. here, we searched for the fmn riboswitch in bacterial genomes to identify genes encoding riboflavin transporters and assessed their distribution among bacteria. two new putative riboflavin transporters were identified: ribz in clostridium and ribv in mesoplasma florum. trans-complementation of an escherichia coli riboflavin auxotroph strain confirmed the riboflavin transport activity of ribz from clostridium difficile, ribxy from chloroflexus aurantiacus, impx from fusobacterium nucleatum and rfnt from ochrobactrum anthropi. the analysis of the genomic distribution of all known bacterial riboflavin transporters revealed that most occur in species possessing  the rbp and that some bacteria may even encode functional riboflavin transporters from two different families. our results indicate that some species possess ancestral riboflavin transporters, while others possess transporters that appear  to have evolved recently. moreover, our data suggest that unidentified riboflavin transporters also exist. the present study doubles the number of experimentally characterized riboflavin transporters and suggests a specific, non-accessory role for these proteins in riboflavin-prototrophic bacteria.

TI  == colonic muc2 mucin regulates the expression and antimicrobial activity of beta-defensin 2.
AB  == in this study we identified mechanisms at the colonic mucosa by which muc2 mucin  regulated the production of beta-defensin in a proinflammatory milieu but functionally protected susceptible bacteria from its antimicrobial effects. the regulator role of muc2 on production of beta-defensin 2 in combination with the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) was confirmed using purified human colonic muc2 mucin and colonic goblet cells short hairpin rna (shrna) silenced for muc2. in vivo, muc2-/- mice showed impaired beta-defensin mrna expression and peptide localization in the colon as compared with muc2+/- and muc2+/+ littermates. importantly, purified muc2 mucin abrogated the antimicrobial activity of beta-defensin 2 against nonpathogenic and enteropathogenic escherichia coli. sodium metaperiodate oxidation of muc2 removed the capacity of muc2 to stimulate beta-defensin production and muc2's inhibition  of defensin antimicrobial activity. this study highlights that a defective muc2 mucin barrier, typical in inflammatory bowel diseases, may lead to deficient stimulation of beta-defensin 2 and an unbalanced microbiota that favor the growth of beta-defensin-resistant microbes such as clostridium difficile.mucosal immunology advance online publication, 29 april 2015; doi:10.1038/mi.2015.27.

TI  == loss of microbiota-mediated colonization resistance to clostridium difficile infection with oral vancomycin compared with metronidazole.
AB  == antibiotic administration disrupts the intestinal microbiota, increasing susceptibility to pathogens such as clostridium difficile. metronidazole or oral  vancomycin can cure c. difficile infection, and administration of these agents to prevent c. difficile infection in high-risk patients, although not sanctioned by  infectious disease society of america guidelines, has been considered. the relative impacts of metronidazole and vancomycin on the intestinal microbiota and colonization resistance are unknown. we investigated the effect of brief treatment with metronidazole and/or oral vancomycin on susceptibility to c. difficile, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli infection in mice. although metronidazole resulted in transient loss of colonization resistance, oral vancomycin markedly disrupted the microbiota, leading to prolonged loss of colonization resistance to c. difficile infection and dense colonization by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, k. pneumoniae, and e. coli. our results demonstrate that vancomycin, and to a lesser extent metronidazole, are associated with marked intestinal microbiota destruction and greater risk of colonization by nosocomial  pathogens.

TI  == the livestock reservoir for antimicrobial resistance: a personal view on changing patterns of risks, effects of interventions and the way forward.
AB  == the purpose of this review was to provide an updated overview on the use of antimicrobial agents in livestock, the associated problems for humans and current knowledge on the effects of reducing resistance in the livestock reservoir on both human health and animal production. there is still limiting data on both use of antimicrobial agents, occurrence and spread of resistance as well as impact on human health. however, in recent years, emerging issues related to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, clostridium difficile, escherichia coli and horizontally transferred genes indicates that the livestock reservoir has a more significant impact on human health than was estimated 10 years ago, where the focus was mainly on resistance in campylobacter and salmonella. studies have indicated that there might only be a marginal if any benefit from the regular use of antibiotics and have shown that it is possible to substantially reduce the use of antimicrobial agents in livestock production without compromising animal welfare or health or production. in some cases, this should be done in combination with other measures such as biosecurity and use of vaccines. to enable better studies on both the global burden and the effect of interventions, there is a need for global harmonized integrated and continuous surveillance of antimicrobial usage and antimicrobial resistance, preferably associated with data on production and animal diseases to determine the positive  and negative impact of reducing antimicrobial use in livestock.

TI  == spectrum of enteropathogens detected by the filmarray gi panel in a multicentre study of community-acquired gastroenteritis.
AB  == the european, multicentre, quarterly point-prevalence study of community-acquired diarrhoea (eucodi) analysed stool samples received at ten participating clinical  microbiology laboratories (austria, finland, france, germany, greece, ireland, italy, portugal, romania, and the uk) in 2014. on four specified days, each local laboratory submitted samples from </=20 consecutive patients to the austrian study centre for further testing with the filmarray gi panel (biofire diagnostics, salt lake city, ut, usa). of the 709 samples from as many patients received, 325 (45.8%) tested negative, 268 (37.8%) yielded only one organism, and 116 (16.4%) yielded multiple organisms. positivity rates ranged from 41% (30 of 73 samples) in france to 74% (59 of 80 samples) in romania. with the exception of entamoeba histolytica and vibrio cholerae, all of the 22 targeted pathogens were  detected at least once. enteropathogenic escherichia coli, campylobacter species, toxigenic clostridium difficile, enteroaggregative e. coli, norovirus and enterotoxigenic e. coli were the six most commonly detected pathogens. when tested according to local protocols, seven of 128 positive samples (5.5%) yielded multiple organisms. overall, the filmarray gi panel detected at least one organism in 54.2% (384/709) of the samples, as compared with 18.1% (128/709) when testing was performed with conventional techniques locally. this underlines the considerable potential of multiplex pcr to improve routine stool diagnostics in community-acquired diarrhoea. classic culture methods directed at the isolation of specific pathogens are increasingly becoming second-line tools, being deployed when rapid molecular tests give positive results. this optimizes the yield from stool examinations and dramatically improves the timeliness of diagnosis.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of bismuth subsalicylate on clostridium difficile, escherichia coli o157:h7, norovirus, and other common enteric pathogens.
AB  == previous studies have shown bismuth subsalicylate (bss) has antimicrobial properties, but few studies have addressed the mechanism of action. furthermore,  following bss ingestion other bismuth salts form throughout the gastrointestinal  tract including bismuth oxychloride (biocl) that also act upon enteric pathogens. to further understand the antimicrobial activity of bismuth in infectious diarrhea, the antimicrobial effect of bss and biocl on clostridium difficile, salmonella, shigella, shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli strains and norovirus (nov) were measured. bacterial enteric pathogens in pure culture or in  human fecal material were exposed to 35mg/ml bss or biocl with or without a vehicle suspension. bss and biocl treated samples were quantified and visualized  by transmission electron microscopy. to measure the effect on nov, reduction of infectious murine nov (mnv), a surrogate for human nov, and norwalk virus rna levels were measured by viral plaque assay and rt-qpcr, respectively. bss and biocl reduced bacterial growth by 3-9 logs in all strains with majority resulting in populations of <10 cfu/ml within 24 h. similar results were found when fecal material was included. microscopy images detected bismuth on bacterial membranes  and within the bacterial organisms at 30 min post-treatment. at 8.8mg/ml bss and  biocl reduced infectivity of mnv significantly by 2.7 and 2.0 log after 24 h of exposure. in addition, both bss and biocl slightly reduced the level of norwalk replicon-bearing cells suggesting that bismuth may inhibit nov in vivo. collectively, our results confirm and build on existing data that bss has antimicrobial properties against a wide-range of diarrhea-causing pathogens.

TI  == diverse supramolecular structures formed by self-assembling proteins of the bacillus subtilis spore coat.
AB  == bacterial spores (endospores), such as those of the pathogens clostridium difficile and bacillus anthracis, are uniquely stable cell forms, highly resistant to harsh environmental insults. bacillus subtilis is the best studied spore-former and we have used it to address the question of how the spore coat is assembled from multiple components to form a robust, protective superstructure. b. subtilis coat proteins (coty, cote, cotv and cotw) expressed in escherichia coli can arrange intracellularly into highly stable macro-structures through processes of self-assembly. using electron microscopy, we demonstrate the capacity of these proteins to generate ordered one-dimensional fibres, two-dimensional sheets and three-dimensional stacks. in one case (coty), the high degree of order favours strong, cooperative intracellular disulfide cross-linking. assemblies of this kind could form exquisitely adapted building blocks for higher-order assembly across all spore-formers. these physically robust arrayed units could also have novel applications in nano-biotechnology processes.

TI  == kibdelomycin is a bactericidal broad-spectrum aerobic antibacterial agent.
AB  == bacterial resistance to antibiotics continues to grow and pose serious challenges, while the discovery rate for new antibiotics declines. kibdelomycin is a recently discovered natural-product antibiotic that inhibits bacterial growth by inhibiting the bacterial dna replication enzymes dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv. it was reported to be a broad-spectrum aerobic gram-positive agent with selective inhibition of the anaerobic bacterium clostridium difficile. we have extended the profiling of kibdelomycin by using over 196 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic pathogens recovered from worldwide patient populations. we report the mic50s, mic90s, and bactericidal activities of kibdelomycin. we confirm the gram-positive spectrum and report for the first time that kibdelomycin shows strong activity (mic90, 0.125 mug/ml) against clinical strains of the gram-negative nonfermenter acinetobacter baumannii but only weak activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. we confirm that well-characterized resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae show no cross-resistance to kibdelomycin and quinolones and coumarin antibiotics. we also show that kibdelomycin is not subject to efflux in pseudomonas, though it is in escherichia coli, and it is generally affected by the outer membrane permeability entry barrier in the nonfermenters p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii, which may be addressable by structure-based chemical modification.

TI  == regional infection control assessment of antibiotic resistance knowledge and practice.
AB  == objective: multidrug-resistant organisms (mdros) are an increasing burden among healthcare facilities. we assessed facility-level perceived importance of and responses to various mdros. design: a pilot survey to assess staffing, knowledge, and the perceived importance of and response to various multidrug resistant organisms (mdros) setting: acute care and long-term healthcare facilities methods: in 2012, a survey was distributed to infection preventionists at ~300 healthcare facilities. pathogens assessed were clostridium difficile, carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (cre), carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, multidrug-resistant (defined as bacterial resistance to >/=3 antibiotic classes) pseudomonas, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli. results: a total of 74 unique facilities responded, including 44 skilled nursing facilities (snfs) and 30 acute care facilities (acfs). while acfs consistently isolated patients with active infections or colonization due to these mdros, snfs had more variable responses.  snfs had more multi-occupancy rooms and reported less specialized training in infection control and prevention than did acfs. of all facilities with multi-occupancy rooms, 86% employed a cohorting practice for patients, compared with 50% of those without multi-occupancy rooms; 20% of acfs and 7% of snfs cohorted staff while caring for patients with the same mdro. mrsa and c. difficile were identified as important pathogens in acfs and snfs, while cre importance was unknown or was considered important in <50% of snfs. conclusion: we identified stark differences in human resources, knowledge, policy, and practice between acfs and snfs. for regional control of emerging mdros like cre,  there is an opportunity for public health officials to provide targeted education and interventions. education campaigns must account for differences in audience resources and baseline knowledge.

TI  == a highly acid-resistant novel strain of lactobacillus johnsonii no. 1088 has antibacterial activity, including that against helicobacter pylori, and inhibits  gastrin-mediated acid production in mice.
AB  == a novel strain of lactobacillus johnsonii no. 1088 was isolated from the gastric  juice of a healthy japanese male volunteer, and characterized for its effectiveness in the stomach environment. lactobacillus johnsonii no. 1088 was found to have the strongest acid resistance among several lactobacilli examined (>10% of cells survived at ph 1.0 after 2 h), and such a high acid resistance property was a specific characteristic of this strain of l. johnsonii. when cultured with various virulent bacteria, l. johnsonii no. 1088 inhibited the growth of helicobacter pylori, escherichia coli o-157, salmonella typhimurium, and clostridium difficile, in which case its effectiveness was more potent than that of a type strain of l. johnsonii, jcm2012. in addition to its effect in vitro, l. johnsonii no. 1088 inhibited the growth of h. pylori in human intestinal microbiota-associated mice in both its live and lyophilized forms. moreover, l. johnsonii no. 1088 suppressed gastric acid secretion in mice via decreasing the number of gastrin-positive cells in the stomach. these results taken together suggest that l. johnsonii no. 1088 is a unique lactobacillus having properties beneficial for supporting h. pylori eradication by triple therapy including the use of a proton pump inhibitor (ppi) and also for prophylaxis of gastroesophageal reflux disease possibly caused after h. pylori eradication as a side effect of ppi.

TI  == case-control comparison of bacterial and protozoan microorganisms associated with gastroenteritis: application of molecular detection.
AB  == the introduction of molecular detection of infectious organisms has led to increased numbers of positive findings, as observed for pathogens causing gastroenteritis (ge). however, because little is known about the prevalence of these pathogens in the healthy asymptomatic population, the clinical value of these additional findings is unclear. a case-control study was carried out in a population of patients served by general practitioners in the netherlands. a total of 2710 fecal samples from case and matched control subjects were subjected to multiplex real-time pcr for the 11 most common bacterial and four protozoal causes of ge. of 1515 case samples, 818 (54%) were positive for one or more target organisms. a total of 49% of the controls were positive. higher positivity rates in cases compared to controls were observed for campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., clostridium difficile, enteroinvasive escherichia coli/shigella  spp., enterotoxigenic e. coli, enteroaggregative e. coli, atypical enteropathogenic e. coli (epec), cryptosporidium parvum/hominis, and giardia lamblia. however, dientamoeba fragilis and shiga-like toxigenic e. coli were detected significantly less frequent in cases than in controls, while no difference in prevalence was found for typical epec and enterohemorrhagic e. coli. the association between the presence of microorganisms and ge was the weakest in children aged 0 to 5 years. higher relative loads in cases further support causality. this was seen for campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., enterotoxigenic e. coli, and c. parvum/hominis, and for certain age categories of those infected with c. difficile, enteroaggregative e. coli, and atypical epec. for d. fragilis and shiga-like toxigenic e. coli/enterohemorrhagic e. coli, pathogen loads were lower in cases. application of molecular diagnostics in ge is rapid, sensitive and specific, but results should be interpreted with care, using clinical and additional background information.

TI  == manganese superoxide dismutase from human pathogen clostridium difficile.
AB  == clostridium difficile is a human pathogen that causes severe antibiotic-associated clostridium difficile infection (cdi). herein the mnsodcd from c. difficile was cloned, expressed in escherichia coli,and characterized by  x-ray crystallography, uv/vis and epr spectroscopy, and activity assay, et al. the crystal structure of mnsodcd (2.32 a) reveals a manganese coordination geometry of distorted trigonal bipyramidal, with his111, his197 and asp193 providing the equatorial ligands and with his56 and a hydroxide or water forming  the axial ligands. the catalytic activity of mnsodcd (8,600 u/mg) can be effectively inhibited by 2-methoxyestradiol with an ic50 of 75 mum. the affinity  investigation between 2-methoxyestradiol and mnsodcd by itc indicated a binding constant of 8.6 mum with enthalpy changes (deltah = -4.08 +/- 0.03 kcal/mol, deltas = 9.53 +/- 0.02 cal/mol/deg). an inhibitory mechanism of mnsodcd by 2-methoxyestradiol was probed and proposed based on molecular docking models and  gel filtration analysis. the 2-methoxyestradiol may bind mnsodcd to interfere with the cross-linking between the two active sites of the dimer enzyme, compromising the sod activity. these results provide valuable insight into the rational design of mnsodcd inhibitors for potential therapeutics for cdi.

TI  == rectal bacteriotherapy for recurrent clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea:  results from a case series of 55 patients in denmark 2000-2012.
AB  == clostridium difficile infection is one of the most common nosocomial infections.  among other alternatives to standard treatment with vancomycin for recurrent infection are faecal microbiota transplantation and rectal bacteriotherapy with a fixed mixture of intestinal bacterial strains isolated from faeces of healthy persons to mimic a theoretical normal microflora. developed by dr. tvede and dr.  rask-madsen, the latter method has been in use for selected patients during the last 25 years in denmark. in this study we reviewed the medical records of patients treated with rectal bacteriotherapy for relapsing c. difficile in denmark, 2000-2012. the primary end point was recurrent diarrhoea within 30 days  after treatment. a total of 55 patients were included in this case series. thirty-five patients (64%) had no recurrence within 30 days of bacteriotherapy. patients with recurrence tended to be older (75.8 years vs. 61.3 years; p 0.26),  and more often have preexisting gastrointestinal illness and longer duration of time from the first cdi to bacteriotherapy (221.6 days vs. 175.3 days; p 0.18). treatment success was 80% in the subgroup of patients with no known gastrointestinal illness and first c. difficile episode less than 6 months before bacteriotherapy. the most common adverse events were abdominal pain (10.9%) and worsening diarrhoea (4.3%). one patient was hospitalized 10 days after treatment  with appendicitis, fever, and escherichia coli bacteremia. the results from this  study indicate that rectal bacteriotherapy is a viable alternative to faecal microbiota transplantation in patients with relapsing c. difficile-associated diarrhoea.

AB  == acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis is a bacterial infection of the renal parenchyma, common in women. the bacterium responsible is usually escherichia coli. empirical antibiotic therapy should be initiated promptly to prevent serious complications. as of 2014, which empirical antibiotic regimen should be offered to non-pregnant adult women with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis, while awaiting the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing? we reviewed the available evidence using the standard prescrire methodology. certain oral fluoroquinolones were effective in a few clinical trials in the 2000s and 2010s:  ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, an isomer of ofloxacin. symptoms resolved within  5 to 7 days in about 96% of the women. in france, in 2011, about 10% of e. coli isolated in community laboratories from outpatients with urinary tract infections were resistant to ciprofloxacin. resistance is mainly a problem in patients treated with a quinolone during the preceding months and in recently hospitalised patients. in hospital laboratories, the fluoroquinolone resistance rate was about 18% in 2012 in france, and even higher in some other european countries. the main harms of fluoroquinolones are neuropsychiatric disorders, photosensitivity, tendon disorders, arrhythmia and cardiac conduction disorders, and clostridium difficile infection. injectable "third-generation" cephalosporins, such as ceftriaxone, are often effective against enterobacteria, in particular e. coli, and have good kidney penetration. the prevalence of e. coli resistance to third-generation cephalosporins is rising rapidly in france, particularly in hospitals: 1% in 2005 versus 10% in 2012. the main harms of cephalosporins are hypersensitivity reactions and c. difficile infection. monotherapy with an aminoglycoside is an alternative that has not been evaluated in this clinical situation. due to the serious irreversible adverse effects of aminoglycosides (nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity), they should only be used when the other options are unacceptable. in practice, as of 2014, the first-choice empirical antibiotic  treatment for acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis remains an oral fluoroquinolone  (ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin) or, in certain cases, the injectable third-generation cephalosporin ceftriaxone. given the rapid development of bacterial resistance, broader-spectrum antibiotics should not be used as empirical therapy, to preserve their efficacy in serious infections. the empirical treatment should be adjusted as soon as the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing are known. whenever possible, it is preferable to avoid the use of fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins in non-serious infections such as cystitis.

TI  == meropenem versus piperacillin-tazobactam for definitive treatment of bloodstream  infections due to ceftriaxone non-susceptible escherichia coli and klebsiella spp (the merino trial): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.
AB  == background: gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli or klebsiella spp. frequently cause bloodstream infections. there has been a worldwide increase in resistance in these species to antibiotics such as third generation cephalosporins, largely driven by the acquisition of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase or plasmid-mediated ampc enzymes. carbapenems have been considered the most effective therapy for serious infections caused by such resistant bacteria; however, increased use creates selection pressure for carbapenem resistance, an emerging threat arising predominantly from the dissemination of genes encoding carbapenemases. recent retrospective data suggest that beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, such as piperacillin-tazobactam, may be non-inferior to carbapenems for the treatment of  bloodstream infection caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producers, if susceptible in vitro. this study aims to test this hypothesis in an effort to define carbapenem-sparing alternatives for these infections. methods/design: the  study will use a multicentre randomised controlled open-label non-inferiority trial design comparing two treatments, meropenem (standard arm) and piperacillin-tazobactam (carbapenem-sparing arm) in adult patients with bacteraemia caused by e. coli or klebsiella spp. demonstrating non-susceptibility to third generation cephalosporins. recruitment is planned to occur in sites across three countries (australia, new zealand and singapore). a total sample size of 454 patients will be required to achieve 80% power to determine non-inferiority with a margin of 5%. once randomised, definitive treatment will be for a minimum of 4 days, but up to 14 days with total duration determined by treating clinicians. data describing demographic information, antibiotic use, co-morbid conditions, illness severity, source of infection and other risk factors will be collected. vital signs, white cell count, use of vasopressors and days to bacteraemia clearance will be recorded up to day 7. the primary outcome measure will be mortality at 30 days, with secondary outcomes including days to clinical and microbiological resolution, microbiological failure or relapse, isolation of a multi-resistant organism or clostridium difficile infection. trial registration: the merino trial is registered under the australian new zealand clinical trials register (anzctr), reference number: actrn12613000532707 (registered 13 may 2013) and the us national institute of health clinicaltrials.gov register, reference number: nct02176122 (registered 24 june 2014).

TI  == multicenter evaluation of the biofire filmarray gastrointestinal panel for etiologic diagnosis of infectious gastroenteritis.
AB  == the appropriate treatment and control of infectious gastroenteritis depend on the ability to rapidly detect the wide range of etiologic agents associated with the  disease. clinical laboratories currently utilize an array of different methodologies to test for bacterial, parasitic, and viral causes of gastroenteritis, a strategy that suffers from poor sensitivity, potentially long  turnaround times, and complicated ordering practices and workflows. additionally, there are limited or no testing methods routinely available for most diarrheagenic escherichia coli strains, astroviruses, and sapoviruses. this study assessed the performance of the filmarray gastrointestinal (gi) panel for the simultaneous detection of 22 different enteric pathogens directly from stool specimens: campylobacter spp., clostridium difficile (toxin a/b), plesiomonas shigelloides, salmonella spp., vibrio spp., vibrio cholerae, yersinia enterocolitica, enteroaggregative e. coli, enteropathogenic e. coli, enterotoxigenic e. coli, shiga-like toxin-producing e. coli (stx1 and stx2) (including specific detection of e. coli o157), shigella spp./enteroinvasive e. coli, cryptosporidium spp., cyclospora cayetanensis, entamoeba histolytica, giardia lamblia, adenovirus f 40/41, astrovirus, norovirus gi/gii, rotavirus a, and sapovirus. prospectively collected stool specimens (n = 1,556) were evaluated using the biofire filmarray gi panel and tested with conventional stool culture and molecular methods for comparison. the filmarray gi panel sensitivity was 100% for 12/22 targets and >/=94.5% for an additional 7/22 targets. for the remaining  three targets, sensitivity could not be calculated due to the low prevalences in  this study. the filmarray gi panel specificity was >/=97.1% for all panel targets. the filmarray gi panel provides a comprehensive, rapid, and streamlined  alternative to conventional methods for the etiologic diagnosis of infectious gastroenteritis in the laboratory setting. the potential advantages include improved performance parameters, a more extensive menu of pathogens, and a turnaround time of as short as 1 h.

TI  == new role for human alpha-defensin 5 in the fight against hypervirulent clostridium difficile strains.
AB  == clostridium difficile infection (cdi), one of the most common hospital-acquired infections, is increasing in incidence and severity with the emergence and diffusion of hypervirulent strains. cdi is precipitated by antibiotic treatment that destroys the equilibrium of the gut microbiota. human alpha-defensin 5 (hd5), the most abundant enteric antimicrobial peptide, is a key regulator of gut microbiota homeostasis, yet it is still unknown if c. difficile, which successfully evades killing by other host microbicidal peptides, is susceptible to hd5. we evaluated, by means of viability assay, fluorescence-activated cell sorter (facs) analysis, and electron microscopy, the antimicrobial activities of  alpha-defensins 1 and 5 against a panel of c. difficile strains encompassing the  most prevalent epidemic and hypervirulent pcr ribotypes in europe (012, 014/020,  106, 018, 027, and 078). here we show that (i) concentrations of hd5 within the intestinal physiological range produced massive c. difficile cell killing; (ii) hd5 bactericidal activity was mediated by membrane depolarization and bacterial fragmentation with a pattern of damage peculiar to c. difficile bacilli, compared to commensals like escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis; and (iii) unexpectedly, hypervirulent ribotypes were among the most susceptible to both defensins. these results support the notion that hd5, naturally present at very high concentrations in the mucosa of the small intestine, could indeed control the very early steps of cdi by killing c. difficile bacilli at their germination  site. as a consequence, hd5 can be regarded as a good candidate for the containment of hypervirulent c. difficile strains, and it could be exploited in the therapy of cdi and relapsing c. difficile-associated disease.

TI  == nosocomial bacteriuria in elderly inpatients may be leading to considerable antibiotic overuse: an audit of current management practice in a secondary level  care hospital in new zealand.
AB  == background: bacteriuria in the form of symptomatic urinary tract infection (uti)  and asymptomatic bacteriuria (asb) is common in the elderly. there is no clinical benefit obtained by treating elderly individuals with asb. however, its high prevalence leads to the overdiagnosis of uti and unnecessary antibiotic use, which can result in adverse events, including clostridium difficile diarrhea and  reinfection with antibiotic-resistant organisms. methods: this was a retrospective audit that assessed the management of nosocomial bacteriuria in elderly patients admitted to the over-65 years rehabilitation unit of a secondary level care hospital in new zealand. identified bacteriuria episodes had the timing of sample collection relative to admission, microbial etiology, antibiotic susceptibility profile, inflammatory marker level, and treatment determined. episodes were classified into six different clinical groups based on the presence or absence of signs and symptoms, urinary catheter status, and systemic inflammatory response. the proportion of bacteriuria episodes by clinical grouping and the level of treatment by clinical group were determined, followed by assessment of the amount of overtreatment in terms of the number of unnecessary antibiotic courses and unnecessary antibiotic treatment days. results: significant bacteriuria was identified in 30% of patients, with 35% of urine samples collected in the immediate postadmission period. fifty-four percent of the bacteriuria episodes were asb or catheter-associated asb (ca-asb) without  an inflammatory response, 24% were asb or ca-asb with raised inflammatory markers, and 22% were uti or ca-uti. the most common cause of bacteriuria was escherichia coli, although the etiology was diverse, especially after prolonged hospitalization or in catheterized patients. a large proportion of organisms were resistant to one or more of the commonly used oral antibiotics. treatment of asb  and ca-asb accounted for 43% of all antibiotic courses received. furthermore, treatment of asb and ca-asb combined with unnecessarily prolonged treatment days  for clinically relevant infections accounted for 55% of all antibiotic treatment  days received. conclusion: the results suggest that inappropriate urine screening was occurring and that 43% of antibiotic courses and 55% of all antibiotic treatment days were unnecessary. current practice is amenable to improvement by performing urine culture only when clinically indicated, focusing on clinical signs and symptoms to diagnose clinically significant uti rather than a positive  culture, and using, where possible, the ecologically least damaging antibiotic for the shortest duration required.

TI  == visual detection of bacterial pathogens via pna-based padlock probe assembly and  isothermal amplification of dnazymes.
AB  == we have developed a self-reporting isothermal system for visual bacterial pathogen detection with single base resolution. the new dna diagnostic is based on combination of peptide nucleic acid (pna) technology, rolling circle amplification (rca) and dnazymes. pnas are used as exceedingly selective chemical tools that bind genomic dna at a predetermined sequence under nondenaturing conditions. after assembly of the pna-dna construct a padlock probe is circularized on the free strand. the probe incorporates a g-quadruplex structure  flanked by nicking enzyme recognition sites. the assembled circle serves as a template for a novel hybrid rca strategy that allows for exponential amplification and production of short single-stranded dna pieces. these dna fragments fold into g-quadruplex structures and when complexed with hemin become  functional dnazymes. the catalytic activity of each dnazyme unit leads to colorimetric detection and provides the second amplification step. the combination of pna, rca, and dnazymes allows for sequence-specific and highly sensitive detection of bacteria with a colorimetric output observed with the naked eye. herein, we apply this method for the discrimination of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and clostridium difficile genomes.

TI  == [fecal microbiota transplantation: first case report in chile and review].
AB  == clostridium difficile (cd) infection is increasing in frequency and severity in in-hospital and outpatient clinical settings, with a recurrence that can reach 30% after first episode. the recurrences are usually treated with longer courses  of metronidazole or vancomycin. other treatments have been used, such as probiotics, fidaxomicin, rifaximin, immunoglobulins and monoclonal antibodies against toxins a and b. fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) has emerged as a promising strategy in this group of patients, with effectiveness greater than 90%. we present the first case reported in chile of this therapeutic strategy in  a patient with crohn's disease and recurrent cd infection who presented after the fecal transplantation an escherichia coli bacteremia, suggesting the need for caution in the use of this strategy. 10 months after the fmt the patient presented a new episode of e. coli bacteremia and two episodes of diarrhea due to cd infection, treated both of them with vancomycin with good clinical response.

TI  == detection of zoonotic pathogens and characterization of novel viruses carried by  commensal rattus norvegicus in new york city.
AB  == norway rats (rattus norvegicus) are globally distributed and concentrate in urban environments, where they live and feed in closer proximity to human populations than most other mammals. despite the potential role of rats as reservoirs of zoonotic diseases, the microbial diversity present in urban rat populations remains unexplored. in this study, we used targeted molecular assays to detect known bacterial, viral, and protozoan human pathogens and unbiased high-throughput sequencing to identify novel viruses related to agents of human disease in commensal norway rats in new york city. we found that these rats are infected with bacterial pathogens known to cause acute or mild gastroenteritis in people, including atypical enteropathogenic escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, and salmonella enterica, as well as infectious agents that have been associated with undifferentiated febrile illnesses, including bartonella spp., streptobacillus moniliformis, leptospira interrogans, and seoul hantavirus. we also identified a wide range of known and novel viruses from groups that contain  important human pathogens, including sapoviruses, cardioviruses, kobuviruses, parechoviruses, rotaviruses, and hepaciviruses. the two novel hepaciviruses discovered in this study replicate in the liver of norway rats and may have utility in establishing a small animal model of human hepatitis c virus infection. the results of this study demonstrate the diversity of microbes carried by commensal rodent species and highlight the need for improved pathogen  surveillance and disease monitoring in urban environments. importance: the observation that most emerging infectious diseases of humans originate in animal  reservoirs has led to wide-scale microbial surveillance and discovery programs in wildlife, particularly in the developing world. strikingly, less attention has been focused on commensal animals like rats, despite their abundance in urban centers and close proximity to human populations. to begin to explore the zoonotic disease risk posed by urban rat populations, we trapped and surveyed norway rats collected in new york city over a 1-year period. this analysis revealed a striking diversity of known pathogens and novel viruses in our study population, including multiple agents associated with acute gastroenteritis or febrile illnesses in people. our findings indicate that urban rats are reservoirs for a vast diversity of microbes that may affect human health and indicate a need for increased surveillance and awareness of the disease risks associated with urban rodent infestation.

TI  == the intestinal microbiota composition and weight development in children: the koala birth cohort study.
AB  == objective: to investigate whether the intestinal microbiota composition in early  infancy is associated with subsequent weight development in children. methods: analyses were conducted within the koala birth cohort study (n = 2834). this cohort originates from two recruitments groups: pregnant women with a conventional lifestyle (no selection based on lifestyle) and pregnant women recruited through alternative channels (organic shops, anthroposophic clinicians/midwives, steiner schools and relevant magazines). from 909 one-month-old infants, fecal samples were collected and analyzed by quantitative  pcr targeting bifidobacteria, bacteroides fragilis group, clostridium difficile,  escherichia coli, lactobacilli and total bacteria counts. between the ages of 1 and 10 years, parent-reported weight and height was collected at 7 time points. age- and gender-standardized body mass index (bmi) z-scores were calculated. data were analyzed using generalized estimating equation. results: colonization with b. fragilis group was borderline significantly associated with a higher bmi z-score of 0.15 (95% confidence interval (ci): -0.02 to 0.31), in the conventional subcohort. after stratification for fiber intake (p(forinteraction)  = 0.003), colonization with b. fragilis group was associated with a 0.34 higher bmi z-score among children with a low-fiber intake in this subcohort (95% ci: 0.17-0.53). higher counts among colonized children were positively associated with bmi z-score only in children within the conventional subcohort and a high-fiber diet (bmi z-score 0.08; 95% ci: 0.01-0.14), but inversely associated in children with a low-fiber diet (bmi z-score -0.05; 95% ci: -0.10 to 0.00), and in children recruited through alternative channels (bmi z-score -0.10; 95% ci: -0.17 to -0.03). the other bacteria were not associated with bmi z-scores, regardless of subcohort. conclusion: using a targeted approach, we conclude that  the intestinal microbiota, particularly the b. fragilis group, is associated with childhood weight development. to identify the potential impact of additional bacterial taxa, further prospective studies applying an unconstrained in-depth characterization of the microbiota are needed.

TI  == identification of aminoglycoside and beta-lactam resistance genes from within an  infant gut functional metagenomic library.
AB  == the infant gut microbiota develops rapidly during the first 2 years of life, acquiring microorganisms from diverse sources. during this time, significant opportunities exist for the infant to acquire antibiotic resistant bacteria, which can become established and constitute the infant gut resistome. with increased antibiotic resistance limiting our ability to treat bacterial infections, investigations into resistance reservoirs are highly pertinent. this  study aimed to explore the nascent resistome in antibiotically-naive infant gut microbiomes, using a combination of metagenomic approaches. faecal samples from 22 six-month-old infants without previous antibiotic exposure were used to construct a pooled metagenomic library, which was functionally screened for ampicillin and gentamicin resistance. our library of approximately 220mb contained 0.45 ampicillin resistant hits/mb and 0.059 gentamicin resistant hits/mb. pcr-based analysis of fosmid clones and uncloned metagenomic dna, revealed a diverse and abundant aminoglycoside and beta-lactam resistance reservoir within the infant gut, with resistance determinants exhibiting homology to those found in common gut inhabitants, including escherichia coli, enterococcus sp., and clostridium difficile, as well as to genes from cryptic environmental bacteria. notably, the genes identified differed from those revealed when a sequence-driven pcr-based screen of metagenomic dna was employed. carriage of these antibiotic resistance determinants conferred substantial, but varied (2-512x), increases in antibiotic resistance to their bacterial host. these data provide insights into the infant gut resistome, revealing the presence of a varied aminoglycoside and beta-lactam resistance reservoir even in the absence of selective pressure, confirming the infant resistome establishes early  in life, perhaps even at birth.

TI  == clostridium difficile hfq can replace escherichia coli hfq for most of its function.
AB  == a gene for the hfq protein is present in the majority of sequenced bacterial genomes. its characteristic hexameric ring-like core structure is formed by the highly conserved n-terminal regions. in contrast, the c-terminal forms an extension, which varies in length, lacks homology, and is predicted to be unstructured. in gram-negative bacteria, hfq facilitates the pairing of srnas with their mrna target and thus affects gene expression, either positively or negatively, and modulates srna degradation. in gram-positive bacteria, its role is still poorly characterized. numerous srnas have been detected in many gram-positive bacteria, but it is not yet known whether these srnas act in association with hfq. compared with all other hfqs, the c. difficile hfq exhibits an unusual c-terminal sequence with 75% asparagine and glutamine residues, while  the n-terminal core part is more conserved. to gain insight into the functionality of the c. difficile hfq (cd-hfq) protein in processes regulated by  srnas, we have tested the ability of cd-hfq to fulfill the functions of the e. coli hfq (ec-hfq) by examining various functions associated with hfq in both positive and negative controls of gene expression. we found that cd-hfq substitutes for most but not all of the tested functions of the ec-hfq protein. we also investigated the role of the c-terminal part of the hfq proteins. we found that the c-terminal part of both ec-hfq and cd-hfq is not essential but contributes to some functions of both the e. coli and c. difficile chaperons.

TI  == iron fortification adversely affects the gut microbiome, increases pathogen abundance and induces intestinal inflammation in kenyan infants.
AB  == background: in-home iron fortification for infants in developing countries is recommended for control of anaemia, but low absorption typically results in >80%  of the iron passing into the colon. iron is essential for growth and virulence of many pathogenic enterobacteria. we determined the effect of high and low dose in-home iron fortification on the infant gut microbiome and intestinal inflammation. methods: we performed two double-blind randomised controlled trials in 6-month-old kenyan infants (n=115) consuming home-fortified maize porridge daily for 4 months. in the first, infants received a micronutrient powder (mnp) containing 2.5 mg iron as nafeedta or the mnp without iron. in the second, they received a different mnp containing 12.5 mg iron as ferrous fumarate or the mnp without the iron. the primary outcome was gut microbiome composition analysed by  16s pyrosequencing and targeted real-time pcr (qpcr). secondary outcomes included faecal calprotectin (marker of intestinal inflammation) and incidence of diarrhoea. we analysed the trials separately and combined. results: at baseline,  63% of the total microbial 16s rrna could be assigned to bifidobacteriaceae but there were high prevalences of pathogens, including salmonella clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, and pathogenic escherichia coli. using pyrosequencing, +femnps increased enterobacteria, particularly escherichia/shigella (p=0.048), the enterobacteria/bifidobacteria ratio (p=0.020), and clostridium (p=0.030). most of these effects were confirmed using  qpcr; for example, +femnps increased pathogenic e. coli strains (p=0.029). +femnps also increased faecal calprotectin (p=0.002). during the trial, 27.3% of  infants in +12.5 mgfemnp required treatment for diarrhoea versus 8.3% in -12.5 mgfemnp (p=0.092). there were no study-related serious adverse events in either group. conclusions: in this setting, provision of iron-containing mnps to weaning infants adversely affects the gut microbiome, increasing pathogen abundance and causing intestinal inflammation. trial registration number: nct01111864.

TI  == gastrointestinal pathogens detected by multiplex nucleic acid amplification testing in stools of pediatric patients and patients returning from the tropics.
AB  == background: gastrointestinal infections are caused by a broad spectrum of pathogens. conventional diagnostic procedures are resource and time consuming due to single pathogen testing, often in different laboratories. method: we analyzed  312 consecutive stool samples from pediatric patients (n = 127) with gastroenteritis or from adult travelers returning from the tropics with suspected parasite infestation (n = 185) using commercial multiplex nucleic acid amplification testing (nat) (xtag gastrointestinal pathogen panel, luminex) covering 15 diarrhea-causing pathogens. the results of the positive samples and a representative number of negative samples were compared to standard methods, including nat, direct antigen detection (dad), bacterial culture and microscopy.  results: of the 185 samples from adult travelers, 21 (11 %) were multiplexnat-positive, with enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (4 %) being the predominant pathogen. microscopic examination revealed blastocystis hominis in 23 % not covered by the panel. multiplexnat scored positive in 66 pediatric samples  (52 %), with rotavirus (27 %) being the most prevalent. all adenovirus-, rotavirus-, clostridium difficile- and cryptosporidium-positive samples were confirmed in external laboratories, but only 40 % of norovirus- and 29 % of giardia-positive samples. analysis of frozen specimens by bacterial culture showed the highest discrepancies with the multiplexnat. conclusion: our study demonstrates broad detection of relevant gastroenteritis pathogens by multiplexnat with a short turnaround time. this is important for diagnosis, infection control and empiric management of gastroenteritis patients, but may be  selectively complemented by bacterial culture and resistance testing.

TI  == modulating the microbiota in inflammatory bowel diseases: prebiotics, probiotics  or faecal transplantation?
AB  == crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc) are the two major phenotypes of  inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd) which constitute a spectrum of chronic, debilitating diseases characterised by a relapsing inflammation of the intestinal mucosal lining. evidence from a variety of disciplines implicates the intestinal  microbiota in the pathogenesis of idiopathic ibd and their complications, including pouchitis. many studies have reported a dysbiosis in ibd, characterised by a decrease in diversity, a decreased abundance of some dominant commensal members (such as clostridium iv and xiva) and an increase in detrimental bacteria (such as sulphate reducing bacteria and escherichia coli). therapies such as prebiotics and probiotics aim to selectively manipulate the intestinal microbiota and have been evaluated as an attractive therapeutic option with few side effects. the multispecies product vsl#3 was found effective in preventing and maintaining remission in pouchitis, whereas both vsl#3 and e. coli nissle were effective in maintaining remission in uc. a more drastic approach to restore the  composition of the microbiota and correct the underlying imbalance is a faecal microbiota transplantation (fmt). fmt has been successfully applied to treat patients with even recalcitrant clostridium difficile infection. particularly in  uc, the majority of studies suggest that fmt may be an effective treatment option although the evidence is still limited. it is anticipated that our increasing knowledge on the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota components will allow in the future for a better selection of highly performing bacteria with specific functions required for specific benefits.

TI  == structural, spectroscopic and functional investigation into fe-substituted mnsod  from human pathogen clostridium difficile.
AB  == clostridium difficile, which inhabits the human digestive tract, is an etiological agent that causes pseudomembranous colitis and antibiotic-associated  diarrhea. the oxidative stress tightly relates to its virulence, which highlights the function of its superoxide dismutase (sod). the sod from clostridium difficile (sodcd) is a mn/fe cambialistic sod with mnsodcd exhibiting an optimal  activity while fe-sub-mnsodcd showing 10-fold less activity. to explain why the fe-loaded protein exhibits a much lower activity than the mn-loaded form, fe-sub-mnsodcd and mnsodcd were expressed in e. coli using m9 minimal medium, and characterized by x-ray crystallography, metal analysis, optical and epr ph titration, azide binding affinity, etc. the pka values of the active site residues and substrate affinities determined by spectroscopic titrations indicated that mnsodcd has a higher affinity for the substrate compared to fe-sub-mnsodcd, while fe-sub-mnsodcd has more affinity for oh(-). the different tendency of the anion ligation may be ascribed to the electronic configurations of fe(3+) in d(5)vs. mn(3+) in d(4), and it could be tuned by the hydrogen-bonding network around the active site of sodcd. furthermore, the free energy for the o2 (-) oxidation-reduction transition state from dft calculation demonstrated that mnsodcd could disproportionate o2 (-) more easily than fe-sub-mnsodcd. these results revealed that sodcd could exquisitely differentiate between the mn- and fe-based activity. this metal specificity for sodcd may benefit the pathogenicity of c. difficile and pave a fundamental way for retarding c. difficile associated diseases.

AB  == fic domains in proteins are found in abundance in nature from the simplest prokaryotes to animals. interestingly, fic domains found in two virulence factors of gram-negative bacteria have recently been demonstrated to catalyse the transfer of the amp moiety from atp to small host gtpases. this post-translational modification has attracted considerable interest and a role for adenylylation in pathology and physiology is emerging. this work was aimed at the structural characterization of a newly identified fic protein of the gram-positive bacterium clostridium difficile. a constitutively active inhibitory helix mutant of c. difficile fic was overexpressed in escherichia coli, purified  and crystallized by the vapour-diffusion technique. preliminary x-ray crystallographic analysis shows that the crystals diffract to at least 1.68 a resolution at a synchrotron x-ray source. the crystals belonged to the orthorhombic space group p2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a=45.6, b=80.8, c=144.7 a, alpha=beta=gamma=90 degrees . two molecules per asymmetric unit corresponds to a matthews coefficient of 2.37 a3 da(-1) and a solvent content of  48%.

TI  == serum bacterial toxins are related to the progression of inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  == objectives: inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), including crohn's disease (cd) and  ulcerative colitis (uc), is an autoimmune disease. disorder of intestinal microbes is thought to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of ibd. detection of bacterial toxins could become a new approach to judge the situation of this disease. materials and methods: serum samples were collected from 142 ibd patients and 40 healthy donors as well as 15 cd patients with anti-tumor necrosis factor (tnf) monoclonal antibody (infliximab [ifx]). enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay kits for clostridium difficile, escherichia coli o157, salmonella, and staphylococcus aureus were used to analyze these bacterial toxins in sera. results: the positive rates of bacterial toxins from c. difficile, e. coli o157,  salmonella, and s. aureus in the ibd patients were found in low incidences and associated with disease duration, colonic involvement, and treatment with prednisone and immunomodulators. the active cd and uc patients had significant higher positive rates of these bacterial toxins than those in remission or healthy controls. blockage of tnf with ifx in cd patients resulted in significant decreases of the levels of toxins of c. difficile, e. coli o157, salmonella, and  s. aureus in sera. conclusions: some bacterial toxins are present in the sera of  active ibd patients, and patients with long disease duration, colonic involvement, or treatment with prednisone and immunomodulators are more susceptible to bacterial infection. inhibition of inflammation with ifx would reduce the bacterial toxins via improvement of intestinal inflammation. detecting bacteria-derived toxins in sera can be used to predict the progression of ibd.

TI  == comparison of maldi-tof ms, gene sequencing and the vitek 2 for identification of seventy-three clinical isolates of enteropathogens.
AB  == objective: this study was performed to evaluate the analytical and practical performance of the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) compared to the sequencing method and the vitek  2 system for identi fi cation of enteropathogens in the clinical microbiology laboratory. methods: ten type strains and 73 clinical isolates of enteropathogens representing eight genera were analyzed by maldi-tof ms. all isolates were also characterized by gene sequencing allowing interpretation of the results from maldi-tof ms. in addition, maldi-tof ms was compared with the vitek 2 system for  the identi fi cation of ten isolates of aeromonas and six of salmonella. results: as previously known, identification between shigella and escherichia coli is not  possible to distinguish. maldi-tof ms produced the correct identifications for all other type strains and clinical isolates to the genus level. fifteen campylobacter jejuni, six campylobacter coli, three plesiomonas shigelloides, three yersinia enterocolitica, two clostridium difficile, one vibrio parahaemolyticus, one vibrio fluvialis, and one vibrio cholera were all correctly identi fi ed to the species level. genus and species identifications of ten aeromonas and six salmonella isolates by maldi-tof ms were consistent with those  by the vitek 2, but with much less cost and about ten times faster. conclusions:  this study demonstrates that maldi-tof ms is a powerful tool for fast, accurate and low-cost identi fi cation of enteropathogens in the clinical microbiology laboratory.

TI  == [saccharomyces cerevisiae fungemia in an elderly patient following probiotic treatment].
AB  == saccharomyces cerevisiae, known as baker's yeast, is also used as a probiotic agent to treat gastroenteritis by modulating the endogenous flora and immune system. however, since there have been increasing reports of fungemia due to s.cerevisiae and its subspecies s.boulardii, it is recommended that probiotics should be cautiously used in immunosuppressed patients, people with underlying diseases and low-birth weight babies. to emphasize this phenomenon, in this report, a case of s.cerevisiae fungemia developed in a patient given probiotic treatment for antibiotic-associated diarrhea, was presented. an 88-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital with left hip pain, hypotension, and  confusion. her medical history included hypertension, chronic renal failure, left knee replacement surgery, and recurrent urinary tract infections due to neurogenic bladder. she was transferred to the intensive care unit with the diagnosis of urosepsis. after obtaining blood and urine samples for culture, empirical meropenem (2 x 500 mg) and linezolid (1 x 600 mg) treatment were administered. a central venous catheter (cvc) was inserted and after one day of inotropic support, her hemodynamic parameters were stabilized. the urine culture  obtained on admission yielded extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. urine culture was repeated after three days and no bacteria were isolated. on the 4th day of admission she developed diarrhea. toxin a/b tests for clostridium difficile were negative. to relieve diarrhea, s.boulardii (reflor 250 mg capsules, sanofi aventis, turkey) was administered twice a day, without opening capsules. two days later, her c-reactive protein (crp) level increased from 23.2 mg/l to 100 mg/l without fever. her blood culture taken from the cvc yielded s.cerevisiae. linezolid and meropenem therapies were stopped on the 13th and 14th days, respectively, while prophylactic fluconazole therapy was replaced with caspofungin 1 x 50 mg on the fifth day. after seven days of therapy crp and serum creatinine levels decreased  to 9.1 mg/l and 1.2 mg/dl, respectively; and she was discharged from the hospital with improvement. the probiotic capsules were used unopen, thus, it was proposed  that s.cerevisiae fungemia originated from translocation from the intestinal mucosa. since it was not possible to investigate the molecular genetics of the strain isolated from the blood culture and the strain present in the probiotic, a definite conclusion about the origin of the strain could not be reached. it was thought that old age and underlying disease of the patient were the related predisposing factors for s.cerevisiae fungemia. this case emphasized that clinicians should be cautious in case of probiotic application even though in encapsulated form, even in immunocompetent patients with a history of long-term hospital stay and use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials since there may be a risk  of s.cerevisiae fungemia development.

TI  == urinary tract infections: leading initiatives in selecting empiric outpatient treatment (utilise).
AB  == background: overuse of fluoroquinolone antibiotics is associated with outbreaks of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea and increasing resistance in gram-negative organisms. over the past decade, resistance of escherichia coli to ciprofloxacin  has increased in the regina qu'appelle health region. in august 2011, an exploratory audit of the regina general hospital (rgh) emergency department showed that 20% of new antibiotic orders were for fluoroquinolones, and 60% of these new fluoroquinolone orders were for ciprofloxacin. it was postulated that ciprofloxacin was predominantly prescribed for outpatients with urinary tract infection. objective: to develop, implement, and evaluate a best-practice algorithm for the empiric treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection in the rgh emergency department, as part of an educational initiative for emergency  physicians. methods: a literature review was conducted and local antibiogram data were analyzed to establish a best-practice algorithm for treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection in outpatients seen in the emergency department. a chart review was conducted from january to march 2011 to establish  a baseline of empiric antibiotic use. an educational strategy targeting emergency physicians described changes in antibiotic resistance patterns in the health region, principles of antimicrobial stewardship, drivers of resistance, and the results of a literature review of best practice for urinary tract infection in outpatients. a post-intervention audit was conducted from january to march 2012 to determine changes in practice. results: comparison of results from the post-intervention audit with baseline data showed that adherence to best practice increased significantly, from 41% (39/96) before the intervention to 66% (50/76)  after the intervention (odds ratio [or] 2.81, 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.51-5.25; p < 0.001). there was also a significant change in overall antibiotic  selection (or 0.25, 95% ci 0.11-0.58; p < 0.001). further analysis suggested that this significant change was driven by a decrease in use of ciprofloxacin, from 32% (31/96) to 11% (8/76). conclusion: creation of a best-practice algorithm and  education focused on emergency physicians significantly increased adherence to best practice and optimized antibiotic prescribing for outpatients with uncomplicated urinary tract infection by limiting overuse of fluoroquinolones, primarily ciprofloxacin.

TI  == the effect of new neonatal porcine diarrhoea syndrome (nnpds) on average daily gain and mortality in 4 danish pig herds.
AB  == background: the study evaluated the effect of new neonatal porcine diarrhoea syndrome (nnpds) on average daily gain (adg) and mortality and described the clinical manifestations in four herds suffering from the syndrome. nnpds is a diarrhoeic syndrome affecting piglets within the first week of life, which is not caused by enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec), clostridium perfringens (c. perfringens) type a/c, clostridium difficile (c. difficile), rotavirus a, coronavirus, cystoisospora suis, strongyloides ransomi, giardia spp or cryptosporidium spp. results: piglets were estimated to have a negative adg of 9  and 14 g when diarrhoeic for 1 day and >1 day respectively. however, if only diarrhoeic on the day of birth, no negative effect on adg was seen. piglets originating from severely affected litters were estimated to have a reduced adg of 38 g. the study did not show an overall effect of diarrhoea on mortality, but  herd of origin, sow parity, birth weight, and gender were significantly associated with mortality. in one of the herds, approximately 25% of the diarrhoeic piglets vs. 6% of the non-diarrhoeic piglets died, and 74% of necropsied piglets were diagnosed with enteritis. these findings indicate that the high mortality seen in this herd was due to diarrhoea. conclusions: nnpds negatively affected adg in piglets, and even piglets that were diarrhoeic for one day only experienced a reduction in adg. however, the study showed that diarrhoea restricted to the day of birth did not affect adg and suggested this phenomenon to be unrelated to the syndrome. since the diarrhoeal status of the litter had important effects on adg, future research on nnpds probably ought to focus on piglets from severely affected litters.the study showed important dissimilarities in the course of diarrhoea between the herds, and one herd was considerably more  affected than the others. within this herd, nnpds seemed to be associated with a  higher mortality, whereas in general the study did not show lethal effects of nnpds.

TI  == identification and characterization of a gene cluster required for proper rod shape, cell division, and pathogenesis in clostridium difficile.
AB  == little is known about cell division in clostridium difficile, a strict anaerobe that causes serious diarrheal diseases in people whose normal intestinal microbiome has been perturbed by treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. here  we identify and characterize a gene cluster encoding three cell division proteins found only in c. difficile and a small number of closely related bacteria. these  proteins were named mlda, mldb, and mldc, for midcell localizing division proteins. mlda is predicted to be a membrane protein with coiled-coil domains and a peptidoglycan-binding spor domain. mldb and mldc are predicted to be cytoplasmic proteins; mldb has two predicted coiled-coil domains, but mldc lacks  obvious conserved domains or sequence motifs. mutants of mlda or mldb had morphological defects, including loss of rod shape (a curved cell phenotype) and  inefficient separation of daughter cells (a chaining phenotype). fusions of cyan  fluorescent protein (cfp) to mlda, mldb, and mldc revealed that all three proteins localize sharply to the division site. this application of cfp was possible because we discovered that o2-dependent fluorescent proteins produced anaerobically can acquire fluorescence after cells are fixed with cross-linkers to preserve native patterns of protein localization. mutants lacking the mld proteins are severely attenuated for pathogenesis in a hamster model of c. difficile infection. because all three mld proteins are essentially unique to c.  difficile, they might be exploited as targets for antibiotics that combat c. difficile without disrupting the intestinal microbiome.

TI  == antibiotic consumption and antibiotic stewardship in swedish hospitals.
AB  == background: the aim of this paper was to describe and analyze the effect of antibiotic policy changes on antibiotic consumption in swedish hospitals and to review antibiotic stewardship in swedish hospitals. results: the main findings were: 1) antibiotic consumption has significantly increased in swedish hospitals  over the last decade. the consumption of cephalosporins has decreased, whereas that of most other drugs including piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems, and penicillinase-sensitive and -resistant penicillins has increased and replaced cephalosporins. 2) invasive infections caused by esbl-producing escherichia coli  and klebsiella pneumoniae have increased, but the proportion of pathogens resistant to third-generation cephalosporins causing invasive infections is still very low in a european and international perspective. furthermore, the following  gaps in knowledge were identified: 1) lack of national, regional, and local data  on the incidence of antibiotic resistance among bacteria causing hospital-acquired infections e.g. bloodstream infections and hospital-acquired pneumonia-data on which standard treatment guidelines should be based; 2) lack of data on the incidence of clostridium difficile infections and the effect of change of antibiotic policies on the incidence of c. difficile infections and infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens; and 3) lack of prospective surveillance programs regarding appropriate antibiotic treatment, including selection of optimal antimicrobial drug regimens, dosage, duration of therapy, and adverse ecological effects such as increases in c. difficile infections and emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. conclusions: evidence-based actions  to improve antibiotic use and to slow down the problem of antibiotic resistance need to be strengthened. the effect of such actions should be analyzed, and standard treatment guidelines should be continuously updated at national, regional, and local levels.

TI  == influence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group b streptococcus on  the early newborn gut composition and evaluation of the anti-streptococcus activity of bifidobacterium strains.
AB  == several factors are known to influence the early colonization of the gut in newborns. among them, the use of antibiotics on the mother during labor, referred to as intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (iap), has scarcely been investigated, although this practice is routinely used in group b streptococcus (gbs)-positive  women. this work is therefore aimed at verifying whether iap can influence the main microbial groups of the newborn gut microbiota at an early stage of microbial establishment. fifty-two newborns were recruited: 26 born by mothers negative to gbs (control group) and 26 by mothers positive to gbs and subjected to iap with ampicillin (iap group). selected microbial groups (lactobacillus spp., bidobacterium spp., bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and escherichia coli) were quantified with real-time pcr on dna extracted from newborn feces. further analysis was performed within the bidobacterium genus by using dgge after amplification with genus-specific primers. results obtained showed a significant decrease of the bifidobacteria counts after antibiotic treatment of the mother. bifidobacteria were found to be affected by iap not only quantitatively but also qualitatively. in fact, iap determined a decrement in the frequency of bidobacterium breve, bidobacterium bifidum, and bidobacterium dentium with respect to the control group. moreover, this study has preliminarily evaluated that some bifidobacterial strains, previously selected for use in infants, have antibacterial properties against gbs and are therefore potential candidates for being applied as probiotics for the prevention of gbs infections.

TI  == utility of the clostridial site-specific recombinase tnpx to clone toxic-product-encoding genes and selectively remove genomic dna fragments.
AB  == tnpx is a site-specific recombinase responsible for the excision and insertion of the transposons tn4451 and tn4453 in clostridium perfringens and clostridium difficile, respectively. here, we exploit phenotypic features of tnpx to facilitate genetic mutagenesis and complementation studies. genetic manipulation  of bacteria often relies on the use of antibiotic resistance genes; however, a limited number are available for use in the clostridia. the ability of tnpx to recognize and excise specific dna fragments was exploited here as the basis of an antibiotic resistance marker recycling system, specifically to remove antibiotic  resistance genes from plasmids in escherichia coli and from marked chromosomal c. perfringens mutants. this methodology enabled the construction of a c. perfringens plc virr double mutant by allowing the removal and subsequent reuse of the same resistance gene to construct a second mutation. genetic complementation can be challenging when the gene of interest encodes a product toxic to e. coli. we show that tnpx represses expression from its own promoter, pattci, which can be exploited to facilitate the cloning of recalcitrant genes in e. coli for subsequent expression in the heterologous host c. perfringens. importantly, this technology expands the repertoire of tools available for the genetic manipulation of the clostridia.

TI  == fluorescence in situ hybridization investigation of potentially pathogenic bacteria involved in neonatal porcine diarrhea.
AB  == background: neonatal diarrhea is a multifactorial condition commonly present on pig farms and leads to economic losses due to increased morbidity and mortality of piglets. immature immune system and lack of fully established microbiota at birth predispose neonatal piglets to infection with enteric pathogens. the microorganisms that for decades have been associated with enteritis and diarrhea  in suckling piglets are: rotavirus a, coronavirus, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec), clostridium perfringens type c, cryptosporidium spp., giardia spp.,  cystoisospora suis and strongyloides ransomi. however, in recent years, the pig industry has experienced an increased number of neonatal diarrhea cases in which  the above mentioned pathogens are no longer detected. potentially pathogenic bacteria have recently received focus in the research on the possible etiology of neonatal diarrhea not caused by common pathogens. the primary aim of this study was to investigate the role of e. coli, enterococcus spp., c. perfringens and c.  difficile in the pathogenesis of neonatal porcine diarrhea with no established casual agents. fluorescence in situ hybridization with oligonucleotide probes was applied on the fixed intestinal tissue samples from 51 diarrheic and 50 non-diarrheic piglets collected from four danish farms during outbreaks of neonatal diarrhea not caused by well-known enteric pathogens. furthermore, an association between the presence of these bacteria and histological lesions was evaluated. results: the prevalence of fluorescence signals specific for e. coli,  c. perfringens and c. difficile was similar in both groups of piglets. however, enterococcus spp. was primarily detected in the diarrheic piglets. furthermore, adherent bacteria were detected in 37 % diarrheic and 14 % non-diarrheic piglets. these bacteria were identified as e. coli and enterococcus spp. and their presence in the intestinal mucosa was associated with histopathological changes.  conclusions: the results of this study showed that simultaneous colonization of the intestinal mucosa by adherent non-etec e. coli and enterococcus spp. can be involved in the pathogenesis of neonatal porcine diarrhea. these bacteria should  be considered in diagnosis of diarrhea in piglets, when detection of common, well-known enteric agents is unsuccessful.

AB  == background: the criteria used when gps submit stool specimens for microbiological investigation are unknown. aim: to determine what criteria gps use to send stool  specimens, and if they are consistent with national guidance, and whether gps would prescribe an antibiotic before they receive a result. design and setting: questionnaire survey of 974 gps in 172 surgeries in england. method: gps were sent a questionnaire (23 questions) based on national guidance. results: questionnaires were returned by 90% (154/172) of surgeries and 49% (477/968) of gps. gps reported sending stool specimens in about 50% of cases of suspected infectious diarrhoea, most commonly because of individual symptoms, rather than public health implications. fewer considered sampling with antibiotic-associated  diarrhoea post hospitalisation, or children with acute, painful, bloody diarrhoea; only 14% mentioned outbreaks as a reason. nearly one-half of gps reported they would consider antibiotics in suspected cases of escherichia coli o157, which is contraindicated. only 23% of gps would send the recommended three  specimens for ova, cysts, and parasites (ocp) examination. although 89% of gps gave some verbal advice on how to collect stool specimens, only 2% of gps gave patients any written instructions. conclusion: gps need more education to address gaps in knowledge about the risks and diagnosis of different infections in suspected infectious diarrhoea, especially clostridium difficile post-antibiotics, e. coli o157, and requesting ocps. advice on reports, tick boxes, or links to guidance on electronic request forms may facilitate this.

TI  == biosynthesis of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxy-4-methylvalerate) by recombinant escherichia coli expressing leucine metabolism-related enzymes derived from clostridium difficile.
AB  == an obligate anaerobic bacterium clostridium difficile has a unique metabolic pathway to convert leucine to 4-methylvalerate, in which 4-methyl-2-pentenoyl-coa (4m2pe-coa) is an intermediate of this pathway. 4m2pe-coa is also able to be converted to 3-hydroxy-4-methylvalerate (3h4mv), a branched side chain monomer unit, for synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) copolymer. in this study, to synthesize 3h4mv-containing pha copolymer from leucine, the leucine metabolism-related enzymes (ldha and hadaibc) derived from c. difficile and pha biosynthesis enzymes (phapcjac and phaabre) derived from aeromonas caviae and ralstonia eutropha were co-expressed in the codon usage-improved escherichia coli. under microaerobic culture conditions, this e. coli was able to synthesize  p(3hb-co-12.2 mol% 3h4mv) from glucose with the supplementation of 1 g/l leucine. this strain also produced p(3hb-co-12.6 mol% 3h4mv) using the culture supernatant of leucine overproducer e. coli strain ns1391 as the medium for pha production, achieving 3h4mv copolymer synthesis only from glucose. furthermore, we tested the feasibility of the 3h4mv copolymer synthesis in e. coli strain ns1391 from glucose. the recombinant e. coli ns1391 was able to synthesize p(3hb-co-3.0 mol%  3h4mv) from glucose without any leucine supplementation. this study demonstrates  the potential of the new metabolic pathway for 3h4mv synthesis using leucine metabolism-related enzymes from c. difficile.

TI  == recombinant antigens based on toxins a and b of clostridium difficile that evoke  a potent toxin-neutralising immune response.
AB  == infection with the bacterium clostridium difficile causes symptoms ranging from mild to severe diarrhoea with life-threatening complications and remains a significant burden to healthcare systems throughout the developed world. two potent cytotoxins, tcda and tcdb are the prime mediators of the syndrome and rapid neutralisation of these would afford significant benefits in disease management. in the present study, a broad range of non-toxic, recombinant fragments derived from tcda and tcdb were designed for soluble expression in e. coli and assessed for their capacity to generate a potent toxin-neutralising immune response as assessed by cell-based assays. significant differences between the efficacies of isolated tcda and tcdb regions with respect to inducing a neutralising immune response were observed. while the c-terminal repeat regions played the principal role in generating neutralising antibodies to tcda, in the case of tcdb, the central region domains dominated the neutralising immune response. for both tcda and tcdb, fragments which comprised domains from both the central and c-terminal repeat region of the toxins were found to induce the most  potent neutralising immune responses. generated antibodies neutralised toxins produced by a range of c. difficile isolates including ribotype 027 and 078 strains. passive immunisation of hamsters with a combination of antibodies to tcda and tcdb fragments afforded complete protection from severe cdi induced by a challenge of bacterial spores. the results of the study are discussed with respect to the development of a cost effective immunotherapeutic approach for the management of c. difficile infection.

AB  == objective: to describe the development of the gut microbiota in extremely low birth weight (elbw) infants with and without necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) between april 2008 and december 2009, fecal microflora was prospectively analyzed in fecal samples of all elbw infants using real-time pcr assays. in addition, fecal inflammatory were measured. results: fecal microflora established early in  elbw infants and microbiota composition remained stable over the first 28 days of life except for the prevalence of c. difficile which decreased with decreasing antibiotic use. infants who subsequently developed nec had an increase of total bacterial count (9.8-fold) 24 h prior to clinical symptoms mainly due to the expansion of e. coli species (21.6-fold), whereas microbiota composition did not  differ from healthy elbw infants five days before onset of nec. importantly, s100a12 and hbd2 positively correlated with the total and e. coli bacterial cfu/g feces (r (2) 0.4 and 0.64, resp.). conclusions: in summary, we found evidence for a disturbed homeostasis between the intestinal microbiome and host immunity in elbw infants with nec. moreover, s100a12 and hbd2 correlate with the fecal microbiota thus linking the intestinal innate immune response to the bacterial colonization thus possibly providing a diagnostic tool in the future.

TI  == emerging infectious colitis.
AB  == purpose of review: the present review will highlight recent advances in the knowledge of emerging pathogens causing infectious colitis and provide a description of the most important food-borne outbreaks. recent findings: outbreaks of enteric disease caused by salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., and shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) continue to surprise with new epidemiological findings or changing virulence characteristics. these pathogens evolve to exploit novel opportunities for spread and transmission, such as fresh  produce within the food chain, and generate new public health challenges. organic sprouts were recently considered as the source responsible for a large german disease outbreak comprising 3842 patients. the outbreak strain was identified as  an enteroaggregative stec o104:h4 (eaggc), a rare hybrid pathogen that harbours the phage encoded shiga toxin gene and antibiotic resistance in an eaggec background. clostridium difficile pcr ribotype 078 is emerging across europe, causing severe disease outside healthcare facilities as well as disease in farm animals, indicating that the species border has been crossed. although the global impact of cryptosporidiosis is less pronounced, these organisms have been responsible for large outbreaks of infectious diarrhoea, often not reported. invasive listeriosis is a serious food-borne illness and was found recently in 28 us states affecting 147 patients, associated with eating contaminated cantaloupe. outbreaks of gastroenteritis caused by listeria monocytogenes are most likely severely underestimated. centralized surveillance of food-borne enteropathogens is essential for the early detection of disease outbreaks and for the organization of an immediate and appropriate response. summary: an improved understanding of the pathogenesis, pathology and epidemiology of emerging enteropathogens causing infectious colitis will provide new approaches for disease prevention and control.

TI  == discovery of a cyclic phosphodiesterase that catalyzes the sequential hydrolysis  of both ester bonds to phosphorus.
AB  == the bacterial c-p lyase pathway is responsible for the metabolism of unactivated  organophosphonates under conditions of phosphate starvation. the cleavage of the  c-p bond within ribose-1-methylphosphonate-5-phosphate to form methane and 5-phospho-ribose-1,2-cyclic phosphate (prcp) is catalyzed by the radical sam enzyme phnj. in escherichia coli the cyclic phosphate product is hydrolyzed to ribose-1,5-bisphosphate by phnp. in this study, we describe the discovery and characterization of an enzyme that can hydrolyze a cyclic phosphodiester directly to a vicinal diol and inorganic phosphate. with prcp, this enzyme hydrolyzes the  phosphate ester at carbon-1 of the ribose moiety to form ribose-2,5-bisphosphate, and then this intermediate is hydrolyzed to ribose-5-phosphate and inorganic phosphate. ribose-1,5-bisphosphate is neither an intermediate nor a substrate for this enzyme. orthologues of this enzyme are found in the human pathogens clostridium difficile and eggerthella lenta. we propose that this enzyme be called cyclic phosphate dihydrolase (cpdh) and be designated as phnpp.

AB  == laboratory surveillance data from the animal health laboratory, university of guelph, on the etiological diagnoses of neonatal diarrhea in piglets were analyzed to determine the relative importance and trends of different enteric pathogens in ontario. a total of 237 cases, including live and dead 1- to 7-day-old piglets, were submitted for diagnosis of gastrointestinal illness between 2001 and 2010. the combined frequencies for cases of gastrointestinal illness involving escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens type a, rotavirus, and clostridium difficile, either as single pathogens or a complex of pathogens,  accounted for 56% of the total cases. in a total of 33% of cases of gastrointestinal illness, an etiological agent was not identified. the frequency  of cases diagnosed with enterotoxigenic e. coli was decreased from 2007. cases submitted in 2010 were more likely to be diagnosed with c. perfringens type a compared to cases submitted in 2002 to 2007 (p < 0.05). there was a significant trend for cases submitted in the winter to be diagnosed with c. perfringens type  a, enterotoxigenic e. coli, rotavirus, and cystoisospora suis (formerly isospora  suis) (p < 0.05). enterotoxigenic e. coli was less likely diagnosed if c. difficile, c. perfringens, or rotavirus were detected (p < 0.05). younger piglets were more likely to be diagnosed with c. perfringens type a (p < 0.05) and c. difficile (p < 0.05) than older piglets. this study shows that e. coli, c. perfringens type a, rotavirus, and c. difficile are enteric pathogens of concern  for ontario swine farrowing operations and further research is required to understand the reasons for the cases that are not diagnosed.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == metabolic engineering of escherichia coli for biosynthesis of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) from glucose.
AB  == the escherichia coli xl1-blue strain was metabolically engineered to synthesize poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) [p(3hb-co-3hv)] through 2-ketobutyrate, which is generated via citramalate pathway, as a precursor for propionyl-coa. two different metabolic pathways were examined for the synthesis of propionyl-coa from 2-ketobutyrate. the first pathway is composed of the dickeya dadantii 3937 2-ketobutyrate oxidase or the e. coli pyruvate oxidase mutant (poxb l253f v380a) for the conversion of 2-ketobutyrate into propionate and the ralstonia eutropha propionyl-coa synthetase (prpe) or the e. coli acetyl-coa:acetoacetyl-coa transferase for further conversion of propionate into  propionyl-coa. the second pathway employs pyruvate formate lyase encoded by the e. coli tdce gene or the clostridium difficile pflb gene for the direct conversion of 2-ketobutyrate into propionyl-coa. as the direct conversion of 2-ketobutyrate into propionyl-coa could not support the efficient production of p(3hb-co-3hv) from glucose, the first metabolic pathway was further examined. when the recombinant e. coli xl1-blue strain equipped with citramalate pathway expressing the e. coli poxb l253f v380a gene and r. eutropha prpe gene together with the r. eutropha pha biosynthesis genes was cultured in a chemically defined  medium containing 20 g/l of glucose as a sole carbon source, p(3hb-co-2.3 mol% 3hv) was produced up to the polymer content of 61.7 wt.%. moreover, the 3hv monomer fraction in p(3hb-co-3hv) could be increased up to 5.5 mol% by additional deletion of the prpc and scpc genes, which are responsible for the metabolism of  propionyl-coa in host strains.

TI  == growth-inhibiting and morphostructural effects of constituents identified in asarum heterotropoides root on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == background: the growth-inhibiting and morphostructural effects of seven constituents identified in asarum heterotropoides root on 14 intestinal bacteria  were compared with those of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin. method: a microtiter plate-based bioassay in sterile 96-well plates was used to evaluate  the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the test materials against the organisms. results: delta-3-carene (5) exhibited the most potent growth inhibition of gram-positive bacteria (clostridium difficile atcc 9689, clostridium paraputrificum atcc 25780, clostridium perfringens atcc 13124, and staphylococcus aureus atcc 12600) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli atcc 11775 and bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285) (minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic), 0.18-0.70 mg/ml) except for salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 13311 (mic, 2.94 mg/ml). the mic of methyleugenol (2), 1,8-cineole (3), alpha-asarone (4), (-)-asarinin (6), and pellitorine (7) was between 1.47 and 2.94 mg/ml against all test bacteria (except for compound 2 against c. difficile (0.70 mg/ml); compounds 1 (23.50 mg/ml) and 4 (5.80 mg/ml) against c. paraputricum; compounds 2 (5.80 mg/ml), 4 (12.0 mg/ml), and 7 (0.70 mg/ml) against c. perfringens); compound 1 against e. coli (7.20 mg/ml) and s. enterica serovar typhimurium (12.0 mg/ml). overall, all of the constituents were  less potent at inhibiting microbial growth than ciprofloxacin (mic, 0.063-0.25 mg/ ml). the lactic acid-producing bacteria (four bifidobacteria and two lactobacilli) and one acidulating bacterium clostridium butyricum atcc 25779 were less sensitive and more susceptible than the five harmful bacteria and two nonpathogenic bacteria (b. fragilis and e. coli) to the constituents and to ciprofloxacin, respectively. beneficial gram-positive bacteria and harmful and nonpathogenic gram-negative bacteria were observed to have different degrees of antimicrobial susceptibility to the constituents, although the antimicrobial susceptibility of the harmful gram-positive bacteria and the harmful and nonpathogenic gram-negative bacteria was not observed. scanning electron microscopy observations showed different degrees of physical damage and morphological alteration to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria treated with alpha-asarone, delta-3-carene, pellitorine, or ciprofloxacin, indicating that they do not share a common mode of action. conclusion: a. heterotropoides root-derived materials described merit further study as potential antibacterial products or lead molecules for the prevention or eradication from humans from diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.

TI  == structures of a bifunctional cell wall hydrolase cwlt containing a novel bacterial lysozyme and an nlpc/p60 dl-endopeptidase.
AB  == tn916-like conjugative transposons carrying antibiotic resistance genes are found in a diverse range of bacteria. orf14 within the conjugation module encodes a bifunctional cell wall hydrolase cwlt that consists of an n-terminal bacterial lysozyme domain (n-acetylmuramidase, blysg) and a c-terminal nlpc/p60 domain (gamma-d-glutamyl-l-diamino acid endopeptidase) and is expected to play an important role in the spread of the transposons. we determined the crystal structures of cwlt from two pathogens, staphylococcus aureus mu50 (sacwlt) and clostridium difficile 630 (cdcwlt). these structures reveal that nlpc/p60 and lysg domains are compact and conserved modules, connected by a short flexible linker. the lysg domain represents a novel family of widely distributed bacterial lysozymes. the overall structure and the active site of blysg bear significant similarity to other members of the glycoside hydrolase family 23 (gh23), such as  the g-type lysozyme (lysg) and escherichia coli lytic transglycosylase mlte. the  active site of blysg contains a unique structural and sequence signature (dxxqsses+s) that is important for coordinating a catalytic water. molecular modeling suggests that the blysg domain may recognize glycan in a similar manner  to mlte. the c-terminal nlpc/p60 domain contains a conserved active site (cys-his-his-tyr) that appears to be specific to murein tetrapeptide. access to the active site is likely regulated by isomerism of a side chain atop the catalytic cysteine, allowing substrate entry or product release (open state), or  catalysis (closed state).

TI  == biological evaluation of benzothiazole ethyl urea inhibitors of bacterial type ii topoisomerases.
AB  == the type ii topoisomerases dna gyrase (gyra/gyrb) and topoisomerase iv (parc/pare) are well-validated targets for antibacterial drug discovery. because  of their structural and functional homology, these enzymes are amenable to dual targeting by a single ligand. in this study, two novel benzothiazole ethyl urea-based small molecules, designated compound a and compound b, were evaluated  for their biochemical, antibacterial, and pharmacokinetic properties. the two compounds inhibited the atpase activity of gyrb and pare with 50% inhibitory concentrations of <0.1 mug/ml. prevention of dna supercoiling by dna gyrase was also observed. both compounds potently inhibited the growth of a range of bacterial organisms, including staphylococci, streptococci, enterococci, clostridium difficile, and selected gram-negative respiratory pathogens. mic90s against clinical isolates ranged from 0.015 mug/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae to 0.25 mug/ml for staphylococcus aureus. no cross-resistance with common drug resistance phenotypes was observed. in addition, no synergistic or antagonistic interactions between compound a or compound b and other antibiotics, including the topoisomerase inhibitors novobiocin and levofloxacin, were detected in checkerboard experiments. the frequencies of spontaneous resistance for s. aureus were <2.3 x 10(-10) with compound a and <5.8 x 10(-11) with compound b at concentrations equivalent to 8x the mics. these values indicate a multitargeting  mechanism of action. the pharmacokinetic properties of both compounds were profiled in rats. following intravenous administration, compound b showed approximately 3-fold improvement over compound a in terms of both clearance and the area under the concentration-time curve. the measured oral bioavailability of compound b was 47.7%.

TI  == [drug therapy of infectious diarrhea: part 1: acute diarrhea].
AB  == background: diarrhea is one of the most commonly occurring diseases. aim: this article gives a review of the current state of the treatment of acute infectious  diarrhea (part 1) and chronic infectious diarrhea (part 2) as well as of the most important pathogens. material and methods: following a presentation of the general principles of the therapy of diarrhea, the targeted antimicrobial therapy of the most important bacterial gastrointestinal infections is described. this includes salmonellosis, shigellosis and campylobacter infections, infections with pathogenic escherichia coli strains, yersiniosis and cholera. due to the increasing incidence and changes in the severity of the disease and important new aspects in the treatment of diarrhea caused by toxigenic clostridium difficile strains, these disease entities will be described in detail. results: symptomatic therapy is still the most important aspect of the treatment of infectious diarrhea. for severely ill patients with a high frequency of stools (> 8/day), immunodeficiency, advanced age or significant comorbidities, empirical antibiotic therapy should be considered. increasing resistance, in particular against fluoroquinolones must also be taken into consideration. due to the risk of excessive pathogen proliferation and concomitant intestinal toxin production with protracted or multiple complications during the disease, therapy with motility inhibitors is not recommended. with respect to the treatment of clostridium difficile infections a promising novel aspect arose in 2012. the macrocyclic antibiotic fidaxomycin can reduce the rate of recurrent disease with the same effectiveness as vancomycin. furthermore, evidence for the benefits of allogenic  stool transplantation is increasing. conclusion: the treatment of acute diarrhea  is still primarily supportive. the benefits of general empirical antibiotic therapy for acute diarrhea are not evidence-based.

TI  == establishment of the intestinal microbiota and its role for atopic dermatitis in  early childhood.
AB  == background: perturbations in the intestinal microbiota may disrupt mechanisms involved in the development of immunologic tolerance. the present study aimed to  examine the establishment of the infant microbiota and its association to the development of atopic dermatitis (ad). methods: within a randomized, placebo-controlled trial on the prevention of ad by oral supplementation of a bacterial lysate between week 5 and the end of month 7, feces was collected at the ages of 5 weeks (n = 571), 13 weeks (n = 332), and 31 weeks (n = 499) and subjected to quantitative pcrs to detect bifidobacteria, bacteroides, lactobacilli, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, and clostridium cluster i. results: birth mode, breast-feeding but also birth order had a strong effect on the microbiota composition. with increasing number of older siblings the colonization rates at age 5 weeks of lactobacilli (p < .001) and bacteroides (p = .02) increased, whereas rates of clostridia decreased (p < .001). colonization with clostridia, at the age of 5 and 13 weeks was also associated with an increased risk of developing ad in the subsequent 6 months of life (odds ratioadjusted = 2.35; 95% ci, 1.36-3.94 and 2.51; 1.30-4.86, respectively). mediation analyses demonstrated that there was a statistically significant indirect effect via clostridium cluster i colonization for both birth mode and birth order in association to ad. conclusion: the results of this study are supportive for a role of the microbiota in the development of ad. moreover, the "beneficial" influence of older siblings on the microbiota composition suggests that this microbiota may be one of the biological mechanisms underlying the sibling effect.

TI  == the anticancer drug tirapazamine has antimicrobial activity against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and clostridium difficile.
AB  == rapidly increasing bacterial resistance to existing therapies creates an urgent need for the development of new antibacterials. tirapazamine (tpz, 3-amino-1,2,4-benzotriazine 1,4 dioxide) is a prodrug undergoing clinical trials  for various types of cancers. in this study, we showed that tpz has antibacterial activity, particularly at low oxygen levels. with escherichia coli, tpz was bactericidal under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. escherichia coli mutants deficient in homologous recombination were hypersusceptible to tpz, suggesting that drug toxicity may be due to dna damage. moreover, e. coli strains deleted for genes encoding putative reductases were resistant to tpz, implying that these enzymes are responsible for conversion of the prodrug to a toxic compound. fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli strains were as susceptible to tpz as a wild-type strain. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains were also susceptible to tpz (mic = 0.5 mug ml(-1) ), as were pathogenic strains of clostridium difficile (mic = 7.5 ng ml(-1) ). tpz may merit additional study as a broad-spectrum antibacterial, particularly for anaerobes.

TI  == the protective effect of recombinant lactococcus lactis oral vaccine on a clostridium difficile-infected animal model.
AB  == background: oral immunization with vaccines may be an effective strategy for prevention of clostridium difficile infection (cdi). however, application of previously developed vaccines for preventing cdi has been limited due to various  reasons. here, we developed a recombinant lactococcus lactis oral vaccine and evaluated its effect on a c. difficile-infected animal model established in golden hamsters in attempt to provide an alternative strategy for cdi prevention. methods: recombinant l. lactis vaccine was developed using the ptrkh2 plasmid, a  high-copy-number escherichia coli-l. shuttle vector: 1) l. lactis expressing secreted proteins was constructed with recombinant ptrkh2 (secreted-protein plasmid) carrying the usp45 signal peptide (spusp45), nontoxic adjuvanted tetanus toxin fragment c (tetc), and 14 of the 38 c-terminal repeats (14cdta) of nontoxic c. difficile toxin a (tcda); and 2) l. lactis expressing secreted and membrane proteins was constructed with recombinant ptrkh2 (membrane-anchored plasmid) carrying spusp45, tetc, 14cdta, and the cell wall-anchored sequence of protein m6 (cwam6). then, 32 male syrian golden hamsters were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 8 each) for gavage of normal saline (blank control) and l. lactis carrying the empty shuttle vector, secreted-protein plasmid, and membrane-anchored plasmid, respectively. after 1-week gavage of clindamycin, the animals were administered with c. difficile spore suspension. general symptoms and intestinal  pathological changes of the animals were examined by naked eye and microscopy, respectively. protein levels of anti-tcda igg/iga antibodies in intestinal tissue and fluid were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). a cell culture cytotoxicity neutralization assay was done by tcda treatment with or without anti-tcda serum pre-incubation or treatment. apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells was examined by flow cytometry (fl) assay. expression of mucosal inflammatory cytokines in the animals was detected by polymer chain reaction (pcr) assay. results: after the c. difficile challenge, the animals of control group had severe diarrhea symptoms on day 1 and all died on day 4, indicating that the cdi animal model was established in hamster. of the 3 immunization groups, secreted-protein and membrane-anchored plasmid groups had significantly lower mortalities, body weight decreases, and pathological scores, with higher survival rate/time than the empty plasmid group (p < 0.05). the tilter of igg antibody directed against tcda was significantly higher in serum and intestinal fluid of secreted-protein and membrane-anchored plasmid groups than in the empty  plasmid group (p < 0.05) while the corresponding titer of iga antibody directed against tcda had no substantial differences (p > 0.05). the anti-tcda serum of membrane-anchored plasmid group neutralized the cytotoxicity of 200 ng/ml tcda with the best protective effect achieved by anti-tcda serum pre-incubation. the incidences of tcda-induced death and apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells were significantly reduced by cell pre-incubation or treatment with anti-tcda serum of membrane-anchored plasmid group (p < 0.05). mcp-1, icam-1, il-6, and gro-1 mrna expression levels were the lowest in cecum tissue of the membrane-anchored groups compared to the other groups. conclusion: recombinant l. lactis live vaccine is effective for preventing cdi in the hamster model, thus providing an alternative for immunization of c. difficile-associated diseases.

TI  == evaluation of luminex xtag gastrointestinal pathogen analyte-specific reagents for high-throughput, simultaneous detection of bacteria, viruses, and parasites of clinical and public health importance.
AB  == acute diarrheal disease (add) can be caused by a range of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites. conventional diagnostic methods, such as culture, microscopy, biochemical assays, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisa), are laborious and time-consuming and lack sensitivity. combined, the array of tests performed on a single specimen can increase the turnaround time (tat) significantly. we validated a 19plex laboratory-developed gastrointestinal  pathogen panel (gpp) using luminex xtag analyte-specific reagents (asrs) to simultaneously screen directly in fecal specimens for diarrhea-causing pathogens, including bacteria (campylobacter jejuni, salmonella spp., shigella spp., enterotoxigenic escherichia coli [etec], shiga toxin-producing e. coli [stec], e. coli o157:h7, vibrio cholerae, yersinia enterocolitica, and toxigenic clostridium difficile), parasites (giardia lamblia, cryptosporidium spp., and entamoeba histolytica), and viruses (norovirus gi and gii, adenovirus 40/41, and rotavirus  a). performance characteristics of gpp asrs were determined using 48 reference isolates and 254 clinical specimens. stool specimens from individuals with diarrhea were tested for pathogens using conventional and molecular methods. using the predictive methods as standards, the sensitivities of the gpp asrs were 100% for adenovirus 40/41, norovirus, rotavirus a, vibrio cholerae, yersinia enterocolitica, entamoeba histolytica, cryptosporidium spp., and e. coli o157:h7; 95% for giardia lamblia; 94% for etec and stec; 93% for shigella spp.; 92% for salmonella spp.; 91% for c. difficile a/b toxins; and 90% for campylobacter jejuni. the overall comparative performance of the gpp asrs with conventional methods in clinical samples was 94.5% (range, 90% to 97%), with 99% (99.0% to 99.9%) specificity. implementation of the gpp asrs enables our public health laboratory to offer highly sensitive and specific screening and identification of the major add-causing pathogens.

TI  == an investigation into the association between cpb2-encoding clostridium perfringens type a and diarrhea in neonatal piglets.
AB  == to investigate the possible role of cpb2-positive type a clostridium perfringens  in neonatal diarrheal illness in pigs, the jejunum and colon of matched normal and diarrheic piglets from 10 farms with a history of neonatal diarrhea were examined grossly and by histopathology, and tested for c. perfringens, for c. perfringens beta2 (cpb2) toxin, as well as for clostridium difficile toxins, salmonella, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, rotavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis (tge) virus, and coccidia. clostridium perfringens isolates were  tested using a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to determine the presence of cpa, consensus and atypical cpb2, and other virulence-associated  genes. the numbers of c. perfringens in the intestinal contents were lower in diarrheic piglets (log(1)(0) 5.4 cfu/g) compared with normal piglets (log(1)(0) 6.5 cfu/g) (p < 0.05). the consensus cpb2 was present in 93% of isolates in each  group, but atypical cpb2 was less common (56% healthy, 32% diarrheic piglets isolates, respectively, p < 0.05). the presence of cpb2 toxin in the intestinal contents of normal and diarrheic piglets did not differ significantly. clostridium difficile toxins and rotavirus were each detected in 7 of the 21 (33%) diarrheic piglets. rotavirus, c. difficile toxins, salmonella, or enterotoxigenic e. coli were concurrently recovered in different combinations in  4 diarrheic piglets. the cause of diarrhea in 8 of the 21 (38%) piglets on 6 farms remained unknown. the etiological diagnosis of diarrhea could not be determined in any of the piglets on 2 of the farms. this study demonstrated that  the number of cpb2-positive type a c. perfringens in the intestinal contents was  not a useful approach for making a diagnosis of type a c. perfringens enteritis in piglets. further work is required to confirm whether cpb2-carrying type a c. perfringens have a pathogenic role in enteric infection in neonatal swine.

TI  == effect of an oxygen-tolerant bifurcating butyryl coenzyme a dehydrogenase/electron-transferring flavoprotein complex from clostridium difficile on butyrate production in escherichia coli.
AB  == the butyrogenic genes from clostridium difficile dsm 1296(t) have been cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the enzymes acetyl-coenzyme a (coa) c-acetyltransferase, 3-hydroxybutyryl-coa dehydrogenase, crotonase, phosphate butyryltransferase, and butyrate kinase and the butyryl-coa dehydrogenase complex composed of the dehydrogenase and two electron-transferring flavoprotein subunits were individually produced in e. coli and kinetically characterized in vitro. while most of these enzymes were measured using well-established test systems, novel methods to determine butyrate kinase and butyryl-coa dehydrogenase activities with respect to physiological function were developed. subsequently, the individual genes were combined to form a single plasmid-encoded operon in a plasmid vector, which was successfully used to confer butyrate-forming capability to the host. in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that c. difficile possesses a bifurcating butyryl-coa dehydrogenase which catalyzes the nadh-dependent reduction of ferredoxin coupled to the reduction of crotonyl-coa also by nadh. since the reoxidation of ferredoxin by a membrane-bound ferredoxin:nad(+)-oxidoreductase enables electron transport phosphorylation, additional atp is formed. the butyryl-coa dehydrogenase from c. difficile is oxygen stable and apparently uses oxygen as a co-oxidant of nadh in the presence  of air. these properties suggest that this enzyme complex might be well suited to provide butyryl-coa for solventogenesis in recombinant strains. the central role  of bifurcating butyryl-coa dehydrogenases and membrane-bound ferredoxin:nad oxidoreductases (rhodobacter nitrogen fixation [rnf]), which affect the energy yield of butyrate fermentation in the clostridial metabolism, is discussed.

TI  == declining cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone non-susceptibility among bloodstream  enterobacteriaceae from the uk: links to prescribing change?
AB  == objectives: the uk saw major increases in cephalosporin and quinolone resistance  amongst enterobacteriaceae from 2001 to 2006, with cephalosporin resistance largely reflecting dissemination of ctx-m extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). we review subsequent trends. methods: data were extracted from public health england's national database (labbase), which collects susceptibility results for bloodstream isolates from hospital microbiology laboratories in england, wales and northern ireland, and from the bsac bacteraemia resistance surveillance system, which centrally tests bloodstream isolates from 25-40 sentinel uk and irish laboratories. reference laboratory submissions were also reviewed. results: labbase and bsac data showed that rates of non-susceptibility  to cephalosporins and quinolones rose amongst escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. until mid-decade (2004-07) before plateauing or falling; similar falls in non-susceptibility began slightly earlier in enterobacter spp. these reversals in trend occurred whilst the incidence of e. coli bacteraemias was rising, the incidence of klebsiella bacteraemias was stable and the incidence of enterobacter bacteraemias was falling; they were not paralleled in ears-net data for continental europe and did not reflect the displacement of single mechanisms. they coincided with large reductions in hospital cephalosporin and quinolone use, owing to concern about clostridium difficile, with replacement by penicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, which have borderline activity  against esbl producers, but consistently lack activity against carbapenemase producers. conclusions: non-susceptibility to cephalosporins and quinolones has declined among bloodstream enterobacteriaceae in the uk, probably reflecting prescribing shifts. the penicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations that have largely replaced cephalosporins and quinolones may add to selection for carbapenemase producers.

TI  == expression and cytoprotective activity of the small gtpase rhob induced by the escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1.
AB  == rhob is the only member of the rho subfamily of small gtpases, which is classified as an immediate early gene product. rhob is up-regulated in response to growth factors as well as cytotoxic and genotoxic agents. clostridial glucosylating toxins have been reported to evoke pronounced rhob expression, based on the inactivation of rho/ras proteins. in this study, we report on a long lasting expression of rhob in cultured cells upon activation of rho proteins by the cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (cnf1) from escherichia coli. the observations of this study highlight a new pathway involving rac1, which positively regulates  the activity of the rhob promoter and rhob expression. conversely, the isomeric cytotoxic necrotizing factor from yersinia pseudotuberculosis (cnfy) drives gtp-loading of basal rhob but fails to cause activation of the rhob promoter and  thus its expression. cnf1 inhibits cytokinesis and induces the formation of bi-nucleated (tetraploid) cells. upon long term treatment with cnf1, rhob(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mefs) exhibit dna fragmentation, phosphatidylserine  exposure, and loss of membrane integrity, while rhob(+/-) mefs persist as bi-nucleated (tetraploid) cells without any signs of cell death. in conclusion, the cytoprotective rhob response is not only evoked by bacterial protein toxins inactivating rho/ras proteins but also by the rac1-activating toxin cnf1.

AB  == objectives: to determine whether systematic testing of faecal samples with a broad range multiplex pcr increases the diagnostic yield in patients with diarrhoea compared with conventional methods and a clinician initiated testing strategy. methods: 1758 faecal samples from 1516 patients with diarrhoea submitted to two diagnostic laboratories were tested for viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens by fast-track diagnostics multiplex real-time pcr kits and conventional diagnostic tests. results: multiplex pcr detected pathogens in 530 samples (30%): adenovirus (51, 3%), astrovirus (95, 5%), norovirus (172, 10%), rotavirus (3, 0.2%), campylobacter jejuni/coli (85, 5%), salmonella spp. (22, 1%), clostridium difficile (72, 4%), entero-haemorrhagic escherichia coli (21, 1%), cryptosporidium spp. (3, 0.2%), entamoeba histolytica (1, 0.1%), and giardia lamblia (59, 3%). in contrast, conventional testing detected a pathogen in 324 (18%) samples. conclusions: using a systematic approach to the diagnosis of gastroenteritis improved diagnostic yield. this enhanced detection with pcr was achieved by a combination of improved detection of individual pathogens and detection of pathogens not requested or unable to be tested by conventional tests. this approach also allowed earlier identification for most pathogens and created a workflow which is likely to adapt well for many diagnostic laboratories.

TI  == a culture-independent sequence-based metagenomics approach to the investigation of an outbreak of shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli o104:h4.
AB  == importance: identification of the bacterium responsible for an outbreak can aid in disease management. however, traditional culture-based diagnosis can be difficult, particularly if no specific diagnostic test is available for an outbreak strain. objective: to explore the potential of metagenomics, which is the direct sequencing of dna extracted from microbiologically complex samples, as an open-ended clinical discovery platform capable of identifying and characterizing bacterial strains from an outbreak without laboratory culture. design, setting, and patients: in a retrospective investigation, 45 samples were  selected from fecal specimens obtained from patients with diarrhea during the 2011 outbreak of shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli (stec) o104:h4 in germany. samples were subjected to high-throughput sequencing (august-september 2012), followed by a 3-phase analysis (november 2012-february 2013). in phase 1, a de novo assembly approach was developed to obtain a draft genome of the outbreak strain. in phase 2, the depth of coverage of the outbreak strain genome was determined in each sample. in phase 3, sequences from each sample were compared with sequences from known bacteria to identify pathogens other than the outbreak  strain. main outcomes and measures: the recovery of genome sequence data for the  purposes of identification and characterization of the outbreak strain and other  pathogens from fecal samples. results: during phase 1, a draft genome of the stec outbreak strain was obtained. during phase 2, the outbreak strain genome was recovered from 10 samples at greater than 10-fold coverage and from 26 samples at greater than 1-fold coverage. sequences from the shiga-toxin genes were detected  in 27 of 40 stec-positive samples (67%). in phase 3, sequences from clostridium difficile, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter concisus, and salmonella enterica  were recovered. conclusions and relevance: these results suggest the potential of metagenomics as a culture-independent approach for the identification of bacterial pathogens during an outbreak of diarrheal disease. challenges include improving diagnostic sensitivity, speeding up and simplifying workflows, and reducing costs.

TI  == hyperimmune bovine colostrum for treatment of gi infections: a review and update  on clostridium difficile.
AB  == hyperimmune bovine colostrum (hbc), produced by vaccination of a cow during gestation, is rich in targeted immunoglobulins, and can be used to treat a variety of diseases. the published history of hbc use for treating gastrointestinal infections in humans has developed over the past several decades and demonstrates the promise of this type of therapeutic for gi infectious disease. hbc, or purified derivative products, have been used successfully for treatment or prevention of cryptosporidiosis, shigellosis, rotavirus, enterotoxigenic e. coli, and c. difficile infection (cdi). given the positive results of previous studies using hbc for treatment of cdi, we have produced hbc  with antibodies against the two most important virulence factors of c. difficile, tcda and tcdb, using a novel recombinant vaccine. our preliminary results demonstrate efficacy of the hbc product for treatment of cdi in the gnotobiotic piglet model, and warrant more thorough investigation. hbc may provide an effective treatment alternative to antibiotics, which can spare the normal gut microflora, and reduce rates of recurrence and antibiotic resistance.

TI  == an unexpected ct finding in a patient with abdominal pain.
AB  == a fit and well 16-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with signs  and symptoms suggestive of appendicitis. a transabdominal ultrasound scan revealed a normal appendix but there was significant free fluid in the pelvis. consequently, a ct scan of her abdomen was performed which showed mucosal oedema  and inflammation involving virtually the entire length of her large bowel (the 'accordion sign'). clostridium difficile colitis was thus suspected; however, the toxin was not detected in her stool. the patient was treated conservatively with  intravenous fluids and antibiotics and had an uneventful recovery. she was subsequently discharged home 3 days later with a full recovery. in this case, the radiological appearance of the accordion sign which is traditionally known to be  pathognomonic of pseudomembranous colitis, reveals that it may also be indicative of severe colonic luminal inflammation.

TI  == american journal of gastroenterology lecture: intestinal microbiota and the role  of fecal microbiota transplant (fmt) in treatment of c. difficile infection.
AB  == the vital roles that intestinal flora, now called microbiota, have in maintaining our health are being increasingly appreciated. starting with birth, exposure to the outside world begins the life-long intimate association our microbiota will have with our diet and environment, and initiates determination of the post-natal structural and functional maturation of the gut. moreover, vital interactions of  the microbiota with our metabolic activities, as well as with the immunological apparatus that constitutes our major defense system against foreign antigens continues throughout life. a perturbed intestinal microbiome has been associated  with an increasing number of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal diseases including clostridium difficile infection (cdi). it has become recognized that fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) can correct the dysbiosis that characterizes chronic cdi, and effect a seemingly safe, relatively inexpensive, and rapidly effective cure in the vast majority of patients so treated. in addition, fmt has been used to treat an array of other gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disorders, although experience in these other non-cdi diseases is in its infancy. more work needs to be done with fmt to ensure its safety and optimal route of administration. there is a conceptual sea change that is developing in our view of bacteria from their role only as pathogens to that of being critical to health maintenance in a changing world. future studies are certain to narrow the spectrum of organisms that need to be given to patients to  cure disease. fmt is but the first step in this journey.

TI  == using rapid diagnostic tests to optimize antimicrobial selection in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
AB  == new advances in rapid diagnostic tests provide several collaborative opportunities for stewardship teams, particularly in processes where delay in the initiation of appropriate therapy has significant consequences for patient outcomes. rapid molecular tests enhance one of the key functions of microbiology  laboratories, which is to produce accurate organism identification and timely antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. these data are used to guide the choice of antimicrobial agents for treating infections in individual patients, and the aggregate data (i.e., hospital's antibiogram) are used to guide empiric therapy for infections before the availability of the patient's culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. in addition, accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing data are critical for the overall success of a health care institution's antimicrobial stewardship program. tests that provide accurate organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility not only benefit the individual patient but also increase the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship programs. this review focuses on the use of molecular diagnostic methods to rapidly identify staphylococcus species, enterococcus faecalis,enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli,klebsiella pneumoniae,pseudomonas aeruginosa,clostridium difficile, and candida species from clinical samples and summarizes studies that describe the application of rapid diagnostic tests in antimicrobial stewardship programs.

TI  == the role of the bacterial flagellum in adhesion and virulence.
AB  == the bacterial flagellum is a complex apparatus assembled of more than 20 different proteins. the flagellar basal body traverses the cell wall, whereas the curved hook connects the basal body to the whip-like flagellar filament that protrudes several microm from the bacterial cell. the flagellum has traditionally been regarded only as a motility organelle, but more recently it has become evident that flagella have a number of other biological functions. the major subunit, flagellin or flic, of the flagellum plays a well-documented role in innate immunity and as a dominant antigen of the adaptive immune response. importantly, flagella have also been reported to function as adhesins. whole flagella have been indicated as significant in bacterial adhesion to and invasion into host cells. in various pathogens, e.g., escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium difficile, flagellin and/or the distally located flagellar cap protein have been reported to function as adhesins. recently, flic  of shiga-toxigenic e. coli was shown to be involved in cellular invasion via lipid rafts. here, we examine the latest or most important findings regarding flagellar adhesive and invasive properties, especially focusing on the flagellum  as a potential virulence factor.

AB  == the impact of bacterial diseases on public health has become enormous, and is partly due to the increasing trend of antibiotic resistance displayed by bacterial pathogens. sequencing of bacterial genomes has significantly improved our understanding about the biology of many bacterial pathogens as well as identification of novel antibiotic targets. since the advent of genome sequencing two decades ago, about 1,800 bacterial genomes have been fully sequenced and these include important aetiological agents such as streptococcus pneumoniae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, escherichia coli o157:h7, vibrio cholerae, clostridium difficile and staphylococcus aureus. very recently, there has been an explosion of bacterial genome data and is due to the development of next generation sequencing technologies, which are evolving so rapidly. indeed, the field of microbial genomics is advancing at a very fast rate and it is difficult  for researchers to be abreast with the new developments. this highlights the need for regular updates in microbial genomics through comprehensive reviews. this review paper seeks to provide an update on bacterial genome sequencing generally, and to analyze insights gained from sequencing in two areas, including bacterial  pathogenesis and the development of antibiotics.

TI  == pang, a new ketopantoate reductase involved in pantothenate synthesis.
AB  == pantothenate, commonly referred to as vitamin b(5), is an essential molecule in the metabolism of living organisms and forms the core of coenzyme a. unlike humans, some bacteria and plants are capable of de novo biosynthesis of pantothenate, making this pathway a potential target for drug development. francisella tularensis subsp. tularensis schu s4 is a zoonotic bacterial pathogen that is able to synthesize pantothenate but is lacking the known ketopantoate reductase (kpr) genes, pane and ilvc, found in the canonical escherichia coli pathway. described herein is a gene encoding a novel kpr, for which we propose the name pang (ftt1388), which is conserved in all sequenced francisella species  and is the sole kpr in schu s4. homologs of this kpr are present in other pathogenic bacteria such as enterococcus faecalis, coxiella burnetii, and clostridium difficile. both the homologous gene from e. faecalis v583 (ef1861) and e. coli pane functionally complemented francisella novicida lacking any kpr.  furthermore, pang from f. novicida can complement an e. coli kpr double mutant. a schu s4 deltapang strain is a pantothenate auxotroph and was genetically and chemically complemented with pang in trans or with the addition of pantolactone.  there was no virulence defect in the schu s4 deltapang strain compared to the wild type in a mouse model of pneumonic tularemia. in summary, we characterized the pantothenate pathway in francisella novicida and f. tularensis and identified an unknown and previously uncharacterized kpr that can convert 2-dehydropantoate  to pantoate, pang.

TI  == proline-dependent regulation of clostridium difficile stickland metabolism.
AB  == clostridium difficile, a proteolytic gram-positive anaerobe, has emerged as a significant nosocomial pathogen. stickland fermentation reactions are thought to  be important for growth of c. difficile and appear to influence toxin production. in stickland reactions, pairs of amino acids donate and accept electrons, generating atp and reducing power in the process. reduction of the electron acceptors proline and glycine requires the d-proline reductase (pr) and the glycine reductase (gr) enzyme complexes, respectively. addition of proline in the medium increases the level of pr protein but decreases the level of gr. we report the identification of prdr, a protein that activates transcription of the pr-encoding genes in the presence of proline and negatively regulates the gr-encoding genes. the results suggest that prdr is a central metabolism regulator that controls preferential utilization of proline and glycine to produce energy via the stickland reactions.

TI  == immunisation of mares with binding domains of toxins a and b of clostridium difficile elicits serum and colostral antibodies that block toxin binding.
AB  == reasons for performing study: enterocolitis caused by clostridium difficile (c. difficile) is a serious, sometimes fatal, disease of neonatal foals and older horses. toxins a and b (tcda and b) produced by c. difficile are important virulence factors. immunisation of mares with receptor binding domains of toxins  may prevent or reduce the severity of c. difficile colitis in foals. objectives:  to determine whether antibodies generated in the pregnant mare to the binding regions of tcda and b will neutralise tcda and b toxicity. methods: sequences encoding the binding domains of each toxin were isolated by pcr amplification from c. difficile jf09, a foal isolate, and cloned and expressed into pet15b. thirteen mares were immunised twice 2 weeks apart with 200 mug of each recombinant protein with quil a 2 months prior to foaling. antibodies were assayed in the sera and colostrum by elisa and for ability to block the cytopathic activity of each of toxin for equine endothelial cells. results: all mares produced strong serum antibody responses to the binding domain of each toxin. a high level of toxin-specific antibodies was also detected in colostrum and in most foal sera 2 days after suckling. diluted sera and colostrum premixed  with either tcda or b had no effect on the morphology of equine endothelial cells. application of the same concentration of toxins alone or premixed with nonimmune mare/foal serum or colostrum led to an unambiguous cytopathic effect that ranged from complete degradation to varying degrees of cell rounding. conclusions: immunisation of pregnant mares with recombinant binding domains of tcda and b of c. difficile resulted in the production of specific antibodies in serum and colostrum that blocked the cytopathic activity of toxins. potential relevance: results of studies support the feasibility of a prepartum vaccine against c. difficile enterocolitis in foals.

AB  == in this study fecal microflora of human infants born through vaginal delivery (vb) and through cesarean section (cb) were investigated using culture-independent 16s rdna cloning and sequencing approach. the results obtained clearly revealed that fecal microbiota of vb infants distinctly differ from those in their counterpart cb infants. the intestinal microbiota of infants  delivered by cesarean section appears to be more diverse, in terms of bacteria species, than the microbiota of vaginally delivered infants. the most abundant bacterial species present in vb infants were acinetobacter sp., bifidobacterium sp. and staphylococcus sp. however, cb infant's fecal microbiota was dominated with citrobacter sp., escherichia coli and clostridium difficile. the intestinal  microbiota of cesarean section delivered infants in this study was also characterized by an absence of bifidobacteria species. an interesting finding of  our study was recovery of large number of acinetobacter sp. consisting of acinetobacter pittii (former acinetobacter genomic species 3), acinetobacter junii and acinetobacter baumannii in the vb infants clone library. among these, acinetobacter baumannii is a known nosocomial pathogen and acinetobacter pittii (genomic species 3) is recently recognized as clinically important taxa within the acinetobacter calcoaceticus-acinetobacter baumannii (acb) complex. although none of the infants had shown any sign of clinical symptoms of disease, this observation warrants a closer look.

TI  == structural insight into the clostridium difficile ethanolamine utilisation microcompartment.
AB  == bacterial microcompartments form a protective proteinaceous barrier around metabolic enzymes that process unstable or toxic chemical intermediates. the genome of the virulent, multidrug-resistant clostridium difficile 630 strain contains an operon, eut, encoding a bacterial microcompartment with genes for the breakdown of ethanolamine and its utilisation as a source of reduced nitrogen and carbon. the c. difficile eut operon displays regulatory genetic elements and protein encoding regions in common with homologous loci found in the genomes of other bacteria, including the enteric pathogens salmonella enterica and enterococcus faecalis. the crystal structures of two microcompartment shell proteins, cd1908 and cd1918, and an uncharacterised protein with potential enzymatic activity, cd1925, were determined by x-ray crystallography. cd1908 and  cd1918 display the same protein fold, though the order of secondary structure elements is permuted in cd1908 and this protein displays an n-terminal beta-strand extension. these proteins form hexamers with molecules related by crystallographic and non-crystallographic symmetry. the structure of cd1925 has a cupin beta-barrel fold and a putative active site that is distinct from the metal-ion dependent catalytic cupins. thin-section transmission electron microscopy of escherichia coli over-expressing eut proteins indicates that cd1918 is capable of self-association into arrays, suggesting an organisational role for cd1918 in the formation of this microcompartment. the work presented provides the basis for further study of the architecture and function of the c. difficile eut  microcompartment, its role in metabolism and the wider consequences of intestinal colonisation and virulence in this pathogen.

TI  == modification of plant rac/rop gtpase signalling using bacterial toxin transgenes.
AB  == bacterial protein toxins which modify rho gtpase are useful for the analysis of rho signalling in animal cells, but these toxins cannot be taken up by plant cells. we demonstrate in vitro deamidation of arabidopsis rop4 by escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (cnf1) and glucosylation by clostridium difficile toxin b. expression of the catalytic domain of cnf1 caused modification and activation of co-expressed arabidopsis rop4 gtpase in tobacco leaves, resulting in hypersensitive-like cell death. by contrast, the catalytic domain of toxin b modified and inactivated co-expressed constitutively active rop4, blocking the hypersensitive response caused by over-expression of active rops. in transgenic arabidopsis, both cnf1 and toxin b inhibited rop-dependent polar morphogenesis of leaf epidermal cells. toxin b expression also inhibited rop-dependent morphogenesis of root hairs and trichome branching, and resulted in root meristem enlargement and dwarf growth. our results show that cnf1 and toxin  b transgenes are effective tools in rop gtpase signalling studies.

TI  == comparison of bacterial quantities in left and right colon biopsies and faeces.
AB  == aim: to compare quantities of predominant and pathogenic bacteria in mucosal and  faecal samples. methods: twenty patients undergoing diagnostic colonoscopy with endoscopically and histologically normal mucosa were recruited to the study, 14 subjects of which also supplied faecal (f) samples between 15 d to 105 d post colonoscopy. mucosal biopsies were taken from each subject from the midportion of the ascending colon (right side samples, rm) and the sigmoid (left side samples,  lm). predominant intestinal and mucosal bacteria including clostridial 16s rrna gene clusters iv and xivab, bacteroidetes, enterobacteriaceae, bifidobacterium spp., akkermansia muciniphila (a. muciniphila), veillonella spp., collinsella spp., faecalibacterium prausnitzii (f. prausnitzii) and putative pathogens such as escherichia coli (e. coli), clostridium difficile (c. difficile), helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) and staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) were analysed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). host dna was quantified from the mucosal samples with human glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene targeting qpcr. paired t tests and the pearson correlation were applied for statistical analysis. results: the most prominent bacterial groups were clostridial groups iv and xiva+b and bacteroidetes and bacterial species f. prausnitzii in both sample types. h. pylori and s. aureus were not detected and c. difficile was detected in only one mucosal sample and three faecal samples. e. coli was detected in less than half of the mucosal samples at both sites, but was present in all faecal samples. all detected bacteria, except enterobacteriaceae,  were present at higher levels in the faeces than in the mucosa, but the different locations in the colon presented comparable quantities (rm, lm and f followed by  p(1) for rm vs f, p(2) for lm vs f and p(3) for rm vs lm: 4.17 +/- 0.60 log(10)/g, 4.16 +/- 0.56 log(10)/g, 5.88 +/- 1.92 log(10)/g, p(1) = 0.011, p(2) = 0.0069, p(3) = 0.9778 for a. muciniphila; 6.25 +/- 1.3 log(10)/g, 6.09 +/- 0.81 log(10)/g, 8.84 +/- 1.38 log(10)/g, p(1) < 0.0001, p(2) = 0.0002, p(3) = 0.6893 for bacteroidetes; 5.27 +/- 1.68 log(10)/g, 5.38 +/- 2.06 log(10)/g, 8.20 +/- 1.14 log(10)/g, p(1) < 0.0001, p(2) </= 0.0001, p(3) = 0.7535 for bifidobacterium spp.; 6.44 +/- 1.15 log(10)/g, 6.07 +/-1.45 log(10)/g, 9.74 +/-1.13 log(10)/g, p(1) < 0.0001, p(2) </= 0.0001, p(3) = 0.637 for clostridium cluster iv; 6.65 +/- 1.23 log(10)/g, 6.57 +/- 1.52 log(10)/g, 9.13 +/- 0.96 log(10)/g, p(1) < 0.0001,  p(2) </= 0.0001, p(3) = 0.9317 for clostridium cluster xiva; 4.57 +/- 1.44 log(10)/g, 4.63 +/- 1.34 log(10)/g, 7.05 +/- 2.48 log(10)/g, p(1) = 0.012, p(2) = 0.0357, p(3) = 0.7973 for collinsella spp.; 7.66 +/- 1.50 log(10)/g, 7.60 +/- 1.05 log(10)/g, 10.02 +/- 2.02 log(10)/g, p(1) </= 0.0001, p(2) = 0.0013, p(3) =  0.9919 for f. prausnitzsii; 6.17 +/- 1.3 log(10)/g, 5.85 +/- 0.93 log(10)/g, 7.25 +/- 1.01 log(10)/g, p(1) = 0.0243, p(2) = 0.0319, p(3) = 0.6982 for veillonella spp.; 4.68 +/- 1.21 log(10)/g, 4.71 +/- 0.83 log(10)/g, 5.70 +/- 2.00 log(10)/g,  p(1) = 0.1927, p(2) = 0.0605, p(3) = 0.6476 for enterobacteriaceae). the bifidobacterium spp. counts correlated significantly between mucosal sites and mucosal and faecal samples (pearson correlation coefficients 0.62, p = 0.040 and  0.81, p = 0.005 between the right mucosal sample and faeces and the left mucosal  sample and faeces, respectively). conclusion: non-invasive faecal samples do not  reflect bacterial counts on the mucosa at the individual level, except for bifidobacteria often analysed in probiotic intervention studies.

TI  == the impact of infection on population health: results of the ontario burden of infectious diseases study.
AB  == background: evidence-based priority setting is increasingly important for rationally distributing scarce health resources and for guiding future health research. we sought to quantify the contribution of a wide range of infectious diseases to the overall infectious disease burden in a high-income setting. methodology/principal findings: we used health-adjusted life years (halys), a composite measure comprising premature mortality and reduced functioning due to disease, to estimate the burden of 51 infectious diseases and associated syndromes in ontario using 2005-2007 data. deaths were estimated from vital statistics data and disease incidence was estimated from reportable disease, healthcare utilization, and cancer registry data, supplemented by local modeling  studies and national and international epidemiologic studies. the 51 infectious agents and associated syndromes accounted for 729 lost halys, 44.2 deaths, and 58,987 incident cases per 100,000 population annually. the most burdensome infectious agents were: hepatitis c virus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia  coli, human papillomavirus, hepatitis b virus, human immunodeficiency virus, staphylococcus aureus, influenza virus, clostridium difficile, and rhinovirus. the top five, ten, and 20 pathogens accounted for 46%, 67%, and 75% of the total  infectious disease burden, respectively. marked sex-specific differences in disease burden were observed for some pathogens. the main limitations of this study were the exclusion of certain infectious diseases due to data availability  issues, not considering the impact of co-infections and co-morbidity, and the inability to assess the burden of milder infections that do not result in healthcare utilization. conclusions/significance: infectious diseases continue to cause a substantial health burden in high-income settings such as ontario. most of this burden is attributable to a relatively small number of infectious agents, for which many effective interventions have been previously identified. therefore, these findings should be used to guide public health policy, planning, and research.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a range of probiotics against pathogens: evidence for the effects of organic acids.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial properties of fifteen  selected strains belonging to the lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, lactococcus, streptococcus and bacillus genera against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. in vitro antibacterial activity was initially investigated by an agar spot method. results from the agar spot test showed that most of the selected strains were able to produce active compounds on solid media with antagonistic properties against salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and clostridium difficile. these results were also confirmed when cell-free culture supernatants (cfcs) from the putative probiotics were used in an agar well diffusion assay. neutralization of  the culture supernatants with alkali reduced the antagonistic effects. these experiments are able to confirm the capacity of potential probiotics to inhibit selected pathogens. one of the main inhibitory mechanisms may result from the production of organic acids from glucose fermentation and consequent lowering of  culture ph. this observation was confirmed when the profile of organic acids was  analysed demonstrating that lactic and acetic acid were the principal end products of probiotic metabolism. furthermore, the assessment of the haemolytic activity and the susceptibility of the strains to the most commonly used antimicrobials, considered as basic safety aspects, were also studied. the observed antimicrobial activity was mainly genus-specific, additionally significant differences could be observed among species.

TI  == suppression of clostridium difficile in the gastrointestinal tracts of germfree mice inoculated with a murine isolate from the family lachnospiraceae.
AB  == the indigenous microbial community of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract determines  susceptibility to clostridium difficile colonization and disease. previous studies have demonstrated that antibiotic-treated mice challenged with c. difficile either developed rapidly lethal c. difficile infection or were stably colonized with mild disease. the gi microbial community of animals with mild disease was dominated by members of the bacterial family lachnospiraceae, while the gut community in moribund animals had a predominance of escherichia coli. we  investigated the roles of murine lachnospiraceae and e. coli strains in colonization resistance against c. difficile in germfree mice. murine lachnospiraceae and e. coli isolates were cultured from wild-type mice. the ability of each of these isolates to interfere with c. difficile colonization was tested by precolonizing germfree mice with these bacteria 4 days prior to experimental c. difficile challenge. mice precolonized with a murine lachnospiraceae isolate, but not those colonized with e. coli, had significantly  decreased c. difficile colonization, lower intestinal cytotoxin levels and exhibited less severe clinical signs and colonic histopathology. infection of germfree mice or mice precolonized with e. coli with c. difficile strain vpi 10463 was uniformly fatal by 48 h, but only 20% mortality was seen at 2 days in mice precolonized with the lachnospiraceae isolate prior to challenge with vpi 10463. these findings confirm that a single component of the gi microbiota, a murine lachnospiraceae isolate, could partially restore colonization resistance against c. difficile. further study of the members within the lachnospiraceae family could lead to a better understanding of mechanisms of colonization resistance against c. difficile and novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment and prevention of c. difficile infection.

TI  == sensitivity of pathogenic and commensal bacteria from the human colon to essential oils.
AB  == the microbiota of the intestinal tract plays an important role in colonic health, mediating many effects of dietary components on colonic health and during enteric infections. in the context of the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance in gut bacteria, complementary therapies are required for the prevention and treatment of enteric infections. here we report the potential application of essential oils (eo) and pure eo compounds to improve human gut health. nerolidol, thymol, eugenol and geraniol inhibited growth of the pathogens escherichia coli o157 : h7(vt(-)), clostridium difficile dsm1296, clostridium perfringens dsm11780, salmonella typhimurium 3530 and salmonella enteritidis s1400 at a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) varying from 50 to 500 p.p.m. most eo showed greater toxicity to pathogens than to commensals. however, the beneficial commensal faecalibacterium prausnitzii was sensitive to eo at similar  or even lower concentrations than the pathogens. the eo showed dose-dependent effects on cell integrity, as measured using propidium iodide, of gram-positive bacteria. these effects were not strongly correlated with growth inhibition, however, suggesting that cell membrane damage occurred but was not the primary cause of growth inhibition. growth inhibition of gram-negative bacteria, in contrast, occurred mostly without cell integrity loss. principal component analysis showed clustering of responses according to bacterial species rather than to the identity of the eo, with the exception that responses to thymol and nerolidol clustered away from the other eo. in conclusion, the selective effects  of some eo might have beneficial effects on gut health if chosen carefully for effectiveness against different species.

TI  == irinotecan (cpt-11) chemotherapy alters intestinal microbiota in tumour bearing rats.
AB  == intestinal microbiota mediate toxicity of irinotecan (cpt-11) cancer therapies and cause systemic infection after cpt-11-induced loss of barrier function. the intestinal microbiota and their functions are thus potential targets for treatment to mitigate cpt-11 toxicity. however, microbiota changes during cpt-11  therapy remain poorly described. this study analysed changes in intestinal microbiota induced by cpt-11 chemotherapy. qualitative and quantitative taxonomic analyses, and functional analyses were combined to characterize intestinal microbiota during cpt-11-based chemotherapy, and in presence or absence of oral glutamine, a treatment known to reduce cpt-11 toxicity. in the first set of experiments tumour-bearing rats received a dose-intensive cpt-11 regimen (125 mg  kg(-1)x3 days), with or without oral glutamine bolus (0.75 g kg(-1)). in a subsequent more clinically-oriented chemotherapy regimen, rats received two cycles of cpt-11 (50 mg kg(-1)) followed by 5-flurouracil (50 mg kg(-1)). the analysis of fecal samples over time demonstrated that tumours changed the composition of intestinal microbiota, increasing the abundance of clostrridial clusters i, xi, and enterobacteriaceae. cpt-11 chemotherapy increased cecal clostridium cluster xi and enterobacteriaceae, particularly after the dose-intensive therapy. glutamine treatment prevented the reduced abundance of major bacterial groups after cpt-11 administration; i.e. total bacteria, clostridium cluster vi, and the bacteroides-group. virulence factor/toxin genes of pathogenic escherichia coli and clostridium difficile were not detected in the cecal microbiota. in conclusion, both colon cancer implantation and cpt-11-based  chemotherapies disrupted the intestinal microbiota. oral glutamine partially mitigated cpt-11 toxicity and induced temporary changes of the intestinal microbiota.

TI  == soluble plantain fibre blocks adhesion and m-cell translocation of intestinal pathogens.
AB  == dietary fibres may have prebiotic effects mediated by promotion of beneficial bacteria. this study explores the possibility that soluble plant fibre may also improve health by inhibiting epithelial adhesion and translocation by pathogenic  bacteria. we have focussed on soluble non-starch polysaccharide (nsp) from plantain bananas (musa spp.) which previous studies showed to be particularly effective at blocking escherichia coli epithelial adherence. in vitro and ex vivo studies assessed the ability of plantain nsp to inhibit epithelial cell adhesion  and invasion of various bacterial pathogens, and to inhibit their translocation through microfold (m)-cells and human peyer's patches mounted in ussing chambers. plantain nsp showed dose-related inhibition of epithelial adhesion and m-cell translocation by a range of pathogens. at 5mg/ml, a concentration readily achievable in the gut lumen, plantain nsp inhibited adhesion to caco2 cells by salmonella typhimurium (85.0 +/- 8.2%, p<.01), shigella sonnei (46.6 +/- 29.3%, p<.01), enterotoxigenic e.coli (56.1 +/- 23.7%, p<.05) and clostridium difficile  (67.6 +/- 12.3%, p<.001), but did not inhibit adhesion by enteropathogenic e.coli. plantain nsp also inhibited invasion of caco2 cells by s. typhimurium (80.2 +/- 9.7%) and sh. sonnei (46.7 +/- 13.4%); p<.01. plantain nsp, 5mg/ml, also inhibited translocation of s. typhimurium and sh. sonnei across m-cells by 73.3 +/- 5.2% and 46.4 +/- 7.7% respectively (p<.05). similarly, s. typhimurium translocation across peyer's patches was reduced 65.9 +/- 8.1% by plantain nsp (p<.01). soluble plantain fibre can block epithelial adhesion and m-cell translocation of intestinal pathogens. this represents an important novel mechanism by which soluble dietary fibres can promote intestinal health and prevent infective diarrhoea.

TI  == fidaxomicin is an inhibitor of the initiation of bacterial rna synthesis.
AB  == fidaxomicin was recently approved for the treatment of clostridium difficile infection. it inhibits transcription by bacterial rna polymerase. because transcription is a multistep process, experiments were conducted in which fidaxomicin was added at different stages of transcriptional initiation to identify the blocked step. dna footprinting experiments were also conducted to further elucidate the stage inhibited. fidaxomicin blocks initiation only if added before the formation of the "open promoter complex," in which the template  dna strands have separated but rna synthesis has not yet begun. binding of fidaxomicin precludes the initial separation of dna strands that is prerequisite  to rna synthesis. these studies show that it has a mechanism distinct from that of elongation inhibitors, such as streptolydigin, and from the transcription initiation inhibitors myxopyronin and the rifamycins.

TI  == diarrhea etiology in a pediatric emergency department: a case control study.
AB  == background: the etiology of childhood diarrhea is frequently unknown. methods: we sought aeromonas, campylobacter, escherichia coli o157:h7, pleisiomonas shigelloides, salmonella, shigella, vibrio, and yersinia (by culture), adenoviruses, astroviruses, noroviruses, rotavirus, and shiga toxin-producing e.  coli (stec; by enzyme immunoassay), clostridium difficile (by cytotoxicity), parasites (by microscopy), and enteroaggregative e. coli (eaec; by polymerase chain reaction [pcr] analysis) in the stools of 254 children with diarrhea presenting to a pediatric emergency facility. age- and geographic-matched community controls without diarrhea (n = 452) were similarly studied, except bacterial cultures of the stool were limited only to cases. results: twenty-nine  (11.4%) case stools contained 13 salmonella, 10 stec (6 o157:h7 and 4 non-o157:h7 serotypes), 5 campylobacter, and 2 shigella. pcr-defined eaec were present more often in case (3.2%) specimens than in control (0.9%) specimens (adjusted odds ratio [or], 3.9; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.1-13.7), and their adherence phenotypes were variable. rotavirus, astrovirus, and adenovirus were more common  among cases than controls, but both groups contained noroviruses and c. difficile at similar rates. pcr evidence of hypervirulent c. difficile was found in case and control stools; parasites were much more common in control specimens. conclusions: eaec are associated with childhood diarrhea in seattle, but the optimal way to identify these agents warrants determination. children without diarrhea harbor diarrheagenic pathogens, including hypervirulent c. difficile. our data support the importance of taking into account host susceptibility, microbial density, and organism virulence traits in future case-control studies,  not merely categorizing candidate pathogens as being present or absent.

TI  == secretion of clostridium difficile toxins a and b requires the holin-like protein tcde.
AB  == the pathogenesis of clostridium difficile, the major cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, is mainly associated with the production and activities of two major toxins. in many bacteria, toxins are released into the extracellular environment via the general secretion pathways. c. difficile toxins a and b have no export signature and their secretion is not explainable by cell lysis, suggesting that they might be secreted by an unusual mechanism. the tcde protein encoded within the c. difficile pathogenicity locus (paloc) has predicted structural features similar to those of bacteriophage holin proteins. during many types of phage infection, host lysis is driven by an endolysin that crosses the cytoplasmic membrane through a pore formed by holin oligomerization. we demonstrated that tcde has a holin-like activity by functionally complementing a  lambda phage deprived of its holin. similar to lambda holin, tcde expressed in escherichia coli and c. difficile formed oligomers in the cytoplamic membrane. a  c. difficile tcde mutant strain grew at the same rate as the wild-type strain, but accumulated a dramatically reduced amount of toxin proteins in the medium. however, the complemented tcde mutant released the toxins efficiently. there was  no difference in the abundance of tcda and tcdb transcripts or of several cytoplasmic proteins in the mutant and the wild-type strains. in addition, tcde did not overtly affect membrane integrity of c. difficile in the presence of tcda/tcdb. thus, tcde acts as a holin-like protein to facilitate the release of c. difficile toxins to the extracellular environment, but, unlike the phage holins, does not cause the non-specific release of cytosolic contents. tcde appears to be the first example of a bacterial protein that releases toxins into  the environment by a phage-like system.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of single- and multi-strain probiotics: inter-species inhibition between probiotic strains, and inhibition of pathogens.
AB  == many studies comparing the effects of single- and multi-strain probiotics on pathogen inhibition compare treatments with different concentrations. they also do not examine the possibility of inhibition between probiotic strains with a mixture. we tested the ability of 14 single-species probiotics to inhibit each other using a cross-streak assay, and agar spot test. we then tested the ability  of 15 single-species probiotics and 5 probiotic mixtures to inhibit clostridium difficile, escherichia coli and s. typhimurium, using the agar spot test. testing was done with mixtures created in two ways: one group contained component species incubated together, the other group of mixtures was made using component species  which had been incubated separately, equalised to equal optical density, and then mixed in equal volumes. inhibition was observed for all combinations of probiotics, suggesting that when used as such there may be inhibition between probiotics, potentially reducing efficacy of the mixture. significant inter-species variation was seen against each pathogen. when single species were  tested against mixtures, the multi-species preparations displayed significantly (p < 0.05 or less) greater inhibition of pathogens in 12 out of 24 cases. despite evidence that probiotic species will inhibit each other when incubated together in vitro, in many cases a probiotic mixture was more effective at inhibiting pathogens than its component species when tested at approximately equal concentrations of biomass. this suggests that using a probiotic mixture might be  more effective at reducing gastrointestinal infections, and that creating a mixture using species with different effects against different pathogens may have a broader spectrum of action that a single provided by a single strain.

TI  == requirement of upstream hfq-binding (arn)x elements in glms and the hfq c-terminal region for glms upregulation by srnas glmz and glmy.
AB  == hfq is an important rna-binding protein that helps bacteria adapt to stress. its  primary function is to promote pairing between trans-acting small non-coding rnas (srnas) and their target mrnas. identification of essential hfq-binding motifs in up-stream regions of rpos and fhla led us to ask the question whether these elements are a common occurrence among other hfq-dependent mrnas as well. here, we confirm the presence of a similar (arn)(x) motif in glms rna, a gene controlled by two srnas (glmz and glmy) in an hfq-dependent manner. glmz represents a canonical srna:mrna pairing system, whereas glmy is non-canonical, interfacing with the rna processing protein yhbj. we show that glms interacts with both hfq-binding surfaces in the absence of srnas. even though two (arn)(x)  motifs are present, using a glms:gfp fusion system, we determined that only one specific (arn)(x) element is essential for regulation. furthermore, we show that  residues 66-72 in the c-terminal extension of escherichia coli hfq are essential  for activation of glms expression by glmy, but not with glmz. this result shows that the c-terminal extension of hfq may be required for some forms of non-canonical srna regulation involving ancillary components such as additional rnas or proteins.

TI  == longitudinal study of clostridium difficile and antimicrobial susceptibility of escherichia coli in healthy horses in a community setting.
AB  == point prevalence studies have reported carriage rates of enteric pathogens in healthy horses, but longitudinal data are lacking. commensal e. coli is an indicator organism to evaluate antimicrobial resistance of enteric bacteria, yet  there are limited data for horses. the objectives of this study were to investigate and molecularly characterize isolates of clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens and salmonella, collected sequentially over a one year period, and to determine the antibiotic susceptibility profile for e. coli. fecal samples were collected monthly from 25 adult horses for one year. selective cultures were performed for all above bacteria. c. difficile isolates were characterized via pcr toxin gene profiling and ribotyping. broth microdilution was performed to assess antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of e. coli. toxigenic clostridium difficile was isolated from 15/275 (5.45%) samples from 10/25 (40%) horses. four horses were positive at multiple sampling times but different ribotypes were found in three. ribotypes included 078 (n=6), 001 (n=6)  and c (n=3). c. perfringens was not isolated, nor was salmonella. e. coli was isolated from 232/300 (77%) fecal samples. resistance to >/= 1 and >/= 3 antimicrobials was present in 31/232 (13.4%) and 6/232 (2.6%) respectively. only  two horses shed the same strain of toxigenic c. difficile for more than one month, indicating that shedding is transient. the high number of ribotype 078 is  consistent with recent emergence of this strain in the local horse population. the low prevalence of antibiotic resistance in commensal e. coli suggests that healthy horses are not likely a major reservoir of resistance for enteric bacteria.

AB  == clostridium difficile is an important, emerging nosocomial pathogen. the transition from harmless colonization to disease is typically preceded by antimicrobial therapy, which alters the balance of the intestinal flora, enabling c. difficile to proliferate in the colon. one of the most perplexing aspects of the c. difficile infectious cycle is its ability to survive antimicrobial therapy and transition from inert colonization to active infection. toxin-antitoxin (ta)  systems have been implicated in facilitating persistence after antibiotic treatment. we identified only one ta system in c. difficile strain 630 (epidemic  type x), designated maze-cd and mazf-cd, a counterpart of the well-characterized  escherichia coli mazef ta system. this e. coli mazf toxin cleaves mrna at aca sequences, leading to global mrna degradation, growth arrest, and death. likewise, mazf-cd expression in e. coli or clostridium perfringens resulted in growth arrest. primer extension analysis revealed that mazf-cd cleaved rna at the five-base consensus sequence uacau, suggesting that the mrnas susceptible to cleavage comprise a subset of total mrnas. in agreement, we observed differential cleavage of several mrnas by mazf-cd in vivo, revealing a direct correlation between the number of cleavage recognition sites within a given transcript and its susceptibility to degradation by mazf-cd. interestingly, upon detailed statistical analyses of the c. difficile transcriptome, the major c. difficile virulence factor toxin b (tcdb) and cwpv, a cell wall protein involved in aggregation, were predicted to be significantly resistant to mazf-cd cleavage.

TI  == a novel fusion protein containing the receptor binding domains of c. difficile toxin a and toxin b elicits protective immunity against lethal toxin and spore challenge in preclinical efficacy models.
AB  == antibodies targeting the clostridium difficile toxin a and toxin b confer protective immunity to c. difficile associated disease in animal models and provided protection against recurrent c. difficile disease in human subjects. these antibodies are directed against the receptor binding domains (rbd) located  in the carboxy-terminal portion of both toxins and inhibit binding of the toxins  to their receptors. we have constructed a recombinant fusion protein containing portions of the rbd from both toxin a and toxin b and expressed it in escherichia coli. the fusion protein induced high levels of serum antibodies to both toxins a and b capable of neutralizing toxin activity both in vitro and in vivo. in a hamster c. difficile infection model, immunization with the fusion protein reduced disease severity and conferred significant protection against a lethal dose of c. difficile spores. our studies demonstrate the potential of the fusion  protein as a vaccine that could provide protection from c. difficile disease in humans.

TI  == clostridium difficile carbohydrates: glucan in spores, psii common antigen in cells, immunogenicity of psii in swine and synthesis of a dual c. difficile-etec  conjugate vaccine.
AB  == clostridium difficile is responsible for severe diarrhea in humans that may cause death. spores are the infectious form of c. difficile, which germinate into toxin-producing vegetative cells in response to bile acids. recently, we discovered that c. difficile cells possess three complex polysaccharides (pss), named psi, psii, and psiii, in which psi was only associated with a hypervirulent ribotype 027 strain, psii was hypothesized to be a common antigen, and psiii was  a water-insoluble polymer. here, we show that (i) c. difficile spores contain, at least in part, a d-glucan, (ii) psi is not a ribotype 027-unique antigen, (iii) common antigen psii may in part be present as a low molecular weight lipoteichoic acid, (iv) selective hydrolysis of psii yields single psii repeat units, (v) the  glycosyl diester-phosphate linkage affords high flexibility to psii, and (vi) that psii is immunogenic in sows. also, with the intent of creating a dual anti-diarrheal vaccine against c. difficile and enterotoxin escherichia coli (etec) infections in humans, we describe the conjugation of psii to the etec-associated ltb enterotoxin.

TI  == cyclic diguanylate inversely regulates motility and aggregation in clostridium difficile.
AB  == clostridium difficile-associated disease is increasing in incidence and is costly to treat. our understanding of how this organism senses its entry into the host and adapts for growth in the large bowel is limited. the small-molecule second messenger cyclic diguanylate (c-di-gmp) has been extensively studied in gram-negative bacteria and has been shown to modulate motility, biofilm formation, and other processes in response to environmental signals, yet little is known about the functions of this signaling molecule in gram-positive bacteria or in c. difficile specifically. in the current study, we investigated the function of the second messenger c-di-gmp in c. difficile. to determine the role  of c-di-gmp in c. difficile, we ectopically expressed genes encoding a diguanylate cyclase enzyme, which synthesizes c-di-gmp, or a phosphodiesterase enzyme, which degrades c-di-gmp. this strategy allowed us to artificially elevate or deplete intracellular c-di-gmp, respectively, and determine that c-di-gmp represses motility in c. difficile, consistent with previous studies in gram-negative bacteria, in which c-di-gmp has a negative effect on myriad modes of bacterial motility. elevated c-di-gmp levels also induced clumping of c. difficile cells, which may signify that c. difficile is capable of forming biofilms in the host. in addition, we directly quantified, for the first time, c-di-gmp production in a gram-positive bacterium. this work demonstrates the effect of c-di-gmp on the motility of a gram-positive bacterium and on aggregation of c. difficile, which may be relevant to the function of this signaling molecule during infection.

TI  == precise manipulation of the clostridium difficile chromosome reveals a lack of association between the tcdc genotype and toxin production.
AB  == clostridium difficile causes a potentially fatal diarrheal disease through the production of its principal virulence factors, toxin a and toxin b. the tcdc gene is thought to encode a negative regulator of toxin production. therefore, increased toxin production, and hence increased virulence, is often inferred in strains with an aberrant tcdc genotype. this report describes the first allele exchange system for precise genetic manipulation of c. difficile, using the coda  gene of escherichia coli as a heterologous counterselection marker. it was used to systematically restore the delta117 frameshift mutation and the 18-nucleotide  deletion that occur naturally in the tcdc gene of c. difficile r20291 (pcr ribotype 027). in addition, the naturally intact tcdc gene of c. difficile 630 (pcr ribotype 012) was deleted and then subsequently restored with a silent nucleotide substitution, or "watermark," so the resulting strain was distinguishable from the wild type. intriguingly, there was no association between the tcdc genotype and toxin production in either c. difficile r20291 or c. difficile 630. therefore, an aberrant tcdc genotype does not provide a broadly applicable rationale for the perceived notion that pcr ribotype 027 strains are "high-level" toxin producers. this may well explain why several studies have reported that an aberrant tcdc gene does not predict increased toxin production or, indeed, increased virulence.

TI  == targeting bacterial toxins.
AB  == protein toxins constitute the main virulence factors of several species of bacteria and have proven to be attractive targets for drug development. lead candidates that target bacterial toxins range from small molecules to polymeric binders, and act at each of the multiple steps in the process of toxin-mediated pathogenicity. despite recent and significant advances in the field, a rationally designed drug that targets toxins has yet to reach the market. this review presents the state of the art in bacterial toxin targeted drug development with a critical consideration of achieved breakthroughs and withstanding challenges. the discussion focuses on a-b-type protein toxins secreted by four species of bacteria, namely clostridium difficile (toxins a and b), vibrio cholerae (cholera toxin), enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (shiga toxin), and bacillus anthracis  (anthrax toxin), which are the causative agents of diseases for which treatments  need to be improved.

TI  == genomic sequence of bacteriophage atcc 8074-b1 and activity of its endolysin and  engineered variants against clostridium sporogenes.
AB  == lytic bacteriophage atcc 8074-b1 produces large plaques on its host clostridium sporogenes. sequencing of the 47,595-bp genome allowed the identification of 82 putative open reading frames, including those encoding proteins for head and tail morphogenesis and lysis. however, sequences commonly associated with lysogeny were absent. orf 22 encodes an endolysin, cs74l, that shows homology to n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases, and when expressed in escherichia coli, the  protein causes effective lysis of c. sporogenes cells when added externally. cs74l was also active on clostridium tyrobutyricum and clostridium acetobutylicum. the catalytic domain expressed alone (cs74l(1-177)) exhibited a similar activity and the same host range as the full-length endolysin. a chimeric endolysin consisting of the cs74l catalytic domain fused to the c-terminal domain of endolysin cd27l, derived from clostridium difficile bacteriophage phicd27, was produced. this chimera (cscd) lysed c. sporogenes cells with an activity equivalent to that of the catalytic domain alone. in contrast, the cd27l c-terminal domain reduced the efficacy of the cs74l catalytic domain when tested  against c. tyrobutyricum. the addition of the cd27l c-terminal domain did not enable the lysin to target c. difficile or other cd27l-sensitive bacteria.

TI  == quantitative analysis of intestinal bacterial populations from term infants fed formula supplemented with fructo-oligosaccharides.
AB  == objectives: previous studies of infant formulas supplemented with oligosaccharides reported mixed results regarding the impact on intestinal microbial populations. the objective of this study was to examine the effect of supplementation of an infant formula with fructo-oligosaccharides (fos) on select groups of intestinal bacteria in term infants. methods: four groups of infants were enrolled and fed human milk, a commercially available milk-based infant formula, or infant formula supplemented with 2.0 or 3.0 g/l fos. dietary intake,  stool, and tolerance events were recorded. fresh stool samples were collected approximately 27 days after feeding the diets (approximately 32 days after birth). total bacteria, bacteroides (as commensal bacteria), bifidobacterium and  lactobacillus, and clostridium difficile and escherichia coli were quantified using respective specific real-time pcr assays. results: the formula feeding groups did not differ in stool consistency and stool frequency or frequency of spit-up or vomit during the entire study. the formula-fed infants tended to have  more total bacteria in their stool samples than the human milk-fed infants. the formula-fed infants harbored a greater abundance of c difficile and e coli than the human milk-fed infants, but had a similar abundance of bacteroides, bifidobacterium, and lactobacillus. the fos supplementation at either dose did not significantly increase the bifidobacterial or lactobacilli populations, or decrease the populations of c difficile, e coli, or bacteroides. conclusions: the milk-based formula used in this study supported bifidobacterial and lactobacilli  populations comparable with the human milk group; however, this formula did not suppress e coli or c difficile as effectively as human milk.

TI  == diarrhoeagenic escherichia coli as a predominant cause of paediatric nosocomial diarrhoea in india.
AB  == intestinal nosocomial infections remain a major concern in paediatric wards leading to increased morbidity and mortality. this study determined the aetiological and epidemiological profile of nosocomial diarrhoea (nd) among children admitted to a hospital in india. during the period of january 2008 to june 2009, we consecutively enrolled 100 children between the age of 2 months and 14 years who developed nd as defined by the centers for disease control and prevention. a control group of patients matched for age and severity score but with no diarrhoea at admission or during their hospital stay (n=50) were also enrolled. stool samples were cultured for various pathogens using standard protocols. clostridium difficile toxins and rotavirus antigen were detected using commercial elisas. detection of diarrhoeagenic escherichia coli was carried out by multiplex pcr assay. all patient details were noted. in this study, males predominated (77%), and 56% children were <1 year of age and 96% were <5 years. the mean duration of diarrhoea and hospitalization in the case group was 3.2 days and 27.5 days, respectively. malignancy and nasogastric tube usage were significant underlying factors for the development of nd. diarrhoeagenic e. coli  was the commonest agent (47%: enterotoxigenic e. coli, enteroaggregative e. coli  and enteropathogenic e. coli were isolated in 22, 18 and 7% of patients, respectively). c. difficile toxin was seen in 9% of cases, whilst rotavirus was found in 8% of cases. although rotavirus and c. difficile are major causative agents of hospital-acquired diarrhoea in the developed world, in this setting diarrhoeagenic e. coli was responsible for the majority of cases of hospital-acquired diarrhoea. nd was most common in children aged <5 years.

TI  == discovery of lff571: an investigational agent for clostridium difficile infection.
AB  == clostridium difficile (c. difficile) is a gram positive, anaerobic bacterium that infects the lumen of the large intestine and produces toxins. this results in a range of syndromes from mild diarrhea to severe toxic megacolon and death. alarmingly, the prevalence and severity of c. difficile infection are increasing; thus, associated morbidity and mortality rates are rising. 4-aminothiazolyl analogues of the antibiotic natural product ge2270 a (1) were designed, synthesized, and optimized for the treatment of c. difficile infection. the medicinal chemistry effort focused on enhancing aqueous solubility relative to that of the natural product and previous development candidates (2, 3) and improving antibacterial activity. structure-activity relationships, cocrystallographic interactions, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy in animal models  of infection were characterized. these studies identified a series of dicarboxylic acid derivatives, which enhanced solubility/efficacy profile by several orders of magnitude compared to previously studied compounds and led to the selection of lff571 (4) as an investigational new drug for treating c. difficile infection.

AB  == objectives: the etiologies, clinical presentations and diagnosis of acute pathogen-specific dysentery in children and adults in industrialized and developing regions is described to help develop recommendations for therapy. methods: we conducted a systematic review of literature published between january 2000 and june 2011 to determine the frequency of occurrence of pathogen-specific  dysentery. results: shigella, salmonella, and campylobacter remain the most frequent bacterial causes of dysentery worldwide. shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) is potentially important in industrialized countries. entamoeba histolytica must be considered in the developing world, particularly in rural or periurban areas. clinicians should use epidemiological clues and knowledge of endemicity to suspect vibrio spp., aeromonas spp., plesiomonas spp., yersinia enterocolitica, clostridium difficile, cytomegalovirus or schistosoma mansoni in cases presenting with dysentery. a single fecal sample studied for etiologic agents is the customary way to make an etiologic diagnosis. conclusions: while a majority of dysenteric cases will not have an identifiable agent causing the illness, when an etiologic organism is identified, other than stec, each has a specific recommended form of therapy, which is provided in this  review.

AB  == objectives: to determine variation at the genome level in escherichia coli st131  clinical isolates previously shown to be phenotypically diverse. methods: the genomes of 10 st131 isolates extensively characterized in previous studies were sequenced using combinations of illumina and 454 sequencing technology. whole-genome comparisons and phylogenetic comparisons were then performed across  the strain set and with other closely related extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli  (expec) strain types. results: e. coli st131 is overrepresented in a collection of clinical isolates, and there is large phenotypic variation amongst isolates. in contrast, genome sequencing of a selection of non-related clinical isolates shows almost no genetic variation between st131 strains, and e. coli st131 shows  evidence of a genetically monomorphic pathogen showing a similar evolutionary trend to hypervirulent clostridium difficile. conclusions: a dominant circulating clone of e. coli st131 has been identified in unrelated clinical urine samples in the uk. the clone splits into two distinct subgroups on the basis of antimicrobial resistance levels and carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase  plasmids. this provides the most comprehensive snapshot to date of the true molecular epidemiology of st131 clinical isolates.

TI  == enveloped virus but not bacteria block il-13 responses in human cord blood t cells in vitro.
AB  == infections that occur early in life may have a beneficial effect on the immune system and thereby reduce the risk of allergen sensitization and/or allergic disease. it is not yet clear to what extent specific virus and/or bacteria can mediate this effect. the purpose of this study was to assess the role of virus and bacteria in cd4(+) t cell-derived cytokine production in newborns. we compared the effects of five bacteria (staphlococcus aureus, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, lactobacillus rhamnosus and bifidobacterium bifidus) and seven virus (adenovirus, coronavirus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, influenza virus, morbillivirus and poliovirus) on the th1/th2 cytokine production in mixed lymphocyte reactions using cd4(+) t cells from cord blood cocultured with allogenic myeloid or plasmacytoid dendritic cells. when comparing the baseline cytokine production prior to microbial stimulation, we observed that cord plasmacytoid dc were stronger inducers of th2 cytokines (il-5 and il-13) compared with cord myeloid dc and to adult dc. when adding microbes to these cultures, bacteria and virus differed in two major respects; firstly, all enveloped viruses, but none of the bacteria, blocked th2 (il-13) production by cord cd4(+) cells. secondly, all gram-positive bacteria, but none of the virus, induced il-12p40 responses, but the il-12p40 responses did not affect th1 cytokine production (ifn-gamma). instead, th1 responses were correlated with the  capacity to induce ifn-alpha secretion, which in cord cells were induced by s. aureus and influenza virus alone. these data imply that enveloped virus can deviate th2 responses in human cord t cells.

TI  == release of tcda and tcdb from clostridium difficile cdi 630 is not affected by functional inactivation of the tcde gene.
AB  == the small open reading frame tcde is located between the genes tcda and tcdb which encode toxin a (tcda) and b (tcdb), respectively, within the pathogenicity  locus of clostridium difficile. sequence and structure similarities to bacteriophage-encoded holins have led to the assumption that tcde mediates the release of the toxins from c. difficile into the extracellular environment. a tcde-deficient c. difficile 630 strain was generated by insertional inactivation  of the tcde gene. data revealed that tcde does not regulate or affect growth or sporogenesis. tcde-deficiency was accompanied by a moderately increased accumulation of tcda and tcdb prior to sporulation in this microorganism. interestingly, this observation did not correlate with a delayed or inhibited toxin release: inactivation of tcde neither significantly altered kinetics of release nor the absolute level of secreted tcda and tcdb, indicating that tcde does not account for the pathogenicity of c. difficile strain 630. furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis could not reveal differences in the secretome of wild  type and tcde-deficient c. difficile, indicating that tcde did not function as a  secretion system for protein release. tcde was expressed as a 19 kda protein in c. difficile, whereas tcde expressed in escherichia coli appeared as a 19 and 16  kda protein. expression of the short 16 kda tcde correlated with bacterial cell death. we conclude that tcde does not exhibit pore-forming function in c. difficile since in these cells only the non-lytic full length 19 kda protein is expressed.

TI  == durability of silver nanoparticulate films within a silica matrix by flame assisted chemical vapour deposition for biocidal applications.
AB  == healthcare acquired infection (hcai) rates have come under increasing scrutiny in recent years and been a major priority for health professionals in the uk and elsewhere. of particular concern is the rise of so called 'superbugs', or those resistant to conventional antibiotics, such as escherichia coli, clostridium difficile and methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). the reasons for this rise are many and complex, but one important factor is bacterial survival rates on wards and other hospital areas. in this respect, nanostructured biocidal surfaces offer a potentially powerful weapon in the fight against hcai. in addition to providing a toxic environment to a range of infectious disease-causing bacteria (while remaining harmless to human health), any potential bioactive coated surface is required to be durable enough to withstand  regular hospital cleaning methods without a reduction in biocidal activity over time and be economically viable to mass produce. the flame assisted chemical vapour deposition (facvd) of silver and silver/silica films offer a means of producing such surfaces. in this work, we report investigations into a wide range of experimental factors and parameters affecting film durability, including burner head design and relative water vapour content in the flame environment. the produced films were assessed in terms of durability (by scratch testing) and  relative silver content using glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (gdoes).

TI  == enteropathogenic bacteria in dogs and cats: diagnosis, epidemiology, treatment, and control.
AB  == this report offers a consensus opinion on the diagnosis, epidemiology, treatment, and control of the primary enteropathogenic bacteria in dogs and cats, with an emphasis on clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., and escherichia coli associated with granulomatous colitis in boxers. veterinarians are challenged when attempting to diagnose animals with suspected bacterial-associated diarrhea because well-scrutinized practice guidelines that provide objective recommendations for implementing fecal testing  are lacking. this problem is compounded by similar isolation rates for putative bacterial enteropathogens in animals with and without diarrhea, and by the lack of consensus among veterinary diagnostic laboratories as to which diagnostic assays should be utilized. most bacterial enteropathogens are associated with self-limiting diarrhea, and injudicious administration of antimicrobials could be more harmful than beneficial. salmonella and campylobacter are well-documented zoonoses, but antimicrobial administration is not routinely advocated in uncomplicated cases and supportive therapy is recommended. basic practices of isolation, use of appropriate protective equipment, and proper cleaning and disinfection are the mainstays of control. handwashing with soap and water is preferred over use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers because spores of c. difficile and c. perfringens are alcohol-resistant, but susceptible to bleach (1:10 to 1:20 dilution of regular household bleach) and accelerated hydrogen peroxide. the implementation of practice guidelines in combination with the integration of validated molecular-based testing and conventional testing is pivotal if we are to optimize the identification and management of enteropathogenic bacteria in dogs and cats.

TI  == approach to the patient with infectious colitis.
AB  == purpose of review: to provide current recommendations for evaluation and treatment of patients with infectious colitis. infectious colitis is diagnosed in someone with diarrhea and one or more of the following: fever and/or dysentery, stools containing inflammatory markers such as leukocytes, lactoferrin, or calprotectin, or positive stool culture for an invasive or inflammatory bacterial enteropathogen including shigella, salmonella, campylobacter, shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) or clostridium difficile, or colonic inflammation by endoscopy. recent findings: standard stool culture should be performed in patients with infectious colitis. epidemiologic findings including prior international travel, shellfish-associated diarrhea, living in parasite-endemic regions may suggest the need for specialized studies of etiology. when stec is suspected as a pathogen because only low grade or no fever is seen in a patient with acute dysentery, a competent laboratory should look for e. coli o157:h7 and shiga toxin directly in stool. summary: once laboratory diagnosis is made, pathogen-specific antimicrobial therapy should be initiated for all forms of infectious colitis other than stec. for empiric treatment of febrile dysenteric diarrhea invasive bacterial enteropathogens (shigella, salmonella, and campylobacter) should be suspected and adults may be treated empirically with 1000mg azithromycin in a single dose.

TI  == gastrointestinal infection as a trigger for inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  == purpose of review: there is accumulating evidence on the importance of microbes in the development and maintenance of both the intestinal and immune systems. this review focuses on the current findings on the role of gastrointestinal pathogens in the cause of chronic inflammatory bowel disease. recent findings: a  number of intestinal pathogens including mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis, adherent-invasive escherichia coli, and campylobacter species are associated at fairly high prevalence with crohn's disease, while two recent studies found a low prevalence for cytomegalovirus. in a prospective study, m. avium subspecies paratuberculosis detection in early crohn's disease was low and  comparable to controls, while much higher in an established inflammatory bowel disease cohort. in the pediatric setting, a high prevalence of clostridium difficile was seen in both active and inactive crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients. some studies have speculated that salmonella or campylobacter infection may increase the risk of inflammatory bowel disease on long-term follow-up, but detection bias was found to obscure the risk. recent studies in mouse models have demonstrated that a combination of factors, including viral pathogens, genetic susceptibility, and commensal microflora, can lead to intestinal pathology. summary: no evidence for causation of inflammatory bowel disease by a single agent has been found, whereas a number of microbes have been  strongly associated with the presence of disease. the majority of recent studies  support a role for the ability of intestinal pathogens to promote chronic inflammation in individuals with genetic susceptibility and/or other environmental factors which remain to be identified. these factors may include subsets of commensal microflora.

AB  == objective: to assess the frequency of, and risk factors for, colonisation with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), clostridium difficile and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing organisms in residential aged care facilities (racfs). design, setting and participants: we conducted a point prevalence survey in october-november 2010 in three racfs associated with our health service. a single faecal sample was collected from each participating resident and screened for the presence of vre, c. difficile and esbl-producing organisms. presence of risk factors for antibiotic-resistant organisms was identified using a questionnaire. main outcome measures: prevalence of colonisation with vre, c. difficile and esbl-producing organisms; molecular typing of esbl-producing organisms; prevalence of risk factors including presence of a urinary catheter, recent inpatient stay in an acute care setting and recent  antibiotic consumption. results: of 164 residents in the three facilities, 119 (73%) were screened. mean age of screened residents was 79.2 years, and 61% were  women; 74% had resided in the racf for > 12 months, 21% had been given antibiotics within the past month and 12% had been in an acute care centre within the past 3 months. overall rates of vre (2%) and c. difficile (1%) colonisation were low, but esbl-producing escherichia coli was detected in 14 residents (12%)  overall, with half of these residing in one wing of an racf (27% of wing residents tested). ten of the 14 esbl-producing isolates had identical molecular  typing patterns and belonged to genotye ctx-m-9. eight of 13 residents had persistent colonisation on repeat testing 3 months later. conclusion: we found a  high prevalence of multiresistant esbl-producing e. coli in racf residents. a clonal relatedness of isolates suggests possible transmission within the facility. racfs should have programs emphasising processes that will limit spread of these organisms, namely good hand hygiene compliance, enhanced environmental cleaning and dedicated antimicrobial stewardship programs.

TI  == toxic megacolon.
AB  == toxic megacolon represents a dreaded complication of mainly inflammatory or infectious conditions of the colon. it is most commonly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), i.e., ulcerative colitis or ileocolonic crohn's disease. lately, the epidemiology has shifted toward infectious causes, specifically due to an increase of clostridium difficile-associated colitis possibly due to the extensive (ab)use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. other important infectious etiologies include salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, cytomegalovirus (cmv), rotavirus, aspergillus, and entameba. less frequently, toxic megacolon has been attributed to ischemic colitis, collagenous colitis, or  obstructive colorectal cancer. toxic colonic dilatation may also occur in hemolytic-uremic syndrome (hus) caused by enterohemorrhagic or enteroaggregative  escherichia coli o157 (ehec, eaec, or eahec). the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to toxic colonic dilatation are incompletely understood. the main characteristics of toxic megacolon are signs of systemic toxicity and severe colonic distension. diagnosis is made by clinical evaluation for systemic toxicity and imaging studies depicting colonic dilatation. plain abdominal imaging is still the most established radiological instrument. however, computed  tomography scanning and transabdominal intestinal ultrasound are promising alternatives that add additional information. management of toxic megacolon is an interdisciplinary task that requires close interaction of gastroenterologists and surgeons from the very beginning. the optimal timing of surgery for toxic megacolon can be challenging. here we review the latest data on the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, laboratory, and imaging modalities and provide algorithms  for an evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic approach.

AB  == purpose: we evaluated the risk of development of a symptomatic urinary tract infection (uti) based on the antibiotic prophylaxis given to a patient during and after uncomplicated ureteroscopy (urs) for urolithiasis. patients and methods: we retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients who underwent urs, laser lithotripsy, and stent placement for the management of stones from 2004/2005 (group 1) and 2009/2010 (group 2). we excluded all patients with preoperative positive cultures, preoperative antibiotics, urinary diversion, who underwent concomitant percutaneous nephrolithotomy, or had strings attached to the stents.  all patients received a first-generation intravenous cephalosporin or fluoroquinolone at the time of initial intervention and had ureteral stents placed intraoperatively. group 1 received an oral fluoroquinolone for 1 week postoperatively. group 2 received an oral first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic peri-stent removal only. antibiotics were appropriately changed according to the local resistance patterns. all stents were removed within 5 to 7 days. our primary end point was symptomatic uti. results: after the exclusion criteria, group 1 had 48 patients, group 2 had 49. there was no statistical difference in the incidence of symptomatic uti between the two groups; each group had one uti (2% risk) (p=0.988). there were no cases of readmission, pyelonephritis, uti, surgical reintervention, or clostridium difficile. the uti in group 1 was secondary to escherichia coli and in group 2, staphylococcus species; both were managed with oral antibiotics. conclusions: the use of oral peri-stent removal antibiotic prophylaxis is sufficient to prevent symptomatic utis in patients who have undergone uncomplicated urs for urolithiasis. the judicious use of antibiotics in uncomplicated cases may help lower the incidence  of resistant organisms and other complications related to the widespread use of antibiotics.

TI  == systematic review: the use of proton pump inhibitors and increased susceptibility to enteric infection.
AB  == background: the use of proton pump inhibitors (ppis) is increasing worldwide. suppression of gastric acid alters the susceptibility to enteric bacterial pathogens. aim this systematic review was undertaken to examine the relationship  between ppi use and susceptibility to enteric infections by a specific pathogen based on published literature and to discuss the potential mechanisms of ppi enhanced pathogenesis of enteric infections. methods pubmed, ovid medline databases were searched. search terms included proton pump inhibitors and mechanisms of, actions of, gastric acid, enteric infections, diarrhoea, clostridium difficile, salmonella, shigella and campylobacter. results the use of ppis increases gastric ph, encourages growth of the gut microflora, increases bacterial translocation and alters various immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. enteric pathogens show variable gastric acid ph susceptibility and acid  tolerance levels. by multiple mechanisms, ppis appear to increase susceptibility  to the following bacterial enteropathogens: salmonella, campylobacter jejuni, invasive strains of escherichia coli, vegetative cells of clostridium difficile,  vibrio cholerae and listeria. we describe the available evidence for enhanced susceptibility to enteric infection caused by salmonella, campylobacter and c. difficile by ppi use, with adjusted relative risk ranges of 4.2-8.3 (two studies); 3.5-11.7 (four studies); and 1.2-5.0 (17 of 27 studies) for the three respective organisms. conclusions severe hypochlorhydria generated by ppi use leads to bacterial colonisation and increased susceptibility to enteric bacterial infection. the clinical implication of chronic ppi use among hospitalized patients placed on antibiotics and travellers departing for areas with high incidence of diarrhoea should be considered by their physicians.

TI  == evaluation of doripenem utilization and susceptibilities at a large urban hospital.
AB  == background: bacterial resistance presents a constant challenge in the treatment of hospitalized patients, particularly with gram-negative infections. carbapenems have an important role in the treatment of resistant nosocomial organisms. doripenem, a recently approved carbapenem, has shown efficacy in clinical trials, but there is little published data on utilization in a general patient population. objective: the clinical utilization of doripenem in a general adult inpatient population was evaluated during a carbapenem formulary conversion. setting: a 706-bed acute care tertiary hospital serving an urban community. methods: after formulary conversion to doripenem, the first 100 patients to receive doripenem were included in the analysis. baseline characteristics were recorded for each patient, along with indication for treatment, prescribing physician, dose and frequency of doripenem and duration of treatment. patients were monitored for adverse reactions to doripenem. bacterial culture results were recorded. for positive cultures, doripenem susceptibility was determined by etest. patients were followed until discontinuation of antibiotic therapy, discharge or death to determine treatment outcomes. successful treatment was defined as clinical or microbiological cure, while patients with infection-related mortality or requiring subsequent antibiotics for the index infection were considered treatment failure. main outcome measures: clinical utilization of doripenem, including indications and doses used. results: doripenem treatment was recorded in 102 patients. the most common indications for treatment were pneumonia and sepsis. the majority of doripenem orders were written by infectious disease or pulmonology services. forty-nine patients were treated successfully with doripenem and six patients experienced treatment failure. the remainder of patients were not evaluable by predefined outcomes criteria. adverse events were reported in eight patients and included acute renal failure, clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea and seizures. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most common organisms in culture results. doripenem demonstrated in vitro activity against 81% of all organisms and susceptibility results had >90% correlation with meropenem and imipenem susceptibilities. conclusion: in our limited sample size,  doripenem was safe and effective against various types of infections in a general inpatient population with similar bacterial susceptibilities to other cabapenems. doripenem was utilized for appropriate indications, but doses were frequently outside the manufacturers labeling. adverse events were uncommon, and no serious  adverse events were directly associated with doripenem treatment.

TI  == innate immune environment in ileal pouch mucosa: alpha5 defensin up-regulation as predictor of chronic/relapsing pouchitis.
AB  == defensins are small cationic peptides with antibacterial activity expressed in paneth cells (alpha-defensins) or generally in intestinal epithelial cells (beta-defensins) that have a profound effect on gut microbiota. chronic pouchitis, which occurs in 5% of patients after restorative proctocolectomy and can cause pouch failure, is associated to a significant increase of clostridiaceae spp. the aim of this study was to gain further insight in the pathogenesis of pouch dysbiosis by exploring defensin expression. thirty-two consecutive patients coming for follow-up endoscopy were recruited. on pouch biopsies, we cultured bacteria adherent to the mucosa and determined alpha- and beta-defensins and toll-like receptor-4 and -2 mrna by quantitative real-time rt-pcr. serum and mucosal levels of il-1beta, il-6 and tnf-alpha were measured with immunometric assays. faecal lactoferrin was analysed by quantitative elisa.  after a median follow-up of 23 (iqr 20-24) months, the patients were contacted for a reassessment of current and past disease activity. during the follow-up, chronic/relapsing pouchitis was diagnosed in six patients. the mucosal level of alpha-5 and alpha-6 defensins correlated with chronic/relapsing pouchitis onset (tau = 0.30, p = 0.034 and tau = 0.28, p = 0.053, respectively). high levels of alpha-5 defensin resulted to be predictive of chronic/relapsing pouchitis [auc =  74% (95% ci = 53-89%), p = 0.052]. patients with high levels of alpha-5 and alpha-6 defensins had earlier pouchitis relapses (p = 0.009 and p = 0.034, respectively). high levels of alpha-5 defensin were associated to a significant risk of chronic/relapsing pouchitis [or = 10.6 (95% ci = 1.2-97.6), p = 0.027]. at multivariate analysis, the mucosal levels of alpha-5 defensin and the number of cfu of mucosa-associated clostridiaceae spp resulted to be independent predictors of chronic/relapsing pouchitis [beta = 0.46 (0.18), p = 0.024 and beta = 0.44 (0.18), p = 0.027, respectively]. in conclusion, chronic/relapsing pouchitis is associated to increased expression of mucosal hd-5 and to increased  antimicrobial activity against escherichia coli. in patients with chronic/relapsing pouchitis, hd-5 and tlr-4 over-expression is likely to create a hostile environment against enterobacteriaceae, thus favouring clostridiaceae spp by decreasing competing bacteria families.

TI  == implementation and outcomes of a hospital-wide computerised antimicrobial stewardship programme in a large medical centre in taiwan.
AB  == antibiotic stewardship is important to address the problem of antimicrobial resistance, but a practical and sustainable strategy to provide stewardship in a  large hospital setting is lacking. we developed a hospital-wide computerised antimicrobial approval system (hcaas) to guide the use of antimicrobial agents in late 2004 in a 3500-bed medical centre in taiwan. the objective of this study was to evaluate the impacts of hcaas on the hospital from 2003 to 2009. following hcaas deployment, the gradients of consumption over time during the study period  of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and glycopeptides fell significantly, whilst that of carbapenems increased. the amount and expenditure of antimicrobial use did not increase with the overall healthcare-associated infection rate, and inpatient mortality rate remained stable with a slight decreasing trend. the rate of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus started to decline in 2002 and continued after hcaas deployment. there was an increasing isolation of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, presumably leading to the increased use of carbapenems. the isolation rate of clostridium difficile from patients who developed diarrhoea after antimicrobial therapy did not change over the years, with a mean annual rate of 10.0% after the implementation of hcaas. hcaas along with strict infection control measures is necessary to reduce the spread of resistant organisms within the hospital. hcaas  is a sustainable system for providing antibiotic stewardship and exerts a positive impact on the hospital by reducing antimicrobial consumption and expenditure whilst not compromising healthcare quality.

TI  == mechanism for gene control by a natural allosteric group i ribozyme.
AB  == an allosteric ribozyme consisting of a metabolite-sensing riboswitch and a group  i self-splicing ribozyme was recently found in the pathogenic bacterium clostridium difficile. the riboswitch senses the bacterial second messenger c-di-gmp, thereby controlling 5'-splice site choice by the downstream ribozyme. the proximity of this allosteric ribozyme to the open reading frame (orf) for cd3246 suggests that coenzyme-mediated regulation of splicing controls expression of this putative virulence gene. in the presence of c-di-gmp, the allosteric ribozyme in the cd3246 precursor transcript generates a spliced transcript that retains the riboswitch aptamer. in the absence of c-di-gmp, the ribozyme mediates an alternative gtp attack that results in a truncated transcript (alternative gtp-attack product). using reporter assays in escherichia coli, we investigated the difference in gene expression between the spliced product and the alternative gtp-attack product. we provide evidence that cd3246 gene expression is activated  if allosteric ribozyme splicing creates a ribosome binding site (rbs) for translation from a uug start codon. in addition, biochemical and genetic analyses reveal that the riboswitch may further control cd3246 expression by revealing or  occluding this newly formed rbs. therefore, this architecture provides the riboswitch with a mechanism for extended regulation after splicing has occurred or as a backup mechanism for suppression of translation in the event of misregulated splicing.

TI  == relative frequency of health care-associated pathogens by infection site at a university hospital from 1980 to 2008.
AB  == background: we describe the relative frequency of health care-associated pathogens by infection site over 29 years using hospital-wide surveillance data from a large academic hospital. methods: comprehensive hospital-wide surveillance was provided by trained infection preventionists using centers for disease control and prevention definitions. five 5-year blocks and one 4-year block were  created for each site: bloodstream infections (bsi), urinary tract infections (uti), respiratory tract infections (rti), and surgical site infections (ssi). the blocks of relative frequency of health care-associated pathogens were compared by chi(2) analysis, and trends for each pathogen were estimated by regression analysis. results: at least 1 pathogen was isolated from 28,208 (83.5%) of 33,797 health care-associated infections (hai). staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), enterococcus species, and clostridium difficile and other anaerobes significantly increased, whereas escherichia coli,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella species, enterobacter species, and other streptococci significantly decreased in the relative proportion of pathogens during the study period. by infection site, results showed significant increasing trends of s aureus in uti, rti, and ssi; cons in bsi and ssi; candida in ssi; and enterococcus in bsi and uti. conclusion: significant changes in relative frequency of health care-associated pathogens by infection site occurred over the 29-year period. these findings have implications for implementation of infection  prevention strategies.

TI  == trends in antimicrobial resistance in intensive care units in the united states.
AB  == purpose of review: antimicrobial resistance and a paucity of new antimicrobial agents are ongoing challenges. this review focuses on the major epidemiologic trends and novel treatments, when available, for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, clostridium difficile, and multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli in the united states during 2010-2011. recent findings: mrsa bloodstream infection rates have declined, primarily due to interventions aimed at decreasing vascular catheter infections. the proportion of mrsa due to the community-associated strain usa300  continues to increase. recent studies of active surveillance and contact isolation for mrsa prevention provide conflicting views of efficacy. two novel treatments for recurrent c. difficile infection, monoclonal antibodies and fidaxomicin, show promising results. antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative bacilli has become widespread; extended-spectrum beta-lactamases are now commonly found among escherichia coli causing community-acquired infections in the united  states. klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases have spread beyond the northeast, and the new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase has been reported in multiple countries  within a few years of its discovery. summary: antimicrobial resistance, particularly among gram-negative bacilli, continues to increase at a rapid rate.  given the frequent transfer of patients between outpatient and acute care settings, as well as between different geographic regions, coordinated infection  control interventions are warranted.

TI  == antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from nunavik collections of the macroalgae fucus evanescens c. agardh (fucaceae).
AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga fucus evanescens in cell culture. accessions were collected on the arctic coast of ungava bay, nunavik, quebec. the crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against hemophilus influenzae , legionella pneumophila , propionibacterium acnes (atcc and clinical isolate), and streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/ml. this algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , whereas bacillus cereus , escherichia coli , klebsiella pneumoniae , and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against propionibacterium acnes showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/ml. the main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl o-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/ml. therefore, the semipurified f. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.

TI  == bacteria as trigger for chronic gastrointestinal disorders.
AB  == apart from acute infections, microorganisms may also induce or perpetuate chronic inflammatory diseases and reversible or irreversible proliferation of various cells in the gastrointestinal tract (the extreme being adenocarcinoma and lymphoma). helicobacter pylori is not only involved in the pathogenesis of lymphoma and gastric adenocarcinoma. the steps and mechanisms of the carcinogenic process involve host predisposition, environmental factors, and strain virulence. the steps of lymphoma genesis include chronic inflammation, acquisition of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue in the stomach, proliferation of the b lymphocytes in an inflammatory context, acquisition of genetic anomalies and dysregulation of the nf-kappab pathway. the role of campylobacter jejuni in immunoproliferative small bowel disease has also been shown and eradication of this bacterium can cure the lymphoma at its early stage. the evidence for the role of some bacteria in colon cancer development is discussed. opportunistic pathogens are detected in the stools or mucosa of a proportion of subjects with crohn's disease. they include mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis, adherent invasive escherichia coli, and clostridium difficile. a dysbiosis has been repeatedly observed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. instability of the dominant microbiota and decreased biodiversity (especially in the firmicutes  phylum) are major characteristics. the decrease of faecalibacterium prausnitzii seems to have a prognostic value to predict relapse of crohn's disease after surgery. finally, important perspectives are opened by new tools such as metagenomics and metabolomics of the gastrointestinal ecosystems. major tracks concern irritable bowel syndrome, colon cancer and obesity.

TI  == advantages and challenges of increased antimicrobial copper use and copper mining.
AB  == copper is a highly utilized metal for electrical, automotive, household objects,  and more recently as an effective antimicrobial surface. copper-containing solutions applied to fruits and vegetables can prevent bacterial and fungal infections. bacteria, such as salmonellae and cronobacter sakazakii, often found  in food contamination, are rapidly killed on contact with copper alloys. the antimicrobial effectiveness of copper alloys in the healthcare environment against bacteria causing hospital-acquired infections such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), escherichia coli o157:h7, and clostridium difficile has been described recently. the use of copper and copper-containing materials will continue to expand and may lead to an increase in copper mining and production. however, the copper mining and manufacturing industry and the consumer do not necessarily enjoy a favorable relationship. open pit mining, copper mine tailings, leaching products, and deposits of toxic metals in the environment often raises concerns and sometimes public outrage. in addition, consumers may fear that copper alloys utilized as antimicrobial surfaces in food production will lead to copper toxicity in humans. therefore, there is a need to mitigate some of the negative effects of increased copper use  and copper mining. more thermo-tolerant, copper ion-resistant microorganisms could improve copper leaching and lessen copper groundwater contamination. copper ion-resistant bacteria associated with plants might be useful in biostabilization and phytoremediation of copper-contaminated environments. in this review, recent  progress in microbiological and biotechnological aspects of microorganisms in contact with copper will be presented and discussed, exploring their role in the  improvement for the industries involved as well as providing better environmental outcomes.

TI  == infectious diseases in the critically ill patients.
AB  == infection is common in the critically ill and often results due to the severity of the patient's illness. recent data suggest 51% of intensive care unit (icu) patients are infected, and 71% receive antimicrobial therapy. bacterial infection is the primary concern, although some fungal infections are opportunistic. infection more than doubles the icu mortality rate, and the costs associated with infection may be as high as 40% of total icu expenditures. there are many contemporary antimicrobial resistance concerns that the critical care clinician must consider in managing the pharmacotherapy of infection. methicillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin resistance in enterococci, beta-lactamase resistance in enterobacteriaceae, multidrug resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter species, fluoroquinolone resistance in escherichia coli, and fungal resistance are among the most common issues icu clinician's must face in managing infection. critical illness causes changes in pharmacokinetics that influence drug and dosing considerations. absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion may all be affected by the various disease states that define critical illness. several specific diseases are discussed, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, various fungal infections,  gastrointestinal infections due to clostridium difficile, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections. within each disease section, discussion includes causes and prevention strategies, microbiology, evidence-based guidelines, and important caveats.

TI  == assessing the efficacy of different microfibre cloths at removing surface micro-organisms associated with healthcare-associated infections.
AB  == this study investigated the ability of 10 different microfibre cloths to remove microbial contamination from three surfaces commonly found in hospital settings (stainless steel, furniture laminate and ceramic tile), under controlled laboratory conditions. tests were conducted using organisms known to cause healthcare-associated infections, i.e. meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), clostridium difficile (in spore form) and escherichia coli. for all the cloths tested, there was significant statistical evidence to suggest a difference in cleaning performance between them on first and single use (p<0.001). however,  the overall performance of the nine re-useable cloths did not differ in practice  with differences in log(1)(0) reductions of <1. the performance of the disposable microfibre cloth was notably worse. the performance of all cloths decreased with  repeated use on a succession of contaminated surfaces. after repeated washing, re-usable cloth performance improved at 75 washes, and reduced after 150 washes,  although, in most instances, performance after 150 washes was better than at first wash. for all cloths, price was not an indication of performance. based on  these laboratory findings, it is concluded that use of the microfibre cloths investigated is an effective way to reduce the levels of mrsa, e. coli and c. difficile (in spore form) on a range of surfaces found in the clinical environment and could therefore be of benefit to these environments.

TI  == c-di-gmp turn-over in clostridium difficile is controlled by a plethora of diguanylate cyclases and phosphodiesterases.
AB  == clostridium difficile infections have become a major healthcare concern in the last decade during which the emergence of new strains has underscored this bacterium's capacity to cause persistent epidemics. c-di-gmp is a bacterial second messenger regulating diverse bacterial phenotypes, notably motility and biofilm formation, in proteobacteria such as vibrio cholerae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella. c-di-gmp is synthesized by diguanylate cyclases (dgcs) that contain a conserved ggdef domain. it is degraded by phosphodiesterases (pdes) that contain either an eal or an hd-gyp conserved domain. very little is known about the role of c-di-gmp in the regulation of phenotypes of gram-positive or fastidious bacteria. herein, we exposed the main components of c-di-gmp signalling in 20 genomes of c. difficile, revealed their prevalence, and predicted their enzymatic activity. ectopic expression of 31 of these conserved genes was carried out in v. cholerae to evaluate their effect on  motility and biofilm formation, two well-characterized phenotype alterations associated with intracellular c-di-gmp variation in this bacterium. most of the predicted dgcs and pdes were found to be active in the v. cholerae model. expression of truncated versions of cd0522, a protein with two ggdef domains and  one eal domain, suggests that it can act alternatively as a dgc or a pde. the activity of one purified dgc (cd1420) and one purified pde (cd0757) was confirmed by in vitro enzymatic assays. gtp was shown to be important for the pde activity  of cd0757. our results indicate that, in contrast to most gram-positive bacteria  including its closest relatives, c. difficile encodes a large assortment of functional dgcs and pdes, revealing that c-di-gmp signalling is an important and  well-conserved signal transduction system in this human pathogen.

TI  == therapeutic potential of egg yolk antibodies for treating clostridium difficile infection.
AB  == herein we present evidence for the therapeutic potential of colonization factor (cf)-specific egg yolk antibodies (igy) for potentially treating acute and recurring clostridium difficile infection (cdi) in humans. the study involved cloning, expressing as 6xhis-tagged proteins in escherichia coli, and ni-affinity purifying three previously identified cfs (flic, flid and cwp84) from c. difficile. the recombinant cf antigens were then used to immunize leghorn chickens and cf-specific igy antibodies were prepared from their eggs. the specificity and titre of the resulting c. difficile cf-specific igy antibodies were assessed by elisa and western immunoblotting techniques. the antibodies were also screened for their ability to inhibit c. difficile adherence to human colon-derived t84 cells, and, based on these findings, one of them (flid-specific igy) was evaluated for its potential to prevent c. difficile-mediated morbidity and mortality in syrian hamsters. the results revealed that purified flid-specific igy significantly protected hamsters from c. difficile strain 630 infection relative to control animals treated with carbonate buffer alone or igy  produced from unimmunized chicken eggs. the results suggest that egg yolk preparations obtained from chickens immunized with recombinant c. difficile cfs may represent another safe and cost-effective treatment option in humans suffering from acute or recurring cdi.

TI  == diversity and antimicrobial activity of pseudovibrio spp. from irish marine sponges.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the diversity and antimicrobial activity present among pseudovibrio spp. isolated from marine sponges. methods and results: seventy-three bacterial isolates from the marine sponges polymastia boletiformis, axinella dissimilis and haliclona simulans were identified as pseudovibrio spp. using phylogenetic analysis of 16s rrna gene sequences. genetic diversity among these isolates was estimated using random amplification of polymorphic dna (rapd), and 33 rapd types were identified among the 73 pseudovibrio isolates. these pseudovibrio spp. were assayed for the production of compounds with antimicrobial activity against various clinically relevant pathogens. sixty-two (85%) of the isolates showed activity against at least one of the pathogens tested, including escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and clostridium difficile. pcr screens of the pseudovibrio isolates also revealed the presence of potential  antibiotic-producing polyketide synthase genes. conclusions: marine sponges harbour a diverse population of pseudovibrio spp., the majority of which demonstrate antimicrobial activity. the identification of several different antimicrobial activity spectra suggests that the pseudovibrio isolates may produce a suite of antimicrobial compounds. significance and impact of the study: this is the first study in which an extended population of pseudovibrio isolates  from marine sponges has been analysed and establishes the little-studied pseudovibrio as a potentially important genus in the search for antimicrobial compounds of clinical relevance.

AB  == purpose: to explore selected factors related to the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (utis) in older adults. data sources: this review of the literature examined multiple studies regarding utis,  and utis in relation to silver-tipped catheters, cranberry juice/extract, and the bacterial lysate escherichia coli om-89. conclusions: silver-tipped catheters retarded the development of the biofilm. the use of cranberry juice/extract showed few if any adverse reactions and avoided the problems of induced antibiotic resistance or introduction to supra-infections, such as clostridium difficile infection. the immune stimulant om-89 shows promise and may lead to simple and inexpensive preventive measures. further research is needed to include elders, both men and women, and elders with long-term indwelling catheters. implications for practice: nurse practitioners (nps) can assure that basic nursing principles regarding long-term indwelling catheter care are upheld, measures such as proper assessment and insertion, as well as the appropriate use  of silver-tipped catheters. nps can prescribe cranberry juice/extract and incur no apparent harm while possibly reducing infection rate. nps must be aware of the dangers of administering prophylactic antibiotics that increase resistant microorganisms and can also increase susceptibility to c. difficile infection.

TI  == five commercial dna extraction systems tested and compared on a stool sample collection.
AB  == in this study, 5 different commercial dna extraction systems were tested on a stool sample collection containing 81 clinical stool specimens that were culture-positive for diarrheagenic escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, salmonella enterica, or clostridium difficile. the purified dnas were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) directed toward the relevant organisms. the results showed that conventional pcr combined with the extraction systems biorobot ez1 (qiagen, hilden, germany), bugs'n beads (genpoint, oslo, norway), chargeswitch (invitrogen, paisley, uk), qiaamp stool mini kit (qiagen), and 2 protocols (generic and specific a) for easymag (biomerieux, marcy i'etoile, france) were able to identify 89%, 62%, 85%, 88%, 85%, and 91%, respectively, of  the pathogens originally identified by conventional culture-based methods. when taqman pcr was combined with the easymag specific a protocol, 99% of the samples  were correctly identified. the results demonstrate that the extraction efficiencies can vary significantly among different extraction systems, careful optimization may have a significant positive effect, and the use of sensitive and specific detection methods like taqman pcr is an ideal choice for this type of analysis.

TI  == infectious diarrhea: cellular and molecular mechanisms.
AB  == diarrhea caused by enteric infections is a major factor in morbidity and mortality worldwide. an estimated 2-4 billion episodes of infectious diarrhea occur each year and are especially prevalent in infants. this review highlights the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying diarrhea associated with the three classes of infectious agents, i.e., bacteria, viruses and parasites. several bacterial pathogens have been chosen as model organisms, including vibrio cholerae as a classical example of secretory diarrhea, clostridium difficile and  shigella species as agents of inflammatory diarrhea and selected strains of pathogenic escherichia coli (e. coli) to discuss the recent advances in alteration of epithelial ion absorption. many of the recent studies addressing epithelial ion transport and barrier function have been carried out using viruses and parasites. here, we focus on the rapidly developing field of viral diarrhea including rotavirus, norovirus and astrovirus infections. finally we discuss giardia lamblia and entamoeba histolytica as examples of parasitic diarrhea. parasites have a greater complexity than the other pathogens and are capable of creating molecules similar to those produced by the host, such as serotonin and pge(2). the underlying mechanisms of infectious diarrhea discussed include alterations in ion transport and tight junctions as well as the virulence factors, which alter these processes either through direct effects or indirectly  through inflammation and neurotransmitters.

TI  == efficient expression and purification of methyltransferase in acetyl-coenzyme a synthesis pathway of the human pathogen clostridium difficile.
AB  == the wood-ljungdahl pathway is responsible for acetyl-coa biosynthesis and used as a major mean of generating energy for growth in some anaerobic microbes. series of genes, from the anaerobic human pathogen clostridium difficile, have been identified that show striking similarity to the genes involved in this pathway including methyltetrahydrofolate- and corrinoid-dependent methyltransferase. this methyltransferase plays a central role in this pathway that transfers the methyl  group from methyltetrahydrofolate to a cob(i)amide center in the corrinoid iron-sulfur protein. in this study, we developed two efficient expression and purification methods for methyltransferase from c. difficile for the first time with two expression vectors mbpht-mcherry2 and petduet-1, respectively. using the latter vector, more than 50mg metr was produced per liter luria-bertani broth media. the recombinant methyltransferase was well characterized by sds-page, gel  filtration chromatography, enzyme assay and far-uv circular dichroism (cd). furthermore, a highly effective approach was established for determining the methyl transfer activity of the methyltetrahydrofolate- and cobalamin-dependent methyltransferase using exogenous cobalamin as a substrate by stopped-flow method. these results will provide a solid basis for further study of the methyltransferase and the wood-ljungdahl pathway.

AB  == to unravel the profile of intestinal microecological parameters in chinese patients with asymptomatic carriage of hepatitis b virus (hbv), chronic hepatitis b, decompensated hbv cirrhosis, and health controls and to establish their correlation with liver disease progression, we performed quantitative pcr and immunological techniques to investigate fecal parameters, including population of fecal predominant bacteria and the abundance of some virulence genes derived from escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and clostridium perfringens in fecal crude dna and some immunological parameters in extracts of all fecal samples. data analysis indicated that 16s rrna gene copy numbers for faecalibacterium prausnitzii, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacteriaceae, bifidobacteria, and lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella) showed marked variation in the intestine of hbv cirrhotic patients. the bifidobacteria/enterobacteriaceae (b/e) ratio, which may  indicate microbial colonization resistance of the bowel, was decreased significantly in turn from 1.15 +/- 0.11 in healthy controls, 0.99 +/- 0.09 in asymptomatic carriers, and 0.76 +/- 0.08 in patients with chronic hepatitis b to  0.64 +/- 0.09 in patients with decompensated hbv cirrhosis (for all, p < 0.01). this suggests that b/e ratio is useful for following the level of intestinal microecological disorder in the course of liver disease progression. the data for virulence gene abundance suggested increased diversity of virulence factors during liver disease progression. fecal secretory iga and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in decompensated hbv cirrhotic patients were present at higher levels than in other groups, which indicates that a complicated autoregulatory system tries to achieve a new intestinal microecological balance.

TI  == use of antibacterial prophylaxis for patients with neutropenia. australian consensus guidelines 2011 steering committee.
AB  == the use of oral prophylactic antibiotics in patients with neutropenia is controversial and not recommended by this group because of a lack of evidence showing a reduction in mortality and concerns that such practice promotes antimicrobial resistance. recent evidence has demonstrated non-significant but consistent, improvement in all-cause mortality when fluoroquinolones (fqs) are used as primary prophylaxis. however, the consensus was that this evidence was not strong enough to recommend prophylaxis. the evidence base for fq prophylaxis  is presented alongside current consensus opinion to guide the appropriate and judicious use of these agents. due consideration is given to patient risk, as it  pertains to specific patient populations, as well as the net effect on selective  pressure from antibiotics if fq prophylaxis is routinely used in a target population. the potential costs and consequences of emerging fq resistance, particularly among escherichia coli, clostridium difficile and gram-positive organisms, are considered. as fq prophylaxis has been advocated in some chemotherapy protocols, specific regard is given to whether fq prophylaxis should be used to support these regimens. the group also provides recommendations for monitoring and surveillance of emerging resistance in those centres that have adopted fq prophylaxis.

TI  == comparative genome-wide analysis of small rnas of major gram-positive pathogens:  from identification to application.
AB  == in the recent years, the number of drug- and multi-drug-resistant microbial strains has increased rapidly. therefore, the need to identify innovative approaches for development of novel anti-infectives and new therapeutic targets is of high priority in global health care. the detection of small rnas (srnas) in bacteria has attracted considerable attention as an emerging class of new gene expression regulators. several experimental technologies to predict srna have been established for the gram-negative model organism escherichia coli. in many respects, srna screens in this model system have set a blueprint for the global and functional identification of srnas for gram-positive microbes, but the functional role of srnas in colonization and pathogenicity for listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficile is almost completely unknown. here, we report  the current knowledge about the srnas of these socioeconomically relevant gram-positive pathogens, overview the state-of-the-art high-throughput srna screening methods and summarize bioinformatics approaches for genome-wide srna identification and target prediction. finally, we discuss the use of modified peptide nucleic acids (pnas) as a novel tool to inactivate potential srna and their applications in rapid and specific detection of pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == use of a continuous culture fermentation system to investigate the effect of ganedenbc30 (bacillus coagulans gbi-30, 6086) supplementation on pathogen survival in the human gut microbiota.
AB  == single-stage continuous fermentation systems were employed to examine the effects of ganedenbc(30) supplementation on the human gastrointestinal microbiota in relation to pathogen challenge in vitro. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis  analysis demonstrated that ganedenbc(30) supplementation modified the microbial profiles in the fermentation systems compared with controls, with profiles clustering according to treatment. overall, ganedenbc(30) supplementation did not elicit major changes in bacterial population counts in vitro, although notably higher bcoa191 counts were seen following probiotic supplementation (compared to  the controls). pathogen challenge did not elicit significant modification of the  microbial counts in vitro, although notably higher clit135 counts were seen in the control system post-clostridium difficile challenge than in the corresponding ganedenbc(30)-supplemented systems. sporulation appears to be associated with the anti-microbial activity of ganedenbc(30), suggesting that a bi-modal lifecycle of ganedenbc(30)in vivo may lead to anti-microbial activity in distal regions of the gastrointestinal tract.

AB  == rifamycin sv is a broad-spectrum, poorly absorbed antimicrobial agent that, when  coupled with mmx technology, is being targeted for the oral treatment of traveler's diarrhea (td) and clostridium difficile-associated disease (cdad). rifamycin sv was tested for activity against 911 td-associated enteropathogens and 30 c. difficile isolates collected from several global surveillance studies.  rifamycin sv demonstrated similar antimicrobial activity levels against the enterobacteriaceae, with mic(5)(0) values ranging from 32 to 128 mug/ml for all but one strain (an enterotoxigenic escherichia coli at >512 mug/ml). for non-enterobacteriaceae strains, mic(5)(0) values ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml, with  the exception of campylobacter spp., for which all strains had mic values of >512 mug/ml. rifamycin sv also demonstrated excellent activity (mic(5)(0) of </= 0.03  mug/ml) against most c. difficile strains (including one hypervirulent nap1 strain), and this activity was even superior to the potency observed for vancomycin, metronidazole, and rifaximin. in mutational passaging studies, rifamycin sv induced stable resistance and showed a mutation frequency in e. coli similar to that of rifampin. this study presents the potency of rifamycin sv for  enteropathogens commonly recovered from patients with td and cdad. additional in  vitro and in vivo studies appear necessary to determine the utility of rifamycin  sv as an oral agent for the prevention and treatment of td and cdad.

TI  == the continuing crisis in antibiotic resistance.
AB  == the emergence of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens is an inevitable consequence of antibiotic use. despite repeated warnings, negligent antibiotic use and poor infection-control practice have led to the continuing development of extensive resistance problems worldwide. multidrug-resistant pathogens are now characterized by their heterogeneity, increasing virulence, resistance even to reserve agents and spread within and between hospitals and the community. examples are glycopeptide-resistant meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase- and carbapenemase-producing coliforms, and toxin-hyperproducing clostridium difficile. effective national and international programmes of control to combat these problems are urgently needed. the potential for success of such coordinated efforts has been demonstrated by the recent dramatic reductions in mrsa and c. difficile infections in england.

TI  == differential role of rho gtpases in intestinal epithelial barrier regulation in vitro.
AB  == maintenance of intestinal epithelial barrier functions is crucial to prevent systemic contamination by microbes that penetrate from the gut lumen. gtpases of  the rho-family such as rhoa, rac1, and cdc42 are known to be critically involved  in the regulation of intestinal epithelial barrier functions. however, it is still unclear whether inactivation or activation of these gtpases exerts barrier  protection or not. we tested the effects of rho gtpase activities on intestinal epithelial barrier functions by using the bacterial toxins cytotoxic necrotizing  factor 1 (cnf-1), toxin b, c3 transferase (c3 tf), and lethal toxin (lt) in an in vitro model of the intestinal epithelial barrier. incubation of cell monolayers with cnf-1 for 3 h induced exclusive activation of rhoa whereas rac1 and cdc42 activities were unchanged. as revealed by fitc-dextran flux and measurements of transepithelial electrical resistance (ter) intestinal epithelial permeability was significantly increased under these conditions. inhibition of rho kinase via  y27632 blocked barrier destabilization of cnf-1 after 3 h. in contrast, after 24  h of incubation with cnf-1 only rac1 and cdc42 but not rhoa were activated which  resulted in intestinal epithelial barrier stabilization. toxin b to inactivate rhoa, rac1, and cdc42 as well as rac1 inhibitor lt increased intestinal epithelial permeability. similar effects were observed after inhibition of rhoa/rho kinase signaling by c3 tf or y27632. taken together, these data demonstrate that both activation and inactivation of rhoa signaling increased paracellular permeability whereas activation of rac1 and cdc42 correlated with stabilized barrier functions.

AB  == background: a custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  rna probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and crohn's disease (cd) patients. methods: oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "goarray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16s rrna sequences. fecal 16s rdna  from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six cd patients were used as  template to generate fluorescently labeled crna that was hybridized to the microarray. differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with species-specific primer sets. results: the microarray analyses showed that eubacterium rectale, bacteroides fragilis group, b. vulgatus, ruminococcus albus, r. callidus, r. bromii, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the cd patients, while enterococcus sp., clostridium difficile, escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, and listeria sp. were more abundant in the cd group. conclusions: the microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. in addition, the microarray showed that enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the cd patients. this microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == characterization of the membrane-targeting c1 domain in pasteurella multocida toxin.
AB  == pasteurella multocida toxin (pmt) is a virulence factor responsible for the pathogenesis of some forms of pasteurellosis. the toxin activates g(q)- and g(12/13)-dependent pathways through the deamidation of a glutamine residue in the alpha-subunit of heterotrimeric gtpases. we recently reported the crystal structure of the c terminus (residues 575-1285) of pmt (c-pmt), which is composed of three domains (c1, c2, and c3), and that the c1 domain is involved in the localization of c-pmt to the plasma membrane, and the c3 domain possesses a cysteine protease-like catalytic triad. in this study, we analyzed the membrane-targeting function of the c1 domain in detail. the c1 domain consists of seven helices of which the first four (residues 590-670), showing structural similarity to the n terminus of clostridium difficile toxin b, were found to be involved in the recruitment of c-pmt to the plasma membrane. c-pmt lacking these  helices (c-pmt deltac1(4h)) neither localized to the plasma membrane nor stimulated the g(q/12/13)-dependent signaling pathways. when the membrane-targeting property was complemented by a peptide tag with an n-myristoylation motif, c-pmt deltac1(4h) recovered the pmt activity. direct binding between the c1 domain and liposomes containing phospholipids was evidenced by surface plasmon resonance analyses. these results indicate that the  c1 domain of c-pmt functions as a targeting signal for the plasma membrane.

AB  == clostridium difficile (cd), salmonella, campylobacter and enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) are major causes of morbidity in a variety of enteric diseases in humans and animals, but subclinical carriage in both is probably more common than are clinical cases. little is known regarding the prevalence of these pathogens in animals raised for exhibit at michigan county fairs or the frequency with which michigan citizens raising these animals may have been subclinically colonized. to address these issues, 361 fecal specimens from 158 humans and 203 of their farm animals were cultured for cd, salmonella and campylobacter. additionally, 50 people and their cattle were tested for ehec. no ehec, salmonella or campylobacter were detected. however, 16 specimens (4.4%) were positive for cd: 13 humans, two horses and one pig. none of the farm animal specimens submitted by any of the 13 cd-positive humans were positive for cd. strain characterization [toxinotype, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge)] demonstrated that the human cd isolates were similar to what has been reported previously in the general us population. we conclude that horses and farm animals (cattle, sheep, goats and swine) at 1-2 months before market weight showed no evidence of wide-spread carriage of the common enteric pathogens, including the recently reported cd toxinotype v. these results provide no support to the hypothesis that 4-h members or others visiting county fair animal husbandry projects in these counties may be at increased risk for acquisition of cd, salmonella, campylobacter or ehec from animals.

TI  == changing antibiotic prophylaxis for transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies: are we putting our patients at risk?
AB  == objective: to evaluate whether changing antibiotic prophylaxis from quinolone to  penicillin antibiotics has affected infectious complication rates in those men undergoing transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (trusgpb). patients and  methods: this interventional study was designed to determine whether changing antibiotic prophylaxis had any bearing on developing serious infectious complications after taking trusgpb. as a secondary aim, we also investigated clostridium difficile (c. difficile) rates in the same groups of men undergoing trusgpb. men historically received ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally 1 h before their procedure followed by a 3-day course of 500 mg given twice daily (group a). due to increasing local patterns of antimicrobial resistance to quinolones and concerns regarding potential antibiotic induced c. difficile infection, antibiotic prophylaxis was changed to a penicillin-based regimen comprising of co-amoxiclav 625 mg given orally 1 h before trusgpb followed by a three times daily course for 3 days (group b). excluded from the study were those men given an alternative antibiotic prophylaxis than those given within the two distinct groups due to reasons of previous hypersensitivity reactions and/or clinical decision by the attending urologist. comparisons were made between the groups using two-tailed fisher's exact tests. results: in all, 119 and 110 men were identified in groups a and b, respectively. two men in group a (1.68%) developed  sepsis after trusgpb requiring hospital admission and intravenous antibiotic treatment. the sepsis rate in group b was significantly higher than that of group a (eight of 110, 7.27%; p = 0.036). escherichia coli was the only organism isolated from our cohort of patients. there were no incidences of c. difficile infections in either antibiotic prophylaxis groups. conclusion: ciprofloxacin appears to provide superior prophylaxis than co-amoxiclav in men undergoing trusgpb and was not associated with an increased risk of quinolone induced c. difficile infections. changing antibiotic prophylaxis from a quinolone-based regime may therefore be putting our patients at an increased risk of serious infectious complications after trusgpb.

TI  == expression, purification and cell cytotoxicity of actin-modifying binary toxin from clostridium difficile.
AB  == clostridium difficile infection (cdi) is a serious problem within the healthcare  environment where the bacterium causes symptoms ranging from mild diarrhoea to life-threatening colitis. in addition to its principal virulence factors, toxin a and toxin b, some c. difficile strains produce a binary toxin (cdt) composed of two sub-units namely cdta and cdtb that are produced and secreted from the cell as two separate polypeptides. once in the gut these fragments have the potential  to combine to form a potent cytotoxin whose role in the pathogenesis of cdi is presently unclear. here, we describe expression and purification methods for recombinant cdta and cdtb produced in escherichia coli. we show that purified cdta and cdtb can combine to form an active cdt which is cytotoxic to vero cells. in addition, the purification processes described will allow milligram quantities of binary toxin fragments to be produced for further functional and structural studies.

TI  == the enteropathogenic escherichia coli effector nleh inhibits apoptosis induced by clostridium difficile toxin b.
AB  == clostridium difficile is a leading cause of nosocomial infections, causing a spectrum of diseases ranging from diarrhoea to pseudomembranous colitis triggered by a range of virulence factors including c. difficile toxins a (tcda) and b (tcdb). tcda and tcdb are monoglucosyltransferases that irreversibly glycosylate  small rho gtpases, inhibiting their ability to interact with their effectors, guanine nucleotide exchange factors, and membrane partners, leading to disruption of downstream signalling pathways and cell death. in addition, tcdb targets the mitochondria, inducing the intrinsic apoptotic pathway resulting in tcdb-mediated apoptosis. modulation of apoptosis is a common strategy used by infectious agents. recently, we have shown that the enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) type iii secretion system effector nleh has a broad-range anti-apoptotic activity. in this study we examined the effects of nleh on cells challenged with  tcdb. during infection with wild-type epec, nleh inhibited tcdb-induced apoptosis at both low and high toxin concentrations. transfected nleh1 alone was sufficient to block tcdb-induced cell rounding, nuclear condensation, mitochondrial swelling and lysis, and activation of caspase-3. these results show that nleh acts via a global anti-apoptotic pathway.

TI  == the antimicrobial compound reuterin (3-hydroxypropionaldehyde) induces oxidative  stress via interaction with thiol groups.
AB  == reuterin is an antimicrobial compound produced by lactobacillus reuteri, and has  been proposed to mediate, in part, the probiotic health benefits ascribed to this micro-organism. despite 20 years of investigation, the mechanism of action by which reuterin exerts its antimicrobial effects has remained elusive. here we provide evidence that reuterin induces oxidative stress in cells, most likely by  modifying thiol groups in proteins and small molecules. escherichia coli cells subjected to sublethal levels of reuterin expressed a set of genes that overlapped with the set of genes composing the oxyr regulon, which senses and responds to various forms of oxidative stress. e. coli cells mutated for oxyr were more sensitive to reuterin compared with wild-type cells, further supporting a role for reuterin in exerting oxidative stress. the addition of cysteine to e.  coli or clostridium difficile growth media prior to exposure to reuterin suppressed the antimicrobial effect of reuterin on these bacteria. interestingly, interaction with e. coli stimulated reuterin production or secretion by l. reuteri, indicating that contact with other microbes in the gut increases reuterin output. thus, reuterin inhibits bacterial growth by modifying thiol groups, which indicates that reuterin negatively affects a large number of cellular targets.

TI  == antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in animals and man: prescribing, practices and  policies.
AB  == this meeting focused on infections in humans and animals due to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing bacteria and clostridium difficile, and their corresponding treatments. mrsa is predominantly a human pathogen, and molecular typing has revealed that certain clones have spread widely both between humans and from humans to animals. esbl-producing bacteria, particularly those that express the ctx-m beta-lactamases, have been disseminated worldwide. whilst such  strains are usually isolated from humans, some animal isolates also produce ctx-m enzymes. in humans, one clone of ctx-m-producing escherichia coli, sequence type  (st)131, has been particularly successful. c. difficile, often ribotype 027, commonly colonizes the hospital environment and causes serious infections in humans. in animals, ribotype 078 is more often found, and is an important cause of diarrhoea in piglets. there is a concern that the numbers of mrsa or other antimicrobial-resistant bacteria might increase further when human isolates become established in animals, as this can amplify the numbers of such bacteria by dissemination within animal groups with subsequent spread back to humans. certain antimicrobials have been implicated in the selection of mrsa, esbl-producing bacteria and predisposition to infection by c. difficile. guidelines for treatment and prevention of infections by mrsa, esbl-producing bacteria and c. difficile were discussed and evidence-based policies were recommended for both humans and animals.

AB  == dermatomyositis is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy that may be associated with malignancies. the technique of 18-f fluorodeoxyglucose (fdg)-positron emission tomography (pet) is an important tool to investigate underlying malignancy in patients with a possible paraneoplastic syndrome. we report two consecutive patients with dermatomyositis in whom 18-f fdg-pet revealed unsuspected infections. physicians should be aware that a positive 18-f fdg-pet is not specific for malignancy and may reveal other conditions including an infectious disorder.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteria resistant to metallic copper surfaces.
AB  == metallic copper alloys have recently attracted attention as a new antimicrobial weapon for areas where surface hygiene is paramount. currently it is not understood on a molecular level how metallic copper kills microbes, but previous  studies have demonstrated that a wide variety of bacteria, including escherichia  coli, staphylococcus aureus, and clostridium difficile, are inactivated within minutes or a few hours of exposure. in this study, we show that bacteria isolated from copper alloy coins comprise strains that are especially resistant against the toxic properties exerted by dry metallic copper surfaces. the most resistant  of 294 isolates were gram-positive staphylococci and micrococci, kocuria palustris, and brachybacterium conglomeratum but also included the proteobacterial species sphingomonas panni and pseudomonas oleovorans. cells of some of these bacterial strains survived on copper surfaces for 48 h or more. remarkably, when these dry-surface-resistant strains were exposed to moist copper surfaces, resistance levels were close to those of control strains and mics for copper ions were at or below control strain levels. this suggests that mechanisms conferring resistance against dry metallic copper surfaces in these newly isolated bacterial strains are different from well-characterized copper ion detoxification systems. furthermore, staphylococci on coins did not exhibit increased levels of resistance to antibiotics, arguing against coselection with copper surface resistance traits.

TI  == prevalence of diarrhea and enteropathogens in racing sled dogs.
AB  == background: diarrhea is highly prevalent in racing sled dogs, although the underlying causes are poorly understood. hypothesis: clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (cpe) and clostridium difficile toxin a and b are associated with diarrhea in racing sled dogs. animals: one hundred and thirty-five sled dogs. methods: freshly voided feces were obtained from 55 dogs before racing and from 80 dogs after 400 miles of racing. samples were visually scored for diarrhea, mucus, blood, and melena. cpe and c. difficile toxin a and b were detected by elisa. samples were cultured for c. perfringens, c. difficile, campylobacter, salmonella, and escherichia coli o157; giardia and cryptosporidium spp. were detected via immunofluorescence. results: diarrhea occurred in 36% of dogs during racing, and hematochezia, fecal mucus or melena, or all 3 occurred in 57.5% of dogs. salmonella was isolated from 78.2% of dogs before racing, and from 71.3% of dogs during racing. c. perfringens and c. difficile were isolated from 100 and 58.2% of dogs before racing, and from 95 and 36.3% of dogs during racing. dogs were more likely to test positive for cpe during than before racing (18.8 versus  5.5%, p = .021); however, no enteropathogens or their respective toxins were significantly associated with hematochezia or diarrhea. conclusions and clinical  importance: sled dogs participating in long distance racing have a high prevalence of diarrhea and hematochezia that is not associated with common enteropathogens. it is possible that diarrhea and hematochezia represent the effect of prolonged exercise on the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == development of a dna microarray to detect antimicrobial resistance genes identified in the national center for biotechnology information database.
AB  == to understand the mechanisms and epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance (ar), the genetic elements responsible must be identified. due to the myriad of possible genes, a high-density genotyping technique is needed for initial screening. to achieve this, ar genes in the national center for biotechnology information genbank database were identified by their annotations and compiled into a nonredundant list of 775 genes. a dna microarray was constructed of 70mer  oligonucelotide probes designed to detect these genes encoding resistances to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, chloramphenicols, glycopeptides, heavy metals, lincosamides, macrolides, metronidazoles, polyketides, quaternary ammonium compounds, streptogramins, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and trimethoprims as well as resistance transfer genes. the microarray was validated with two fully sequenced control strains of salmonella enterica: typhimurium lt2 (sensitive) and typhi ct18 (multidrug resistance [mdr]). all resistance genes encoded on the mdr  plasmid, phcm1, harbored by ct18 were detected in that strain, whereas no resistance genes were detected in lt2. the microarray was also tested with a variety of bacteria, including mdr salmonella enterica serovars, escherichia coli, campylobacter spp., enterococcus spp., methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, listeria spp., and clostridium difficile. the results presented here demonstrate that a microarray can be designed to detect virtually all ar genes found in the national center for biotechnology information database, thus reducing the subsequent assays necessary to identify specific resistance gene alleles.

TI  == application of a novel decontamination process using gaseous ozone.
AB  == environmental disinfection in a health care setting is an important aspect of infection control. recently, there has been interest in the use of vapor- and gas-based treatments for decontamination of surfaces and rooms. we describe preliminary results for an ozone-based decontamination of surfaces seeded with a  range of vegetative cells and spores of bacteria of clinical relevance. the efficacy of the approach for room sanitization was also assessed. the protocol included use of a quenching agent to rapidly reduce ozone concentrations to safe  levels allowing treatment times of less than 1 h for the majority of organisms tested. using bacteria seeded onto agar plates and solid surfaces, reductions in  bacterial load of greater than 3 log values were recorded for a number of organisms including escherichia coli and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. application of the process in a 30 m3 room showed similar reductions in viable counts for these organisms and for clostridium difficile spores. we suggest that the potential of this ozone-quench approach should be further evaluated for disinfection or decontamination of healthcare environments.

AB  == purpose of review: rifaximin is gaining attention for its potential activity in a multitude of gastrointestinal diseases. we review the unique pharmaceutical properties of this antibiotic and the published evidence in the literature regarding the use of rifaximin for different gastrointestinal disorders. recent findings: rifaximin is a gastrointestinal-selective antibiotic with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, an excellent safety profile, minimal drug interactions, and negligible impact on the intestinal microbiome. rifaximin is currently approved in the united states for the treatment of travelers' diarrhea  caused by noninvasive diarrheagenic escherichia coli and is approved in more than 30 other countries for a variety of gastrointestinal disorders. considerable research with this medication has been conducted for the treatment and prevention of travelers' diarrhea, the treatment of portal systemic encephalopathy, clostridium difficile infection, small bowel intestinal overgrowth, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, pouchitis, and colonic diverticular disease. summary: rifaximin is effective for the treatment of travelers' diarrhea and can be considered as the treatment of choice for uncomplicated travelers' diarrhea. when invasive travelers' diarrhea pathogens are suspected, an alternative antibiotic should be administered. rifaximin appears promising as a chemoprophylaxis for travelers' diarrhea and as a treatment of portal systemic encephalopathy. this antibiotic may be effective for other gastrointestinal diseases, but more well designed clinical studies are needed to confirm its efficacy for these off-label indications. future studies will determine whether the development of significant bacterial resistance will limit rifaximin use.

AB  == the growth-inhibiting activities of sinapis alba l. seed-derived materials were examined on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. longum, clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, escherichia coli, lactobacillus acidophilus, and l. casei. the active component of s. alba seeds was purified using silica gel column chromatography and hplc and was identified as phenethyl isothiocyanate by various spectroscopic analyses. the antimicrobial activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate varied according to the dose and bacterial strain tested. phenethyl isothiocyanate strongly inhibited the growth of c. difficile and c. perfringens at 1 mg/disc, and weakly (+) inhibited its growth at 0.1 mg/disc. furthermore, phenethyl isothiocyanate moderately (++) inhibited the growth of e. coli at a dose of 2 mg/disc, but did not inhibit the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. addition of various functional groups to isothiocyanates resulted in selective inhibitory activity against harmful bacteria with low concentrations of aromatic isothiocyanates demonstrating greater inhibitory activity against clostridia and e. coli than aliphatic isothiocyanates. in conclusion, aromatic isothiocyanates containing phenethyl-, benzyl-, and benzoyl-groups might be useful in the development of novel preventive and therapeutic agents against diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.

TI  == bacteriophage-mediated toxin gene regulation in clostridium difficile.
AB  == clostridium difficile has been identified as the most important single identifiable cause of nosocomial antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis. virulent strains of c. difficile produce two large protein toxins, toxin a and toxin b, which are involved in pathogenesis. in this study, we examined the effect of lysogeny by phicd119 on c. difficile toxin production. transcriptional  analysis demonstrated a decrease in the expression of pathogenicity locus (paloc) genes tcda, tcdb, tcdr, tcde, and tcdc in phicd119 lysogens. during this study we found that repr, a putative repressor gene of phicd119, was expressed in c. difficile lysogens and that its product, repr, could downregulate tcda::gusa and  tcdr::gusa reporter fusions in escherichia coli. we cloned and purified a recombinant repr containing a c-terminal six-his tag and documented its binding to the upstream regions of tcdr in c. difficile paloc and in repr upstream region in phicd119 by gel shift assays. dna footprinting experiments revealed similarities between the repr binding sites in tcdr and repr upstream regions. these findings suggest that presence of a cd119-like temperate phage can influence toxin gene regulation in this nosocomially important pathogen.

TI  == enteric bacterial pathogen detection in southern sea otters (enhydra lutris nereis) is associated with coastal urbanization and freshwater runoff.
AB  == although protected for nearly a century, california's sea otters have been slow to recover, in part due to exposure to fecally-associated protozoal pathogens like toxoplasma gondii and sarcocystis neurona. however, potential impacts from exposure to fecal bacteria have not been systematically explored. using selective media, we examined feces from live and dead sea otters from california for specific enteric bacterial pathogens (campylobacter, salmonella, clostridium perfringens, c. difficile and escherichia coli o157:h7), and pathogens endemic to the marine environment (vibrio cholerae, v. parahaemolyticus and plesiomonas shigelloides). we evaluated statistical associations between detection of these pathogens in otter feces and demographic or environmental risk factors for otter  exposure, and found that dead otters were more likely to test positive for c. perfringens, campylobacter and v. parahaemolyticus than were live otters. otters  from more urbanized coastlines and areas with high freshwater runoff (near outflows of rivers or streams) were more likely to test positive for one or more  of these bacterial pathogens. other risk factors for bacterial detection in otters included male gender and fecal samples collected during the rainy season when surface runoff is maximal. similar risk factors were reported in prior studies of pathogen exposure for california otters and their invertebrate prey, suggesting that land-sea transfer and/or facilitation of pathogen survival in degraded coastal marine habitat may be impacting sea otter recovery. because otters and humans share many of the same foods, our findings may also have implications for human health.

AB  == background: saccharomyces boulardii, a well-studied probiotic, can be effective in inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases with diverse pathophysiology, such as inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), and bacterially mediated or enterotoxin-mediated diarrhoea and inflammation. aim: to discuss the mechanisms of action involved in the intestinal anti-inflammatory action of s. boulardii. methods: review of the literature related to the anti-inflammatory effects of this probiotic. results: several mechanisms of action have been identified directed against the host and pathogenic microorganisms. s. boulardii and s. boulardii secreted-protein(s) inhibit production of proinflammatory cytokines by  interfering with the global mediator of inflammation nuclear factor kappab, and modulating the activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinases erk1/2 and p38.  s. boulardii activates expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (ppar-gamma) that protects from gut inflammation and ibd. s. boulardii also suppresses 'bacteria overgrowth' and host cell adherence, releases a protease that cleaves c. difficile toxin a and its intestinal receptor and stimulates antibody production against toxin a. recent results indicate that s. boulardii may interfere with ibd pathogenesis by trapping t cells in mesenteric lymph nodes. conclusions: the multiple anti-inflammatory mechanisms exerted by s. boulardii provide molecular explanations supporting its effectiveness in intestinal inflammatory states.

TI  == a novel genetic switch controls phase variable expression of cwpv, a clostridium  difficile cell wall protein.
AB  == clostridium difficile is a nosocomial pathogen that can cause severe gastrointestinal infections. c. difficile encodes a family of cell wall proteins, some of which are implicated in pathogenesis. here we have characterized cwpv, the largest member of this family. cwpv is surface expressed and post-translationally processed in a manner analogous to the major s-layer protein slpa. expression of cwpv is phase variable, with approximately 5% of cells in a population expressing the protein under standard laboratory growth conditions. upstream of cwpv, inverted repeats flank a 195 bp sequence which undergoes dna inversion. use of a gusa transcriptional reporter demonstrated that phase variation is mediated by dna inversion; in one orientation cwpv is expressed while in the opposite orientation the gene is silent. the inversion region contains neither the promoter nor any of the open reading frame, therefore this system differs from previously described phase variation mechanisms. the cwpv promoter is located upstream of the inversion region and we propose a model of phase variation based on intrinsic terminator formation in the off transcript. a  c. difficile site-specific recombinase able to catalyse the inversion has been identified.

TI  == inhibition of cytokinesis by clostridium difficile toxin b and cytotoxic necrotizing factors--reinforcing the critical role of rhoa in cytokinesis.
AB  == low molecular weight gtp-binding proteins of the rho family control the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells. rhoa governs the formation of actin stress fibers and is responsible for the formation of the contractile ring in cytokinesis. cytokinesis completion requires rhoa inactivation resulting in disassembly of the contractile ring. cytokinesis thus requires switching of rhoa activity. this switch of rhoa activity is blocked by rho-modifying bacterial protein toxins that either activate or inactivate rhoa by covalent modifications. exoenzyme c3 from clostridium limosum (c3-lim) and clostridium difficile toxin b (tcdb) inactivate rhoa by mono-adp-ribosylation and mono-glucosylation, respectively. cytotoxic necrotizing factors (cnf), produced by either yersinia pseudotuberculosis (cnfy) or uropathogenic strains of e. coli  (cnf1), deamidate and thereby activate rhoa. this study provides evidence that rhoa-activating as well as rhoa-inactivating toxins cause inhibition of cytokinesis and cell division. the toxins' effects on cytokinesis were analyzed in hela cells synchronized using the thymidine double block technique. treatment  of g2-phase cells with either the rhoa-activating cnfy or cnf1 or the rhoa-inactivating c3-lim or tcdb resulted in cytokinesis inhibition, as evidenced by the formation of a 4n population on flow cytometry, the inhibition of contractile ring formation, and the formation of bi-nucleated cells. while tcdb and cnf1 modify a broad-spectrum of rho proteins, c3-lim and cnfy specifically target rhoa. since c3-lim and cnfy both caused cytokinesis inhibition, our study  re-inforces the critical role of rhoa (not rac1 or cdc42) in cytokinesis and cell division.

AB  == studies of microbial pathogens and the toxins they produce are important for determining the mechanisms by which they cause disease and spread throughout a population. some bacteria produce secretory enterotoxins (such as cholera toxin or the heat-labile or stable enterotoxins produced by escherichia coli) that invade cells directly. others invade cells or produce cytotoxins (such as those produced by shigella, enteroinvasive e coli, or clostridium difficile) that damage cells or trigger host responses that cause small or large bowel diseases (such as enteroaggregative or enteropathogenic e coli or salmonella). viruses (such as noroviruses and rotaviruses) and protozoa (such as cryptosporidium, giardia, or entamoeba histolytica) disrupt cell functions and cause short- or long-term disease. much epidemiologic data about these pathogens have been collected from community- and hospital-acquired settings, as well as from patients with traveler's or persistent diarrhea. these studies have led to practical approaches for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

AB  == purpose of review: to summarize recent evidence on the role of intestinal bacteria in inflammatory bowel diseases, and of antibiotics and probiotics in their treatment. the implications connected with the use of antibiotics are also  examined. recent findings: the hypothesis that mycobacterium paratuberculosis could be a causative agent of crohn's disease has not been confirmed by a large trial on symptomatic patients treated by a combination of antibiotics active against this bacterium. an increased number of adherent-invasive escherichia coli have been found in the intestinal tissue of patients with crohn's disease, but their role in the pathogenesis of this condition remains to be defined. the combination of metronidazole and azathioprine, associating the effects of a reduced bacterial load with immunosuppression, appears to be a therapeutic option to decrease the recurrence of postoperative crohn's disease in high-risk patients. however, concerns are raised by the possibility that antibiotics may induce disease relapse due to clostridium difficile infection. summary: recent literature provides increasing support for the use of antibiotics in crohn's disease, although the side effects limit their long-term use. the efficacy of antibiotics in ulcerative colitis is not confirmed by the available literature, except in severe colitis. more trials are needed to support the use of probiotics as therapy in inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  == auranofin disrupts selenium metabolism in clostridium difficile by forming a stable au-se adduct.
AB  == clostridium difficile is a nosocomial pathogen whose incidence and importance are on the rise. previous work in our laboratory characterized the central role of selenoenzyme-dependent stickland reactions in c. difficile metabolism. in this work we have identified, using mass spectrometry, a stable complex formed upon reaction of auranofin (a gold-containing drug) with selenide in vitro. x-ray absorption spectroscopy supports the structure that we proposed on the basis of mass-spectrometric data. auranofin potently inhibits the growth of c. difficile but does not similarly affect other clostridia that do not utilize selenoproteins to obtain energy. moreover, auranofin inhibits the incorporation of radioisotope  selenium ((75)se) in selenoproteins in both escherichia coli, the prokaryotic model for selenoprotein synthesis, and c. difficile without impacting total protein synthesis. auranofin blocks the uptake of selenium and results in the accumulation of the auranofin-selenide adduct in the culture medium. addition of  selenium in the form of selenite or l-selenocysteine to the growth medium significantly reduces the inhibitory action of auranofin on the growth of c. difficile. on the basis of these results, we propose that formation of this complex and the subsequent deficiency in available selenium for selenoprotein synthesis is the mechanism by which auranofin inhibits c. difficile growth. this  study demonstrates that targeting selenium metabolism provides a new avenue for antimicrobial development against c. difficile and other selenium-dependent pathogens.

TI  == mucin dynamics in intestinal bacterial infection.
AB  == background: bacterial gastroenteritis causes morbidity and mortality in humans worldwide. murine citrobacter rodentium infection is a model for gastroenteritis  caused by the human pathogens enteropathogenic escherichia coli and enterohaemorrhagic e. coli. mucin glycoproteins are the main component of the first barrier that bacteria encounter in the intestinal tract. methodology/principal findings: using immunohistochemistry, we investigated intestinal expression of mucins (alcian blue/pas, muc1, muc2, muc4, muc5ac, muc13 and muc3/17) in healthy and c. rodentium infected mice. the majority of the c. rodentium infected mice developed systemic infection and colitis in the mid and distal colon by day 12. c. rodentium bound to the major secreted mucin, muc2, in  vitro, and high numbers of bacteria were found in secreted muc2 in infected animals in vivo, indicating that mucins may limit bacterial access to the epithelial surface. in the small intestine, caecum and proximal colon, the mucin  expression was similar in infected and non-infected animals. in the distal colonic epithelium, all secreted and cell surface mucins decreased with the exception of the muc1 cell surface mucin which increased after infection (p<0.05). similarly, during human infection salmonella st paul, campylobacter jejuni and clostridium difficile induced muc1 in the colon. conclusion: major changes in both the cell-surface and secreted mucins occur in response to intestinal infection.

TI  == mass spectrometric analysis of the s-layer proteins from clostridium difficile demonstrates the absence of glycosylation.
AB  == like many other bacterial cell surfaces, the cell wall of clostridium difficile is also encapsulated by a proteinaceous paracrystalline layer, the surface (s)-layer. in many bacterial species, the s-layer proteins (slps) have been shown to be glycosylated, whereas in other species glycosylation is absent. unusually,  the s-layer of c. difficile is composed of two distinct proteins, the high-molecular weight (hmw) and low-molecular-weight (lmw) slps. previous investigations have reported that one or both of these slps are glycosylated, though no definitive study has been conducted. we have used a variety of mass spectrometric approaches to analyse slps from a number of strains of c. difficile for the presence of associated glycans. analysis of intact slps by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation time of flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry demonstrated that the observed molecular masses matched the predicted masses of the lmw and hmw slps. furthermore, analysis of cyanogen bromide (cnbr) and tryptic peptides displayed no evidence of post-translational modification. in the first in-depth study of its kind, we unequivocally demonstrate that the s-layer proteins from the c. difficile strains investigated are not glycosylated.

TI  == reduction in infection risk through treatment of microbially contaminated surfaces with a novel, portable, saturated steam vapor disinfection system.
AB  == background: surface-mediated infectious disease transmission is a major concern in various settings, including schools, hospitals, and food-processing facilities. chemical disinfectants are frequently used to reduce contamination, but many pose significant risks to humans, surfaces, and the environment, and all must be properly applied in strict accordance with label instructions to be effective. this study set out to determine the capability of a novel chemical-free, saturated steam vapor disinfection system to kill microorganisms,  reduce surface-mediated infection risks, and serve as an alternative to chemical  disinfectants. methods: high concentrations of escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), salmonella enterica, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, ms2 coliphage (used as a surrogate for nonenveloped viruses including norovirus), candida albicans, aspergillus niger, and the endospores of clostridium difficile were dried individually onto porous clay test surfaces. surfaces were treated with the saturated steam vapor disinfection system for brief periods and then numbers of surviving microorganisms were determined. infection risks were calculated from the kill-time data using microbial dose-response relationships published in the scientific literature, accounting for surface-to-hand and hand-to-mouth transfer efficiencies. results:  a diverse assortment of pathogenic microorganisms was rapidly killed by the steam disinfection system; all of the pathogens tested were completely inactivated within 5 seconds. risks of infection from the contaminated surfaces decreased rapidly with increasing periods of treatment by the saturated steam vapor disinfection system. conclusions: the saturated steam vapor disinfection system tested for this study is chemical-free, broadly active, rapidly efficacious, and  therefore represents a novel alternative to liquid chemical disinfectants.

TI  == mechanisms of infectious diarrhea.
AB  == infectious diarrhea is an important public health problem worldwide. research has provided new insights into the mechanisms of diarrhea caused by various pathogens that are classified as noninflammatory, inflammatory or invasive. these three groups of organisms cause two diarrheal syndromes--noninflammatory diarrhea and inflammatory diarrhea. the noninflammatory diarrheas are caused by enterotoxin-producing organisms such as vibrio cholerae and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, or by viruses that adhere to the mucosa and disrupt the absorptive and/or secretory processes of the enterocyte without causing acute inflammation or mucosal destruction. inflammatory diarrhea is caused by two groups of organisms--cytotoxin-producing, noninvasive bacteria (e.g. enteroaggregative escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli and clostridium difficile), or by invasive organisms (e.g. salmonella spp., shigella  spp., campylobacter spp., entamoeba histolytica). the cytotoxin-producing organisms adhere to the mucosa, activate cytokines and stimulate the intestinal mucosa to release inflammatory mediators. invasive organisms, which can also produce cytotoxins, invade the intestinal mucosa to induce an acute inflammatory  reaction, involving the activation of cytokines and inflammatory mediators. regardless of the underlying mechanism they use, these various types of pathogen  have all successfully evolved to evade and modulate the host defense systems. the mechanisms by which the different pathogens invade the host and cause infectious  diarrhea are the topic of this review.

AB  == dogs that participate in animal-assisted interventions (aais), often called 'therapy dogs', commonly interact with humans whose immune systems are not functioning optimally. the advisability of feeding raw meat (including poultry) to these animals remains a highly contentious issue, in spite of increasing evidence that raw meat is frequently contaminated with salmonella. we set out to  determine if consuming raw meat influences the risk of therapy dogs shedding salmonella and other pathogens. two hundred healthy therapy dogs from ontario and alberta were enrolled. between may 2005 and november 2006, fecal specimens were collected from each dog every 2 months for 1 year, along with a log of places visited, antimicrobial use within the home, dog health status and diet. specimens were cultured for salmonella, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), extended-spectrum cephalosporinase (esc)  escherichia coli and clostridium difficile. forty (20%) of the dogs were reported to have been fed raw meat at some point during the year. the incidence rate of salmonella shedding in the raw meat-fed dogs was 0.61 cases/dog-year, compared with 0.08 cases/dog-year in dogs that were not fed raw meat (p<0.001). controlling for therapy dog group, the repeated measures, and pig ear consumption and diarrhoea in the 2 months prior to specimen submission, dogs that consumed raw meat were significantly more likely to test positive for salmonella at least  once during the year than dogs that did not eat raw meat [odds ratio (or) 22.7; 95% confidence interval (ci) 3.1-58.8; p<0.001]. specific salmonella serovars were more common among dogs that consumed raw meat versus those that did not include s. typhimurium, s. heidelberg and s. kentucky. raw meat consumption was also significantly associated with shedding esc e. coli (or 17.2; 95% ci 9.4-32.3). no associations between c. difficile, mrsa or vre and consumption of raw meat were detected. we recommend that dogs fed raw meat should be excluded from aai programmes, particularly when the programmes involve interaction with humans at high risk of infection or adverse sequelae attributable to infection. furthermore, although aai dogs may not be representative of the general population of dogs, we also recommend that feeding of raw meat to dogs is to be avoided in homes where immunocompromised people live.

TI  == molecular characterization of a clostridium difficile bacteriophage and its cloned biologically active endolysin.
AB  == clostridium difficile infection is increasing in both frequency and severity, with the emergence of new highly virulent strains highlighting the need for more  rapid and effective methods of control. here, we show that bacteriophage endolysin can be used to inhibit and kill c. difficile. the genome sequence of a  novel bacteriophage that is active against c. difficile was determined, and the bacteriophage endolysin gene was subcloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the partially purified endolysin was active against 30 diverse strains of c. difficile, and importantly, this group included strains of the major epidemic ribotype 027 (b1/nap1). in contrast, a range of commensal species that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract, including several representatives of the clostridium-like firmicutes, were insensitive to the endolysin. this endolysin provides a platform for the generation of both therapeutic and detection systems  to combat the c. difficile problem. to investigate a method for the protected delivery and production of the lysin in the gastrointestinal tract, we demonstrated the expression of active cd27l endolysin in the lactic acid bacterium lactococcus lactis mg1363.

TI  == fluoroquinolone resistance in clostridium difficile isolates from a prospective study of c. difficile infections in europe.
AB  == the european study group on clostridium difficile (esgcd) conducted a prospective study in 2005 to monitor and characterize c. difficile strains circulating in european hospitals, collecting 411 isolates. eighty-three of these isolates, showing resistance or intermediate resistance to moxifloxacin (mx), were selected for this study to assess susceptibility to other fluoroquinolones (fqs) and to analyse the gyr genes, encoding the dna gyrase subunits gyra and gyrb. twenty mx-susceptible isolates from the surveillance study were included for comparison. overall, one amino acid substitution in gyra (thr82 to ile) and four different substitutions in gyrb (ser416 to ala, asp426 to asn, asp426 to val and arg447 to  lys) were identified. a high level of resistance (mic >or=32 microg ml(-1)) to mx, ciprofloxacin (ci), gatifloxacin (ga) and levofloxacin (le) was found in 68 isolates showing the amino acid substitution thr82 to ile in gyra, in eight isolates with the substitutions thr82 to ile in gyra and ser416 to ala in gyrb, in two isolates showing the substitution asp426 to asn in gyrb and in one isolate with asp426 to val in gyrb. the remaining four isolates showed high mics for ci and le, but different mic levels for mx and ga. in particular, intermediate levels of resistance to mx were shown by two isolates, one with the substitution  thr82 to ile in gyra, and one showing asp426 to asn in gyrb. the substitution arg447 to lys in gyrb was found in two strains resistant to mx, ci and le but susceptible to ga. no substitutions in gyra were found in the fq-susceptible strains, whereas two strains showed the amino acid change ser416 to ala in gyrb.  thr82 to ile was the most frequent amino acid change identified in the c. difficile isolates examined. in contrast to previous observations, 10% of the isolates showed this substitution in association with ser416 to ala in gyrb. the  other amino acid changes found were characteristic of a few strains belonging to  certain types and/or countries. two new substitutions for c. difficile, ser416 to ala and arg447 to lys, were found in gyrb. whereas the former does not seem to have a key role in resistance, since it was also detected in susceptible strains, the latter substitution occurred in the same position where other amino acid variations take place in resistant escherichia coli and other c. difficile strains. a large number of c. difficile isolates now show an alarming pattern of  resistance to the majority of fqs currently used in hospitals and outpatient settings, therefore judicious use of these antibiotics and continuous monitoring  of in vitro resistance are necessary.

TI  == enhancement of the cytotoxic activity of clostridium difficile toxin a by surface-associated antigens.
AB  == cell-surface antigens of clostridium difficile and lps from escherichia coli were investigated for modulating effects on the activity of c. difficile toxin a on vero and caco2 cells. the antigens of c. difficile tested comprised: (i) an edta  extract, which contained several major and minor cell-surface proteins and the membrane-associated lipocarbohydrate (lc); (ii) a guanidine hydrochloride extract, which mainly contained the surface-layer proteins; (iii) an aqueous phenol-extracted, protein-free lc. on their own, none of the antigens had a detrimental effect on the cells, with the edta extract and lc having a marginally protective effect. when these antigens were added to suboptimal levels of toxin a, there was significant enhancement of its cytotoxicity by the edta and lc preparations on both cell types. lps showed some enhancement of the effect of toxin on vero cells at the lowest levels of toxin investigated. it was concluded  that this effect seen in vitro may have a role to play in the colon during infection with c. difficile.

TI  == systemic antibody response to clostridium difficile in colonized patients with and without symptoms and matched controls.
AB  == it has been proposed that patients who develop clostridium difficile-associated disease (cdad) do so because they are unable to mount an adequate immune response. serum was collected from three groups of elderly in-patients: (i) cases (n=21) of cdad, being toxin a/b-positive; (ii) carriers (n=21) asymptomatic for cdad (no diarrhoea) but at least toxin or culture positive; and (iii) controls (n=26) asymptomatic for cdad and negative for both c. difficile toxin and culture. the age and gender of each group were compared, and the colonizing strains were ribotyped and toxinotyped. serum antibodies (igg and igm) were measured by elisa using different antigen preparations: edta extract (containing  cell-surface proteins and carbohydrates), guanidine hydrochloride extract (surface-layer proteins), aqueous phenol-extracted lipocarbohydrate (lc); crude toxin (dialysis culture supernatant) and purified toxin a. lps from escherichia coli was used as a control antigen. antibodies were also tested for toxin neutralization on tissue monolayers and for binding to edta-extracted antigens by western blotting. igg antibody measurements to cytomegalovirus (cmv) were included as an indicator of potential immunosenescence. results showed that the patient groups were well matched by age and gender, and the colonizing strains were similar in cases and carriers, being predominantly ribotype 001 and toxinotype 0. by elisa, igg levels to most of the antigens were highest in the cases and lowest in the controls, with the exception of antibodies to the lc, which were higher in the controls than the cases. levels in the carriers tended to be of intermediate level or similar to the controls. for all antigens, the levels of igm were not significantly different among cases, carriers and controls. serum from all groups was able to neutralize the cytotoxic action of toxin on both vero and caco2 cells, and all to a similar extent. western blots showed an overall higher level of igg antibodies to the edta-extracted antigens in the cases. the results of the cmv elisa showed that specific igg was detected  in more cases (78%) than carriers and controls (both 65%), but this difference in seropositivity was not significant. the conclusion is that, during symptomatic infection, patients respond to protein antigens of c. difficile in a manner typical of a secondary antibody response, with no evidence that an inability to respond predisposes to the appearance of symptoms.

AB  == specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) protocols were used to determine the prevalence of toxigenic clostridium difficile in vhembe, south africa. of 322 stool samples collected, toxigenic c. difficile was found in 23 (7.1%) cases and  was significantly associated with diarrhea 20 (11.4%) compared with 3 (2%) in non-diarrheal samples (chi(2) = 426, p = 0.001), intestinal inflammation in 18 (12.1%) compared with 5 (2.9%) in lactoferrin-negative samples (chi(2) = 10.194,  p = 0.001), and occult blood in 19 (16%) compared with 4 (2%) in occult blood-negative samples (chi(2) = 22.157, p < 0.001). toxigenic c. difficile was more common among individuals > 50 years of age (20%), followed by those between  30 and 39 years of age (19%) and was not associated with hiv infections (chi(2) = 0.289, p = 0.591). co-infection with other pathogens was common. multivariate analysis indicated that toxigenic c. difficile was associated with e. bieneusi (p = 0.028), c. parvum (p = 0.007), and enteroaggregative escherichia coli (eaec) (p = 0.007) in diarrheal samples. this study confirms the usefulness of pcr methodologies in the detection of toxigenic c. difficile and suggests that c. difficile is responsible for a small, but underappreciated, proportion of diarrheal cases in the region, and further study is warranted in this area.

TI  == qnr-like pentapeptide repeat proteins in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == objectives: to study the role of qnr-like pentapeptide repeat proteins (prps) from several gram-positive species with quinolone resistance in vitro. methods: a pcr-based strategy was used to clone and express genes coding for qnr-like prps in enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, bacillus cereus and b. subtilis in escherichia coli dh10b. mic values of nalidixic acid and fluoroquinolones were determined for reference strains and e. coli dh10b harbouring recombinant plasmids containing genes coding for prps. results: amino acid identity of qnr-like prps in gram-positive strains compared with that of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants qnra1, qnrb1 and qnrs1 was in the range of 16%  to 22%. recombinant plasmids coding for qnr-like prps conferred reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (in the range of 0.016 to 0.064 mg/l for ciprofloxacin) and nalidixic acid (from 6 to 12 mg/l), depending on the antimicrobial agent and prp. the prp from b. subtilis showed no protective effect. conclusions: the prps analysed conferred a reduced susceptibility phenotype in e. coli; the data provide further evidence of the possible roles in  quinolone resistance of prps from different gram-positive species. these gram-positive species may constitute a reservoir for qnr-like quinolone resistance proteins.

TI  == [infectious aetiologies of travelers' diarrhoea].
AB  == traveler's diarrhoea (td) occurs in 20 to 60% of european or north-american travelers in intertropical areas. following return from endemic zone, malaria must always be evocated in front of febrile diarrhoea. many causative infectious  agents are involved in td and their frequency may vary according to destination and seasons. the main agents involved in td are escherichia coli pathovars (especially enterotoxigenic and enteroaggregative e. coli) followed by enteroinvasive bacteria (campylobacter spp., shigella spp., salmonella enterica), enteric viruses (norovirus, rotavirus) and protozoa (gardia intestinalis, cryptosporidium parvum et entamoeba histolytica). the development of molecular biology methods as pcr may allow us to evaluate the relative frequency of these agents and especially of viral agents in td. protozoa and microsporidia are more  frequently isolated in persistent and chronic td, especially in compromised patients. a complete etiological research in routine microbiology laboratories is difficult and time-consuming, related to the high diversity of causative agents and the need for specific methods. implementation of laboratory diagnosis is highly recommended when diarrhoea is associated with fever or presence of blood in stools, immunosuppression, antibiotic treatment (clostridium difficile toxins) or in case of persistent/chronic diarrhoea. according to the high frequency of acquired antibiotic-resistance in enteric bacteria, an antibiogram must be performed for all causative bacterial agents.

TI  == prediction of specific pathogens in patients with sepsis: evaluation of treat, a  computerized decision support system.
AB  == background: prediction of bacterial infections and their pathogens allows for early, directed investigation and treatment. we assessed the ability of treat, a  computerized decision support system, to predict specific pathogens. methods: treat uses data available within the first few hours of infection presentation in a causal probabilistic network to predict sites of infection and specific pathogens. we included 3529 patients (920 with microbiologically documented infections) participating in the observational and interventional trials of the treat system in israel, germany and italy. discriminatory performance of treat to predict individual pathogens was expressed by the auc with 95% confidence intervals. calibration was assessed using the hosmer-lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic. results: the aucs for gram-negative bacteria, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli, ranged between 0.70 and 0.80 (all significant). adequate calibration was demonstrated for any gram-negative infection and individual bacteria, except for e. coli. discrimination and calibration were acceptable for enterococcus spp. (auc 0.71, 0.65-0.78), but not for staphylococcus aureus (auc 0.63, 0.55-0.71). the few infections caused by candida spp. and clostridium difficile were well predicted (aucs 0.74, 0.54-0.95; and 0.94, 0.88-1.00, respectively). the coverage with treat's recommendation exceeded that observed with physicians' treatment for all  pathogens, except candida spp. conclusions: treat predicted individual pathogens  causing infection well. prediction of s. aureus was inferior to that observed with other pathogens. treat can be used to triage patients by the risk for specific pathogens. the system's predictions enable it to prescribe appropriate antibiotic treatment prior to pathogen identification.

TI  == saccharomyces cerevisiae strain 905 reduces the translocation of salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium and stimulates the immune system in gnotobiotic and conventional mice.
AB  == previous results in the laboratory of the authors showed that saccharomyces cerevisiae strain 905, isolated during 'cachaca' production, was able to colonize and survive in the gastrointestinal tract of germ-free and conventional mice, and to protect these animals against oral challenge with salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium or clostridium difficile. in the present work, the effects of s. cerevisiae 905 on the translocation of salm. typhimurium (mesenteric lymph nodes, peyer's patches, spleen, liver) as well as on the immune system (number of kupffer cells, immunoglobulin production, clearance of escherichia coli b41) were evaluated in gnotobiotic and/or conventional mice. the treatment with the yeast reduced significantly the translocation of salm. typhimurium to liver in gnotobiotic animals and to all the organs tested in conventional mice. the number of kupffer cells per 100 hepatocytes in liver was significantly higher (p<0.05) in yeast mono-associated mice (52.9+/-15.7) than in germ-free controls (38.1+/-9.0). probably as a consequence, clearance of e. coli b41 from the bloodstream was more efficient in yeast mono-associated animals when compared to  germ-free mice. higher levels (p<0.05) of secretory iga in intestinal content and of iga and igm in serum were observed in yeast mono-associated mice when compared to germ-free group. concluding, the protection against pathogenic bacteria observed in a previous study was probably due to a modulation of both local and systemic immunity of mice treated with s. cerevisiae 905.

TI  == glutamate 2,3-aminomutase: a new member of the radical sam superfamily of enzymes.
AB  == a gene eam in clostridium difficile encodes a protein that is homologous to lysine 2,3-aminomutase (lam) in many other species but does not have the lysyl-binding residues asp293 and asp330 in lam from clostridium subterminale sb4. the c. difficile protein has lys and asn, respectively, in the sequence positions of the essential asp residues in lam. the c. difficile gene has been cloned into an e. coli expression vector, expressed in e. coli, and the protein purified and characterized. the recombinant protein displays excellent activity as a glutamate 2,3-aminomutase and no activity toward l-lysine. the plp-, iron-,  and sulfide-content and ultraviolet/visible spectrum are similar to lam, and the  enzyme requires sam and dithionite as activators, as does lam. freeze-quench epr  experiments in the presence of l-glutamate reveal a glutamate-based free radical  in the steady state of the reaction. a number of other bacterial genomes include  genes encoding proteins homologous to the glutamate 2,3-aminomutase from c. difficile, and four of these proteins display the activity of glutamate 2,3-aminomutase when produced in e. coli. all of the homologous proteins have the cysteine motif csmycrhc corresponding to the motif cxxxcxxc characteristic of radical sam enzymes. it is concluded that glutamate 2,3-aminomutase from c. difficile is a representative of a family found in a number of bacteria. it is likely that the beta-glutamate found in a few bacterial and archeal species as an osmolyte arises from the action of glutamate 2,3-aminomutase.

TI  == antiparasitic drug nitazoxanide inhibits the pyruvate oxidoreductases of helicobacter pylori, selected anaerobic bacteria and parasites, and campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == nitazoxanide (ntz) exhibits broad-spectrum activity against anaerobic bacteria and parasites and the ulcer-causing pathogen helicobacter pylori. here we show that ntz is a noncompetitive inhibitor (k(i), 2 to 10 microm) of the pyruvate:ferredoxin/flavodoxin oxidoreductases (pfors) of trichomonas vaginalis,  entamoeba histolytica, giardia intestinalis, clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, h. pylori, and campylobacter jejuni and is weakly active against the pyruvate dehydrogenase of escherichia coli. to further mechanistic studies, the pfor operon of h. pylori was cloned and overexpressed in e. coli, and the multisubunit complex was purified by ion-exchange chromatography. pyruvate-dependent pfor activity with ntz, as measured by a decrease in absorbance at 418 nm (spectral shift from 418 to 351 nm), unlike the reduction of viologen dyes, did not result in the accumulation of products (acetyl coenzyme a  and co(2)) and pyruvate was not consumed in the reaction. ntz did not displace the thiamine pyrophosphate (tpp) cofactor of pfor, and the 351-nm absorbing form  of ntz was inactive. optical scans and (1)h nuclear magnetic resonance analyses determined that the spectral shift (a(418) to a(351)) of ntz was due to protonation of the anion (ntz(-)) of the 2-amino group of the thiazole ring which could be generated with the pure compound under acidic solutions (pk(a) = 6.18).  we propose that ntz(-) intercepts pfor at an early step in the formation of the lactyl-tpp transition intermediate, resulting in the reversal of pyruvate binding prior to decarboxylation and in coordination with proton transfer to ntz. thus, ntz might be the first example of an antimicrobial that targets the "activated cofactor" of an enzymatic reaction rather than its substrate or catalytic sites,  a novel mechanism that may escape mutation-based drug resistance.

TI  == gut microbiota composition and development of atopic manifestations in infancy: the koala birth cohort study.
AB  == background and aims: perturbations in intestinal microbiota composition due to lifestyle changes may be involved in the development of atopic diseases. we examined gut microbiota composition in early infancy and the subsequent development of atopic manifestations and sensitisation. methods: the faeces of 957 infants aged 1 month and participating in the koala birth cohort study were analysed using quantitative real-time pcr. information on atopic symptoms (eczema, wheeze) and potential confounders was acquired through repeated questionnaires. total and specific ige were measured in venous blood samples collected during home visits when the infant was 2 years old. during these home visits a clinical diagnosis of atopic dermatitis was made according to the uk-working party criteria. results: the presence of escherichia coli was associated with a higher risk of developing eczema (or(adj) = 1.87; 95% ci 1.15 to 3.04), this risk being increased with increasing numbers of e coli (p(for trend) = 0.016). infants colonised with clostridium difficile were at higher risk of developing eczema (or(adj) = 1.40; 95% ci 1.02 to 1.91), recurrent wheeze (or(adj) = 1.75; 95% ci 1.09 to 2.80) and allergic sensitisation (or(adj) = 1.54; 95% ci 1.02 to 2.31). furthermore, the presence of c difficile was also associated with a higher risk of a diagnosis of atopic dermatitis during the home visit (or(adj) = 1.73; 95% ci 1.08 to 2.78). conclusion: this study demonstrates  that differences in gut microbiota composition precede the development of atopy.  since e coli was only associated with eczema and c difficile was associated with  all atopic outcomes, the underlying mechanisms explaining these association may be different.

AB  == bacteria have well documented abilities to induce protective as well as pathogenic mucosal immune responses, with the type of response dependent on the genetically programmed balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and t-lymphocyte subsets. inflammatory bowel disease, especially crohn disease and periodontal disease, appear to be overly aggressive cellular immune responses to  some, but not all, normal resident bacteria. recent evidence suggests that the balance of protective (probiotic) and aggressive commensal luminal bacterial species is an additional determinant of mucosal homeostasis (tolerance) versus pathogenic immune responses (loss of tolerance) and that this balance can be therapeutically manipulated. mucosal pathogens elicit a characteristic profile of cytokines from epithelial cells, including chemokines that recruit effector cells to the site of invasion to clear the invading organism. the molecular mechanisms  of epithelial attachment and invasion of bacterial pathogens (eg, salmonella, shigella, pathogenic escherichia coli, and yersinia) and the mechanisms of injury induced by clostridium difficile toxins and helicobacter pylori are beginning to  be understood, as are the innate and cognate host immune responses to these organisms, leading to novel means to effectively block bacterial injury and induce protective immune responses through immunization.

TI  == bacterial aetiology of diarrhoea in young children: high prevalence of enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) not belonging to the classical epec serogroups.
AB  == diarrhoeal disease continues to be one of the most common causes of admittance in children hospital emergency. the aim of the present study was to investigate the  relative contribution of enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli  (epec and ehec, respectively) as a cause of infectious bacterial diarrhoea in children from the region of toulouse. we analysed 280 samples of stools from 280  children (<2 years) with diarrhoea admitted in the "hopital des enfants" from january to august 2005. classic pathogens (salmonella, campylobacter, yersinia, shigella, aeromonas and vibrio) were detected by standard culture methods. enterotoxigenic clostridium difficile were identified after culture by immuno-enzyme assay (iea). virulence genes of epec and ehec were detected by using pcr. shiga-toxin production of ehec strains was confirmed with an iea test. potential enteric pathogens were identified in 55 patients. epec was the most frequently identified agent (30 patients), followed by campylobacter (9 cases: 7  c. jejuni and 2 c. coli) and c. difficile (8 patients), then ehec (5 patients) and salmonella (3 patients). no shigella, yersinia, aeromonas or other pathogenic bacteria were detected during this period in that class of children. epec not belonging to the classical epec serogroups were highly prevalent (24 versus 6). ehec possessed different genotypes and serogroups: o26 (2 strains), o157 (2 strains) and one un-typable strain. this study demonstrates the importance of epec (55 % of positive cases) and of ehec (more frequent than salmonella) in the  aetiology of diarrhoeal diseases of young children. we confirm the usefulness of  the pcr methodology: it allows the detection of virulent e. coli and thus increases by two fold the diagnosis of bacterial diarrhoea.

TI  == treatment of gastrointestinal infections.
AB  == treatment of gastrointestinal infections continues to be complicated by expanding resistance to antibiotics. this has led to both new antibiotic treatments and to  research on alternative therapies. in the case of clostridium difficile colitis,  interesting preliminary results have been obtained with both probiotic therapy and passive immunization strategies. the newer macrolides were found to be effective for multidrug-resistant salmonella typhi and safe in the pediatric population. the efficacy of rifaximin, a nonabsorbed antimicrobial agent, was demonstrated in the treatment of travelers diarrhea in mexico. the benefit of the proteolytic agent bromelain, which degrades enterocyte receptors for enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, was shown in an experimental model of piglets challenged with this infection after bromelain prophylaxis. the potential value of zinc supplementation in infant diarrhea was shown in a study in india. the recently approved rotavirus vaccine is being withheld because of multiple reported cases of intussusception. cryptosporidiosis continues to challenge old and new chemotherapeutic agents. the usefulness of paromomycin in cryptosporidium infection was shown in both murine and piglet models. the cost effectiveness of prophylaxis for parasitosis in immigrants has been an area of investigation.

TI  == effect of tigecycline on normal oropharyngeal and intestinal microflora.
AB  == antibacterial agents disrupt the ecological balance of the normal human microflora. tigecycline, a member of a new class of antibiotics (glycylcyclines), has been shown to have a potent broad-spectrum activity against most gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the aim of the study was to investigate the ecological effects of tigecycline on the normal oropharyngeal and intestinal microflora of healthy subjects. thirteen healthy white subjects (six females and seven males) between 20 and 31 years of age received 100 mg of tigecycline in the morning on day 1 as a 30-min intravenous infusion followed by a 50-mg dose of tigecycline every 12 h as a 30-minute infusion for 10 days. one subject was withdrawn on day 2 because of an adverse event (urticaria). serum, saliva, and fecal samples were collected before, during, and after administration for microbiological cultivation and for assays of tigecycline. all new colonizing bacteria were tested for susceptibility (resistance of > or =8 mg/liter) during the investigation period. the fecal concentrations on day 8 were from 3.0 to 14.1 mg/kg, with a mean value of 6.0 mg/kg and a median value of 5.6 mg/kg. the saliva concentrations were generally low (0 to 0.12 mg/liter). a minor effect on the oropharyngeal microflora was observed. the numbers of enterococci and escherichia coli cells in the intestinal microflora were reduced at day 8 (p < 0.05), while those of other enterobacteria  and yeasts increased. there was a marked reduction of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria (p < 0.05) but no impact on bacteroides. no clostridium difficile  strains were isolated. two klebsiella pneumoniae strains and five enterobacter cloacae strains resistant to tigecycline were found on day 8.

TI  == effect of tea phenolics and their aromatic fecal bacterial metabolites on intestinal microbiota.
AB  == tea is rich in polyphenols and other phenolics that have been widely reported to  have beneficial health effects. however, dietary polyphenols are not completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are metabolized by the gut microflora so that they and their metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. in this study, we investigated the influence of the phenolic components of a tea extract and their aromatic metabolites upon bacterial growth. fecal homogenates containing bacteria significantly catalyzed tea phenolics, including epicatechin, catechin, 3-o-methyl gallic acid, gallic acid and caffeic acid to generate aromatic metabolites dependent on bacterial species. different strains of intestinal bacteria had varying degrees of growth sensitivity to tea phenolics and metabolites. growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile and bacteroides spp. was significantly repressed by tea phenolics and their derivatives, while commensal anaerobes like clostridium spp., bifidobacterium spp. and probiotics such as lactobacillus sp. were less severely affected. this indicates that tea phenolics exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population, probably by acting as metabolic prebiotics. our observations provide further evidence for the importance of colonic bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of phenolics in human health and disease. the bioactivity of different phenolics may play an important role in the maintenance of gastrointestinal health.

TI  == characterization of (r)-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase and a family iii coenzyme a transferase involved in reduction of l-leucine to isocaproate by clostridium difficile.
AB  == the strictly anaerobic pathogenic bacterium clostridium difficile occurs in the human gut and is able to thrive from fermentation of leucine. thereby the amino acid is both oxidized to isovalerate plus co(2) and reduced to isocaproate. in the reductive branch of this pathway, the dehydration of (r)-2-hydroxyisocaproyl-coenzyme a (coa) to (e)-2-isocaprenoyl-coa is probably catalyzed via radical intermediates. the dehydratase requires activation by an atp-dependent one-electron transfer (j. kim, d. darley, and w. buckel, febs j. 272:550-561, 2005). prior to the dehydration, a dehydrogenase and a coa transferase are supposed to be involved in the formation of (r)-2-hydroxyisocaproyl-coa. deduced amino acid sequences of ldha and hada from the genome of c. difficile showed high identities to d-lactate dehydrogenase and  family iii coa transferase, respectively. both putative genes encoding the dehydrogenase and coa transferase were cloned and overexpressed in escherichia coli; the recombinant strep tag ii fusion proteins were purified to homogeneity and characterized. the substrate specificity of the monomeric ldha (36.5 kda) indicated that 2-oxoisocaproate (k(m) = 68 mum, k(cat) = 31 s(-1)) and nadh were  the native substrates. for the reverse reaction, the enzyme accepted (r)- but not (s)-2-hydroxyisocaproate and therefore was named (r)-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase. hada showed coa transferase activity with (r)-2-hydroxyisocaproyl-coa as a donor and isocaproate or (e)-2-isocaprenoate as  an acceptor. by site-directed mutagenesis, the conserved d171 was identified as an essential catalytic residue probably involved in the formation of a mixed anhydride with the acyl group of the thioester substrate. however, neither hydroxylamine nor sodium borohydride, both of which are inactivators of the coa transferase, modified this residue. the dehydrogenase and the coa transferase fit well into the proposed pathway of leucine reduction to isocaproate.

TI  == diarrhea etiology in a children's hospital emergency department: a prospective cohort study.
AB  == background: we evaluated the frequency of recovery of pathogens from children with diarrhea who presented to a pediatric emergency department and characterized the associated illnesses, to develop guidelines for performing a bacterial enteric culture. methods: we conducted a prospective cohort study of all patients with diarrhea who presented to a large regional pediatric emergency department during the period from november 1998 through october 2001. a thorough microbiologic evaluation was performed on stool specimens, and the findings were  correlated with case, physician, and laboratory data. results: a total of 1626 stool specimens were studied to detect diarrheagenic bacteria and, if there was a sufficient amount of stool, clostridium difficile toxin (688 specimens), parasites (656 specimens), and viruses (417 specimens). one hundred seventy-six (47%) of 372 specimens that underwent complete testing yielded a bacterial pathogen (shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli, 39 specimens [of which 28 were  serotype o157:h7]; salmonella species, 39; campylobacter species, 25; shigella species, 14; and yersinia enterocolitica, 2), a viral pathogen (rotavirus, 85 specimens; astrovirus, 27; adenovirus, 18; or rotavirus and astrovirus, 8), a diarrheagenic parasite (5 specimens); or c. difficile toxin (46 specimens). samples from 2 patients yielded both bacterial and viral pathogens. a model to identify predictors of bacterial infection found that international travel, fever, and the passing of >10 stools in the prior 24 h were associated with the presence of a bacterial pathogen. physician judgment regarding the need to perform a stool culture was almost as accurate as the model in predicting bacterial pathogens. conclusions: nearly one-half of the patients who presented to the emergency department with diarrhea had a definite or plausible pathogen in their stool specimens. we were unable to develop a model that was substantially better than physician judgment in identifying patients for whom bacterial culture would yield positive results. the unexpectedly high rate of c. difficile toxin warrants further examination.

TI  == construction and analysis of chromosomal clostridium difficile mutants.
AB  == clostridium difficile is an emerging nosocomial pathogen of increasing importance and virulence but our ability to study the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of c. difficile-associated disease has been limited because of a lack of tools for its genetic manipulation. we have now developed a reproducible  method for the targeted insertional inactivation of chromosomal c. difficile genes. the approach relies on the observation that an escherichia coli-clostridium perfringens shuttle vector is unstable in c. difficile and can be used as a form of conditional lethal vector to deliver gene constructs to the  chromosome. we have used this methodology to insertionally inactivate two putative response regulator genes, rgar and rgbr, which encode proteins with similarity to the toxin gene regulator, virr, from c. perfringens. transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that the c. difficile rgar protein positively regulated four genes, including a putative agrbd operon. the rgar protein was also purified and shown to bind specifically to sites that contained two consensus virr boxes located just upstream of the putative promoters of these genes. the development of this methodology will significantly enhance our ability to use molecular approaches to develop a greater understanding of the ability of c. difficile to cause disease.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by probiotic strains modify the adhesion of probiotics and enteropathogens to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == exopolysaccharides (epss) are exocellular polymers present in the surface of many bacteria, including lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. the genome sequence of several strains revealed the presence of eps-encoding genes. however, the physiological role that epss play in the bacterial ecology still remains uncertain. in this study, we have assessed the effect of epss produced by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium longum nb667, and bifidobacterium animalis ipla-r1 on the adhesion of probiotic and enteropathogen strains to human intestinal mucus. the eps fraction gg had no significant effect on the adhesion of l. rhamnosus gg and b. animalis ipla-r1. however, the eps fractions nb667 and  ipla-r1 significantly reduced the adherence of both probiotic strains. in contrast, the three eps fractions increased the adhesion of enterobacter sakazakii atcc 29544 and escherichia coli nctc 8603. higher adherence of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 29631 and clostridium difficile atcc 9689 was detected in the presence of the eps fractions gg and nb667. in general,  these effects were obtained at eps concentrations of up to 5 mg/ml, and they were eps dose dependent. the competitive exclusion of probiotics in the presence of eps could suggest the involvement of these biopolymers in the adhesion to mucus.  the increase in the adherence of enteropathogens could be explained if components of the pathogen surface are able to bind to specific epss and the bound epss are  able to adhere to mucus. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work reporting the effect of epss from probiotics on bacterial adhesion properties.

TI  == how long do nosocomial pathogens persist on inanimate surfaces? a systematic review.
AB  == background: inanimate surfaces have often been described as the source for outbreaks of nosocomial infections. the aim of this review is to summarize data on the persistence of different nosocomial pathogens on inanimate surfaces. methods: the literature was systematically reviewed in medline without language restrictions. in addition, cited articles in a report were assessed and standard  textbooks on the topic were reviewed. all reports with experimental evidence on the duration of persistence of a nosocomial pathogen on any type of surface were  included. results: most gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus spp. (including vre), staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), or streptococcus pyogenes, survive for months on dry surfaces. many gram-negative species, such as acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, or shigella spp., can also survive for months. a few others, such as bordetella pertussis, haemophilus influenzae, proteus vulgaris, or vibrio cholerae, however, persist only for days. mycobacteria, including mycobacterium tuberculosis, and spore-forming bacteria, including clostridium difficile, can also survive for months on surfaces. candida albicans as the most important nosocomial fungal pathogen can survive up to 4 months on surfaces. persistence of other yeasts, such as torulopsis glabrata, was described to be similar (5 months) or shorter (candida parapsilosis, 14 days). most viruses from the respiratory tract, such as corona, coxsackie, influenza, sars or rhino virus, can persist on  surfaces for a few days. viruses from the gastrointestinal tract, such as astrovirus, hav, polio- or rota virus, persist for approximately 2 months. blood-borne viruses, such as hbv or hiv, can persist for more than one week. herpes viruses, such as cmv or hsv type 1 and 2, have been shown to persist from  only a few hours up to 7 days. conclusion: the most common nosocomial pathogens may well survive or persist on surfaces for months and can thereby be a continuous source of transmission if no regular preventive surface disinfection is performed.

AB  == infection of endothelial cells by listeria monocytogenes is an essential step in  the pathogenesis of listeriosis. small gtpases of the rho family act as molecular switches in signal transduction. we tested the hypothesis that rho gtpases contribute to the regulation of cytokine expression following l. monocytogenes infection. l. monocytogenes induced release of distinct cc and cxc, as well as th1 and th2 cytokines and growth factors by endothelial cells and activated rhoa  and rac1. inhibition of rac1 by inhibitor nsc23766 reduced cytokine expression, and slightly yet significantly the uptake of bacteria. blocking of rho proteins by clostridium difficile toxin b-10463 (tcdb) reduced listeria-dependent cytokine expression, whereas activating rho proteins by escherichia coli cnf1 increased it. we analyzed regulation of il-8 expression in more detail: listeria-induced il-8 release was reduced by inhibition of rhoa, rac1 and cdc42 (tcdb) or rac1 while blocking of rhoa/b/c by clostridium limosum c3 fusion toxin (c3ft) or rho kinase by y27632 reduced cytokine expression only slightly. activation of rhoa, rac1 and cdc42 (cnf1), but not of rhoa alone (cnf(y)), enhanced listeria-dependent il-8 release significantly. furthermore, inhibition of rhoa, rac1 and cdc42 (tcdb) and rac1 (nsc23766), but not of rhoa (c3ft) reduced listeria-related recruitment of nf-kappab/p65 and rna polymerase ii to the il8 promoter, as well as acetylation of histone h4 and ser10/lys14-phosphorylation/acetylation of histone h3 at the il8 gene promoter in huvec. in conclusion, rac1 contributed to l. monocytogenes-induced cytokine expression by human endothelial cells.

TI  == factors influencing the composition of the intestinal microbiota in early infancy.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to examine the contribution of a broad range of external influences to the gut microbiotic composition in early infancy. methods: fecal samples from 1032 infants at 1 month of age, who were recruited from the koala birth cohort study in the netherlands, were subjected to quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays for the enumeration of bifidobacteria, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, bacteroides fragilis group, lactobacilli, and total bacterial counts. information on potential determinants of the gut microbiotic composition was collected with repeated questionnaires. the associations between these factors and the selected gut bacteria were analyzed with univariate and multivariate analyses. results: infants born through cesarean section had lower numbers of bifidobacteria and bacteroides, whereas they were more often colonized with c difficile, compared with vaginally born infants. exclusively formula-fed infants were more often colonized with e coli, c difficile, bacteroides, and lactobacilli, compared with  breastfed infants. hospitalization and prematurity were associated with higher prevalence and counts of c difficile. antibiotic use by the infant was associated with decreased numbers of bifidobacteria and bacteroides. infants with older siblings had slightly higher numbers of bifidobacteria, compared with infants without siblings. conclusions: the most important determinants of the gut microbiotic composition in infants were the mode of delivery, type of infant feeding, gestational age, infant hospitalization, and antibiotic use by the infant. term infants who were born vaginally at home and were breastfed exclusively seemed to have the most "beneficial" gut microbiota (highest numbers  of bifidobacteria and lowest numbers of c difficile and e coli).

TI  == effect of dalbavancin on the normal intestinal microflora.
AB  == objectives: dalbavancin is a new lipoglycopeptide antibiotic active in vitro against most gram-positive bacteria. it is administered parenterally as a weekly  regimen, is eliminated both in urine and faeces, and has t(1/2) in plasma of 8.5  days. investigating the impact of antibiotics on endogenous microflora is important since alteration of the balance may facilitate colonization by new potentially pathogenic strains or enable microorganisms in the normal flora to develop resistance. the purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of administration of dalbavancin on the intestinal flora of healthy subjects. methods: six women and six men, 18-40 years, received a single 30 min intravenous infusion of 1 g dalbavancin. plasma and faeces were collected over several weeks for determination of dalbavancin concentration and analysis of faecal flora. faecal specimens were cultured on non-selective and selective media. different colony types were counted, isolated in pure culture and identified to genus level. all new colonizing bacteria were tested for susceptibility to dalbavancin. results: plasma dalbavancin concentrations at 2, 21 and 60 days after administration were 35.8-208.7, 3.9-22.1 and 0.5-2.9 mg/l, respectively. the faecal concentrations of dalbavancin were 6.8-73.4 mg/kg on day 5 and 7.4-26.4 mg/kg on day 14. dalbavancin was not detectable in faeces on day 60. there was some impact on numbers of enterococci and escherichia coli and no changes in numbers of lactobacilli, clostridia and bacteroides. no clostridium difficile strains were recovered. no new colonizing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria resistant to dalbavancin were found. conclusions: dalbavancin has no major ecological effect on the human normal intestinal microflora.

AB  == rho gtpases are the preferred targets of various bacterial cytotoxins, including  clostridium difficile toxins a and b, clostridium sordellii lethal toxin, the cytotoxic necrotizing factors (cnf1) from escherichia coli, and the dermonecrotizing toxin (dnt) from bordetella species. the toxins inactivate or activate specific sets of rho gtpases by mono-o-glucosylation and deamidation/transglutamination, respectively. here we studied the structural basis of the recognition of rhoa, which is modified by toxin b, cnf1, and dnt, in comparison with rhod, which is solely a substrate for lethal toxin. we found that a single amino acid residue in rhoa and rhod defines the substrate specificity for toxin b and lethal toxin. change of serine 73 to phenylalanine in rhoa turned rhoa into a substrate for lethal toxin. accordingly, change of the equivalently positioned phenylalanine 85 in rhod with serine allowed glucosylation by toxin b. comparable results were achieved with the rho-activating and transglutaminating enzymes cnf1 and dnt. here, amino acid glutamate 64 of rhoa and the equivalent aspartate 76 of rhod define substrate specificity for cnf1 and dnt, respectively. these data indicate that single amino acid residues located in the switch ii region of rho proteins determine enzyme specificity for diverse bacterial toxins.

TI  == the development of clostridium difficile genetic systems.
AB  == clostridum difficile is a major cause of healthcare-associated disease in the western world, and is particularly prominent in the elderly. its incidence is rising concomitant with increasing longevity. more effective countermeasures are  required. however, the pathogenesis of c. difficile infection is poorly understood. the lack of effective genetic tools is a principal reason for this ignorance. for many years, the only tools available for the transfer of genes into c. difficile have been conjugative transposons, such as tn916, delivered via filter mating from bacillus subtilis donors. they insert into a preferred site within the genome. therefore, they may not be employed for classical mutagenesis  studies, but can be employed to modulate gene function through the delivery of antisense rna. attempts to develop transformation procedures have so far met with little success. however, in recent years the situation has been dramatically improved through the demonstration of efficient conjugative transfer of both replication-proficient and replication-deficient plasmids from escherichia coli donors. this efficient transfer can only be achieved in certain strains through negation of the indigenous restriction barrier, and is generally most effective when the plasmid employed is based on the replicon of the c. difficile plasmid, pcd6.

TI  == glycans on secretory component participate in innate protection against mucosal pathogens.
AB  == in mucosal secretions, secretory component (sc) is found either free or bound to  polymeric iga within the secretory iga complex. sc displays numerous and various  glycans, which are potential ligands for bacterial compounds. we first established that human sc (hsc) purified from colostrum (hsccol) or produced in chinese hamster ovary cells (hscrec) exhibits the same lectin reactivity. both forms bind to clostridium difficile toxin a and functionally protect polarized caco-2 cell monolayers from the cytopathic effect of the toxin. the interaction is mediated by glycans present on hsc and involves galactose and sialic acid residues. hsccol and hscrec were also shown to bind enteropathogenic escherichia  coli adhesin intimin and to inhibit its infectivity on hep-2 cells in a glycan-dependent manner as well. sc remained operative in the context of the whole secretory iga molecule and can therefore enhance its fab-mediated neutralizing properties. on the contrary, hsc did not interact with three different strains of rotavirus (rf, rrv, and sa11). accordingly, infection of target ma104 cells with these rotavirus strains was not reduced in the presence of either form of hsc tested. although not a universal mechanism, these findings  identify hsc as a microbial scavenger contributing to the antipathogenic arsenal  that protects the body epithelial surfaces.

AB  == visitation of hospitalized people by dogs is becoming commonplace, but little is  known about the potential health risks of introducing dogs to healthcare settings. this cross-sectional study evaluated the prevalence of zoonotic agents  in a group of 102 visitation dogs from a variety of sources across ontario. between may and july 2004, owners were interviewed by a standardized questionnaire while dogs underwent a standardized physical examination. one specimen of faeces, hair-coat brushings and one rectal, aural, nasal, oral and pharyngeal swab were collected from each dog and tested for 18 specific pathogens. all dogs were judged to be in good health. zoonotic agents were isolated from 80 out of 102 (80%) dogs. the primary pathogen was clostridium difficile, which was isolated from 58 (58%) faecal specimens. seventy-one percent (41/58) of these isolates were toxigenic. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase escherichia coli was isolated from one (1%) dog, extended-spectrum cephalosporinase e. coli was isolated from three (3%) dogs, and organisms of the  genus salmonella were isolated from three (3%) dogs. pasteurella multocida or pasteurella canis was isolated from 29 (29%) oral swabs, and malassezia pachydermatis was isolated from eight (8%) aural swabs. giardia antigen was present in the faeces of seven (7%) dogs, while toxocara canis and ancylostoma caninum were detected in two (2%) dogs and one (1%) dog, respectively. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, campylobacter spp., microsporum canis, group a streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa and cryptosporidium spp. were not detected. further information is needed before the full implications of these findings for infection control can be assessed properly.

TI  == diarrhea in american infants and young children in the community setting: incidence, clinical presentation and microbiology.
AB  == objective: the characteristics and microbiology of the full spectrum of pediatric diarrhea occurring in the u.s. community setting are not well-understood. methods: six-month prospective cohort study of 604 healthy 6- to 36-month-old children recruited by the slone center office-based research network. results: the incidence of parent-defined diarrhea was 2.2 episodes per person-year. the median duration of diarrhea was 2 days with a median of 6 stools per episode. outpatient visits and hospitalization were prompted by 9.7 and 0.3% of episodes,  respectively. the most common microorganisms identified in healthy baseline stools were atypical enteropathogenic escherichia coli (12.2%), enteroaggregative escherichia coli (3.7%), clostridium difficile (3.5%) and clostridium perfringens (2.9%), and each of these was no more common in diarrhea stools. in contrast, all of the viruses analyzed were more prevalent in diarrhea specimens than in baseline specimens: enteric adenovirus (5.7% diarrhea versus 1.4% baseline), rotavirus (5.2% versus 1.4%), astrovirus (3.5% versus 1.4%), sapporo-like virus (3.0% versus 0.8%) and norovirus (1.9% versus 0.8%). a likely pathogen was detected in 20.6% of diarrhea specimens. vomiting and > or =16 stools in an episode were predictive of isolating a pathogen from the stool, each with a relative risk of approximately 2. conclusions: healthy young children in this study experienced more than 2 cases of diarrhea per person-year, but most were brief and do not require medical attention. although most diarrhea-associated pathogens were viruses, no likely pathogen was found in almost 80% of cases; possible etiologies for these cases include currently unknown gastrointestinal infections, nongastrointestinal illnesses and dietary/environmental factors.

TI  == adhesion of selected bifidobacterium strains to human intestinal mucus and the role of adhesion in enteropathogen exclusion.
AB  == the ability of potential probiotic strains to adhere to the intestinal mucosa and exclude and displace pathogens is of utmost importance for therapeutic manipulation of the enteric microbiota. the ability of seven selected human bifidobacterial strains and five human enteropathogenic strains to adhere to human intestinal mucus was analyzed and compared with that of four strains isolated from chicken intestines. the adhesion of the bifidobacterial strains ranged from 3 to 16% depending on the strain. bifidobacterium strains of animal origin adhered significantly better than did strains of human origin. of the pathogenic bacteria, escherichia coli nctc 8603 had the highest adhesion value (20%), salmonella typhimurium atcc 29631, enterobacter sakazakii atcc 29544, and  clostridium difficile atcc 9689 had adhesion values ranging from 10 to 15%, and listeria monocytogenes atcc 15313 had the lowest adhesive value (3%). the ability of these bifidobacteria to inhibit pathogen adhesion and to displace pathogens previously adhering to mucus was also tested. the inhibition of pathogens adhesion by these bifidobacterial strains was variable and clearly strain dependent. in general, bifidobacterial strains of animal origin were better able  to inhibit and displace pathogens than were human strains. preliminary characterization of bacterial adhesion was accomplished using different pretreatments to explore adhesion mechanisms. the results indicate that different molecules are implicated in the adhesion of bifidobacteria to the human intestinal mucus, constituting a multifactorial process.

TI  == epidemiology, risk factors and outcome of nosocomial infections in a respiratory  intensive care unit in north india.
AB  == objective: to determine the epidemiology, risk factors and outcome of infections  in a respiratory intensive care unit (ricu) of a tertiary care institute in northern india. methodology: prospective, observational clinical study. results:  the study included 201 patients (1285 patient days) admitted to ricu over a period of one-and-a-half years. a total of 77 infections were identified in 67 patients (33.5%). the infections included pneumonia (23%), sepsis of unknown origin (10.5%), bacteremia (7.5%), urinary tract infections (1.5%), catheter related blood stream infections (1%) and clostridium difficile colitis (1%). the  most commonly identified organisms were the acinetobacter species (34.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.9%) and escherichia coli (15.2%). the median length of stay in patients with and without infection was 13 days (interquartile range, iqr, 28) and 4 days (interquartile range, iqr, 3), respectively (p<0.0001). multivariate analysis showed the following risk factors for icu-acquired infection: the admitting diagnosis of infection (odds ratio [or] 3.3; 95% confidence intervals [ci] 1.06-10.1), length of stay in the ricu (or, 1.2; 95% confidence intervals [ci] 1.1-1.33); renal failure (or, 4.7; 95% ci, 1.52-14.41)  and institution of parenteral nutrition (or, 16.9; 95% ci, 1.07-269.03). multivariate analysis showed the following risk factors for death in icu: apache  ii scores (or, 1.06; 95% ci, 1.01-1.11), and endotracheal intubation (or, 5.07; 95% ci, 1.24-20.65). conclusions: this study clearly documents a high prevalence  rate of infections in the icu, and the data suggest that occurrence of infections was associated with a prolonged icu stay but had no significant effect on the final outcome.

TI  == gastrointestinal bacteria generate nitric oxide from nitrate and nitrite.
AB  == denitrifying bacteria in soil generate nitric oxide (no) from nitrite as a part of the nitrogen cycle, but little is known about no production by commensal bacteria. we used a chemiluminescence assay to explore if human faeces and different representative gut bacteria are able to generate no. bacteria were incubated anaerobically in gas-tight bags, with or without nitrate or nitrite in  the growth medium. in addition, luminal no levels were measured in vivo in the intestines in germ-free and conventional rats, and in rats mono-associated with lactobacilli. we show that human faeces can generate no after nitrate or nitrite  supplementation. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria generated much no from nitrite,  but only a few of the tested strains produced no from nitrate and at much lower levels. in contrast, escherichia coli, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and clostridium difficile did not produce significant amounts of no either with nitrate or nitrite. no generation in the gut lumen was also observed in vivo in conventional rats but not in germ-free rats or in rats mono-associated with lactobacilli. we conclude that no can be generated by the anaerobic gut flora in  the presence of nitrate or nitrite. future studies will reveal its biological significance in regulation of gastrointestinal integrity.

TI  == change of the donor substrate specificity of clostridium difficile toxin b by site-directed mutagenesis.
AB  == the large cytotoxins of clostridia species glycosylate and thereby inactivate small gtpases of the rho family. clostridium difficile toxins a and b and clostridium sordellii lethal toxin use udp-glucose as the donor for glucosylation of rho/ras gtpases. in contrast, alpha-toxin from clostridium novyi n-acetylglucosaminylates rho gtpases by using udp-n-acetylglucosamine as a donor  substrate. based on the crystal structure of c. difficile toxin b, we studied the sugar donor specificity of the toxins by site-directed mutagenesis. the changing  of ile-383 and gln-385 in toxin b to serine and alanine, respectively, largely increased the acceptance of udp-n-acetylglucosamine as a sugar donor for modification of rhoa. the k(m) value was reduced from 960 to 26 mum for the double mutant. accordingly, the potential of the double mutant of toxin b to hydrolyze udp-n-acetylglucosamine was higher than that for udp-glucose. the changing of ile-383 and gln-385 in the lethal toxin of c. sordellii allowed modification of ras in the presence of udp-n-acetyl-glucosamine and reduced the acceptance of udp-glucose as a donor for glycosylation. vice versa, the changing  of the equivalent residues in c. novyi alpha-toxin from ser-385 and ala-387 to isoleucine and glutamine, respectively, reversed the donor specificity of the toxin from udp-n-acetylglucosamine to udp-glucose. these data demonstrate that two amino acid residues are crucial for the co-substrate specificity of clostridial glycosylating toxins.

TI  == molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

AB  == toxigenic clostridium difficile ccug19126 produces the autoinducer-2 (ai-2) quorum sensing molecule that induces bioluminescence in vibrio harveyi bb170 reporter strain. ai-2-containing cell-free supernatants from mid-log phase c. difficile and escherichia coli dh5alpha expressing recombinant luxs(cd) upregulated the transcript levels of tcda (7-10-fold), tcdb (4-6-fold), and tcde  (2-3-fold) in early-log c. difficile. in contrast, no induction occurred when cells were exposed to sterile medium or to cell-free supernatant from e. coli dh5alpha. ai-2 did not significantly increase the level of toxin a in early-log c. difficile. these results suggest that luxs(cd)-dependent signaling regulates virulence gene expression at the transcriptional level in c. difficile.

TI  == neutropenic enterocolitis in an advanced epithelial ovarian cancer patient treated with paclitaxel/platinum-based chemotherapy: a case report and review of  the literature.
AB  == background: literature data show that neutropenic enterocolitis is a rare but severe complication that can occur in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy and especially with taxanes. case report: a 60-year-old woman with stage illc epithelial ovarian cancer developed neutropenic fever, abdominal pain, severe diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and oral mucositis one week after the first postoperative cycle of paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 3-hour infusion) plus carboplatin-based chemotherapy. abdominal x-ray showed diffuse dilatation of the  ileal and colonic loops with air/fluid. the patient soon recovered after intensive supportive care. for the second cycle the dose of paclitaxel was reduced by 20%, but nine days later the patient again developed severe neutropenia with fever, abdominal colicky pain, diarrhoea and vomiting. the culture of blood samples collected on admission was found to be positive for escherichia coli, whereas stools resulted negative for both enteric rods and clostridium difficile toxin. the patient recovered with intensive supportive care, and chemotherapy was continued with single-agent carboplatin. discussion: the increasing use of paclitaxel in first-line as well as in the salvage treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer could increase the occurrence of neutropenic enterocolitis in patients with this malignancy. the importance of symptoms such as neutropenic fever, abdominal pain and tenderness and severe diarrhoea should be stressed in patients who receive taxane-based chemotherapy, and intensive supportive care management should be started immediately.

TI  == structural basis for the function of clostridium difficile toxin b.
AB  == toxin b is a member of the family of large clostridial cytotoxins which are of great medical importance. its catalytic fragment was crystallized in the presence of udp-glucose and mn2+. the structure was determined at 2.2 a resolution, showing that toxin b belongs to the glycosyltransferase type a family. however, toxin b contains as many as 309 residues in addition to the common chainfold, which most likely contribute to the target specificity. a superposition with other glycosyltransferases shows the expected positions of the acceptor oxygen atom during glucosyl transfer and indicates further that the reaction proceeds probably along a single-displacement pathway. the c1'' donor carbon atom position is defined by the bound udp and glucose. it assigns the surface area of toxin b that forms the interface to the target protein during the modifying reaction. a docking attempt brought the known acceptor atom, thr37 o(gamma1) of the switch i  region of the rhoa:gdp target structure, near the expected position. the relative orientation of the two proteins was consistent with both being attached to a membrane. sequence comparisons between toxin b variants revealed that the highest exchange rate occurs around the active center at the putative docking interface,  presumably due to a continuous hit-and-evasion struggle between clostridia and their eukaryotic hosts.

AB  == a gene encoding a putative peptidoglycan hydrolase was identified by sequence similarity searching in the clostridium difficile 630 genome sequence, and the corresponding protein, named acd (autolysin of c. difficile) was expressed in escherichia coli. the deduced amino acid sequence of acd shows a modular structure with two main domains: an n-terminal domain exhibiting repeated sequences and a c-terminal catalytic domain. the c-terminal domain exhibits sequence similarity with the glucosaminidase domains of staphylococcus aureus atl and bacillus subtilis lytd autolysins. purified recombinant acd produced in e. coli was confirmed to be a cell-wall hydrolase with lytic activity on the peptidoglycan of several gram-positive bacteria, including c. difficile. the hydrolytic specificity of acd was studied by rp-hplc analysis and maldi-tof ms using b. subtilis cell-wall extracts. muropeptides generated by acd hydrolysis demonstrated that acd hydrolyses peptidoglycan bonds between n-acetylglucosamine  and n-acetylmuramic acid, confirming that acd is an n-acetylglucosaminidase. the  transcription of the acd gene increased during vegetative cellular growth of c. difficile 630. the sequence of the acd gene appears highly conserved in c. difficile strains. regarding deduced amino acid sequences, the c-terminal domain  with enzymic function appears to be the most conserved of the two main domains. acd is the first known autolysin involved in peptidoglycan hydrolysis of c. difficile.

TI  == rational antibiotic treatment of outpatient genitourinary infections in a changing environment.
AB  == in the outpatient setting, genitourinary infections (guis) remain costly to treat and are a significant cause of morbidity. recent evidence supports more substantial roles for pathogens other than escherichia coli, particularly gram-positive pathogens, in the pathogenesis of guis. broad-spectrum agents should be considered in order to address this etiologic change appropriately. criteria for antimicrobial selection set forth by the council for appropriate and rational antibiotic therapy (carat) recommend using antibiotics that are supported by strong clinical evidence, have good susceptibility profiles, are safe, are cost-effective, and are used for the optimal duration. evidence-based guidelines recommend considering local e coli resistance rates to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and using fluoroquinolones as second-line therapy when resistance is high. fluoroquinolones are recommended for the treatment of pyelonephritis and prostatitis. among the fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin offer coverage for the gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, which may make them preferable in treating urinary tract infections empirically in such patient groups. for the treatment of bacterial prostatitis, only trimethoprim and the fluoroquinolones possess both the appropriate bactericidal activity and the ability to diffuse into the prostate. levofloxacin shows particularly good penetration into prostatic tissue. safety issues to consider include imbalances in intestinal microflora caused by antimicrobial agents that may lead to overgrowth of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. once the optimal agent is identified, the optimal  duration of treatment should be determined to maximize treatment success while minimizing the potential for resistance. finally, cost considerations include the costs of treatment failure due to inappropriate therapy or nonadherence to the therapeutic regimen.

TI  == probiotic therapy of intestinal inflammation and infections.
AB  == purpose of review: the author presents evidence published during the past year regarding treatment of clinical and experimental intestinal inflammation and infections by probiotic agents. recent findings: normal commensal bacteria are implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic, immune-mediated intestinal inflammation, particularly crohn disease and pouchitis, whereas viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoan infections are increasingly important with widespread use of immunosuppressive agents and broad-spectrum antibiotics. combinations of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and streptococcus salivarius prevent relapse of recurrent pouchitis and perhaps decrease the initial onset of pouch inflammation, whereas escherichia coli nissle 1917 maintains remission in ulcerative colitis. several agents offer promise as primary therapy of ulcerative colitis. use of probiotics in crohn disease remains unsubstantiated. animal models demonstrate marked differences in responses among various probiotic bacterial species and that nonviable organisms can have therapeutic efficacy. probiotics have multiple  mechanisms of action, including prevention of pathogenic bacterial growth, binding to or penetration of pathogens to mucosal surfaces, stimulation of mucosal barrier function, or altering immunoregulation (decreasing proinflammatory and promoting protective molecules). although multiple probiotic  species block epithelial adhesion and invasion by microbial pathogens in vitro, their proven utility in clinical infections is limited to accelerating recovery from acute infectious diarrhea and preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea. summary: probiotics offer promise for physiologic, nontoxic treatment of pouchitis, ulcerative colitis, and acute infectious diarrhea, but larger, controlled clinical studies must be performed to clarify optimal agents; doses; combinations of various probiotics, prebiotics, and antibiotics; and therapeutic  conditions.

TI  == quorum sensing in clostridium difficile: analysis of a luxs-type signalling system.
AB  == the increasing incidence of clostridium difficile-associated disease, and the problems associated with its control, highlight the need for additional countermeasures. the attenuation of virulence through the blockade of bacterial cell-to-cell communication (quorum sensing) is one potential therapeutic target.  preliminary studies have shown that c. difficile produces at least one potential  signalling molecule. through the molecule's ability to induce bioluminescence in  a vibrio harveyi luxs reporter strain, it has been shown to correspond to autoinducer 2 (ai-2). in keeping with this observation, a homologue of luxs has been identified in the genome of c. difficile. adjacent to luxs(cd) a potential transcriptional regulator and sensor kinase, rola and rolb, have been located. rt-pcr has been used to confirm the genetic organization of the luxs(cd) locus. while ai-2 production has not been blocked so far using antisense technology, ai-2 levels could be modulated by controlling expression of the putative transcriptional regulator rola. rola, therefore, acts as a negative regulator of  ai-2 production. finally, it has been shown that the exogenous addition of ai-2 or 4-hydroxy-5-methyl-3(2h) furanone has no discernible effect on the production  of toxins by c. difficile.

TI  == 2-hydroxyisocaproyl-coa dehydratase and its activator from clostridium difficile.
AB  == the hadbc and hadi genes from clostridium difficile were functionally expressed in escherichia coli and shown to encode the novel 2-hydroxyisocaproyl-coa dehydratase hadbc and its activator hadi. the activated enzyme catalyses the dehydration of (r)-2-hydroxyisocaproyl-coa to isocaprenoyl-coa in the pathway of  leucine fermentation. the extremely oxygen-sensitive homodimeric activator as well as the heterodimeric dehydratase, contain iron and inorganic sulfur; besides varying amounts of zinc, other metal ions, particularly molybdenum, were not detected in the dehydratase. the reduced activator transfers one electron to the  dehydratase concomitant with hydrolysis of atp, a process similar to that observed with the unrelated nitrogenase. the thus activated dehydratase was separated from the activator and atp; it catalyzed about 10(4) dehydration turnovers until the enzyme became inactive. adding activator, atp, mgcl(2), dithionite and dithioerythritol reactivated the enzyme. this is the first demonstration with a 2-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydratase that the catalytic electron is recycled after each turnover. in agreement with this observation, only substoichiometric amounts of activator (dehydratase/activator = 10 mol/mol) were  required to generate full activity.

AB  == human herpesvirus 8 (hhv-8; also called kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus), which is implicated in the pathogenesis of kaposi's sarcoma (ks) and lymphoproliferative disorders, infects a variety of target cells both in vivo and in vitro. hhv-8 binds to several in vitro target cells via cell surface heparan sulfate and utilizes the alpha3beta1 integrin as one of its entry receptors. interactions with cell surface molecules induce the activation of host cell signaling cascades and cytoskeletal changes (p. p. naranatt, s. m. akula, c. a. zien, h. h. krishnan, and b. chandran, j. virol. 77:1524-1539, 2003). however, the mechanism by which the hhv-8-induced signaling pathway facilitates the complex events associated with the internalization and nuclear trafficking of internalized viral dna is as yet undefined. here we examined the role of hhv-8-induced cytoskeletal dynamics in the infectious process and their interlinkage with signaling pathways. the depolymerization of microtubules did not affect hhv-8 binding and internalization, but it inhibited the nuclear delivery of viral dna and infection. in contrast, the depolymerization of actin microfilaments did not have any effect on virus binding, entry, nuclear delivery, or infection. early during infection, hhv-8 induced the acetylation of microtubules and the activation of the rhoa and rac1 gtpases. the inactivation of rho gtpases by clostridium difficile toxin b significantly reduced microtubular acetylation and the delivery of viral dna to the nucleus. in contrast, the activation of rho gtpases by escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor significantly augmented the nuclear delivery of viral dna. among the rho gtpase-induced downstream effector molecules known to stabilize the microtubules, the activation of rhoa-gtp-dependent diaphanous 2 was observed, with no significant activation in the rac- and cdc42-dependent pak1/2 and stathmin molecules. the nuclear delivery of viral dna increased in cells expressing a constitutively active rhoa mutant and decreased in cells expressing a dominant-negative mutant of rhoa. hhv-8 capsids colocalized with the microtubules, as observed by confocal microscopic examination, and the colocalization was abolished by the destabilization of microtubules with nocodazole and by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor affecting the rho gtpases. these results suggest that hhv-8 induces rho gtpases, and in doing so, modulates microtubules and promotes the trafficking of viral capsids and the establishment of infection. this is the first demonstration of virus-induced host cell signaling pathways in the modulation of microtubule dynamics and in the trafficking of viral dna to the infected cell nucleus. these results further support our hypothesis that hhv-8 manipulates the host cell signaling pathway to  create an appropriate intracellular environment that is conducive to the establishment of a successful infection.

TI  == development of an extensive set of 16s rdna-targeted primers for quantification of pathogenic and indigenous bacteria in faecal samples by real-time pcr.
AB  == aims: the microbiota of the human intestinal tract constitutes a complex ecosystem. we report the design and optimization of an extensive set of 16s rdna-targeted species- and group-specific primers for more accurate quantification of bacteria from faecal samples with real-time pcr. methods and results: a linear range of quantification between 0.1-10 pg and 10 ng of specific target genome was obtained, which corresponds to detection of ca 30-4500 to 1.9 x 10(6)-6.0 x 10(6) target bacterial genomes. functionality of the assays was confirmed by quantification of target bacterial dna from faecal dna preparations  of healthy volunteers and irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) patients. additionally,  spiking of faecal preparations with helicobacter pylori, clostridium difficile or campylobacter jejuni was used to confirm the accurate and sensitive quantification. conclusions: real-time pcr is a very sensitive and precise technique for an extensive quantitative evaluation of gut microbiota and is feasible for detection of human pathogens from faecal samples. significance and impact of the study: to design and optimize an extensive set of real-time pcr assays targeting a large group of predominant and pathogenic gi microbial species for further use in updating the current knowledge of the putative role of gut microbiota in health and disease.

TI  == nosocomial diarrhea.
AB  == objective: to study the occurrence of nosocomial diarrhea in pediatric wards and  the role of infections in its causation. methods: 75 cases conforming to the cdc  definition of nosocomial diarrhea were selected for the study. stool samples were subjected to direct microscopic examination, bacteriological culture and direct antigen detection for clostridium difficile (c. difficile) and rota virus. results: all the cases were sporadic in origin. rota virus was detected in 16.67% cases and enteropathogenic escherichia coli (e.p.e.c.) was detected in 12% cases. cases in which no pathogen was detected (82.7%) outnumbered those in which a pathogen was identified (17.3%). conclusion: rota virus and e.p.e.c were the most common etiological agents. c. difficile was detected in one case only. most of the sporadic cases of nosocomial diarrhea in pediatric patients can be managed on fluids and electrolytes.

TI  == [characterization of an extracellular protease from clostridium difficile].
AB  == clostridium difficile is an intestinal pathogen, which produces two main virulence factors, the exotoxins a and b. other bacterial structures have been implicated in the colonization of the gastrointestinal tract, which is the first  step of the pathogenic process. c. difficile expresses adherence factors and also, displays some surface-associated proteolytic activity, which could play a role in the physiopathology of this bacterium. the aim of this work was to study  the protein named cwp84 which displays significant homologies with many cysteine  proteases. the coding catalytic domain of this protein has been cloned in the expression system pgex-6p-1, as an in-frame fusion with the gluthatione s-transferase, and subsequently purified. the purified fraction showed proteolytic activity on gelatine and bapna, but not on azocoll, suggesting a highly selective substrate specificity. the results obtained from inhibition experiments confirmed that cwp84 belongs to the cysteine protease family. cwp84 could play a role in degrading some specific host proteins or in the maturation of surface-associated bacterial proteins.

TI  == cdea of clostridium difficile, a new multidrug efflux transporter of the mate family.
AB  == the cdea gene, cloned from clostridium difficile clinical strain 714 under the control of its natural promoter made escherichia coli and clostridium perfringens resistant to ethidium bromide and acriflavin but had no effect on the susceptibility of the hosts to the following antibiotics: norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, erythromycin, tetracyclin, and chloramphenicol. however, it was responsible for fluoroquinolone resistance in e. coli when it was cloned under the control of the plac promoter. quantitative reverse transcriptase (rt)-pcr showed that growth of c. difficile clinical strain 253 in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of ethidium bromide significantly increased the transcription of cdea, but this was not observed with ciprofloxacin. the deduced  protein was homologous to the protein sequences of known efflux pumps from the third cluster (the so-called dinf branch) of the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (mate) family. cdea caused ethidium bromide energy-dependent efflux in  whole cells of e. coli. efflux activity was stimulated by addition of na+ ions, suggesting that cdea, like other pumps of the mate family, is a na+-coupled efflux pump. cdea is the first multidrug efflux transporter identified in c. difficile.

TI  == cloning and expression of clostridium difficile toxin a gene (tcda) by pcr amplification and use of an expression vector.
AB  == toxigenic clostridium difficile isolates harbor a 19 kb pathogenicity locus that  encodes the genes for toxins a and b. toxins a and b are among the largest known  bacterial toxins expressing potent cytotoxicity and enterotoxicity, and thus the  major virulence factors in c. difficile associated diarrhea. cloning and sequencing of toxin genes is of interest for studies of molecular pathogenesis. we report the amplification and cloning of the complete toxin a gene into an escherichia coli expression vector. ten clones analyzed contained the complete toxin a gene. four of these clones showed cytotoxic activity in cell culture, and were positive for toxin a as determined by elisa. toxin a expression was confirmed by western immunoblot analysis. the presence of cytotoxic activity in cell culture suggests that toxin a activity is independent of other genes in the  pathogenicity locus.

TI  == screening of the equine intestinal microflora for potential probiotic organisms.
AB  == reasons for performing study: probiotics have not been demonstrated to provide any beneficial health effects in horses, possibly because of improper selection of probiotic organisms. this study was designed to identify lactic acid bacteria  of equine origin with predetermined beneficial properties which might make them useful as therapeutic probiotics. hypothesis: a small percentage of lactic acid bacteria that are native to the intestinal tract of horses possess properties that may be useful in the treatment and/or prevention of gastrointestinal disease in horses. methods: faecal samples were collected from healthy mature horses and  foals. lactic acid bacteria were isolated and tested for the ability to grow in acid and bile environments, aerotolerance and in vitro inhibition of enteropathogens. one isolate that possessed these properties was administered orally to healthy mature horses and foals and gastrointestinal survival was assessed. results: of the 47 tested organisms, 18 were deemed to be adequately acid- and bile-tolerant. all were aerotolerant. four organisms markedly inhibited salmonella spp. one isolate, lactobacillus pentosus we7, was subjectively superior and chosen for further study. it was also inhibitory against e. coli, moderately inhibitory against s. zooepidemicus and c. difficile and mildly inhibitory against c. perfringens. after oral administration, this isolate was recovered from the faeces of 8/9 (89%) foals and 7/8 (87.5%) mature horses. conclusions: lactobacillus pentosus we7 possesses in vitro and in vivo properties that may be useful for the prevention and treatment of enteric disease in horses. potential relevance: the beneficial in vitro and in vivo properties that l. pentosus we7 possesses indicate that randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled efficacy studies are warranted.

TI  == subunit composition of the glycyl radical enzyme p-hydroxyphenylacetate decarboxylase. a small subunit, hpdc, is essential for catalytic activity.
AB  == p-hydroxyphenylacetate decarboxylase from clostridium difficile catalyses the decarboxylation of p-hydroxyphenylacetate to yield the cytotoxic compound p-cresol. the three genes encoding two subunits of the glycyl-radical enzyme and  the activating enzyme have been cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the recombinant enzymes were used to reconstitute a catalytically functional system in vitro. in contrast with the decarboxylase purified from c. difficile, which was an almost inactive homo-dimeric protein (beta(2)), the recombinant enzyme was a hetero-octameric (beta(4)gamma(4)), catalytically competent complex, which was  activated using endogenous activating enzyme from c. difficile or recombinant activating enzyme to a specific activity of 7 u.mg(-1). preliminary results suggest that phosphorylation of the small subunit is responsible for the change of the oligomeric state. these data point to an essential function of the small subunit of the decarboxylase and may indicate unique regulatory properties of the system.

TI  == microbial contamination of drinking water and disease outcomes in developing regions.
AB  == drinking water is a major source of microbial pathogens in developing regions, although poor sanitation and food sources are integral to enteric pathogen exposure. gastrointestinal disease outcomes are also more severe, due to under-nutrition and lack of intervention strategies in these regions. poor water  quality, sanitation and hygiene account for some 1.7 million deaths a year world-wide (3.1% of all deaths and 3.7% of all daly's), mainly through infectious diarrhoea. nine out of 10 such deaths are in children and virtually all of the deaths are in developing countries. major enteric pathogens in these children include: rotavirus, campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, shigella spp. and vibrio cholerae o1, and possibly enteropathogenic e. coli, aeromonas spp. v. cholerae o139, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile and cryptosporidium parvum. all except the latter are easily control by chlorination of water, but recontamination of treated water is  a huge problem. emerging environmental pathogens, such as helicobacter pylori and burkholderia pseudomallei, may well be of significance in some regions. in adults, much less is understood of various sequellae such as myocarditis, diabetes, reactive arthritis and cancers some months-years after initial infections. so in addition to the traditional pathogens (helminths, entamoeba histolytica, giardia lamblia hepatitis a and e) various enteroviruses, c. jejuni  and h. pylori are emerging issues in adults.

AB  == the receptor binding domains of the most potent mucosal adjuvants, bacterial toxins and plant lectins, are organized in repeat units to recognize specific sugar residues. the lectin-like structure of the c-terminal region of clostridium difficile toxin a prompted us to investigate the mucosal adjuvant properties of a nontoxigenic peptide corresponding to amino acids 2394 to 2706 (txa(c314)). we compared txa(c314) adjuvant activity to those of cholera toxin (ct) and escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin subunit b (etxb) coadministered orally or nasotracheally with poor peptide antigens (keyhole limpet hemocyanin [klh] and hen egg lysozyme [hel]). levels of anti-klh-specific serum immunoglobulin g (igg) and iga as well as that of mucosal iga were significantly higher in animals immunized orally with txa(c314) plus klh than with klh alone, ct plus klh, or etxb plus klh. following intranasal immunization with txa(c314) plus hel, levels  of serum- and mucosa-specific antibodies were comparable to those induced by coadministering hel with ct or etxb. the txa(c314) adjuvant effect following oral, but not intranasal, immunization was dose dependent. the analysis of the subclasses of anti-klh-specific igg isotypes and the cytokines released from splenocytes of immunized mice challenged in vitro with klh indicates the induction of a mixed th1/th2-type immune response, with prevalence of the th1 branch. we conclude that txa(c314) enhances immune responses against mucosa-coadministered foreign antigens and represents a promising mucosal adjuvant, especially because its ability to stimulate mixed th1/th2 responses with a strong a th1 component is extremely worthwhile against intracellular pathogens.

TI  == the large resolvase tnpx is the only transposon-encoded protein required for transposition of the tn4451/3 family of integrative mobilizable elements.
AB  == chloramphenicol resistance in clostridium perfringens and clostridium difficile is often encoded by catp genes located within the 6.3 kb integrative mobilizable  elements tn4451 and tn4453 respectively. this family of transposons is capable of being mobilized into a recipient cell in the presence of another conjugative element. transposition is mediated by the large resolvase tnpx, which excises the element to produce a circular molecule that is the integrative intermediate. in this study, in vivo deletion analysis of the transposon-encoded tnpv and tnpy genes showed that they are not essential for excision or integration of this group of elements. similar studies on tnpw suggested either that this gene is not essential for these functions or that tnpw does not function when provided in trans. development and use of an in vivo insertion assay showed that tnpx is the  only transposon-encoded protein required for the integration reaction. subsequently, a tnpxleh6 protein was purified and shown to catalyse excision in vitro in the absence of any other protein and preferentially to excise a supercoiled dna substrate. in summary, these studies have shown that tnpx is the  only transposon protein required in vivo and in vitro for the excision process and that, like excision, integration also occurs by a serine recombinase-mediated site-specific recombination mechanism.

TI  == the role of bacterial and non-bacterial toxins in the induction of changes in membrane transport: implications for diarrhea.
AB  == bacterial toxins induce changes in membrane transport which underlie the loss of  electrolyte homeostasis associated with diarrhea. bacterial- and their secreted toxin-types which have been linked with diarrhea include: (a) vibrio cholerae (cholera toxin, e1 tor hemolysin and accessory cholera enterotoxin); (b) escherichia coli (heat stable enterotoxin, heat-labile enterotoxin and colicins); (c) shigella dysenteriae (shiga-toxin); (d) clostridium perfringens (c. perfringens enterotoxin, alpha-toxin, beta-toxin and theta-toxin); (e) clostridium difficile (toxins a and b); (f) staphylococcus aureus (alpha-haemolysin); (g) bacillus cereus (cytotoxin k and haemolysin bl); and (h)  aeromonas hydrophila (aerolysin, heat labile cytotoxins and heat stable cytotoxins). the mechanisms of toxin-induced diarrhea include: (a) direct effects on ion transport in intestinal epithelial cells, i.e. direct toxin interaction with intrinsic ion channels in the membrane and (b) indirect interaction with ion transport in intestinal epithelial cells mediated by toxin binding to a membrane  receptor. these effects consequently cause the release of second messengers, e.g. the release of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate/guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate, ip(3), ca2+ and/or changes in second messengers that are the result of toxin-formed ca2+ and k+ permeable channels, which increase ca2+ flux and augment changes in ca2+ homeostasis and cause depolarisation of the membrane  potential. consequently, many voltage-dependent ion transport systems, e.g. voltage-dependent ca2+ influx, are affected. the toxin-formed ion channels may act as a pathway for loss of fluid and electrolytes. although most of the diarrhea-causing toxins have been reported to act via cation and anion channel formation, the properties of these channels have not been well studied, and the available biophysical properties that are needed for the characterization of these channels are inadequate.

TI  == bacterial-associated diarrhea in the dog: a critical appraisal.
AB  == the clinical documentation of enteropathogenic bacteria causing diarrhea in dogs  is clouded by the presence of many of these organisms existing as normal constituents of the indigenous intestinal flora. the diagnosis of a putative bacterial enteropathogen(s) in dogs should be made based on a combination of parameters, including signalment and predisposing factors, clinical signs, serologic assays for toxins, fecal culture, and pcr. relying on results of fecal  culture alone is problematic, because c perfringens, c difficile, campylobacter spp, and pathogenic and non-pathogenic e coli are commonly isolated from apparently healthy dogs [10,13,33]. nevertheless, culture may be useful in procuring isolates for the application of molecular techniques, such as pcr, for  detection of specific toxin genes or molecular typing of isolated strains to establish clonality in suspected outbreaks. the oversimplistic attempt to characterize bacterially associated diarrhea by anatomic localization of clinical signs should be discouraged, because most of the previously mentioned bacteria have been associated with small and large intestinal diarrhea. accurate diagnosis of infections may require diagnostic laboratories to incorporate pcr-based assays using genus- and species-specific primers to facilitate detection of toxin genes  and differentiation of species that appear phenotypically and biochemically similar. there has been tremendous interest in the application of microarray technology for the simultaneous detection of thousands of genes or target dna sequences on one glass slide. this powerful tool could be used for detection of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in fecal specimens obtained from dogs in the future.

TI  == transcription and analysis of polymorphism in a cluster of genes encoding surface-associated proteins of clostridium difficile.
AB  == recent investigations of the clostridium difficile genome have revealed the presence of a cluster of 17 genes, 11 of which encode proteins with similar two-domain structures, likely to be surface-anchored proteins. two of these genes have been proven to encode proteins involved in cell adherence: slpa encodes the  precursor of the two proteins of the s-layer, p36 and p47, whereas cwp66 encodes  the cwp66 adhesin. to gain further insight into the function of this cluster, we  further focused on slpa, cwp66, and cwp84, the latter of which encodes a putative surface-associated protein with homology to numerous cysteine proteases. it displayed nonspecific proteolytic activity when expressed as a recombinant protein in escherichia coli. polymorphism of cwp66 and cwp84 genes was analyzed in 28 strains, and transcriptional organization of the three genes was explored by northern blots. the slpa gene is strongly transcribed during the entire growth phase as a bicistronic transcript; cwp66 is transcribed only in the early exponential growth phase as a polycistronic transcript encompassing the two contiguous genes upstream. the putative proteins encoded by the cotranscribed genes have no significant homology with known proteins but may have a role in adherence. no correlation could be established between sequence patterns of cwp66 and cwp84 and virulence of the strains. the cwp84 gene is strongly transcribed as a monocistronic message. this feature, together with the highly conserved sequence pattern of cwp84, suggests a significant role in the physiopathology of  c. difficile for the cwp84 protease, potentially in the maturation of surface-associated adhesins encoded by the gene cluster.

AB  == recombinant antibody cloning and phage display technologies were used to produce  single-chain antibodies (scfv) against clostridium difficile toxin b. the starting material was the mouse b cell hybridoma line 5a8, which generates a monoclonal antibody against the toxin. the integrated cloning, screening, and phage display system of krebber et al. (j. immunol. methods 201:35-55, 1997) allowed us to rapidly obtain toxin b-binding scfv sequences derived from the hybridoma cell line. the best candidate scfv sequences, based on preliminary enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) screening data were then subcloned into the compatible expression vector. recombinant single-chain antibodies were expressed in escherichia coli. a 29-kda band was observed on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as predicted. the expressed product was characterized by immunoblotting and detection with an anti-flag antibody. the toxin b-binding function of the single-chain antibody was shown by a sandwich elisa. the antibody was highly specific for toxin b and did not cross-react with material isolated from a toxin b-negative c. difficile strain. the sensitivity of the soluble single-chain antibody is significantly higher than the original monoclonal antibody based on elisa data and could detect a minimum of 10 ng of toxin b/well. competitive elisas established that the affinity of the 5a8 parent antibody and the best representative (clone 10) of the single-chain antibodies were similar and in the range of 10(-8) m. we propose that recombinant antibody technology is  a rapid and effective approach to the development of the next generation of immunodiagnostic reagents.

TI  == mechanism of quinolone resistance in anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == several recently developed quinolones have excellent activity against a broad range of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and are thus potential drugs for the treatment of serious anaerobic and mixed infections. resistance to quinolones is  increasing worldwide, but is still relatively infrequent among anaerobes. two main mechanisms, alteration of target enzymes (gyrase and topoisomerase iv) caused by chromosomal mutations in encoding genes, or reduced intracellular accumulation due to increased efflux of the drug, are associated with quinolone resistance. these mechanisms have also been found in anaerobic species. high-level resistance to the newer broad-spectrum quinolones often requires stepwise mutations in target genes. the increasing emergence of resistance among  anaerobes may be a consequence of previous widespread use of quinolones, which may have enriched first-step mutants in the intestinal tract. quinolone resistance in the bacteroides fragilis group strains is strongly correlated with  amino acid substitutions at positions 82 and 86 in gyra (equivalent to positions  83 and 87 of escherichia coli). several studies have indicated that b. fragilis group strains possess efflux pump systems that actively expel quinolones, leading to resistance. dna gyrase seems also to be the primary target for quinolones in clostridium difficile, since amino acid substitutions in gyra and gyrb have been  detected in resistant strains. to what extent other mechanisms, such as mutational events in other target genes or alterations in outer-membrane proteins, contribute to resistance among anaerobes needs to be further investigated.

AB  == clostridium difficle is a causative agent of severe and difficult-to-diagnose human infections. toxins a and b, which modify the ras-like proteins of eukaryotic cells, are the major factor in the pathogenicity of the discussed causative agent. these very toxins are considered as the key components of the developed diagnostic and therapeutic-and-preventive preparations. the c-terminal  fragments of toxins a and b as well as hybrid products, consisting of fragments of both toxins, were cloned, within the present case study, by using the pet28 plasmid vector. the recombinant plasmids were transformed into strains escherichia coli bl21 (de3), and they were used later to produce the appropriate  proteins. the purified protein preparations were isolated from the ultrasound bacterial-cell lysate by using the method of metal-affinity chromatography to be  used later in the production of hyper-immune rabbit sera.

TI  == rho protein inhibition blocks cyclooxygenase-2 expression by proinflammatory mediators in endothelial cells.
AB  == rho proteins participate in the regulation of inflammatory gene expression in endothelial cells. we made use of clostridium difficile toxin b-10643 (tcdb-10463) which inhibites rhoa/rac1/cdc42 to analyze their role in expression  and regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) in endothelial cells (ec). pretreatment of ec with tcdb-10643 prevented lipopolysaccharide (lps)-or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnfalpha)-related cox-2 expression but had no effect on cox-1 protein levels. tcdb-10463 preincubation suppressed lps-dependent nuclear factor-kappab activation (nf-kappab). rho inhibition did not affect cox-1 activity. inactivation of rho proteins before lps stimulation blocked arachidonic acid (aa)-, thrombin-, and escherichia coli hemolysin (hlya)-dependent release of cox-2-related 6-ketoprostaglandin f(1alpha), (6k-pgf(1alpha)). in contrast, rho inhibition did not affect cox-2-dependent 6k-pgf(1alpha) liberation when tcdb-10643 was added 10 h after lps or tnfalpha stimulation of ec. therefore, rhoa/rac1/cdc42 contribute to nf-kappab-dependent lps- and tnfalpha-induced expression of pghs-2 in ec but had no effect on the activity of expressed cox-1 and cox-2.

TI  == acute gastroenteritis in children : what role for antibacterials?
AB  == the aim of this article is to define the currently accepted role of antibacterials in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis in children. most cases  of acute gastroenteritis in children are viral, self-limited, and need only supportive treatment. appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, with close attention to nutrition, remain central to therapy.antibacterial therapy serves as an adjunct, to shorten the clinical course, eradicate causative organisms, reduce transmission, and prevent invasive complications. selection of antibacterials to  use in acute bacterial gastroenteritis is based on clinical diagnosis of the likely pathogen prior to definitive laboratory results. antibacterial therapy should be restricted to specific bacterial pathogens and disease presentations. in general, infections with shigella spp. and vibrio cholera should usually be treated with antibacterials, while antibacterials are only used in severe unresponsive infections with salmonella, yersinia, aeromonas, campylobacter, plesiomonas spp., and clostridium difficile. antibacterials should be avoided in  enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli infection. however, empiric therapy may be appropriate in the presence of a severe illness with bloody diarrhea and stool leucocytes, particularly in infancy and the immunocompromised. the benefits and risks of adverse drug reactions should be weighed before prescribing antibacterials. moreover, a major concern is the emergence of antibacterial-resistant strains due to the widespread use of antibacterial agents.

TI  == bacterial hemorrhagic enterocolitis.
AB  == bacterial diarrhea can be classified into two clinical entities, noninflammatory  diarrhea and inflammatory diarrhea syndromes. the latter type of diarrhea is characterized by bloody and puruloid mucus stool, and is often accompanied by fever, tenesmus, and severe abdominal pain. pathogenic bacteria causing the inflammatory diarrhea syndrome include salmonella, vibrio, shigella, enteroinvasive and enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli, campylobacter, yersinia, chlamydia, and clostridium difficile. the pathologic changes in the inflammatory  diarrhea syndrome range from a superficial exudative enterocolitis to a transmural enterocolitis with overt ulceration. this syndrome is also designated  as bacterial hemorrhagic enterocolitis because of its usual manifestation by bloody diarrhea. the diagnostic approach needs information on the patient's age,  travel history, epidemiological associations, sexual practice, and medical history, including usage of antibiotics. bacterial information can be obtained by microscopic study, culture, and the identification of specific bacterial toxins.  flexible colonoscopy with biopsy is useful for the differentiation of bacterial hemorrhagic enterocolitis from idiopathic ulcerative colitis and ischemic colitis. physicians should be familiar with the diagnostic modalities used to detect the specific pathogens causing hemorrhagic bacterial enterocolitis; namely, bacterial culture, serology, histology, and nucleic acid technologies.

TI  == conjugative transfer of clostridial shuttle vectors from escherichia coli to clostridium difficile through circumvention of the restriction barrier.
AB  == progress towards understanding the molecular basis of virulence in clostridium difficile has been hindered by the lack of effective gene transfer systems. we have now, for the first time, developed procedures that may be used to introduce  autonomously replicating vectors into this organism through their conjugative, orit-based mobilization from escherichia coli donors. successful transfer was achieved through the use of a plasmid replicon isolated from an indigenous c. difficile plasmid, pcd6, and through the characterization and subsequent circumvention of host restriction/modification (rm) systems. the characterized replicon is the first c. difficile plasmid replicon to be sequenced and encodes a large replication protein (repa) and a repetitive region composed of a 35 bp iteron sequence repeated seven times. strain cd6 has two rm systems, cdicd6i/m.cdicd6i and cdicd6ii/m. cdicd6ii, with equivalent specificities to sau96i/m. sau96i (5'-ggnmcc-3') and mboi/m. mboi (5'-gmatc-3') respectively. a second strain (cd3) possesses a type iis restriction enzyme, cdi i, which cleaves the sequence 5'-catcg-3' between the fourth and fifth nucleotide to give a blunt-ended fragment. this is the first time that an enzyme with this specificity has been reported. the sequential addition of this site to vectors showed that each site caused between a five- and 16-fold reduction in transfer efficiency. the transfer efficiencies achieved with both strains equated to between 1.0 x 10-6 and 5.5 x 10-5 transconjugants per donor.

AB  == the prevalence of bacteria, parasite and viral pathogens in 3875 patients with diarrhea in community and hospital settings from march 1997 through august 1999 in jakarta, indonesia was determined using routine bacteriology and molecular assay techniques. bacterial pathogens isolated from hospital patients were, in decreasing frequency, vibrio cholerae o1, shigella flexneri, salmonella spp. and  campylobacter jejuni, while s. flexneri, v. cholerae o1, salmonella spp. and c. jejuni were isolated from the community patients. v. cholerae o1 was isolated more frequently (p<0.005) from the hospital patients than the community patients. overall, bacterial pathogens were isolated from 538 of 3875 (14%) enrolled cases  of diarrhea. enterotoxigenic escherichia coli were detected in 218 (18%) of 1244  rectal swabs. a small percentage of enterohemorrhagic e. coli (1%) and of clostridium difficile (1.3%) was detected. parasitic examination of 389 samples resulted in 43 (11%) positives comprising ascaris lumbricoides (1.5%), blastocystis hominis (5.7%), giardia lamblia (0.8%), trichuris trichiura (2.1%) and endolimax nana (0.5%). rotavirus (37.5%), adenovirus (3.3%) and norwalk-like  virus (17.6%) were also detected. antimicrobial resistance was observed among some isolates. bacterial isolates were susceptible to quinolones, with the exception of some isolates of c. jejuni which were resistant to ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid and norfloxacin. data obtained from this community- and hospital-based study will enable the indonesian ministry of health to plan relevant studies on diarrheal diseases in the archipelago.

TI  == environmental response and autoregulation of clostridium difficile txer, a sigma  factor for toxin gene expression.
AB  == txer, a sigma factor that directs clostridium difficile rna polymerase to recognize the promoters of two major toxin genes, was shown to stimulate its own  synthesis. whether expressed in c. difficile, clostridium perfringens, or escherichia coli, txer stimulated transcription of fusions of the txer promoter region to reporter genes. as is the case for the tox genes, txer expression was responsive to the cellular growth phase and the constituents of the medium. that  is, the level of expression in broth culture was low during the exponential growth phase, but rapidly increased as cells approached the stationary phase. in  the presence of excess glucose, expression from the txer promoter was repressed.  the results support a model for toxin gene expression in which synthesis of txer  is induced by specific environmental signals. the increased level of txer then permits high-level expression of the toxin genes. the study of txer gene regulation in c. difficile was made possible by introduction of a mobilizable, replicative plasmid via conjugation with e. coli.

TI  == antidiarrhoeal properties of a novel sigma ligand (jo 2871) on toxigenic diarrhoea in mice: mechanisms of action.
AB  == background and aims: sigma ligands display antisecretory activity against various secretagogues, suggesting antidiarrhoeal properties. in this study, we evaluated: (i) the antidiarrhoeal effect of jo 2871, a high affinity sigma ligand, in three  models of toxigenic diarrhoea in mice; and (ii) the site and mechanism of action  of this compound. methods: faeces were collected after toxin or vehicle administration in male dba2 or nmri mice. diarrhoea was determined by cumulative  stool weight (mg) over a 120 minute period. diarrhoea was induced by intravenous  administration of salmonella enteriditis lipopolysaccharide (lps), or oral administration of escherichia coli heat stable (e coli-sta) or clostridium difficile toxins. two sigma ligands, igmesine and jo 2871, were administered either orally or intravenously, 60 and 30 minutes before the toxins, respectively. jo 2871 was also given orally 30 minutes after e coli-sta. in addition, jo 2871 was administered intracerebroventricularly five minutes before  lps and e coli-sta. bmy 14802 (1000 microg/kg orally), a sigma receptor antagonist, or cyclosomatostatin (css 1 microg/kg intravenously), a somatostatin  antagonist, were given five minutes prior to jo 2871 in lps, e coli-sta, and c difficile toxin treated mice. gastric emptying and intestinal transit were evaluated after oral jo 2871 and bmy 14802 and intravenous css. results: stool weight measured 120 minutes after administration of the toxins was significantly  increased. oral jo 2871 and igmesine dose dependently inhibited toxigenic diarrhoea in all models. ed(50) values obtained using jo 2871 (1-20 microg/kg) were more than 40 times lower than those obtained with igmesine. oral jo 2871 given after e coli-sta also inhibited diarrhoea in a dose dependent manner (ed(50) 50 microg/kg). both sigma ligands were active by the intravenous route on lps and e coli-sta induced stool weight increases. jo 2871 administered intracerebroventricularly failed to block this effect at any dose tested. both bmy 14802 and css reversed the antidiarrhoeal effect of oral jo 2871. jo 2871, bmy 14802, and css did not affect transit parameters. conclusions: jo 2871 exerts a potent oral antidiarrhoeal effect, acting peripherally through sigma sites and  somatostatin release.

TI  == binding of clostridium difficile surface layer proteins to gastrointestinal tissues.
AB  == clostridium difficile is the etiological agent of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, a potentially serious condition frequently affecting elderly hospitalized patients. while tissue damage is primarily induced by two toxins, the mechanism of gut colonization, and particularly the role of bacterial adherence to the mucosa, remains to be clarified. previous studies have shown binding of c. difficile whole cells to cultured cell lines and suggested the existence of multiple adhesins, only one of which has been molecularly characterized. in this  paper, we have investigated tissue binding of c. difficile surface layer proteins (slps), which are the predominant outer surface components and are encoded by the slpa gene. the adherence of c. difficile to hep-2 cells was studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, which showed that antibodies to the high-molecular-weight (mw) slp inhibited adherence. immunohistochemical analysis of human gastrointestinal tissue sections revealed strong binding both to the surface epithelium lining the digestive cavities and to the subjacent lamina propria, while glands were negative. a similar pattern was observed in the mouse. by using purified recombinant slps, we show that binding is largely mediated by the high-mw slp. by western blotting analysis, we have identified two potential ligands of the c. difficile slps, one of which may be specific to the gut. by using purified extracellular matrix components immobilized on nitrocellulose, we also show slp binding to collagen i, thrombospondin, and vitronectin, but not to collagen iv, fibronectin, or laminin. these results raise the possibility that the slps play a role both in the initial colonization of the gut by c. difficile and in the subsequent inflammatory reaction.

TI  == a survey of agents associated with neonatal diarrhea in iowa swine including clostridium difficile and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus.
AB  == this survey was undertaken to determine the relative frequency of agents that are currently associated with neonatal diarrhea in swine, including clostridium difficile and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv). the subjects for this study were the first 100 live 1-7-day-old piglets submitted to  the iowa state university veterinary diagnostic laboratory with a clinical signalment of diarrhea, beginning on january 1, 2000. the evaluation of each pig  included bacterial culture of a section of ileum, 2 sections of jejunum, and a single section of colon; a fluorescent antibody test (fat) or immunohistochemistry (ihc) for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev); elisa's for rotavirus and c. difficile toxins; ihc for prrsv; and microscopic examination of ileum, midjejunum, spiral colon, liver, spleen, and lung. survey results demonstrate a decline in the relative number of diagnoses of tgev, escherichia coli, and clostridium perfringens type c compared with retrospective  data. the combined case frequency rate for these 3 pathogens dropped from 70% in  1988 to 21% in 2000. this survey also demonstrated the emergence of c. difficile  as an important pathogen of neonatal swine. clostridium difficle toxin was detected in the colon contents of 29% of the piglets, and at least 1 toxin-positive animal was identified in 55% of the cases. all 29 c. difficile toxin-positive piglets had mesocolonic edema, and colitis was observed in 21 of 29 toxin-positive animals. prrsv-positive macrophages were detected in the lamina propria of intestinal villi by ihc in 10 piglets with diarrhea. in 6 of these cases, prrsv was the only pathogen detected. gross and microscopic lung lesions were not a reliable indicator of prrsv infection in these neonatal pigs with diarrhea. the addition of tests for c. difficile and prrsv to a routine neonatal  diarrhea diagnostic protocol resulted in a significant increase in thediagnostic  success rate on both individual animal and case bases.

AB  == the toxin genes of clostridium difficile have been previously cloned by reconstructing the entire gene in a series of steps in sequence using several cloned fragments. amplification of a 7.9 kb fragment corresponding to the toxin b gene (tcdb) was obtained with expand long template pcr system. the amplified fragment was inserted into the e. coli expression vector pbad and cloned into competent e. coli top 10 cells. tcdb gene sequences representing the complete toxin gene were detected in 3/120 (2.5%) clones analyzed. culture filtrates of 2/3 clones were found to have cytotoxic activity in human lung fibroblasts. the recombinant protein expressed in e. coli was identified as toxin b by western immunoblot analysis using c. sordellii antitoxin. this rapid cloning method may be useful in determining the role that individual genes in the pathogenicity locus (paloc) play in the virulence of c. difficile. our results also suggest that the activity of toxin b is independent of other genes in the paloc.

TI  == etiology of diarrhea in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in south india.
AB  == background: no studies so far have examined enteric infections in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation (bmt) in developing countries where asymptomatic carriage and colonization with enteric pathogens is frequent. methods: a prospective study followed 65 patients who underwent bmt in south india between 1995 and 1998. patients were screened for enteric pathogens before  transplantation, weekly during the first 4 weeks after transplantation, and during all episodes of diarrhea. results: enteric pathogens were found in 60% of  patients before or after transplantation. pretransplantation screening revealed asymptomatic excretion of enteric pathogens in 29% (19/65). forty-eight percent of patients undergoing bmt developed diarrhea. diarrhea was mainly of noninfectious origin in the first 20 days after transplantation. more than 20 days after transplantation, the major causes of diarrhea were graft-versus-host disease and infection. parasitic infections other than cryptosporidium did not contribute significantly to morbidity in the pre- and posttransplantation period. rotavirus and adenoviruses were found in approximately 12% and 5% of subjects, respectively. bacterial infections in the posttransplantation period were found to be more common in india than in developed countries. clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea was seen in the posttransplantation period but not  before transplantation. enterotoxigenic and enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli caused symptomatic infections in the posttransplantation period, but the association of other classes of diarrheogenic e. coli with diarrhea was doubtful. conclusions: there was significantly higher mortality (p<0.01) in patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic gastrointestinal infections caused by bacteria than in patients with parasitic or viral infections or without enteric infections.

AB  == a prospective study of 62 chemotherapy-induced neutropenic episodes in patients with acute leukaemia was conducted to determine the incidence and causes of abdominal infections, and to assess the diagnostic value of the combined use of ultrasonography (us) and microbiology. each patient underwent us of liver, gallbladder and complete bowel before chemotherapy, on days 2-4 after the end of  chemotherapy and in cases of fever, diarrhoea or abdominal pain. us was combined  with a standardized clinical examination and a broad spectrum of microbiological  investigations. from january to august 2001, 243 us examinations were performed.  the overall incidence of abdominal infectious diseases was 17.7% (11 out of 62, 95% confidence interval (ci): 9-29%). four patients (6.5%) developed neutropenic  enterocolitis; two of them died, two survived. bowel wall thickening (bwt) > 4 mm in these four patients ranged from 5.8 to 23.6 mm and was detected only in one patient with mucositis. in three other patients (4.8%) clostridium difficile, and in one patient (1.6%) campylobacter jejuni, caused enterocolitis without bwt. cholecystitis was diagnosed in three patients (4.8%) and hepatic candidiasis was  strongly suspected in one patient. abdominal infections caused by gastroenteritis viruses, cytomegalovirus (cmv) or cryptosporidium were not observed. we conclude  that in neutropenic patients with acute leukaemia receiving chemotherapy: (i) bwt is not a feature of chemotherapy-induced mucositis and should therefore be considered as sign of infectious enterocolitis; (ii) viruses, classic bacterial enteric pathogens (salmonella, shigella, yersinia, campylobacter, aeromonas, vibrio subsp., enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli) and cryptosporidium have a very low incidence; and (iii) abdominal infections may be underestimated when us  is not used in every patient with abdominal pain.

TI  == molecular characterization of phenyllactate dehydratase and its initiator from clostridium sporogenes.
AB  == the heterotrimeric phenyllactate dehydratase from clostridium sporogenes, fldabc, catalyses the reversible dehydration of (r)-phenyllactate to (e)-cinnamate in two steps: (i) coa-transfer from the cofactor cinnamoyl-coa to phenyllactate to yield phenyllactyl-coa and the product cinnamate mediated by flda, a (r)-phenyllactate  coa-transferase; followed by (ii) dehydration of phenyllactyl-coa to cinnamoyl-coa mediated by heterodimeric fldbc, a phenyllactyl-coa dehydratase. phenyllactate dehydratase requires initiation by atp, mgcl2 and a reducing agent  such as dithionite mediated by an extremely oxygen-sensitive initiator protein (fldi) present in the cell-free extract. all four genes coding for these proteins were cloned and shown to be clustered in the order fldaibc, which shares over 95% sequence identity of nucleotide and protein levels with a gene cluster detected in the genome of the closely related clostridium botulinum hall strain a. flda shows sequence similarities to a new family of coa-transferases, which apparently do not form covalent enzyme coa-ester intermediates. an n-terminal strep ii-tag containing enzymatically active fldi was overproduced and purified from escherichia coli. fldi was characterized as a homodimeric protein, which contains one [4fe-4s]1+/2+ cluster with an electron spin s = 3/2 in the reduced form. the  amino acid sequence as well as the chemical and epr-properties of the pure protein are very similar to those of component a of 2-hydroxyglutaryl-coa dehydratase from acidaminococcus fermentans (hgdc), which was able to replace fldi in the activation of phenyllactate dehydratase. only in the oxidized state,  fldi and component a exhibit significant atpase activity, which appears to be essential for unidirectional electron transfer. both subunits of phenyllactyl-coa dehydratase (fldbc) show significant sequence similarities to both subunits of 2-hydroxyglutaryl-coa dehydratase (hgdab). the fldaibc gene cluster resembles the hadaibc gene cluster in the genome of clostridium difficile and the hadabc,i genes in c. botulinum. the four subunits of these deduced 2-hydroxyacid dehydratases (65-81% amino acid sequence identity between the had genes) probably code for a 2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydratase involved in leucine fermentation. this enzyme could be the target for metronidazole in the treatment of pseudomembranous enterocolitis caused by c. difficile.

AB  == objective: to determine the frequency with which clostridium difficile was detected in stool specimens from outpatients and patients hospitalized for less than 4 days to assess the usefulness of routine laboratory screening for detecting this enteric pathogen. methods: seven hundred and forty-one specimens from 398 patients were cultured over a 6-month period for salmonella, shigella, yersinia, escherichia coli o157:h7, campylobacter and clostridium difficile. clostridium difficile culture-positive samples were further tested for cytotoxin  production. results: campylobacter, salmonella, shigella and e. coli o157:h7 were isolated in 50 (6.7%) specimens from 35 (8.8%) patients. clostridium difficile was cultured from 88 (11.9%) specimens from 35 (8.8%) patients and its cytotoxin  detected in 35 (4.7%) specimens of 12 (3%) patients. clostridium difficile was the second most frequent enteric pathogen after campylobacter. of 178 (24%) specimens submitted with a specific request for clostridium difficile testing, 13 (7.3%) were cytotoxin positive (three patients); of 563 specimens for which clostridium difficile was not requested, 22 (3.9%) were cytotoxin positive (nine  patients). conclusions: nine of 12 patients with cytotoxin-positive specimens would have gone undiagnosed in the laboratory had all stool samples submitted not been tested. these results suggest that clostridium difficile disease is under-recognized and that testing all stool samples for clostridium difficile may be warranted in our community of patients.

TI  == linkage between toxin production and purine biosynthesis in clostridium difficile.
AB  == the production of toxins a and b by clostridium difficile was greatly enhanced under biotin-limited conditions, in which a 140-kda protein was expressed strongly. gene cloning revealed that this protein was a homologue of formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide synthetase (fgam synthetase, ec 6.3.5.3), which is known as purl in escherichia coli and catalyses the fourth step of the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway. this enzyme consisted of a single polypeptide, although fgam synthetases of gram-positive bacteria usually consist  of two subunits. inhibition of the enzymic activity of c. difficile purl by o-diazoacetyl-l-serine (azaserine) resulted in enhanced toxin b production even in biotin-sufficient conditions. in contrast, blockade of the preceding step of the purl catalysing step by sulfamethoxazole inhibited toxin b production almost  completely. these results suggest that accumulation of formylglycinamide ribonucleotide (fgar), a substrate of fgam synthetase, enhances toxin production  by c difficile and depletion of fgar reduces toxin production.

(neural and hormonal mechanisms that regulate normal mucosal ion transport are not discussed.) the manner in which vibrio cholerae, several pathotypes of escherichia coli, several salmonella serotypes, rotavirus, campylobacter species, shigella dysenteriae, yersinia species and clostridium difficile perturb these mechanisms and cause diarrhea, is discussed. throughout the article, the main emphasis is on experimental studies designed to elucidate biological mechanisms and (where relevant) the microbial determinants responsible for diarrheal disease. allusions are also made to the involvement of host responses such as the inflammatory response, the production and release of potent cytokines and accelerated homeostatic responses (such as increased rates of crypt cell division seen in some infections), and the role that they play in pathophysiological fluid secretion.

TI  == iron-sulfur flavoprotein (isf) from methanosarcina thermophila is the prototype of a widely distributed family.
AB  == a total of 35 homologs of the iron-sulfur flavoprotein (isf) from methanosarcina  thermophila were identified in databases. all three domains were represented, and multiple homologs were present in several species. an unusually compact cysteine  motif ligating the 4fe-4s cluster in isf is conserved in all of the homologs except two, in which either an aspartate or a histidine has replaced the second cysteine in the motif. a phylogenetic analysis of isf homologs identified four subgroups, two of which were supported by bootstrap data. three homologs from metabolically and phylogenetically diverse species in the bacteria and archaea domains (af3 from archaeoglobus fulgidus, cd1 from clostridium difficile, and mj2 from methanococcus jannaschii) were overproduced in escherichia coli. each homolog purified as a homodimer, and the uv-visible absorption spectra were nearly identical to that of isf. after reconstitution with iron, sulfide, and flavin mononucleotide (fmn) the homologs contained six to eight nonheme iron atoms and 1.6 to 1.7 fmn molecules per dimer, suggesting that two 4fe-4s or 3fe-4s clusters and two fmn cofactors were bound to each dimer, which is consistent with isf data. homologs af3 and mj2 were reduced by co in reactions catalyzed by cell extract of acetate-grown m. thermophila, but cd1 was not. homologs af3 and mj2 were reduced by co in reactions catalyzed by a. fulgidus and m. jannaschii cell extracts. cell extract of clostridium thermoaceticum catalyzed co reduction of cd1. our database sequence analyses and biochemical characterizations indicate that isf is the prototype of a family of iron-sulfur flavoproteins that occur in members of all three domains.

TI  == characterization of the enzymatic component of the adp-ribosyltransferase toxin cdta from clostridium difficile.
AB  == certain strains of clostridium difficile produce the adp-ribosyltransferase cdt,  which is a binary actin adp-ribosylating toxin. the toxin consists of the binding component cdtb, which mediates receptor binding and cellular uptake, and the enzyme component cdta. here we studied the enzyme component (cdta) of the toxin using the binding component of clostridium perfringens iota toxin (ib), which is  interchangeable with cdtb as a transport component. ib was used because cdtb was  not expressed as a recombinant protein in escherichia coli. similar to iota toxin, cdta adp-ribosylates nonmuscle and skeletal muscle actin. the n-terminal part of cdta (cdta1-240) competes with full-length cdta for binding to the iota toxin binding component. the c-terminal part (cdta244-263) harbors the enzyme activity but was much less active than the full-length cdta. changes of glu428 and glu430 to glutamine, ser388 to alanine, and arg345 to lysine blocked adp-ribosyltransferase activity. comparison of cdta with c. perfringens iota toxin and clostridium botulinum c2 toxin revealed full enzyme activity of the fragment ia208-413 but loss of activity of several n-terminally deleted c2i proteins including c2i103-431, c2i190-431, and c2i30-431. the data indicate that  cdta belongs to the iota toxin subfamily of binary actin adp-ribosylating toxins  with respect to interaction with the binding component and substrate specificity. it shares typical conserved amino acid residues with iota toxin and c2 toxin that are suggested to be involved in nad-binding and/or catalytic activity. the enzyme components of cdt, iota toxin, and c2 toxin differ with respect to the minimal structural requirement for full enzyme activity.

AB  == gnotobiotic wistar rats were produced using gnotobiotic techniques, which were established in the production of a spf mouse colony, in order to establish a barrier-sustained colony. one strain of escherichia coli, 28 strains of bacteriodaceae (b-strains), three strains of lactobacillus (l-strains) and a chloroform-treated fecal suspension (chf, clostridium mixture) were prepared from conventional wistar rats as the microflora source. two groups of limited-flora rats, e. coli plus b-strains and e. coli plus chf, were produced. after confirmation that clostridium difficile was not detected in the chf-inoculated rats, two groups of limited-flora rats were transferred to an isolator and housed together in a cage. these rats were then orally inoculated with l-strains. the gnotobiotic rats showed colonization resistance to pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the number of e. coli in the feces was 10(5) to 10(6)/g. the gnotobiotic rats were transferred to a barrier room as a source of intestinal flora for spf colonies. in the spf rats, basic cecal flora was mainly composed of bacteroidaceae, clostridia, fusiform-shaped bacteria and lactobacilli, and did not change over a long period. their flora became similar to that of conventional rats.

TI  == evidence for holin function of tcde gene in the pathogenicity of clostridium difficile.
AB  == toxigenic strains of clostridium difficile produce two large bacterial toxins called toxins a (tcda) and b (tcdb). tcda and tcdb genes are located on the pathogenicity locus of c. difficile, a unique characteristic of toxigenic strains of this species. intergenic to the two toxin genes is tcde, a small 501-bp open reading frame of unknown function. expression of the tcde gene in escherichia coli caused bacterial cell death. computational analysis of the amino acid sequence of tcde revealed structural features that are strikingly similar to a class of bacteriophage proteins called holins. holins are cytolytic proteins that cause lysis of bacterial hosts to effect the release of progeny phages. further analysis of the recombinant clone expressing tcde by transmission electron microscopy confirmed that the site of action of tcde is on the bacterial cell membrane. the results provide evidence that tcde is structurally and functionally similar to holin proteins. tcde may function as a lytic protein to facilitate the release of tcda and tcdb to the extracellular environment, as these toxins lack signal peptide.

TI  == effect of probiotics on enterocyte bacterial translocation in vitro.
AB  == enteral probiotics such as lactobacillus casei gg (lgg) have been used in the treatment of a variety of intestinal disorders in infants and children, including diarrhea, malabsorption, and clostridium difficile colitis. we have previously demonstrated that the probiotic bacterium lgg has an inhibitory effect on bacterial translocation (bt) in a neonatal rabbit model. however, this in-vivo model is limited for investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for probiotic inhibition of bt. the purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of lgg in reducing the rate of escherichia coli c25 (e. coli c25) translocation using an in-vitro enterocyte cell-culture model. human colonic carcinoma (caco-2) enterocytes were seeded in porous filters in the apical chamber of a two-chamber cell-culture system and grown for 14 days to confluence. the monolayers were incubated at 37 degrees c with lgg for 180 min. non-adherent lgg was washed away prior to a 120-min incubation period with 10(5)  cfu e. coli c25. e. coli that had translocated across the enterocyte monolayer were quantified by growing basal-chamber media samples on gram-negative bacteria-specific macconkey's agar. in order to determine monolayer integrity, transepithelial electrical resistance (teer) was measured across caco-2 cells treated with lgg and e. coli. statistical analysis was by anova with p < 0.05 considered significant. lgg inhibited e. coli translocation at all lgg concentrations tested. the teer ratio was not significantly altered by addition of lgg or e. coli (0.9 +/- 0.03 vs 0.8 +/- 0.05). these results demonstrate that  the probiotic bacterium lgg inhibits bt of e. coli c25 in a dose-dependent manner in an in-vitro cell-culture model. this model should be valuable in investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the inhibition of pathological  enteral bacteria by probiotic agents.

TI  == molecular characterization of the surface layer proteins from clostridium difficile.
AB  == many bacteria express a surface-exposed proteinaceous layer, termed the s-layer,  which forms a regular two-dimensional array visible by electron microscopy. clostridium difficile is unusual in expressing two s-layer proteins (slps), which are of varying size in a number of strains. in an approach combining molecular biology with mass spectrometric sequencing strategies, we have identified the structural gene (slpa) for the s-layer from three strains of c. difficile. both proteins are derived from a common precursor, and processing involves the removal of a signal peptide and a second cleavage to release the two mature slps. to our  knowledge, this is the first example in which two slps have been shown to derive  from a single gene product through post-translational processing, rather than from the expression of separate genes. the higher molecular weight (mw) slp is highly conserved among the three strains, whereas the lower mw slp shows considerable sequence diversity, reflecting the results from western blotting. the high-mw slp shows weak homology to n-acetyl muramoyl-l-alanine amidase from bacillus subtilis, and both the native slp from c. difficile and a recombinant protein expressed in escherichia coli were found to display amidase activity by zymography. the high-mw slps showed evidence of glycosylation, whereas the lower  mw proteins did not. a family of genes with sequence homology to the amidase domain of the high-mw slp was identified in the c. difficile strain 630 genome, some of which are located in the same region of the genome as slpa and were shown by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) analysis to be transcribed.

TI  == intestinal epithelial damage in sids babies and its similarity to that caused by  bacterial toxins in the rabbit.
AB  == sections of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum and large intestine from 14 sudden infant death syndrome (sids) babies were examined by scanning (sem) and transmission electron microscopy (tem). the type and amount of damage was characterised and quantitated and compared with the presence of clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus in faecal samples from the babies and toxins from the bacteria in faecal samples and serum from the babies. the data were compared with the damage that these toxins cause to the rabbit intestinal epithelium (see the previous paper in this issue). damage was present in most of the sids samples, varying from 0 to 96%, and most damage occurred when the faecal samples contained the above bacteria and their toxins. damage varied from removal of microvilli, damage to villus tips, separation of and removal of epithelial cells from the lamina propria, and removal of enterocytes leaving goblet and tuft cells, to damage and breakdown of  the lamina propria. the results support the hypothesis that the cause of death in a significant proportion of sids babies may result from the absorption of toxins  from the intestinal tract initiating a toxic shock reaction.

TI  == the effect of bacterial enterotoxins implicated in sids on the rabbit intestine.
AB  == the aim of this project was to characterise the type of damage caused to the intestine of the infant rabbit by bacterial enterotoxins implicated in sudden infant death syndrome (sids). samples of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum and large intestine exposed to the toxins for up to 6 hours were examined by scanning (sem) and transmission electron microscopy (tem). the damage was quantitatively assessed (% villi damaged) by sem and qualitatively by sem and tem. clostridium perfringens enterotoxin, staphylococcal enterotoxin b and clostridium difficile toxin a + toxin b combined all caused severe damage to the villi in the small intestine (80-90% damage). clostridium difficile toxin b caused only slight damage (17% to the jejunum, 26% to the caecum). clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin caused moderate damage to the small intestine (duodenum 34%, caecum 35%), and escherichia coli sta caused significant damage to the small (53-70%) and large intestine (51%). the level of toxin damage increased with time, the small intestine being more susceptible generally to damage than the large intestine. each toxin differed in its ability to damage the villi, microvilli, enterocytes and lamina propria.

TI  == regulation of toxin synthesis in clostridium difficile by an alternative rna polymerase sigma factor.
AB  == clostridium difficile, a causative agent of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and its potentially lethal form, pseudomembranous colitis, produces two large protein toxins that are responsible for the cellular damage associated with the disease.  the level of toxin production appears to be critical for determining the severity of the disease, but the mechanism by which toxin synthesis is regulated is unknown. the product of a gene, txer, that lies just upstream of the tox gene cluster was shown to be needed for tox gene expression in vivo and to activate promoter-specific transcription of the tox genes in vitro in conjunction with rna polymerases from c. difficile, bacillus subtilis, or escherichia coli. txer was shown to function as an alternative sigma factor for rna polymerase. because homologs of txer regulate synthesis of toxins and a bacteriocin in other clostridium species, txer appears to be a prototype for a novel mode of regulation of toxin genes.

TI  == probiotic activities of lactobacillus casei rhamnosus: in vitro adherence to intestinal cells and antimicrobial properties.
AB  == the interest of probiotics as remedies for a broad number of gastrointestinal and other infectious diseases has gained wide interest over the last few years, but little is known about their underlying mechanism of action. in this study, the probiotic activities of a human isolate of lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus strain (lcr35) were investigated. using intestinal caco-2 cell line in an in vitro model, we demonstrated that this strain exhibited adhesive properties. the  inhibitory effects of lcr35 organisms on the adherence of three pathogens, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) and klebsiella pneumoniae, were determined. a decrease in the number of adhering pathogens was observed, using either preincubation, postincubation or coincubation of the pathogens with lcr35. moreover, the antibacterial activities  of cell-free lcr35 supernatant was examined against nine human pathogenic bacteria, etec, epec, k. pneumoniae, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficile. the growth of all strains was inhibited, as measured by determining the number of viable bacteria over time, but no bactericidal activity was detected in this in vitro assay. together, these findings suggest that this probiotic strain could be used to prevent colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by a large variety of pathogens.

TI  == characterization of a cell surface protein of clostridium difficile with adhesive properties.
AB  == our laboratory has previously shown that clostridium difficile adherence to cultured cells is enhanced after heat shock at 60 degrees c and that it is mediated by a proteinaceous surface component. the present study was undertaken to identify the surface molecules of this bacterium that could play a role in its adherence to the intestine. the cwp66 gene, encoding a cell surface-associated protein of c. difficile 79-685, was isolated by immunoscreening of a c. difficile gene library with polyclonal antibodies against c. difficile heated at 60 degrees c. the cwp66 protein (66 kda) contains two domains, each carrying three imperfect repeats and one presenting homologies to the autolysin cwlb of bacillus subtilis. a survey of 36 strains of c. difficile representing 11 serogroups showed that the 3' portion of the cwp66 gene is variable; this was confirmed by sequencing of cwp66 from another strain, c-253. two recombinant protein fragments corresponding to the two domains of cwp66 were expressed in fusion with glutathione s-transferase in escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography using gluthatione-sepharose 4b. antibodies raised against the two domains recognized cwp66 in bacterial surface extracts. by immunoelectron microscopy, the c-terminal domain was found to be cell surface exposed. when used as inhibitors in cell binding studies, the antibodies and protein fragments partially inhibited adherence of c. difficile to cultured cells, confirming that cwp66 is an adhesin, the first to be identified in clostridia.

TI  == p-hydroxyphenylacetate decarboxylase from clostridium difficile. a novel glycyl radical enzyme catalysing the formation of p-cresol.
AB  == the human pathogenic bacterium clostridium difficile is a versatile organism concerning its ability to ferment amino acids. the formation of p-cresol as the main fermentation product of tyrosine by c. difficile is unique among clostridial species. the enzyme responsible for p-cresol formation is p-hydroxyphenylacetate  decarboxylase. the enzyme was purified from c. difficile strain dmsz 1296(t) and  initially characterized. the n-terminal amino-acid sequence was 100% identical to an open reading frame in the unfinished genome of c. difficile strain 630. the orf encoded a protein of the same size as the purified decarboxylase and was very similar to pyruvate formate-lyase-like proteins from escherichia coli and archaeoglobus fulgidus. the enzyme decarboxylated p-hydroxyphenylacetate (k(m) =  2.8 mm) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate (k(m) = 0.5 mm). it was competitively inhibited by the substrate analogues p-hydroxyphenylacetylamide and p-hydroxymandelate with k(i) values of 0.7 mm and 0.48 mm, respectively. the protein was readily and irreversibly inactivated by molecular oxygen. although the purified enzyme was active in the presence of sodium sulfide, there are some  indications for an as yet unidentified low molecular mass cofactor that is required for catalytic activity in vivo. based on the identification of p-hydroxyphenylacetate decarboxylase as a novel glycyl radical enzyme and the substrate specificity of the enzyme, a catalytic mechanism involving ketyl radicals as intermediates is proposed.

TI  == groel (hsp60) of clostridium difficile is involved in cell adherence.
AB  == previous results have demonstrated that adherence of clostridium difficile to tissue culture cells is augmented by various stresses; this study focussed on whether the groel heat shock protein is implicated in this process. the 1940 bp groesl operon of c. difficile was isolated by pcr. the 1623 bp groel gene is highly conserved between various c. difficile isolates as determined by rflp-pcr  and dna sequencing, and the operon is present in one copy on the bacterial chromosome. the 58 kda groel protein was expressed in escherichia coli in fusion  with glutathione s:-transferase and the fusion protein was purified from iptg-induced bacterial lysates by affinity chromatography on glutathione-sepharose. a polyclonal, monospecific antiserum was obtained for groel which established by immunoelectron microscopy, indirect immunofluorescence and immunoblot analysis that groel is released extracellularly after heat shock and can be surface associated. cell fractionation experiments suggest that groel  is predominantly cytoplasmic and membrane bound. groel-specific antibodies as well as the purified protein partially inhibited c. difficile cell attachment and expression of the protein was induced by cell contact, suggesting a role for groel in cell adherence.

TI  == clostridium difficile toxins a and b can alter epithelial permeability and promote bacterial paracellular migration through ht-29 enterocytes.
AB  == clostridium difficile toxins a and b are the widely recognized etiologic agents of antibiotic-associated diseases ranging from diarrhea to pseudomembranous colitis. we hypothesized that c. difficile toxins may alter intestinal epithelial permeability and facilitate bacterial penetration of the intestinal epithelial barrier. experiments were designed to clarify the effects of c. difficile toxins  a and b on the flux of inert particles across ht-29 enterocyte monolayers, and to correlate these results with bacteria-enterocyte interactions. in all experiments, mature, confluent ht-29 cultures were preincubated 16 h with toxin a or b (1-100 ng/ml). to study alterations in epithelial permeability, toxin-treated enterocytes were incubated with 5 pm solutions of 10- and 40-kd inert dextran particles. toxin a, but not toxin b, was associated with increased  dextran flux through enterocyte monolayers. to study bacteria-enterocyte interactions, toxin-treated enterocytes were incubated with 10(8) salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, or escherichia coli. although numbers of internalized bacteria were generally unaffected, both toxins were associated with increased bacterial adherence, as well as increased bacterial transmigration through enterocyte monolayers. bacterial transmigration was significantly greater using toxin a- compared to toxin b-treated enterocytes, consistent with the observation that dextran flux was significantly greater using toxin a- compared to toxin b-treated enterocytes. thus intestinal colonization with toxigenic c. difficile may facilitate bacterial penetration of the intestinal epithelium by a  mechanism involving increased permeability of the intestinal epithelial barrier.

AB  == although there has been extensive investigation of the biochemical consequences of the interactions between bacterial enterotoxins and intestinal epithelial cells and the mechanisms by which they induce intestinal secretion, relatively little attention has been given to other aspects of the host response to these enterotoxins. there is now compelling evidence that the enteric nervous system has a major role in enhancing the secretory state induced by cholera toxin, the e. coli enterotoxins and possibly c. difficile toxin a. cholera toxin for example is thought to activate a neural reflex via the release of 5-hydroxytryptamine from enterochromaffin cells. neurotransmitters involved in the reflex include substance p and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. delineation of these neural pathways may offer new possibilities for the pharmacological control of enterotoxin-mediated secretion.

TI  == novel targets for the pharmacotherapy of diarrhoea: a view for the millennium.
AB  == acute diarrhoea continues to carry a high morbidity and mortality worldwide. intestinal infection is the major cause of acute diarrhoea although the prevalence of individual pathogens varies according to geographic location. in many countries in the industrialized world, reports of intestinal infections continue to increase; these are largely related to waterborne and foodborne outbreaks. acute diarrhoea may be due to increased intestinal secretion, commonly as a result of infection with enterotoxin-producing organisms (enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, vibrio cholerae) or to decreased intestinal absorption from infection with organisms that damage the intestinal epithelium (enteropathogenic  e. coli, shigella sp., salmonella sp.). although oral rehydration therapy has reduced the mortality associated with acute diarrhoea, the diarrhoea attack rate  remains unchanged and stool volume often increases during the rehydration process. the search for agents that will directly inhibit intestinal secretory mechanisms and thereby reduce stool volume has been going on for more than 20 years. research during the past decade has highlighted the importance of neurohumoral mechanisms in the pathogenesis of diarrhoea, notably the role of 5-hydroxytryptamine, substance p, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and neural reflexes within the enteric nervous system. cholera toxin, e. coli enterotoxins and clostridium difficile toxin a are known to invoke these mechanisms in diarrhoea pathogenesis. this new dimension of intestinal pathophysiology has already exposed possible novel targets for anti-secretory therapy, namely, 5-ht receptor antagonists, substance p antagonists and the possibility for potentiating the proabsorptive effects of endogenous enkephalins by use of enkephalinase inhibitors. there now seems to be a real possibility that anti-secretory therapy will become more widely available in the future.

TI  == the large resolvase tndx is required and sufficient for integration and excision  of derivatives of the novel conjugative transposon tn5397.
AB  == tn5397 is a novel conjugative transposon, originally isolated from clostridium difficile. this element can transfer between c. difficile strains and to and from bacillus subtilis. it encodes a conjugation system that is very similar to that of tn916. however, insertion and excision of tn5397 appears to be dependent on the product of the element encoded gene tndx, a member of the large resolvase family of site-specific recombinases. to test the role of tndx, the gene was cloned and the protein was expressed in escherichia coli. the ability of tndx to  catalyze the insertion and excision of derivatives (minitransposons) of tn5397 representing the putative circular and integrated forms, respectively, was investigated. tndx was required for both insertion and excision. mutagenesis studies showed that some of the highly conserved amino acids at the n-terminal resolvase domain and the c-terminal nonconserved region of tndx are essential for activity. analysis of the target site choices showed that the cloned tn5397 targets from c. difficile and b. subtilis were still hot spots for the minitransposon insertion in e. coli.

TI  == transposition of tn4451 and tn4453 involves a circular intermediate that forms a  promoter for the large resolvase, tnpx.
AB  == tn4451 is the paradigm element of a family of mobilizable chloramphenicol resistance transposons from clostridium perfringens and clostridium difficile. the unique feature of these 6.3 kb elements is that their excision to form a circular molecule is mediated by tnpx, a member of the large resolvase family of  site-specific recombinases. by optimizing the transposition assay system in escherichia coli, we showed that tn4453a from c. difficile transposed at a higher frequency than the c. perfringens element, tn4451, and that transposition of both tn4451 and tn4453a was significantly enhanced by the provision of a multicopy tnpx gene in trans. the complete nucleotide sequence of tn4453a was determined, but its comparison with tn4451 did not reveal why it transposed at a higher frequency. using experiments involving a chromosomal derivative of tn4453a, we have confirmed that the circular form is the transposition intermediate. as the tnpx gene is located very close to one end of these elements, primer extension analysis was used to determine the transcription start point. the results showed  that the formation of the circular intermediate creates a strong tnpx promoter, which consists of a -10 box originally located at the left end of the transposon  and a -35 box originally located at the right end. the data provide strong evidence that transcription of tnpx is likely to occur from the non-replicating circular intermediate, which would facilitate the subsequent insertion of the transient circular molecule. it is postulated that, when the transposon is in an  integrated state, transcription of tnpx would depend on the presence of an appropriately spaced -35 sequence in the dna flanking the insertion site or the presence of an alternative upstream promoter.

TI  == effect on the human normal microflora of oral antibiotics for treatment of urinary tract infections.
AB  == oral administration of antibiotics for treatment of urinary tract infections (utis) can cause ecological disturbances in the normal intestinal microflora. poorly absorbed drugs can reach the colon in active form, suppress susceptible microorganisms and disturb the ecological balance. suppression of the normal microflora may lead to reduced colonization resistance with subsequent overgrowth of pre-existing, naturally resistant microorganisms, such as yeasts and clostridium difficile. new colonization by resistant potential pathogens may also occur and may spread within the body or to other patients and cause severe infections. it is therefore important to learn more about the ecological effects  of antibacterial agents on the human microflora. the impact on intestinal microorganisms of oral antibiotics used for the treatment of utis is reviewed here. ampicillin, amoxycillin and co-amoxiclav suppress both the aerobic and anaerobic intestinal microflora with overgrowth of ampicillin-resistant enterobacteriaceae. pivmecillinam also affects the intestinal microflora, suppressing escherichia coli, but does not have a major effect on the anaerobic microflora. several orally administered cephalosporins, such as cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefprozil and ceftibuten, reduce the number of enterobacteriaceae and increase the number of enterococci. colonization with c. difficile has also been observed. fluoroquinolones eliminate or strongly suppress intestinal enterobacteriaceae, but affect enterococci and anaerobic bacteria only slightly.  when antimicrobial agents are prescribed for the treatment of utis, not only the  antimicrobial spectrum of the agent but also the potential ecological disturbances, including the risk of emergence of resistant strains, should be considered.

AB  == clostridium aminobutyricum ferments 4-aminobutyrate via succinic semialdehyde, 4-hydroxybutyrate, 4-hydroxybutyryl-coa and crotonyl-coa to acetate and butyrate. the genes coding for the enzymes that catalyse the interconversion of these intermediates are arranged in the order abfd (4-hydroxybutyryl-coa dehydratase),  abft (4-hydroxybutyrate coa-transferase), and abfh (nad-dependent 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase). the genes abfd and abft were cloned, sequenced  and expressed as active enzymes in escherichia coli. hence the insertion of the [4fe-4s]clusters and fad into the dehydratase required no additional specific protein from c. aminobutyricum. the amino acid sequences of the dehydratase and the coa-transferase revealed close relationships to proteins deduced from the genomes of clostridium difficile, porphyromonas gingivalis and archaeoglobus fulgidus. in addition the n-terminal part of the dehydratase is related to those  of a family of fad-containing mono-oxygenases from bacteria. the putative assignment in the databank of cat2 (orfz) from clostridium kluyveri as 4-hydroxybutyrate coa-transferase, which is thought to be involved in the reductive pathway from succinate to butyrate, was confirmed by sequence comparison with abft (57% identity). furthermore, an acetyl-coa:4-hydroxybutyrate coa-transferase activity could be detected in cell-free extracts of c. kluyveri.  in contrast to glutaconate coa-transferase from acidaminococcus fermentans, mutation studies suggested that the glutamate residue of the motive exg, which is conserved in many homologues of abft, does not form a coa-ester during catalysis.

TI  == bifidobacterium strains from resident infant human gastrointestinal microflora exert antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background and aims: the gastrointestinal microflora exerts a barrier effect against enteropathogens. the aim of this study was to examine if bifidobacteria,  a major species of the human colonic microflora, participates in the barrier effect by developing antimicrobial activity against enterovirulent bacteria. methods: antibacterial activity was examined in vitro against a wide range of gram negative and gram positive pathogens. inhibition of salmonella typhimurium sl1334 cell association and cell invasion was investigated in vitro using caco-2  cells. colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract in vivo by bifidobacteria was examined in axenic c3/he/oujco mice. antimicrobial activity was examined in vivo  in axenic c3/he/oujco mice infected by the lethal s typhimurium c5 strain. results: fourteen human bifidobacterium strains isolated from infant stools were  examined for antimicrobial activity. two strains (ca1 and f9) expressed antagonistic activity against pathogens in vitro, inhibited cell entry, and killed intracellular s typhimurium sl1344 in caco-2 cells. an antibacterial component(s) produced by ca1 and f9 was found to be a lipophilic molecule(s) with a molecular weight of less than 3500. in the axenic c3/he/oujco mice, ca1 and f9  strains colonised the intestinal tract and protected mice against s typhimurium c5 lethal infection. conclusion: several bifidobacterium strains from resident infant human gastrointestinal microflora exert antimicrobial activity, suggesting that they could participate in the "barrier effect" produced by the indigenous microflora.

TI  == [detection of toxin-producing pathogenic bacterial strains by polymerase chain reaction].
AB  == polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used for detection of pathogenic clostridium  botulinum, clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile, and escherichia coli.  with this aim in view, primers to botulinic toxins types a, b, c1, d, e, f, and g, perfringens enterotoxin, difficile toxin, and types 1 and 2 shigella-like toxins were chosen and synthesized. optimal amplification conditions were selected for each pair of primers, with dna and the respective agent as the reaction mixture matrices. pcr was highly specific and sensitive in all cases. its sensitivity was 10-100 cells/sample. among the tested c. botulinum, c. perfringens, c. difficile, and e. coli strains, specific amplification products of expected size were observed only in the strains containing the respective toxin genes. these findings recommend the use of these methods in clinical microbiology. strains containing type 2 shigella-like toxin gene were detected among e. coli strains isolated from patients with the hemolytic uremic syndrome,  which for the first time indicates that the problem with e. coli epidemic strain  o157 is valid for russia. as a result of our studies, test systems for detection  of types a, b, c, d, e, f, and g c. botulinum strains, c. perfringens and c. difficile, and e. coli o157 strains are now available.

TI  == effect on the human normal microflora of oral antibiotics for treatment of urinary tract infections.
AB  == oral administration of antibiotics for treatment of urinary tract infections (utis) can cause ecological disturbances in the normal intestinal microflora. poorly absorbed drugs can reach the colon in active form, suppress susceptible microorganisms and disturb the ecological balance. suppression of the normal microflora may lead to reduced colonization resistance with subsequent overgrowth of pre-existing, naturally resistant microorganisms, such as yeasts and clostridium difficile. new colonization by resistant potential pathogens may also occur and may spread within the body or to other patients and cause severe infections. it is therefore important to learn more about the ecological effects  of antibacterial agents on the human microflora. the impact on intestinal microorganisms of oral antibiotics used for the treatment of utis is reviewed here. ampicillin, amoxycillin and co-amoxiclav suppress both the aerobic and anaerobic intestinal microflora with overgrowth of ampicillin-resistant enterobacteriaceae. pivmecillinam also affects the intestinal microflora, suppressing escherichia coli, but does not have a major effect on the anaerobic microflora. several orally administered cephalosporins, such as cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefprozil and ceftibuten, reduce the number of enterobacteriaceae and increase the number of enterococci. colonization with c. difficile has also been observed. fluoroquinolones eliminate or strongly suppress intestinal enterobacteriaceae, but affect enterococci and anaerobic bacteria only slightly.  when antimicrobial agents are prescribed for the treatment of utis, not only the  antimicrobial spectrum of the agent but also the potential ecological disturbances, including the risk of emergence of resistant strains, should be considered.

TI  == rho gtpases as targets of bacterial protein toxins.
AB  == several bacterial toxins target rho gtpases, which constitute molecular switches  in several signaling processes and master regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. the biological activities of rho gtpases are blocked by c3-like transferases, which adp-ribosylate rho at asn41, but not rac or cdc42. large clostridial cytotoxins (e. g., clostridium difficile toxin a and b) glucosylate rho gtpases at thr37 (rho) or thr35 (rac/cdc42), thereby inhibiting rho functions by preventing effector coupling. the 'injected' toxins exos, yope and sptp from pseudomonas aeruginosa, yersinia and salmonella ssp., respectively, which are transferred into the eukaryotic target cells by the type-iii secretion system, inhibit rho functions by acting as rho gap proteins. rho gtpases are activated by the cytotoxic necrotizing factors cnf1 and cnf2 from escherichia coli and by the  dermonecrotizing toxin dnt from b. bronchiseptica. these toxins deamidate/transglutaminate gln63 of rho to block the intrinsic and gap-stimulated gtp hydrolysis, thereby constitutively activating the gtpases. rho gtpases are also activated by sope, a type-iii system injected protein from salmonella ssp.,  that acts as a gef protein.

TI  == in vitro activity of rifaximin, metronidazole and vancomycin against clostridium  difficile and the rate of selection of spontaneously resistant mutants against representative anaerobic and aerobic bacteria, including ammonia-producing species.
AB  == background: rifaximin is a rifamycin derivative characterized by a wide antibacterial activity. this drug is neither absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract nor inactivated by gastric juices, and exerts its action entirely within the intestinal lumen. methods: in this study, the activity of this antibiotic was compared with that of metronidazole and vancomycin against 93 clostridium difficile isolates. the rate of emergence of bacteria spontaneously resistant to  the new compound was also evaluated in relation to representative gram-positive and gram-negative strains. in terms of mic(50) values, rifaximin showed an intrinsic activity superior to that of the other agents. the emergence of spontaneously resistant strains was assessed with 46 aerobic (staphylococci, enterococci, proteus spp., citrobacter freundii, providencia rettgeri, enteropathogenic, enteroinvasive, enterotoxigenic and entero- hemorrhagic escherichia coli, and salmonella enteritidis) and anaerobic (clostridium spp., bacteroides spp., fusobacterium nucleatum and peptococcus spp.) pathogens, most of them also ammonium producers. two different methods, broth and agar dilution,  were employed. results: when liquid medium was employed, bacteria capable of sustained growth in 100 microg/ml of rifaximin were obtained after 2-5 transfers  with gram-positive aerobic cocci, 2-3 transfers with gram-negative aerobic strains and 2-5 transfers with anaerobic species. at the highest dose used with the agar dilution method (8 x mic), the frequency of emergence of spontaneously resistant mutants ranged from <1 x 10(-9) to 1.6 x 10(-8) with gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic cocci, while with aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, this value ranged from <1 x 10(-9) to 1.7 x 10(-7). c. difficile showed a particularly low incidence of spontaneously resistant mutants (<1 x 10(-9)). the low incidence of resistant subpopulations selected by levels of 8 x mic of rifaximin suggests that the high levels of the drug which were reached in the gastrointestinal lumen may further prevent the selection of mutants. conclusion:  the low toxicity, broad antibacterial activity and very poor absorption from the  gastrointestinal tract of rifaximin suggest a potential therapeutic use for this  drug in gastrointestinal diseases, as well as in the management of patients with  cirrhosis and chronic portal-systemic encephalopathy.

TI  == clostridium difficile recombinant toxin a repeating units as a carrier protein for conjugate vaccines: studies of pneumococcal type 14, escherichia coli k1, and shigella flexneri type 2a polysaccharides in mice.
AB  == unlike the native protein, a nontoxic peptide (repeating unit of the native toxin designated raru) from clostridium difficile toxin a (cdta) afforded an antigen that could be bound covalently to the surface polysaccharides of pneumococcus type 14, shigella flexneri type 2a, and escherichia coli k1. the yields of these  polysaccharide-protein conjugates were significantly increased by prior treatment of raru with succinic anhydride. conjugates, prepared with raru or succinylated (rarusucc), were administered to mice by a clinically relevant dosage and immunization scheme. all conjugates elicited high levels of serum immunoglobulin  g both to the polysaccharides and to cdta. conjugate-induced anti-cdta had neutralizing activity in vitro and protected mice challenged with cdta, similar to the raru alone. conjugates prepared with succinylated raru, therefore, have potential for serving both as effective carrier proteins for polysaccharides and  for preventing enteric disease caused by c. difficile.

TI  == the role of probiotic cultures in the control of gastrointestinal health.
AB  == the use of probiotics to enhance intestinal health has been proposed for many years. probiotics are traditionally defined as viable microorganisms that have a  beneficial effect in the prevention and treatment of specific pathologic conditions when they are ingested. there is a relatively large volume of literature that supports the use of probiotics to prevent or treat intestinal disorders. however, the scientific basis of probiotic use has been firmly established only recently, and sound clinical studies have begun to be published. currently, the best-studied probiotics are the lactic acid bacteria, particularly lactobacillus sp. and bifidobacterium sp. however, other organisms used as probiotics in humans include escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., enterococcus sp., bacteroides sp., bacillus sp., propionibacterium sp. and various fungi. some probiotic preparations contain mixtures of more than one bacterial strain. probiotics have been examined for their effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of a diverse spectrum of gastrointestinal disorders such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea (including clostridium difficile-associated intestinal disease), infectious bacterial and viral diarrhea (including diarrhea  caused by rotavirus, shigella, salmonella, enterotoxigenic e. coli, vibrio cholerae and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency disorder, enteral feeding diarrhea, helicobacter pylori gastroenteritis, sucrase maltase deficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, small bowel bacterial overgrowth and lactose intolerance. probiotics have been found to inhibit intestinal bacterial enzymes involved in the synthesis of colonic carcinogens. there are many mechanisms by which probiotics enhance intestinal health, including stimulation of immunity, competition for limited nutrients, inhibition of epithelial and mucosal adherence, inhibition of epithelial invasion and production of antimicrobial substances. probiotics represent an exciting prophylactic and therapeutic advance, although additional investigations must be  undertaken before their role in intestinal health can be delineated clearly.

TI  == a rho-related gtpase is involved in ca(2+)-dependent neurotransmitter exocytosis.
AB  == rho, rac, and cdc42 monomeric gtpases are well known regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and phosphoinositide metabolism and have been implicated in hormone  secretion in endocrine cells. here, we examine their possible implication in ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis of neurotransmitters. using subcellular fractionation procedures, we found that rhoa, rhob, rac1, and cdc42 are present in rat brain synaptosomes; however, only rac1 was associated with highly purified synaptic vesicles. to determine the synaptic function of these gtpases, toxins that impair rho-related proteins were microinjected into aplysia neurons. we used lethal toxin from clostridium sordellii, which inactivates rac; toxin b from clostridium difficile, which inactivates rho, rac, and cdc42; and c3 exoenzyme from clostridium botulinum and cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 from escherichia coli, which mainly affect rho. analysis of the toxin effects on evoked acetylcholine release revealed that a member of the rho family, most likely rac1, was implicated in the control of neurotransmitter release. strikingly, blockage of acetylcholine release by lethal toxin and toxin b could be completely removed in  <1 s by high frequency stimulation of nerve terminals. further characterization of the inhibitory action produced by lethal toxin suggests that rac1 protein regulates a late step in ca(2+)-dependent neuroexocytosis.

TI  == bacterial toxins inhibiting or activating small gtp-binding proteins.
AB  == amino acids located on the switch 1 or switch 2 domains of small gtpases of the ras and rho family are targets of several bacterial toxins. exoenzyme c3 from clostridium botulinum adp-ribosylates specifically rho at r43 and prevents the recruitment of rho on the cell membrane. this blocks the downstream effects of the rho gtpase. however, exoenzyme c3 is not a toxin, and chimeric proteins fusing c3 with the b moiety of either diphtheria toxin or pseudomonas aeruginosa  exotoxin a have been produced to intoxicate cells with low concentration of c3. c. difficile toxin b modifies by glucosylation rho on t37 and rac and cdc42 on t35. glucosylation of rho, rac, and cdc42 blocks the binding of these gtpases on  their downstream effectors. c. sordellii lethal toxin modifies ras, rap, and rac  on t35 by glucosylation. cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (cnf1), from uropathogenic escherichia coli strains, deamidates q63 of rho into e63, thereby blocking the intrinsic or gap-mediated gtpase of rho. this allows permanent activation of rho. thus, rho gtpases are targets for three different toxin activities. molecular mechanisms of these toxins are discussed.

TI  == identification of a novel genetic locus that is required for in vitro adhesion of a clinical isolate of enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli to epithelial cells.
AB  == enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) are food-borne intestinal pathogens with a low infectious dose. adhesion of some ehec strains to epithelial cells is  attributed, in part, to intimin, but other factors may be required for the intestinal colonizing ability of these bacteria. in order to identify additional  adherence factors of ehec, we generated transposon mutants of a clinical ehec isolate of serotype o111:h-, which displayed high levels of adherence to cultured chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells. one mutant was markedly deficient in cho cell  adherence, human red blood cell agglutination and autoaggregation. sequence analysis of the gene disrupted in this mutant revealed a 9669 bp novel chromosomal open reading frame (orf), which was designated efa1, for ehec factor  for adherence. efa1 displayed 28% amino acid identity with the predicted product  of a recently described orf from the haemolysin-encoding plasmid of ehec o157:h7. the amino termini of the putative products of these two genes exhibit up to 38% amino acid similarity to clostridium difficile toxins a and b. efa1 occurred within a novel genetic locus, at least 15 kb in length, which featured a low g+c  content, several insertion sequence homologues and a homologue of the shigella flexneri enterotoxin shet2. dna probes prepared from different regions of efa1 hybridized with all of 116 strains of attaching-effacing e. coli (aeec) of a variety of serotypes, including enteropathogenic e. coli (epec) and ehec, but with none of 91 non-aeec strains. nevertheless, efa1 was not required for the attachment-effacement phenotype, and the efa1 locus was not physically linked to  the locus for enterocyte effacement (lee) pathogenicity island, which is responsible for this phenotype in epec. these findings suggest that efa1 encodes  a novel virulence-associated determinant of aeec, which contributes to the adhesive capacity of these bacteria.

TI  == [new knowledge of the molecular biology of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) o157].
AB  == since 1982, enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) have been identified as a  cause of diarrhoea and haemorrhagic colitis. the most serious complication of the infection is the haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (hus) that develops in 5 to 10% of children with diarrhoea. shiga toxins (stx) are the most important presently known virulence factors of ehec. after reaching the bloodstream, the toxins cause damage of endothelial cells but also of tubular cells in the kidneys which may result in renal failure. in ehec o157 isolates from patients, we were able to identify seven different combinations of stx genes that occurred with different frequency. the genes encoding stx are located in the genomes of prophages that are integrated in ehec chromosomes. in addition, ehec o157 strains possess a chromosomally located pathogenicity island (pais) termed lee that contains numerous pathogenicity genes including the eae gene encoding intimin. moreover, ehec o157 strains possess a 93-kb plasmid harbouring genes encoding the ehec-hemolysin (ehec-hlya), a serin protease (espp) that cleaves factor v and a protein called toxb that shows homology with the toxin b of clostridium difficile. the ehec o157 strains exist in two variants, namely non-sorbitol-fermenting (nsf) o157:h7 and sorbitol-fermenting (sf) o157:h- strains that are evolutionary older. our results obtained up to now demonstrate marked differences in epidemiology of the infection caused by the respective ehec o157 variants. ehec o157:h7 strains occur worldwide, whereas sf strains have been hitherto found only in germany and recently also in the czech republic. while the ehec o157:h7 strains occur mainly during warm months, the sf strains are more frequent during the cold season of the year. in addition, differences exist with  regard to the resistance to heavy metals, the plasmid structure, and the reservoir. we postulate that sf o157:h- strains occur only in the human intestine, whereas nsf o157:h7 strains have become adapted to other hosts, such as cattle, promoting a more rapid spread of the strains.

TI  == clostridium difficile toxins may augment bacterial penetration of intestinal epithelium.
AB  == background: clostridium difficile can be recovered from many high-risk hospitalized patients receiving broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. clostridium difficile toxins a and b have been associated with increased intestinal permeability in vitro and there is growing evidence that increased intestinal permeability may be a common mechanism whereby enteric bacteria penetrate the intestinal epithelium. hypothesis: clostridium difficile-induced alterations in the intestinal barrier facilitate microbial penetration of the intestinal epithelium, which in turn facilitates the translocation of intestinal bacteria. design: mature caco-2 enterocytes were pretreated with varying concentrations of  toxin a or toxin b followed by 1 hour of incubation with pure cultures of either  salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, or proteus mirabilis. the effects of toxins a and b on enterocyte viability, cytoskeletal actin, and ultrastructural topography were assessed using vital dyes, fluorescein-labeled phalloidin, and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. the toxins' effects on bacterial adherence and bacterial internalization by cultured enterocytes were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative culture, respectively. epithelial permeability was assessed by changes in transepithelial electrical resistance and by quantifying paracellular bacterial movement through caco-2 enterocytes cultivated on permeable supports. results: neither toxin a nor toxin  b had a measurable effect on the numbers of enteric bacteria internalized by caco-2 enterocytes; however, both toxins were associated with alterations in enterocyte actin, decreased transepithelial electrical resistance, and increased  bacterial adherence and paracellular transmigration. conclusion: clostridium difficile toxins a or b may facilitate bacterial adherence and penetration of the intestinal epithelial barrier.

AB  == the international centre for diarrhoeal disease research, bangladesh, is a major  center for research into diarrheal diseases. the center treats more than 100,000  patients a year. to obtain useful information representative of all patients, a surveillance system in which a 4% systematic sample of all patients is studied in detail, including etiological agents of diarrhea, was installed in october 1979.  the first paper on etiology for the surveillance patients was published in 1982,  which identified a potential enteric pathogen in 66% of patients. in subsequent years, several new agents of diarrhea have been identified. to assess the importance of a broader spectrum of diarrheal agents including the ones identified relatively recently, we studied 814 children with diarrhea. the children were up to 5 years of age and were part of the surveillance system. they were matched with an equal number of community controls without diarrhea. the study was conducted from february 1993 to june 1994. a potential enteric pathogen was isolated from 74.8% of diarrheal children and 43.9% of control children (p =  0.0001). even though the first study was not a case-control study, it identified  rotavirus, campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, shigella spp.  , and vibrio cholerae o1 as major pathogens. the present study identified these pathogens as being significantly associated with diarrhea. in addition, the study also identified six additional agents, including enteropathogenic e. coli, aeromonas spp., v. cholerae o139, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and cryptosporidium parvum, as being significantly associated with diarrhea. plesiomonas shigelloides, salmonella spp., diffusely adherent e. coli, enteroaggregative e. coli, entamoeba histolytica, and giardia lamblia were not significantly associated with diarrhea. enteroinvasive e. coli,  enterohemorrhagic e. coli, and cyclospora cayetanensis were not detected in any of the children. the major burden of diseases due to most pathogens occurred in the first year of life. as in the previous study, seasonal patterns were seen for diarrhea associated with rotavirus, v. cholerae, and enterotoxigenic e. coli, and infections with multiple pathogens were common. with a few exceptions, these findings are in agreement with those from other developing countries. this knowledge of a broader spectrum of etiological agents of diarrhea in the surveillance patients will help us plan studies into various aspects of diarrheal diseases in this population.

TI  == immunological evidence for a bacterial toxin aetiology in sudden infant death syndrome.
AB  == toxin-specific antibodies to clostridial, enterobacterial and staphylococcal toxins implicated in sudden infant death syndrome were studied in sera from sudden infant death syndrome infants and a comparison group of infants (babies with phenylketonuria). the results indicated a higher proportion of sera from sudden infant death syndrome infants contained iga that bound to clostridial and  enterobacterial toxins but a higher proportion of sera from the phenylketonuria comparison group contained iga that bound staphylococcal toxins. the higher proportion of serum samples with igg and igm in the healthy comparison babies serum probably indicated immunity in this group of babies to these toxins. the effect of gender and age had a minimal effect on the incidence of these antibodies. the presence of toxin-specific antibodies in sudden infant death syndrome and the of comparison infants suggests that all infants are exposed to these toxins and most babies successfully overcome the toxic challenge. some infants with predisposing risk factors (temperature change, smoking, infection, immune development, sleeping position, etc.) that could affect the baby's immune  competency could succumb to these and possibly other toxins. this immunological evidence further strengthens the view that bacterial toxins are a significant cause of sudden infant death syndrome.

AB  == the drosophila gene ten-m is the first pair-rule gene not encoding a transcription factor, but an extracellular protein. we have characterized a highly conserved chicken homologue that we call teneurin-1. the c-terminal part harbors 26 repetitive sequence motifs termed yd-repeats. the yd-repeats are most  similar to the core of the rhs elements of escherichia coli. related repeats in toxin a of clostridium difficile are known to bind specific carbohydrates. we show that recombinantly expressed proteins containing the yd-repeats of teneurin-1 bind to heparin. furthermore, heparin lyase treatment of extracts of cells expressing recombinant yd-repeat protein releases this protein from high molecular mass aggregates. in situ hybridization and immunostaining reveals teneurin-1 expression in neurons of the developing visual system of chicken and drosophila. this phylogenetic conservation of neuronal expression from flies to birds implies fundamental roles for teneurin-1 in neurogenesis. this is supported by the neurite outgrowth occurring on substrates made of recombinant yd-repeat proteins, which can be inhibited by heparin. database searches resulted in the identification of ests encoding at least three further members of the teneurin family of proteins. furthermore, the human teneurin-1 gene could be identified on chromosome xq24/25, a region implied in an x-linked mental retardation syndrome.

TI  == accuracy of fecal lactoferrin and other stool tests for diagnosis of invasive diarrhea at a colombian pediatric hospital.
AB  == objectives: estimate under "real life" conditions the operating characteristics of several stool tests for determining whether a diarrheal episode is invasive-inflammatory. design: determination of operating characteristics of diagnostic tests against a standard in a prospectively gathered sample. setting:  the emergency room of the largest social security pediatric hospital in colombia  serving referred and nonreferred patients. patients: stool samples from children  attending the emergency room because of acute diarrhea (three or more loose stools per day lasting <7 days). patients receiving antibiotics or antiparasitic  medications were excluded. interventions: samples were collected in sterile containers and examined immediately for protozoa, fecal leukocytes, occult blood  and lactoferrin. specimens were inoculated onto culture media for common bacterial fecal pathogens except enteroinvasive escherichia coli and clostridium  difficile. main outcome measure: sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios of several cutoff levels for fecal lactoferrin, fecal leukocytes and occult blood. results: stool samples from 500 infants and children with diarrhea were collected. patients' median age was 2.66 years (range, 0.5 to 13 years), and 261  (52.2%) were males. in 155 (31%) cases enteroinvasive bacteria and/or entamoeba histolytica were documented. fecal leukocytes >5 had the best sensitivity (63.2%; 95% confidence interval, 55.4 to 70.5) and specificity (84.3%; 95% confidence interval, 80.2 to 87.9), although not statistically or clinically significantly different from lactoferrin. conclusions: no single test or combination had satisfactory operating characteristics. nevertheless the use of likelihood ratios derived here can help clinicians identify invasive-inflammatory diarrheal episodes in many instances.

TI  == how intestinal bacteria cause disease.
AB  == an improved understanding of how intestinal bacteria cause disease has become increasingly important because of the emergence of new enteric pathogens, increasing threats of drug resistance, and a growing awareness of their importance in malnutrition and diarrhea. reviewed here are the varied ways that intestinal bacteria cause disease, which provide fundamental lessons about microbial pathogenesis as well as cell signaling. following colonization, enteric pathogens may adhere to or invade the epithelium or may produce secretory exotoxins or cytotoxins. in addition, by direct or indirect effects, they may trigger secondary mediator release of cytokines that attract inflammatory cells,  which release further products, such as prostaglandins or platelet-activating factor, which can also trigger secretion. an improved understanding of pathogenesis not only opens new approaches to treatment and control but may also  suggest improved simple means of diagnosis and even vaccine development.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of synthetic bismuth compounds against clostridium difficile.
AB  == clostridium difficile is a major nosocomial pathogen responsible for pseudomembranous colitis and many cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. because of potential relapse of disease with current antimicrobial therapy protocols, there is a need for additional and/or alternative antimicrobial agents for the treatment of disease caused by c. difficile. we have synthesized a systematic series of 14 structurally simple bismuth compounds and assessed their  biological activities against c. difficile and four other gastrointestinal species, including helicobacter pylori. here, we report on the activities of six  compounds that exhibit antibacterial activities against c. difficile, and some of the compounds have mics of less than 1 microgram/ml. also tested, for comparison, were the activities of bismuth subcitrate and ranitidine bismuth citrate obtained from commercial sources. c. difficile and h. pylori were more sensitive both to the synthetic bismuth compounds and to the commercial products than were escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis, and the last three species were markedly resistant to the commercial bismuth salts. testing with human foreskin fibroblast cells revealed that some of the synthetic compounds were more cytotoxic than others. killing curves for c. difficile treated with the more active compounds revealed rapid death, and electron microscopy showed that the bismuth of these compounds was rapidly incorporated by c. difficile. energy dispersive spectroscopy x-ray microanalysis of c. difficile  cells containing electron-dense material confirmed the presence of internalized bismuth. internalized bismuth was not observed in c. difficile treated with synthetic bismuth compounds that lacked antimicrobial activity, which suggests that the uptake of the metal is required for killing activity. the nature of the  carrier would seem to determine whether bismuth is transported into susceptible bacteria like c. difficile.

TI  == a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study of oral trovafloxacin on bowel microflora in healthy male volunteers.
AB  == background: treatment with oral antibiotic drugs generally influences normal fecal flora. these changes can be both beneficial (eg, elimination of aerobic, gram-negative bacilli) and detrimental (eg, the appearance of resistant pathogenic micro-organisms). trovafloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone with in vitro activity against anaerobes, and gram-negative, gram-positive, and atypical pathogens, is a potentially beneficial antimicrobial for bowel sterilization. this double-blind trial investigated the effect of trovafloxacin on the normal microbial bowel flora of healthy male subjects. methods: subjects were randomized (in a 2:1 ratio) to receive either 200 mg trovafloxacin once daily for 10 days or a matching placebo. fecal samples were collected at two baseline occasions, on visit days 4, 7, 10, and 17, and at follow-up. bacterial species were identified  and quantified in the fecal samples. results: twelve subjects received the active drug and seven received placebo. no enterobacteriaceae were found in samples from days 4 to 10 in subjects receiving trovafloxacin. no changes in enterobacteriaceae were found throughout the study in subjects receiving placebo. incidental enterobacteriaceae were isolated from subjects in the trovafloxacin group at the end of the study. no clinically significant differences were found in either group with respect to prevalence, appearance, or disappearance of aerobic gram-positive cocci, anaerobic bacteria, or yeasts. all tested enterobacteriaceae were highly susceptible to trovafloxacin. no increase in minimum inhibitory concentration values was seen in day 17 and follow-up samples  for isolated escherichia coli strains. no clostridium difficile was found in day  17 or follow-up samples from subjects in the trovafloxacin group. all tests for clostridium toxin were negative. conclusions: during the treatment period, e. coli could not be cultured from the feces of the 12 healthy subjects receiving 200 mg trovafloxacin daily during days 4 to 10. all isolated enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to trovafloxacin and no changes in susceptibility were found after the treatment period. in subjects treated with trovafloxacin, the prevalence and number of gram-positive bacteria were rapidly reduced. trovafloxacin is able to selectively and reversibly suppress bowel flora.

TI  == chronic diarrhoea among hiv-infected adult patients in nairobi, kenya.
AB  == objectives: chronic diarrhoea and wasting are well recognized features of aids in africa. however, because of resource constraints few comprehensive aetiological studies have been conducted in sub-saharan africa which have included a broad range of microbiological investigations. we undertook a prospective cross-sectional study of adult patients admitted to a government hospital in nairobi, kenya, to determine possible bacterial, mycobacterial, parasitic and viral causes of diarrhoea; to consider which may be treatable; and to relate microbiological findings to clinical outcome. methods: stool specimens from 75 consecutive hiv-seropositive patients with chronic diarrhoea admitted to a nairobi hospital were subjected to microbiological investigation and results were compared with clinical findings and outcome. stool samples were cultured for bacteria and mycobacteria and underwent light and electron microscopy; lawns of escherichia coli were probed for pathogenic types and aliquots were tested for the presence of clostridium difficile cytotoxin. blood cultures for mycobacteria  and other bacterial pathogens were performed as clinically indicated. results: thirty-nine (52%) patients yielded putative pathogens, the most common being cryptosporidium sp. (17%), salmonella typhimurium (13%), and mycobacterium tuberculosis (13%). of 41 patients investigated for pathogenic escherichia coli,  enteroaggregative e. coli and diffusely adherent e. coli were each found in four  patients. thirty-one (41%) patients died. detection of cryptosporidium cysts was  the single most significant predictor of death (x2 = 5.2, p<0.05). many patients  did not improve (21; 28%) or self-discharged whilst still sick (5; 7%) but five (7%) were diagnosed ante mortem with tuberculosis and treated and a further 13 (17%) showed improvement by time of discharge. conclusions: hiv-infected patients with chronic diarrhoea in nairobi have a poor outcome overall, and even with extensive investigation a putative pathogen was identified in only just over half the patients. the most important step is to exclude tuberculosis; and the most useful investigation appears to be ziehl-neelsen staining. other potentially treatable gram-negative bacterial pathogens, s. typhimurium, shigella sp. and adherent e. coli were, however, common but require culture facilities which are not widely accessible for definitive identification. further studies focussing on simple ways to identify sub-groups of patients with treatable infections are warranted.

TI  == [probiotic therapy of pseudomembranous colitis. combination of intestinal lavage  and oral administration of escherichia coli].
AB  == history and findings: an 82-year-old woman was admitted because of acute left heart failure with pulmonary oedema. there was a right basal pneumonia with congestion which was treated with amoxycillin and clavulanic acid. severe watery  diarrhoea with more than 10 stools daily occurred. clostridium difficile was not  isolated. investigations: coloscopy as far as the right flexure revealed proximally increasing whitish coatings, like those in severe pseudomembranous colitis (pmc), revealed as acute erosive colitis histologically. the plate-like incomplete erosions contained fibrin and granulocyte deposits so typical of pmc.  clostridium difficile could again not be demonstrated. treatment and course: as intestinal lavage, already undertaken in preparation of the coloscopy, markedly improved the symptoms it was repeated for therapeutic purposes. this brought about further improvement and a fall in granulocyte count from 29,500 g/l to 10,700 g/l. subsequently live e. coli bacteria (nissle 1917 strain) were administered. after 5 days stool frequency had fallen to one or two daily, each soft or partly formed. stools were normal after a further week. coloscopy 3 weeks after onset of treatment showed almost complete healing of the pmc. conclusion: the successful treatment of pmc with intestinal lavage and physiological e. coli  administration agrees with the results of animal experiments and clinical experience. whether it is an effective alternative to primary standard treatment  with vancomycin or metronidazole remains to be tested by further experience, preferably properly controlled therapeutic trials.

TI  == the enzymatic domain of clostridium difficile toxin a is located within its n-terminal region.
AB  == clostridium difficile, an anaerobic pathogen encountered in human enteric disease, produces two major virulence factors, toxins a and b, which are members  of a clostridial family of large cytotoxins. these are glucosyltransferases, which use a udp-sugar as co-substrate to glucosylate and inactivate small gtpases of the rho or ras families, culminating in cytotoxicity. clinically, toxin a is perhaps the most important family member, because it causes major tissue damage in the course of disease, leading to a potentially lethal, pseudomembranous colitis. the location of the enzymatic domain of toxin a and mechanistic details  of its action are not yet known, so we wished to localize this domain using gene  deletion constructions from the full-length gene and by monitoring glucosylation  activity of encoded protein products. toxin a deletions were obtained by successively truncating the c-terminal coding region. these were transformed into e. coli, cell lysates were prepared and they were assayed for their ability to glucosylate rho a protein, using an in vitro enzymatic assay. we report that the  udp-glucose binding site, the catalytic site for glucose transfer and the rho a interaction site occur within the first 659 n-terminal amino acids of toxin a, i.e., less than 25% of the length of holotoxin a. localization of the enzymatic domain of toxin a to these 659 n-terminal amino acids should greatly simplify studies on mechanistic details of this clinically important toxin.

TI  == activation of rho gtpases by escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 increases intestinal permeability in caco-2 cells.
AB  == the cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (cnf1) activates rho gtpases by deamidation of glutamine-63 and thereby induces redistribution of the actin cytoskeleton and formation of stress fibers. here, we have studied the effects of cnf1 on the transepithelial resistance of caco-2 cells, a human intestinal epithelial cell line, in comparison with the rho-inactivating toxin b of clostridium difficile. whereas toxin b decreased the transepithelial resistance of caco-2 cells by about 80% after 4 h, cnf1 reduced it by about 40%. significant changes of the transepithelial resistance induced by cnf1 were detected after 3 h of incubation. half-maximal effects were observed with 10 and 41 ng of cnf1 and toxin b per ml,  respectively. flux measurement revealed no cnf1-induced increase of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran permeation within the first 4 h of incubation and a 2.9-fold increase after 24 h of incubation. in contrast, toxin b induced a 28-fold increase of permeation after 24 h. as detected by rhodamine-phalloidin staining, cnf1 increased polymerization of f actin at focal contacts of adjacent  cells and induced formation of stress fibers. the data indicate that not only depolymerization but also polymerization of actin and subsequent reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton alter the barrier function of intestinal tight junctions.

TI  == the complete dna sequence and analysis of the large virulence plasmid of escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == the complete dna sequence of po157, the large virulence plasmid of ehec strain o157:h7 edl 933, is presented. the 92 kb f-like plasmid is composed of segments of putative virulence genes in a framework of replication and maintenance regions, with seven insertion sequence elements, located mostly at the boundaries of the virulence segments. one hundred open reading frames (orfs) were identified, of which 19 were previously sequenced potential virulence genes. forty-two orfs were sufficiently similar to known proteins for suggested functions to be assigned, and 22 had no convincing similarity with any known proteins. of the newly identified genes, an unusually large orf of 3169 amino acids has a putative cytotoxin active site shared with the large clostridial toxin (lct) family and proteins such as toxa and b of clostridium difficile . a conserved motif was detected that links the large orf and the lct proteins with the och1 family of glycosyltransferases. in the complete sequence, the mosaic form can be observed at the levels of base composition, codon usage and gene organization. insights were obtained from patterns of dna composition as well as  the pathogenic and 'housekeeping' gene segments. evolutionary trees built from shared plasmid maintenance genes show that even these genes have heterogeneous origins.

TI  == small gtp-binding proteins of the rho- and ras-subfamilies are not involved in the actin rearrangements induced by attaching and effacing escherichia coli.
AB  == attaching and effacing escherichia coli (aeec) are extracellular pathogens that induce the formation of actin-rich structures at their sites of attachment to eukaryotic host cells. we analysed whether small gtp-binding proteins of the rho- and ras-subfamilies, which control the cellular actin system, are essential for these bacterial-induced microfilament reorganizations. for this purpose we specifically inactivated them using the clostridium difficile toxins tcdb-10463 and tcdb-1470. such treatment led to a dramatic breakdown of the normal actin cytoskeleton, but did not abrogate the bacterial-induced actin rearrangements. our data therefore indicate that the microfilament reorganizations induced by aeec are independent of those small gtp-binding proteins that under normal conditions control the dynamics and maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton.

TI  == chloramphenicol resistance in clostridium difficile is encoded on tn4453 transposons that are closely related to tn4451 from clostridium perfringens.
AB  == the chloramphenicol resistance gene catd from clostridium difficile was shown to  be encoded on the transposons tn4453a and tn4453b, which were structurally and functionally related to tn4451 from clostridium perfringens. tn4453a and tn4453b  excised precisely from recombinant plasmids, generating a circular form, as is the case for tn4451. evidence that this process is mediated by tn4453-encoded tnpx genes was obtained from experiments which showed that in trans these genes complemented a tn4451tnpx delta 1 mutation for excision. nucleotide sequencing showed that the joint of the circular form generated by the excision of tn4453a and tn4453b was similar to that from tn4451. these results suggest that the tn4453-encoded tnpx proteins bind to similar dna target sequences and function in a manner comparable to that of tnpx from tn4453. furthermore, it has been shown that tn4453a and tn4453b can be transferred to suitable recipient cells by rp4 and therefore are mobilizable transposons. it is concluded that, like tn4451, they must encode a functional tnpz gene and a target orit or rsa site. the finding that related transposable elements are present in c. difficile and c. perfringens has implications for the evolution and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes and the mobile elements on which they are found within the clostridia.

TI  == inhibition of rho is required for camp-induced melanoma cell differentiation.
AB  == up-regulation of the camp pathway by forskolin or alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone induces melanocyte and melanoma cell differentiation characterized by stimulation of melanin synthesis and dendrite development. here we show that forskolin-induced dendricity is associated to a disassembly of actin stress fibers. since rho controls actin organization, we studied the role of this guanosine triphosphate (gtp)-binding protein in camp-induced dendrite formation.  clostridium botulinum c3 exotransferase, which inhibits rho, mimicked the effect  of forskolin in promoting dendricity and stress fiber disruption, while the escherichia coli toxin cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1 (cnf-1), which activates rho and the expression of a constitutively active rho mutant, blocked forskolin-induced dendrite outgrowth. in addition, overexpression of a constitutively active form of the rho target p160 rho-kinase (p160(rock)) prevented the dendritogenic effects of camp. our results suggest that inhibition  of rho and of its target p160(rock) are required events for camp-induced dendrite outgrowth in b16 cells. furthermore, we present evidence that rho is involved in  the regulation of melanogenesis. indeed, rho inactivation enhanced the camp stimulation of tyrosinase gene transcription and protein expression, while rho constitutive activation impaired these camp-induced effects. this reveals that, in addition to controlling dendricity, rho also participates in the regulation of melanin synthesis by camp.

TI  == detection of bacteroides fragilis enterotoxin gene by pcr.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis constitutes about 1% of the bacterial flora in intestines of normal humans. enterotoxigenic strains of b. fragilis have been associated with diarrheal diseases in humans and animals. the enterotoxin produced by these isolates induces fluid changes in ligated intestinal loops and an in vitro cytotoxic response in ht-29 cells. we developed a nested pcr to detect the enterotoxin gene of b. fragilis in stool specimens. after dna extraction, a 367-bp fragment was amplified with two outer primers. the amplicon from this reaction was subjected to a second round of amplification with a set of internal  primers. with these inner primers, a 290-bp dna fragment was obtained which was confirmed as part of the b. fragilis enterotoxin gene by southern blotting with a nonradioactive internal probe and a chemiluminescence system. by this approach, b. fragilis enterotoxin gene sequences were detected in eight known enterotoxigenic human isolates and nine enterotoxigenic horse isolates. no amplification products were obtained from dna extracted from 28 nonenterotoxigenic b. fragilis isolates or b. distasonis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, b. ovatus, escherichia coli, or clostridium difficile. the sensitivity of this assay allowed us to detect as little as 1 pg of enterotoxin dna sequences or 100 to 1,000 cells of enterotoxigenic b. fragilis/g of stool. enterotoxin production of all isolates was confirmed in vitro in ht-29 cells. a 100% correlation was obtained between enterotoxin detection by cytotoxin assay and the nested pcr assay. this rapid and sensitive assay can be used to identify enterotoxigenic b. fragilis and may be used clinically to determine the role of b. fragilis in diarrheal diseases.

TI  == molecular analysis of the promoter region of the clostridium difficile toxin b gene that is functional in escherichia coli.
AB  == clostridium difficile is a human pathogen that produces two types of toxins, a and b, that cause a potentially lethal gastrointestinal syndrome termed pseudomembranous colitis. virtually nothing is known about the mechanism of regulation of toxin production in this organism, and cis-regulatory regions of neither toxin have yet been identified, thus prompting this investigation. a motif homologous with the shine-dalgarno sequence of escherichia coli occurs upstream from the putative initiation codon of toxin b, making this region also a candidate to contain a promoter. therefore, a subgenomic dna library of c. difficile in a plasmid vector was first constructed encompassing the 5'-end of the toxin b gene. a 450-bp dna fragment was excised from the subgenomic dna library clone and subcloned into a promoter-probe plasmid vector that contains two divergently oriented, promoterless genes to assay for promoter function. this subcloned dna fragment directed the expression of alkaline phosphatase, a reporter gene product of the promoterless vector, thus indicating the presence of a functional promoter. to locate the promoter more precisely, a series of nested  deletions of the toxin b promoter subclone was constructed with exonuclease iii.  the promoter that facilitates expression of the toxin b gene in e. coli was localised, based on alkaline phosphatase activity. the transcriptional initiation site of toxin b mrna in e. coli was mapped by primer extension analysis, suggesting two closely associated tandem start sites directed by two similarly spaced promoters within this localised region.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of am-1155, a 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, was compared with those of temafloxacin, sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin  and cefmetazole, a cephamycin, against a variety of anaerobic bacteria. although  am-1155 demonstrated only modest activity against the bacteroides fragilis group  and prevotella bivia (mic90s > or =3.13 mg/ml), 76% of the b. fragilis strains tested were inhibited at am-1155 concentrations of 0.78 mg/l. am-1155 was highly  active against prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium spp., clostridium perfringens and mobiluncus spp. (mic90s < or =0.39 mg/l). an in-vivo study using a mixed infection with am-1155- and tosufloxacin-susceptible  b. fragilis and escherichia coli strains in rat granuloma pouch was performed. am-1155 was effective against both organisms whereas tosufloxacin was effective only against e. coli. these results correlated well to the higher pouch levels of am-1155 than those of tosufloxacin. clostridium difficile overgrowth was found in the caecum of mice treated with ampicillin both 1 and 7 days after 5 days dosing, but not in am-1155-treated mice. these results suggest that the clinical efficacy of am-1155 against infections involving most anaerobic bacteria except for the b. fragilis group and p. bivia should be evaluated further.

TI  == the effect of enteric bacterial toxins on the catecholamine levels of the rabbit.
AB  == the rabbit catecholamine responses to bacterial toxins commonly found in sudden infant death syndrome (sids) victims were studied as part of a proposed animal model for sids. six bacterial toxins commonly isolated from sids baby feces and a comparison endotoxin were injected intravenously (i.v.) and intraluminarily (i.l.) to determine their effects on catecholamine levels. i.v. injected toxins clearly altered catecholamine levels causing sharp rises in adrenaline and noradrenaline levels and at critical toxin concentrations sudden death ensued. clostridium perfringens enterotoxin and alpha-toxin, clostridium difficile enterotoxin (a) and cytotoxin (b), escherichia coli sta toxin and staphylococcal  enterotoxin b caused rises in catecholamine levels similar to that caused by e. coli endotoxin. control rabbits showed very little or no obvious change in catecholamine levels. clostridium difficile enterotoxin (a) and cytotoxin (b) injected i.v. exhibited synergy. toxins injected into the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum and large intestine caused behavioural changes ranging from reduced  appetite and diarrhea to, in rare cases, death. changes in the catecholamine levels of these animals however were not significantly different from those of the control animals. the results are discussed in relation to the possible effect of certain conditions (physiological, viral infections and environmental) which increase toxin permeability and allow absorption of these toxins, possibly resulting in sudden infant death.

TI  == enhancement of bismuth antibacterial activity with lipophilic thiol chelators.
AB  == the antibacterial properties of bismuth are greatly enhanced when bismuth is combined with certain lipophilic thiol compounds. antibacterial activity was enhanced from 25- to 300-fold by the following seven different thiols, in order of decreasing synergy: 1,3-propanedithiol, dimercaprol (bal), dithiothreitol, 3-mercapto-2-butanol, beta-mercaptoethanol, 1-monothioglycerol, and mercaptoethylamine. the dithiols produced the greatest synergy with bismuth at optimum bismuth-thiol molar ratios of from 3:1 to 1:1. the monothiols were generally not as synergistic and required molar ratios of from 1:1 to 1:4 for optimum antibacterial activity. the most-active mono- or dithiols were also the most soluble in butanol. the intensity of the yellow formed by bismuth-thiol complexes reflected the degree of chelation and correlated with antibacterial potency at high molar ratios. the bismuth-bal compound (bisbal) was active against most bacteria, as assessed by broth dilution, agar diffusion, and agar dilution analyses. staphylococci (mic, 5 to 7 microm bi3+) and helicobacter pylori (mic, 2.2 microm) were among the most sensitive bacteria. gram-negative bacteria were sensitive (mic, < 17 microm). enterococci were relatively resistant (mic, 63 microm bi3+). the mic range for anaerobes was 15 to 100 microm bi3+, except for clostridium difficile (mic, 7.5 microm). bactericidal activity averaged 29% above the mic. bactericidal activity increased with increasing ph and/or increasing temperature. bismuth-thiol solubility, stability, and antibacterial activity depended on ph and the bismuth-thiol molar ratio. bisbal was stable but ineffective against escherichia coli at ph 4. activity and instability (reactivity) increased with increasing alkalinity. bisbal was acid soluble at a molar ratio of greater than 3:2 and alkaline soluble at a molar ratio of less than 2:3. in conclusion, certain lipophilic thiol compounds enhanced bismuth antibacterial activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria. the activity, solubility, and stability of bisbal were strongly dependent on the ph,  temperature, and molar ratio. chelation of bismuth with certain thiol agents enhanced the solubility and lipophilicity of this cationic heavy metal, thereby significantly enhancing its potency and versatility as an antibacterial agent.

TI  == escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (cnf1), a toxin that activates the rho gtpase.
AB  == cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (cnf1), a 110-kda protein toxin from pathogenic escherichia coli induces actin reorganization into stress fibers and retraction fibers in human epithelial cultured cells allowing them to spread. cnf1 is acting in the cytosol since microinjection of the toxin into hep-2 cells mimics the effects of the externally applied cnf1. incubation in vitro of cnf1 with recombinant small gtpases induces a modification of rho (but not of rac, cdc42, ras, or rab6) as demonstrated by a discrete increase in the apparent molecular weight of the molecule. preincubation of cells with cnf1 impairs the cytotoxic effects of clostridium difficile toxin b, which inactivates rho but not those of  clostridium sordellii lt toxin, which inhibits ras and rac. as shown for rho-gtp, cnf1 activates, in a time- and dose-dependent manner, a cytoskeleton-associated phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase. however, neither the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (pip2) nor the phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (pi 3,4-p2) or 3,4,5-trisphosphate (pip3) cellular content were  found increased in cnf1 treated hep-2 cells. cellular effects of cnf1 were not blocked by ly294002, a stable inhibitor of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase. incubation of hep-2 cells with cnf1 induces relocalization of myosin 2 in stress  fibers but not in retraction fibers. altogether, our data indicate that cnf1 is a toxin that selectively activates the rho gtp-binding protein, thus inducing contractility and cell spreading.

TI  == immobilization of reducing sugars as toxin binding agents.
AB  == a simple and economical procedure for the attachment of reducing sugars to aminated solid supports has been developed. reaction of the amino groups on the solid support with p-nitrophenyl chloroformate, followed by 1,6-hexanediamine, yields a chain-extended amine to which reducing sugars can be attached while remaining accessible to macromolecules. immobilization of the reducing sugars involves a simple incubation followed by trapping of the resulting glycosylamine  with acetic anhydride and recovery of the unreacted sugar by filtration. this technique was used to immobilize lactose and sialyllactose onto silylaminated chromosorb p, producing solid supports that effectively neutralized the activity  of cholera toxin from vibrio cholerae and heat-labile enterotoxin of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli. the general applicability of such solid supports for toxin neutralization was further demonstrated by immobilization of the enzymatically synthesized alpha gal(1-3) beta gal(1-4)glc trisaccharide, which produced a support that efficiently neutralized toxin a of clostridium difficile. the results from this study suggest that these solid supports have the potential to serve as inexpensive therapeutics for bacterial toxin-mediated diarrheal diseases.

TI  == single-step polymerase chain reaction for combined gene detection and epidemiological typing in three bacterial models.
AB  == we describe a new polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for combined gene detection and epidemiological typing (cogedet), which allows bacterial typing and gene detection in a one-step assay. this assay, in which target gene-specific primers  are used under low-stringency annealing conditions, was evaluated on 32 staphylococcus aureus strains using toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (tst) primers, 30 clostridium difficile strains using toxin a (toxa) primers, and 30 escherichia coli strains using cytotoxic necrotizing factor (cnf) primers. typing performances with cogedet were compared to those of conventional random amplification polymorphic dna (rapd), and gene detection performances, to those of conventional pcr followed by southern blot hybridization. concordances between conventional pcr/southern blot and cogedet were 96.9, 100 and 96.7% for the detection of the tst, toxa and cnf genes, respectively. discriminatory indexes for the conventional rapd and cogedet techniques were similar in the three bacterial species tested. these results show that the cogedet assay can replace two separate assays for typing and genes detection respectively, thus saving both technicians' time and reagents.

TI  == role of tumor necrosis factor and nitric oxide in the cytotoxic effects of clostridium difficile toxin a and toxin b on macrophages.
AB  == clostridium difficile, the bacterium involved in antibiotic-associated colitis, produces two exotoxins, toxin a (txa) and toxin b (txb). although these toxins are well recognized as being cytotoxic to several mammalian cell types, the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. the aim of the present investigation was to examine the cytotoxicity of txa and txb to peritoneal macrophages in culture and to investigate whether tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) and nitric oxide (no) are involved in the process. as a control, the  effect of e. coli lps was also investigated. txa, txb and lps were dose-dependently cytotoxic to macrophage monolayers, with txb being the most potent. all of the toxins stimulated the release of tnf-alpha from macrophages. txb was again the most active in inducing this response. the tnf-alpha released appears to be involved in the action of lps and txa, but not of txb, since a mab  against tnf-alpha inhibited the cytotoxicity of the former two but had no effect  on the latter. no is not involved in the effects of txa and txb since these toxins did not induce the production of this mediator in macrophages, even in the presence of ifn-gamma. in addition, l-imino-ethyl-l-ornithine (l-nio), a no synthase inhibitor, did not modify the macrophage death caused by txa or txb. although lps was able to induce the production of high amounts of no, no did not  mediate the lps cytotoxicity since l-nio did not influence the degree of macrophage death caused by lps. txa and txb therefore appear to exert cytotoxic effects on cultured macrophages by different mechanisms. tnf-alpha is involved in txa and lps-mediated cytotoxicity but not in the toxicity caused by txb. no is not involved in the killing action of any of these toxins.

TI  == positive regulation of clostridium difficile toxins.
AB  == the toxigenic element of clostridium difficile vpi 10463 contains a small open reading frame (orf) immediately upstream of the toxin b gene (g. a. hammond and j. l. johnson, microb. pathog. 19:203-213, 1995). the deduced amino acid sequence of the orf, which we have designated txer, encodes a 22-kda protein which contains a helix-turn-helix motif with sequence identity to dna binding regulatory proteins. we used a dna fragment containing the c. difficile toxin a repeating units (aru) as a reporter gene to determine if txer regulates expression from the toxin a and toxin b promoters in escherichia coli. to test the affect of txer on expression, we fused the aru gene fragment in frame with the toxin promoters. the fusions expressed a 104-kda protein that contained the epitopes for monoclonal antibody pcg-4, which we used to measure levels of recombinant aru by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. when txer was expressed in  trans with the toxin b promoter-aru fusion contained on separate low-copy-number  plasmid, expression of aru increased over 800-fold. furthermore, when we tested the toxin a promoter fused to aru, expression increased over 500-fold with txer supplied in trans. our results suggest that txer is a positive regulator that activates expression of the c. difficile toxins.

TI  == oral supplementation with lactic acid-producing bacteria during intake of clindamycin.
AB  == objective: to study the effect of administration of clindamycin with or without supplementation of the intestinal microflora with bifidobacterium bifidum and lactobacillus acidophilus. methods: twenty-three healthy subjects received clindamycin by mouth for 7 days. eleven of the subjects also received capsules containing lyophilized l. acidophilus and b. bifidum for 14 days. the other 12 subjects received placebo. results: there was a marked decrease in total numbers  of anaerobic bacteria during the administration of clindamycin. in the lactic acid bacteria-supplemented group, a tendency towards delayed reduction and earlier increase in bifidobacteria was observed, and two of 11 subjects (18%) were colonized with clostridium difficile, in comparison with five of 12 (41%) in the placebo group. the total number of microorganisms was significantly higher in the lactic acid bacteria-supplemented group than in the placebo group (p=0.02) 4  days after the end of clindamycin administration. the difference was mainly due to higher counts of escherichia coli and enterococci. mean levels of other enterobacteria increased less in the lactic acid bacteria-supplemented group than in the placebo group between days 0 and 14. conclusions: the recolonization with  aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms was faster in the lactic acid bacteria-supplemented group than in the placebo group. this may be of importance  in preventing colonization with c. difficile.

TI  == intracellular transport and processing of protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria.
AB  == bacterial toxins are associated with disease in humans and animals. toxins can either be preformed in food or produced by bacteria in the intestine. there are two types of toxins: heat-labile protein toxins and heat stabile toxins. heat labile toxins are produced by bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, and vibrio cholerae, and heat-stabile enterotoxins consisting of relatively few amino acids are produced by escherichia coli and acts by activation of guanylate cyclase. similarly, heat-stabile entero-toxins are also produced by staphylococcus aureus, a common cause of food poisoning in the united states, and yersenia enterocolitica. protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria  can intoxicate intestinal cells and can also be taken up from the gut and reach other cells in the body. for example the shiga-like toxins (vero-toxins) can intoxicate endothelial cells in the kidney and cause kidney failure. intracellular transport and processing of a few of the protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria, namely clostridium difficile toxin a and b, cholera toxin and the related heat-labile toxin produced by escherichia coli, and shiga toxin and shiga-like toxins are presented.

TI  == glucosylation of small gtp-binding rho proteins disrupts endothelial barrier function.
AB  == the endothelial cytoskeleton is important for the regulation of endothelial barrier function. small gtp-binding rho proteins play a central role in the organization of the microfilament system. clostridium difficile toxin b (tcdb) inactivates rho proteins by glucosylation at thr-37. we used tcdb as a probe to study the role of rho proteins in the regulation of endothelial barrier function. tcdb time (50-170 min) and dose (10-100 ng/ml) dependently increased the hydraulic conductivity of cultured porcine pulmonary artery endothelial cell monolayers approximately 10-fold. simultaneously, the albumin reflection coefficient decreased substantially from 0.8 to 0.15. before endothelial hyperpermeability, tcdb reduced f-actin content in a dose-dependent manner, whereas g-actin content remained unchanged. finally, we proved that tcdb caused dose (5-100 ng/ml)- and time-dependent glucosylation of rho proteins in endothelial cells. phalloidin, which stabilizes filamentous actin, prevented the  effect of tcdb on endothelial permeability. in contrast to thrombin-, hydrogen peroxide-, or escherichia coli hemolysin-induced hyperpermeability, the elevation of cyclic nucleotides did not block tcdb-related permeability. the data demonstrate a central role of small gtp-binding rho proteins for the control of endothelial barrier function.

TI  == evaluation of routine enteric pathogens in hospitalized patients: a canadian perspective.
AB  == diarrhea is a frequently encountered problem in hospitalized patients. since nosocomial spread of routine enteric pathogens such as salmonella species, shigella species, campylobacter species and escherichia coli o:157 h:7 seldom occurs, testing for these organisms in patients hospitalized for longer than three days has been questioned. the goal of this study was to determine the length of hospitalization preceding detection of routine enteric pathogens and clostridium difficile cytotoxin, and to develop guidelines for enteric cultures from hospitalized patients. the enteric pathogens detected in 1991 were c difficile toxin b(+), 77%; campylobacter species, 10%; salmonella species, 9%; e  coli o:157 h:7, 3%; and shigella species, 1%. for 1992, these numbers were 86%, 9%, 3%, 2% and 0%, respectively. none of the routine enteric pathogens isolated in 1991 or 1992 was detected in patients after their second day of hospitalization. routine cultures for enteric pathogens on hospitalized patients  were eliminated in february 1993, and physician ordering practices were monitored. with the exception of one campylobacter isolate per year, all routine  enteric pathogens isolated in 1993 and 1994 were detected by the second day of hospitalization. compliance with the changed protocol was 76% measured over a four-month period in 1993 and 74% over the year 1994. savings of $3,648.10 were associated with rejecting 191 'inappropriate' specimens in 1994. it was concluded that routine enteric cultures are unnecessary for patients hospitalized more than two days, and that appreciable financial savings can be achieved if revised protocols for processing stool cultures are instituted. however, when enteric protocol changes are in place compliance must be evaluated to ensure appropriate  utilization.

AB  == as recommended by the eec, the in vitro activity of a veterinary quinolone has to be evaluated on human strains isolated from the gut and especially against anaerobes. thus, the mics for marbofloxacin were determined by the reference agar method (norma nccls m11 a3) using wilkins chalgren medium for the 124 anaerobic strains and mueller hinton agar for e. coli, proteus, enterococcus and lactobacillus. on the whole aerobes, the activity of marbofloxacin was equal or slightly greater to that of ofloxacin. the modal mic was 0.03 mg/l for enterobacteriaceae, 2 mg/l and 16 mg/l for enterococcus and lactobacillus strains, respectively. considering the anti-anaerobic activity of this new drug,  in comparison with that of ofloxacin, mics for ofloxacin were generally one log2  higher for gram negative bacilli and two log2 higher for gram positive bacilli. modal mics for marbofloxacin were 0.12 mg/l for clostridium perfringens, 0.5 mg/l for bacteroides fragilis, fusobacterium, prevotella, and peptostreptococcus strains, 1 mg/l for bifidobacteria, 2 mg/l for non-fragilis members of the b. fragilis group, and 4 mg/l for c. difficile strains, respectively. it appears in  vitro that marbofloxacin was a more potent agent than ofloxacin on the whole anaerobes.

AB  == five well characterised strains of clostridium difficile of differing virulence and two escherichia coli strains, a verotoxigenic o157:h7 isolate and a urinary isolate, were examined for cell surface hydrophobicity and charge, and haemagglutinating ability. phase partition in hexadecane or octan-1-ol was similar for c. difficile and e. coli, as was retention by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (hic), indicating moderate hydrophobicity. the salt agglutination  test showed e. coli to be hydrophobic and c. difficile to be hydrophilic. relative hydrophobicity determined by hic when charge effects were not nullified, i.e., to reflect more closely conditions in vivo, showed c. difficile to bind less well. growth of c. difficile in caecal emulsions to simulate conditions in vivo did not alter the cell surface hydrophobicity. the phase partition method for charge determination indicated that e. coli and c. difficile had a net negative charge, although this was weaker for c difficile than e. coli. however,  although e. coli exhibited a net negative charge as determined by immuno-gold electronmicroscopy (igem), in keeping with the results of the phase partition method, c. difficile was shown to be predominantly positively charged by igem, and by movement in a charged field as determined by paper electrophoresis and a novel method based on light microscope observation. a cell-wall deficient mutant  of c. difficile was weakly positively charged, showing that most of the charge resides in the cell wall.

TI  == exchange of domains of glutamate dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon pyrococcus furiosus and the mesophilic bacterium clostridium difficile:  effects on catalysis, thermoactivity and stability.
AB  == the glutamate dehydrogenase gene from the hyperthermophilic archaeon pyrococcus furiosus has been functionally expressed in escherichia coli under the control of the lambda pl promoter. the p. furiosus glutamate dehydrogenase amounted to 20% of the total e. coli cell protein, and the vast majority consisted of hexamers. following activation by heat treatment, an enzyme could be purified from e. coli  that was indistinguishable from the glutamate dehydrogenase purified from p. furiosus. hybrid genes, that consisted of the coding regions for the homologous glutamate dehydrogenases from p. furiosus and the mesophilic bacterium clostridium difficile, were constructed and successfully expressed in e. coli. one of the resulting hybrid proteins, containing the glutamate binding domain of  the c. difficile enzyme and the cofactor binding domain of the p. furiosus enzyme, did not show a detectable activity. in contrast, the complementary hybrid containing the p. furiosus glutamate and the c. difficile cofactor binding domain was a catalytically active hexamer that showed a reduced substrate affinity but maintained efficient cofactor binding with the specificity found in the clostridium symbiosum enzyme. compared with the c. difficile glutamate dehydrogenase, the archaeal-bacterial hybrid is slightly more thermoactive, less  thermostable but much more stable towards guanidinium chloride-induced inactivation and denaturation.

TI  == escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1: evidence for induction of actin  assembly by constitutive activation of the p21 rho gtpase.
AB  == cytotoxic necrotizing factor type 1 (cnf1) induces in hep-2 cells an increase in  f-actin structures, which was detectable by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis 24 h after addition of this factor to the culture medium. increase in f-actin was correlated with the augmentation of both the cell volume and the total cell actin content. actin assembly-disassembly is controlled by small gtp-binding proteins of the rho family, which have been reported recently to be modified by cnf1 treatment. clostridium difficile toxin b and clostridium botulinum exoenzyme c3, both known to act on the rho gtpase, were used as biological tools to study the effect of cnf1 on this protein. cnf1 incubated before, during, or after exposure to the chimeric toxin c3b (which is the product of a genetic fusion between the dna coding for c3 and the one coding for the b fragment of diphtheria toxin) protected hep-2 cells from the disruption of f-actin structures caused by inactivation of the rho gtpase through its adp-ribosylation. on the other hand, c. difficile toxin b cytopathic effect was not observed upon preincubation of cells with cnf1. toxins acting through a rho-independent mechanism, such as cytochalasin d and clostridium spiroforme iota-like toxin, could not be modified in their cellular activities by cnf1 treatment. all of our results suggest that cnf1 modifies the rho molecule, thus probably protecting this gtpase from further bacterial toxin modification.

AB  == in bacillus subtilis, the ahrc protein represses genes encoding enzymes of arginine biosynthesis and activates those mediating its catabolism. to determine  how this repressor also functions as an activator, we attempted to clone catabolic genes by searching for insertions of the tn917-lacz transposon that express ahrc-dependent, arginine-inducible beta-galactosidase activity. one such  isolate was obtained. the region upstream of lacz was subcloned in escherichia coli in such a way that it could be replaced in the b. subtilis chromosome after  appropriate manipulation. analysis of exonuclease iii-derived deletions located an ahrc-dependent, arginine-inducible promoter to within a ca. 1.9 kb fragment. the sequence revealed: the 3' end of an orf homologous to gdh genes encoding glutamate dehydrogenase, with highest homology to the homologue from clostridium  difficile; the 5' end of an orf homologous to a saccharomyces cerevisiae gene encoding delta 1-pyrroline 5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (p5cdh), an enzyme of arginine catabolism; and just upstream of the latter, a sequence with homology to known ahrc binding sites in the upstream part of the biosynthetic argcjbd-cpa-f cluster. the same region has also been sequenced by others as part of the b. subtilis genome sequencing project, revealing that the p5cdh gene is the first in a cluster termed rocabc. restriction fragments containing the putative ahrc-binding sequence, but not those lacking it, showed retarded electrophoretic  mobility in the presence of purified ahrc. a 277 bp ahrc-binding fragment also showed anomalous mobility in the absence of ahrc, consistent with its being intrinsically bent. dnase i footprinting localized ahrc binding to bp -16/-22 to  +1 (the transcription startpoint). such a location for an activator binding site, i.e. overlapping the transcription start, is unusual.

TI  == is cardiorespiratory failure induced by bacterial toxins the cause of sudden infant death syndrome? studies with an animal model (the rabbit).
AB  == recent studies have implicated various toxigenic bacteria and their toxins in the aetiology of sudden infant death syndrome (sids). therefore the effect of six bacterial toxins on the cardiorespiratory system of the rabbit was studied as a model for sids. the toxins' effect on the heart rate, arterial blood pressure, and breathing of anaesthetized rabbits was determined and their action compared to that of endotoxin. intravenous injection of clostridium perfringens enterotoxin and alpha-toxin, staphylococcus enterotoxin b, escherichia coli heat-stable toxin (sta), clostridium difficile toxin a and b reduced heart rate,  blood pressure, respiration and increased, slowed and prolonged thorax expansion, and at higher concentrations caused sudden death without visible stress or trauma. a combination of a low concentration of enterotoxins caused a greater reduction of these activities and sudden death. these effects were generally similar to those produced by endotoxin. in non-anaesthetized rabbits, the toxins  slowed metabolism until death occurred without agitation, spasms, visible distress or prolonged illness. intestinal production of these toxins by toxigenic strains, when conditions are suitable, and their systemic absorption, could therefore cause sids by an endotoxin-like shock mechanism.

TI  == clostridial infection in children.
AB  == a survey of the isolation of clostridium spp. from 1543 specimens sent to anaerobic microbiology laboratories revealed 113 isolates from 107 specimens (7.0% of all specimens) from 96 children. the isolates comprised 43 (38%) unidentified clostridium spp., 37 (33%) c. perfringens, 13 (12%) c. ramosum, five (4%) c. innocuum, six (5%) c. botulinum, three (3%) c. difficile, two (2%) c. butyricum, and one isolate each of c. bifermentans, c. clostridiiforme, c. limosum and c. paraputrificum. most clostridial isolates were from abscesses (38), peritonitis (26), bacteraemia (10), and chronic otitis media (7). predisposing or underlying conditions were present in 31 (32%) cases. these were  immunodeficiency (12), malignancy (9), diabetes (7), trauma (7), presence of a foreign body (6) and previous surgery (6). the clostridia were the only bacterial isolates in 14 (15%) cases; 82 (85%) cases had mixed infection. the species most  commonly isolated with clostridia were anaerobic cocci (57); bacteroides spp. (b. fragilis group) (50), escherichia coli (22), pigmented prevotella or porphyromonas spp. (18) and fusobacterium spp. (10). most bacteroides and escherichia coli isolates with clostridia were from abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections adjacent to the rectal area; most pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas isolates were from oropharyngeal, pulmonary, and head and neck  sites. antimicrobial therapy was given to all patients, in conjunction with surgical drainage in 34 (35%). only two patients died. these data illustrate the  importance of clostridium spp. in paediatric infections.

TI  == tracking the evolution of the bacterial choline-binding domain: molecular characterization of the clostridium acetobutylicum ncib 8052 cspa gene.
AB  == the major secreted protein of clostridium acetobutylicum ncib 8052, a choline-containing strain, is cspa (clostridial secreted protein). it appears to  be a 115,000-m(r) glycoprotein that specifically recognizes the choline residues  of the cell wall. polyclonal antibodies raised against cspa detected the presence of the protein in the cell envelope and in the culture medium. the soluble cspa protein has been purified, and an oligonucleotide probe, prepared from the determined n-terminal sequence, has been used to clone the cspa gene which encodes a protein with 590 amino acids and an m(r) of 63,740. according to the predicted amino acid sequence, cspa is synthesized with an n-terminal segment of  26 amino acids characteristic of prokaryotic signal peptides. expression of the cspa gene in escherichia coli led to the production of a major anti-cspa-labeled  protein of 80,000 da which was purified by affinity chromatography on deae-cellulose. a comparison of cspa with other proteins in the embl database revealed that the c-terminal half of cspa is homologous to the choline-binding domains of the major pneumococcal autolysin (lyta amidase), the pneumococcal antigen pspa, and other cell wall-lytic enzymes of pneumococcal phages. this region, which is constructed of four repeating motifs, also displays a high similarity with the glucan-binding domains of several streptococcal glycosyltransferases and the toxins of clostridium difficile.

AB  == the in vitro activities of the carbapenem bms-181139 were determined in comparison with those of imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin. bms-181139 was the most active against species of pseudomonas and related genera alteromonas and burkholderia, with mics for 147 of 149 isolates of < 4 micrograms/ml. of 22 imipenem-resistant (mic > 8 micrograms/ml) p. aeruginosa strains, only 1 required an mic of bms-181139 of > 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 14 requiring the same meropenem mic. bms-181139 was the most active carbapenem against the majority of other gram-negative species except members of the tribe proteeae, against which meropenem was more active. although imipenem was more active against gram-positive species, bms-18139 mics at which 90% of strain tested were inhibited were < 1 microgram/ml for these species. bms-181139 was generally active against isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin or broad-spectrum cephalosporins, including those containing plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases or high levels of chromosome-encoded beta-lactamases, as well as anaerobes except clostridium difficile. inoculum effects were noted for all three carbapenems against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia marcescens but  not escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or staphylococcus aureus. bms-181139's inoculum effect tended to be more marked. bms-181139 exhibited bactericidal activity at the mic for some strains and up to four to eight times the mic for others. the postantibiotic effect of bms-181139 was equal to or less  than that of imipenem and, like meropenem, exhibited intraspecies variability. bms-181139 was 30-fold more stable than imipenem and 7-fold more stable than meropenem to hydrolysis by hog kidney dehydropeptidase.

AB  == the feces of 52 children without diarrhea, aged from 5 days to 22 months, treated in the department for various causes was investigated for the presence of that might be the cause of infectious diarrhea. samples were taken at the beginning and the end of hospitalization. the results were analyzed with reference to 5 age subgroups (1 month, 2-3 months, 4-6 months, 7-12 months, 12-22 months) and duration of hospitalization (3-42 days). the presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria in the feces was found in 87% of children without diarrhea, especially at the beginning of hospitalization, which suggests the possible existence of a "transient carrier state". because of the immaturity of a number of intra-organism mechanisms, the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the alimentary  tract in the youngest children, may be a potential danger of developing serious,  even generalized disease processes and may constitute an important source of nosocomial infections.

TI  == a rapid test for infectious and inflammatory enteritis.
AB  == background: inflammatory illnesses are an indication for specific diagnostic studies and possible antimicrobial therapy. the presence of fecal leukocytes has  been used as a marker of inflammatory diarrhea; however, microscopic examination  of the fecal smear is unreliable if the specimen is transported, refrigerated, frozen, or collected by swab. objective: to evaluate a rapid, sensitive, semiquantitative test for detection of fecal leukocytes using antilactoferrin latex bead agglutination (lfla), a test that remains sensitive even after specimens are refrigerated, frozen, or stored on swabs. methods: lfla titers were determined in stool specimens from previously healthy volunteers before and after experimental infection with different enteric pathogens and from patients with nosocomial diarrhea caused by clostridium difficile. results: healthy controls and subjects with noninflammatory diarrhea caused by vibrio cholerae consistently demonstrated lfla titers less than 1:50. in contrast, subjects with inflammatory  diarrhea caused by shigella species and c difficile had markedly elevated titers. titers for subjects with experimental shigellosis ranged from 1:50 to 1:3200, with seven (78%) of nine at 1:400 or greater. titers for patients with c difficile enteritis ranged as high as 1:1200, with six (50%) of 12 at 1:400 or greater. subjects with experimental enteropathogenic escherichia coli infection also had elevated titers, ranging from 1:100 to 1:1600, with three (43%) of seven at 1:400 or greater. titers for subjects with experimental enterotoxigenic e coli infection were moderately elevated, with nine (53%) of 17 ranging from 1:50 to 1:200 (only one [6%] of 17 was > or = 1:400), suggesting a mild inflammatory process. conclusions: the fecal lfla assay distinguishes inflammatory from noninflammatory diarrhea, may provide new information on mildly inflammatory processes, and may be a useful, rapid test in a diagnostic algorithm for acute, infectious diarrheal illnesses.

AB  == biapenem (l-627), a novel injectable carbapenem antibiotic, was studied with regard to its effect on mice inoculated with four types of bacteria and on the intestinal flora of pediatric patients. l-627 was given i.m., 40 mg/kg once daily for 5 consecutive days, to mice inoculated enterically with four types of bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, and bifidobacterium breve). except for a mild decrease in e. coli, there were no major fluctuations in viable bacterial counts in the feces during the treatment.  five children with bacterial infections (3 boys and 2 girls; ages: 1 month to 7 years and 7 months; body weights 4.62-21.8 kg) were given l-627 at 6.0 to 11.7 mg/kg 3 times daily for 7 to 11 days. among aerobes, although enterobacteriaceae  such as e. coli tended to decrease remarkably in all patients, there was no major change in enterococcus. consequently, total aerobe counts did not change significantly in any patient. among anaerobes, bifidobacterium, bacteroides, and  eubacterium, which are the predominant organisms in infants, decreased remarkably in some patients. one of the patients showed a marked decrease in total anaerobe  count associated with a change in fecal characteristics (diarrhea). glucose nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli or fungi did not become predominant organisms in any patient. recovery from these changes in the intestinal flora was noted promptly after terminating l-627 treatment. l-627 was detected in the feces of 4  patients during treatment. the fecal concentration ranged from 0.24 to 2.22 micrograms/g. clostridium difficile was not detected in any patient. although c.  difficile d-1 antigen was observed in 2 patients, it bore no relationship to fecal properties. the results indicated that l-627 had relatively few effects on  the intestinal flora compared to other new beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == etiology and outcome of diarrhea after marrow transplantation: a prospective study.
AB  == background/aims: acute diarrhea after marrow transplant is usually ascribed to acute graft-vs.-host disease (gvhd) or infection, with a reported 40%-50% incidence of infection. the aim of this study was to determine the incidence of acute diarrhea after transplantation, its causes, and its outcome. methods: two hundred ninety-six patients were followed up; patients with diarrhea were studied using standard evaluation of stool plus immunoelectron microscopy; assays for astrovirus, picobirnavirus, and norwalk virus; and gene-probe methods for toxin-producing escherichia coli. in 38 patients with diarrhea, intestinal biopsy specimens and duodenal fluid were also analyzed. results: one hundred fifty acute diarrheal episodes developed in 126 patients (an incidence of 43%). intestinal infection was found in 20 of 150 episodes: viruses (astrovirus, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, and rotavirus) in 12 patients, nosocomially acquired bacteria (clostridium difficile and aeromonas) in 7 patients, and mixed infection in 1 patient. acute gvhd was responsible for 72 of 150 episodes (48%). clinical signs  and symptoms of infection and gvhd were similar. in 58 of 150 episodes (39%), no  clear etiology could be found for self-limited diarrhea. conclusions: intestinal  infection accounted for 13% and acute gvhd for 48% of diarrheal episodes. the most common infecting organisms were astrovirus, c. difficile, and adenovirus. most cases of diarrhea after marrow transplant are not caused by infection.

TI  == cloning of a genetic determinant from clostridium difficile involved in adherence to tissue culture cells and mucus.
AB  == our laboratory has previously shown that clostridium difficile adherence to caco-2 cells is greatly enhanced after heat shock at 60 degrees c and that it is  mediated by a proteinaceous surface component. the experiments described here show that c. difficile could adhere to several types of tissue culture cells (vero, hela, and kb) after heat shock. the type of culture medium (liquid or solid, with or without blood) had little effect on adhesion. to clone the adhesin gene, polyclonal antibodies against c. difficile heated at 60 degrees c were used to screen a genomic library of c. difficile constructed in lambda zapii. ten positive clones were identified in the library, one of which (pcl6) agglutinated  several types of erythrocytes in the presence of mannose. in western blots (immunoblots), this clone expressed in escherichia coli a 40- and a 27-kda protein; a 27-kda protein has been previously identified in the surface extracts  of heat-shocked c. difficile as a possible adhesin. the clone adhered to vero, caco-2, kb, and hela cells; the adherence was blocked by anti-c. difficile antibodies, by a surface extract of c. difficile, and by mucus isolated from axenic mice. furthermore, the clone could attach ex vivo to intestinal mucus isolated from axenic mice. preliminary studies on the receptor moieties implicated in c. difficile adhesion revealed that glucose and galactose could partially block adhesion to tissue culture cells, as did di- or trisaccharides containing these sugars, suggesting that the adhesin is a lectin. in addition, n-acetylgalactosamine, a component of mucus, and gelatin partially impeded cell attachment.

TI  == lessons from diarrheal diseases: demography to molecular pharmacology.
AB  == from diarrheal diseases come profound lessons about health and population growth, microbial pathogenesis, and the molecular pharmacology of signal transduction. epidemics such as cholera, hemorrhagic colitis, salmonellosis, and cryptosporidiosis remind us of how interdependent we are, sharing enteric microbial flora on a global scale. diarrhea morbidity and mortality teach us that disease and poverty do not control but are associated with population overgrowth. great advances are being made in understanding new bacterial, viral, and parasitic causes and treatment of diarrhea, especially persistent diarrhea. in addition, microbial toxins provide unique pharmacologic tools to probe cell signaling pathways. the mechanism of action of cholera toxin, once thought so clear, now appears to involve additional pathways such as platelet-activating factor and prostaglandin synthesis. escherichia coli st has opened a whole family of activators of guanylate cyclase, including new mammalian products that regulate sodium transport. clostridium difficile toxin a provides a novel tool to dissect mediators involved in inflammatory diarrhea. these lessons have both basic implications for science and practical applications for medicine and society.

AB  == a longitudinal study of diarrheal disease among patients of all ages with acute diarrhea was carried out in new caledonia from january 1990 to december 1991. stool samples from 2,088 diarrheal patients were examined for parasites, rotavirus, and bacterial pathogens. potential sources of contamination (drinking  water, seawater and bovine and porcine feces) were investigated. one or more enteric pathogens were identified in 41.8 and 40.6% of the persons with diarrhea, in 1990 and 1991, respectively. salmonella spp., shigella spp., hep-2 cell adherent escherichia coli (diffuse adherent and enteroaggregative), enteropathogenic e. coli (epec) (epec adherence factor-positive strains belonging to classical serotypes), localized adherent e. coli (non-epec), and enterotoxigenic e. coli were the frequently identified enteropathogenic bacteria. other major enteropathogens were entamoeba histolytica and giardia lamblia. campylobacter jejuni, clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, yersinia enterocolitica, and rotavirus were isolated from only a few patients. no vibrio spp., aeromonas spp., plesiomonas spp., shiga-like-toxin-producing e. coli, enterohemorrhagic e. coli, or enteroinvasive e. coli were identified. shiga-like  toxin i-producing e. coli were present in adult bovines and calves, and heat-stable enterotoxin ii-producing enterotoxigenic e. coli were found in pigs.

TI  == mutagenesis of the clostridium difficile toxin b gene and effect on cytotoxic activity.
AB  == toxins a and b of clostridium difficile are large cytotoxic proteins that share several unusual structural features, including four conserved cysteines, a potential nucleotide binding site, a hydrophobic region, and a series of contiguous repeating units at the carboxyl terminus. in the following study, we developed a series of toxin b mutants with altered properties in each of these features and examined the effect of the mutation on cytotoxic activity. altering  conserved cysteines to serine resulted in a 90% reduction in activity, whereas altering a histidine residue located in the potential nucleotide binding site to  glutamine resulted in a 99% reduction. removing the repeating units lowered the activity by 90% whereas removing the repeating units plus a conserved cysteine located just upstream of the units reduced the activity by more than five logs, resulting in an inactive toxin. deleting the internal hydrophobic region had a similar effect. our findings demonstrate that these conserved features appear to  be important for expression of cytotoxic activity.

TI  == growth inhibition of clostridium difficile by intestinal flora of infant faeces in continuous flow culture.
AB  == growth of clostridium difficile was inhibited more strongly in continuous flow (cf) culture with c. difficile-negative faeces of infants than with c. difficile-positive faeces. culture of faecal flora of infants yielded a greater variety of bacterial species in c. difficile-negative than in c. difficile-positive faeces. in the mixed cf culture of c. difficile with enterococcus avium, bacteroides distasonis, eubacterium lentum, c. ramosum, c. perfringens and either escherichia coli or klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from c. difficile-negative faeces, inhibition of growth of c. difficile was demonstrated  when the ph of the culture medium was decreased. amino-acid analysis of cf cultures showed considerable utilisation of aspartic acid, serine, threonine, arginine and asparagine. a marked increase in concentrations of citrulline and ornithine was found in the culture that inhibited growth of c. difficile. the addition of citrulline and ornithine into a gifu anaerobic medium (gam) broth produced no inhibition of growth of c. difficile. the addition of the mixture of  the depleted amino acids (aspartic acid, serine, threonine, arginine and asparagine) to the culture filtrate or adjustment of the ph of the culture filtrate induced considerable growth of c. difficile. these results suggest that  the inhibition of growth of c. difficile may be due to consumption of amino acids by intestinal flora, and not to the presence of inhibitors produced by the intestinal flora.

AB  == objective: to review the pharmacokinetics, microbiology, clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerance of cefprozil, a new, broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin. data sources: published clinical trials and microbiologic, pharmacokinetic, and safety data were identified by medline; additional references were derived from bibliographies of these articles; microbiologic data on file were provided by bristol-myers squibb. study selection: only published comparative clinical trial  reports are included in the review of clinical efficacy. noncomparative clinical  data pertaining to uses of cefprozil not approved by the food and drug administration are not included. data synthesis: data are presented on the in vitro microbiologic activity of cefprozil against 10,152 bacterial isolates, including most of the clinically important streptococci (e.g., streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae), beta-lactamase-positive and -negative staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, clostridium difficile, and numerous other gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. in clinical trials, cefprozil appears to be  at least as effective as commonly used comparison agents such as cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. additionally, cefprozil is better tolerated than the latter two agents, especially with regard to gastrointestinal  adverse effects. conclusions: cefprozil is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that provides coverage against both gram-negative and -positive bacteria that may cause otitis media, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, skin and skin-structure infections,  secondary bacterial infection of acute bronchitis, and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. the beta-lactamase stability of cefprozil appears to exceed that of other oral cephalosporins for some important pathogens. cefprozil is used primarily for second-line treatment as less-expensive, first-line generic alternatives generally are available. cefprozil demonstrates clinical advantages over many other orally administered beta-lactam antibiotics in terms of antimicrobial spectrum, a once- or twice-daily dosing regimen, and/or reduced incidence of adverse effects.

TI  == antibiotic associated colitis.
AB  == it is a prospective study based on 100 consecutive cases of diarrhea following antibiotic therapy admitted to the pediatric services of j.n. medical college, a.m.u., aligarh between january to december 1987. they had c. penicillin (50), chloramphenicol (34), ampicillin (34), gentamicin (34), cephalosporin (4) and cotrimoxazole (4) for 3 days to 3 weeks prior to the onset of diarrhea. apart from routine and special investigations, naked eye and microscopic examination of stool, its culture for pathogens including cl. difficile were carried out in all  cases. presence of cl. difficile cytotoxin was demonstrated by observing the cytopathic. effect on veru cell culture, 18 grew cl. difficile (14 cyto toxin positive). frequency of fever, vomiting, abdominal distension, dehydration and duration of diarrhea was not different (p > 0.05) in the two groups. purge rate and presence of mucus and blood in cl. difficile positive patients was significantly higher (p < 0.05). eight cl. difficile positive (7 cytotoxin+ve) were subjected to endoscopy. three of them showed p.m. colitis and 2 non specific colitis. chloromycetin, gentamicin and penicillin were the main culprits responsible for aac. none of the patients given ampicillin alone suffered from aac. the mortality was 5%.

TI  == effects of purified clostridium difficile toxin a in the small intestine of the rat in vivo.
AB  == the action of highly purified clostridium difficile toxin a was studied in the jejunum of rats in vivo. c. difficile toxin a reversed dose-dependently net fluid absorption into net fluid secretion, accompanied by an increase in prostaglandin  e2 but not 5-hydroxytryptamine output into the gut lumen. accordingly, indomethacin but not the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonists ketanserin plus tropisetron were able to inhibit toxin a-induced fluid secretion. atropine and hexamethonium were without effect on the action of toxin a, such excluding a nervous mechanism. the cyclic nucleotides cyclic amp and cyclic gmp appear not to be involved in the mediation of the secretory response. the reduced cyclic gmp levels are most likely the result of a complete destruction of the villus membranes, where the guanylate cyclase is located. histological studies revealed  massive damage to intestinal villi, whereas the majority of the crypts seem to be unaffected. in conclusion, toxin a-induced intestinal fluid secretion appears to  be caused mainly by severe mucosal damage. pge2-release may be the consequence of the inflammation accompanying this damage. the mechanism seems to be completely different to those of cholera toxin or escherichia coli heat stable enterotoxin.

TI  == [bacterial pathogens in diarrhea: demonstration of verotoxin-producing escherichia coli using the polymerase chain reaction].
AB  == in 23% of 576 diarrhea patients we were able to demonstrate putative bacterial pathogens. not included in this number is clostridium difficile which was found in 8 of 48 (8.3%) specimens analyzed. in addition to salmonella (8.2%), campylobacter (6.0%), aeromonas (2.7%), shigella (1.9%) and yersinia (0.8%) we identified verotoxin-producing escherichia coli (vtec) in 10 patients (1.9%). vtec were found as frequently as shigella (occurring exclusively in patients returning from the tropics) and we propose that vtec should be routinely assayed  in patients with travel-associated diarrhea as well as in those with diarrhea presumably acquired in switzerland. established methods for identification of e.  coli o157:h7, which include screening for sorbitol-negative enterobacteriaceae and agglutination, are laborious and insensitive (only 1 of 10 patients with proven vtec infection positive). the other 9 patients were identified by means of the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). in 7 of these 9 patients we were able to isolate a verotoxigenic strain following a positive pcr result by screening large numbers of colonies. none of them belonged to the o157:h7 serogroup and, in addition, all were sorbitol-positive. the polymerase chain reaction as performed  in this study is easy to use, is applicable to large numbers of specimens, and can be regarded as the method of choice for demonstration of vtec in the clinical diagnostic laboratory.

TI  == [effect of meropenem on fecal flora in children].
AB  == meropenem (mepm, sm-7338), a novel parenteral carbapenem antibiotic, was examined for its effect on intestinal flora in children. seven children with infectious diseases (3 male and 4 female children of age's ranging from 4 months to 8 years  and 9 months weighing from 7.3 to 23.0 kg) were treated with mepm at doses ranging 10.3 to 40.5 mg/kg 3 or 4 times a day for 6 to 12 days. before, during and after the treatment, identities and numbers of various bacteria contained in  1 g of feces were determined and fecal beta-lactamase activity and clostridium difficile d-1 antigen were also assayed. changes in fecal flora during mepm treatment was somewhat different depending on cases. regarding enterobacteriaceae among aerobes, all of 7 cases exhibited moderate or pronounced reductions in escherichia coli. some of the cases exhibited the tendency to increase in klebsiella oxytoca. enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii. e. coli which  was reduced during the treatment increased rapidly after the treatment in 5 out of 7 cases, and the initial bacterial counts were restored. diverse strains were  observed within the genus enterococcus, while the overall bacterial counts of this genus exhibited the tendency to increase during the treatment. as a result,  no significant change in total aerobe count was observed in any case except 1 case where enterococcus count was somewhat reduced. among anaerobes, major bacteria such as bacteroides, bifidobacterium, eubacterium and peptococcaceae exhibited tendencies to decrease in some cases during the antibiotic treatment. two infants and 1 child exhibited significant decreases in total anaerobe counts. in most of the cases, such changes in major anaerobes were transient and bacterial counts recovered to their initial values rapidly after completion of the treatment. in no cases, glucose non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli or fungus became predominant. although c. difficile d-1 antigen was observed in 4 cases, its changes had no relationship with characteristics of feces. c. difficile was not detected in any of the cases. mepm was detected in feces in 4 cases being treatment, in concentrations ranging from 0.35 to 66.0 micrograms/g.  fecal mepm levels were very low except in 1 case in which beta-lactamase was negative. from these results, effects of mepm on intestinal flora in children were relatively minor compared to other new beta-lactam drugs. however, a care should be taken to minimize diarrhea and bacterial turnover when a prolonged use  of the antibiotic, was practiced because of potential significant effects on intestinal flora.

TI  == multiple dose pharmacokinetics, safety, and effects on faecal microflora, of cefepime in healthy volunteers.
AB  == in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 12 healthy volunteers  pharmacokinetics, safety and impact on the faecal microflora of cefepime were determined. for eight days eight volunteers received cefepime 1000 mg bd by constant infusion over 30 min, four volunteers received placebo. concentrations of cefepime in serum and urine were measured by bioassay and hplc. the correlation between the two methods was good and the bioassay results were used for pharmacokinetic calculations. the faecal flora was analysed twice before the  study, twice during the study and four times after cefepime administration. there were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters between days 1  and 8. the following values (mean +/- s.d.) represent day 1. the maximum concentration of 72.69 +/- 12.2 mg/l immediately after infusion decreased to 0.56 +/- 0.17 mg/l after 12 h. the mean 12 h recovery in urine was 93.69 +/- 2.14%. pharmacokinetic parameters based on an open two-compartment model were as follows (mean +/- s.d.): area under the curve, 142.65 +/- 18.35 mg.h/l; elimination half-life 110.3 +/- 8.3 min; steady state volume of distribution 16.0 +/- 1.9 l/70 kg; total clearance, 107.0 +/- 16.0 ml/min; renal clearance 103.0 +/- 15.2 ml/min. no accumulation was observed during the eight day study period with cefepime at this dosage; trough levels on days 2-7 ranged from 0.52 +/- 0.26 mg/l to 0.90 +/- 0.33 mg/l. in the cefepime treated group the following side-effects were noted: headache (5), fatigue (4), nausea/stomach ache (2), soft stool (2), transient scotoma (1). side-effects in the placebo group were: headache (2) fatigue (3), nausea/stomach-ache (1), soft stool (2) and photophobia (1). during  cefepime administration a decrease in the number of escherichia coli and bifidobacteria in faeces was observed, whereas bacteroides spp. and clostridia showed a slight increase. the numbers of faecal bacteria returned to normal 20 to 48 days after the study was completed.

TI  == prevalence of bacterial agents of diarrhoeal disease at the national university hospital, singapore and their resistance to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == over a 50-month period, 4,508 stool specimens from patients with diarrhoea were bacteriologically examined at the national university hospital, singapore. salmonella serotypes other than the typhoid and paratyphoid bacilli were the most common finding, being isolated in 10.8% of cases. campylobacter jejuni was unexpectedly infrequent (1.9%); aeromonas hydrophila was found in 1.8%. no other  aerobic pathogen occurred in more than 1% of cases. clostridium difficile was sought only when requested, and was isolated from 9.6% of cases tested. testing for enteropathogenic escherichia coli was limited to children under 1 year old. gentamicin was active against the greatest number of aerobic isolates, followed by chloramphenicol and cotrimoxazole. the c. difficile isolates were all sensitive to metronidazole.

TI  == review of the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == cefprozil is a newer oral cephalosporin with a spectrum of activity against organisms that include gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. a review of published data shows that cefprozil is active (susceptibility, less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml; moderate susceptibility, 16 micrograms/ml; resistance, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) against gram-positive species such as  streptococci, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, and listeria monocytogenes;  it may have marginal activity against some enterococci. among the gram-negative species, cefprozil has activity against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. for anaerobic species, cefprozil has activity against clostridial species, including clostridium difficile, peptostreptococci, and possibly bacteroides melaninogenicus and eubacterium. the  activity of cefprozil is generally greater than that of cephalexin and generally  similar to that of cefaclor. in these reports, cefprozil showed more in vitro activity than cephalexin and cefaclor against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci, beta-lactamase-positive methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and c. difficile, although the clinical significance of some of these differences has yet to be studied.

TI  == microbic superinfection in relapse of inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  == to assess the association between symptomatic relapse of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) and superinfection with enteropathogenic microorganisms, we determined prospectively the incidence of infections with enteropathogenic bacteria, protozoa, and helminths in patients with confirmed longstanding ibd. sixty-four patients with ibd (49 with crohn's disease [cd] and 15 with ulcerative colitis [uc]) were consecutively enrolled in the study when relapse occurred. multiple biopsies for histological and microbiological investigations were taken  from all patients who were evaluated by colonoscopy. parallel stool specimens were investigated for the presence of enteropathogenic bacteria, protozoa, and helminths. in six patients, we detected clostridium difficile or toxin b (five cd, one uc), in one patient campylobacter jejuni (cd), and in another patient salmonella typhimurium (uc). enteropathogenic escherichia coli were isolated from three patients. investigation of biopsies for mycobacteria, microscopic examination of stool samples for helminths, and immunofluorescence for chlamydia  were negative in all patients. in summary, as we found enteropathogenic microorganisms so infrequently in patients with relapse of ibd, despite intensive microbiological screening by tissue sampling for detection of gut adherent bacteria, we believe that microorganisms play only a minor role in the exacerbation of ibd.

TI  == [the influence of cefdinir on the intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  == the influence of cefdinir (cfdn), a new oral cephalosporin, on the intestinal bacterial flora was studied in tetra-contaminated mice and in pediatric patients. cfdn in fine granules was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice contaminated with 4 different species of organism: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve. no remarkable changes were observed in the fecal viable cell counts except that decreases in e. coli counts were observed on the day 3 to 5 after starting administration. the subjects in pediatric study were 7 children with infections,  3 boys and 4 girls, with their ages from 6 months to 12 years 7 months. their body weights ranged from 5.5 to 29.2 kg. cfdn fine granules was administered at each dose of 3.0 mg/kg to 3.7 mg/kg, 3 times a day for 4 to 14 days. during the administration of cfdn, some variations were observed in the pattern of changes in the fecal bacterial flora between subjects. although enterobacteriaceae and total counts of anaerobes were markedly decreased in 2 cases, total counts of aerobes were unchanged in the 2 cases, whereas main aerobes and anaerobes except  enterococci hardly varied in the other cases. there was no case in which glucose  non-fermenting gram-negative rods and fungi became predominant species continually. although clostridium difficile and c. difficile d-1 antigens were detected in 1 and 4 cases, respectively, no relationship was found between the number of c. difficile and the characteristics of the feces. with regard to the drug sensitivities of bacteria isolated from feces before and after administration of cfdn, higher levels of resistance were found in some bacteria such as enterococcus and bacteroides during or after administration than before administration. cfdn was detected in fecal samples from 2 cases during administration with concentrations ranging between 0.99-254 micrograms/g. high value of cfdn was found in a case with low beta-lactamase activity in feces, in which marked decrease of enterobacteriaceae and total counts of anaerobes was observed. the above results suggest that cfdn is considered to be a drug with relatively small influence on the intestinal bacterial flora. but as high concentrations of drugs were detected in feces under some circumstances, our attention will be required. particular care is also required for the occurrence of diarrhea and microbial replacement during continuous, long-term administration of the drug.

TI  == use of the polymerase chain reaction for the specific and direct detection of clostridium difficile in human feces.
AB  == the polymerase chain reaction was used for the detection of clostridium difficile, the etiologic agent of antibiotic-associated colitis. an upstream primer identical to a coding region (segment i) of the c. difficile 16s rrna gene and a downstream primer complementary to a highly conserved region of eubacterial 16s rrna served to amplify a targeted 270-base-pair fragment of genomic dna. this technique allowed the detection of as few as 10 c. difficile organisms among 10(6) escherichia coli bacteria. this level of sensitivity represents a 100-fold  increase over that of conventional anaerobic culture. c. difficile was detected in dna extracted directly from the stools of 23 patients with antibiotic-associated colitis and from those of four patients with diarrhea whose stools had been negative for c. difficile when assessed in a cytotoxicity assay.  no amplification products were found in the stools of asymptomatic patients. when detected in stools of symptomatic patients, amplification products of c. difficile were confirmed by southern blotting with a nonradioactive, horseradish  peroxidase-catalyzed, chemiluminescent probing system in which biotin-labeled oligonucleotides were used. this system discriminates between c. difficile and similar organisms, such as clostridium sordellii and clostridium bifermentans. the combination of the polymerase chain reaction with enzyme-linked probing results in a faster and more sensitive assay for c. difficile than standard culture.

AB  == the formation of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies by escherichia coli overproducing clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase d (egd) was investigated. egd was found in inclusion bodies as a 68 kda form, whereas the size of the cytoplasmic form was 65 kda. upon solubilization with urea followed by dialysis, the 68 kda form was converted to the 65 kda species. proteolysis occurred within the cooh-terminal, reiterated region of the 68 kda form, which is conserved among most c. thermocellum endoglucanases, but is not required for catalytic activity. the specific activity of the enzyme embedded in inclusion bodies was close to that of the purified protein. thus, inclusion body formation does not involve denaturation of the catalytic domain of egd, but, more likely, the participation  of the reiterated, conserved region in intermolecular interactions.

TI  == molecular detection of persistent borrelia burgdorferi in the urine of patients with active lyme disease.
AB  == current diagnostic tests for lyme disease (ld) are dependent upon the host serologic response and are insensitive early in infection and, possibly, following antibiotic therapy. we cloned a library of borrelia burgdorferi 297 dna and studied one clone, ly-1, for its potential in diagnostic and pathogenic studies. using pulsed-field electrophoresis, we demonstrated that ly-1 is of chromosomal origin and estimated that the b. burgdorferi chromosome is approximately 1,100 kb in size. the 3.7-kb ly-1 clone hybridizes with geographically diverse strains of b. burgdorferi. no cross hybridization occurs with dna from human cells, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium difficile, or the closely related b. hermsii. we used a dot blot assay to detect  100 pg of b. burgdorferi dna. we partially determined the nucleotide sequence of  ly-1 and used it to select and synthesize oligonucleotides for use in the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). two different primer pairs were found to amplify dna from nine geographically diverse isolates. we could detect 10 fg (less than 10 molecules) of b. burgdorferi or less than five spirochetes added to human urine. finally, we were able to use the pcr to detect b. burgdorferi dna in the urine of four of eight patients with suspected active ld (three with arthritis and one with neurologic manifestations), all of whom responded to antibiotic treatment. in contrast, those patients who were pcr negative either had inactive  disease or had been appropriately treated and did not respond to additional antibiotics, and all four control urine specimens were pcr negative. we conclude  that b. burgdorferi dna can be sensitively detected by the pcr with the primers and methods we describe and that the urinary tract is a site of persistent infection in some cases of human ld, an observation of potential diagnostic and pathogenic importance.

AB  == hemorrhagic colitis is characterized by abdominal cramps, bloody diarrhea, and no or low-grade fever. most cases are caused by the shiga-like toxin-producing bacteria, escherichia coli o157:h7. nineteen colonic biopsy specimens and one resection specimen were reviewed from 11 patients with e. coli o157:h7-associated colitis to determine whether histologic features could be useful in diagnosis or  in suggesting pathogenesis. all specimens showed hemorrhage and edema in the lamina propria. specimens from nine patients were focally necrotic and showed hemorrhage and acute inflammation in the superficial mucosa with preservation of  the deep crypts, similar to the pattern of injury associated with acute ischemic  colitis. specimens from five patients showed neutrophils focally infiltrating the lamina propria and crypts, resembling the pattern of injury seen in infectious colitis. one or both of these histologic patterns were observed in specimens from all but one patient. specimens from four patients had poorly formed inflammatory  pseudomembranes. it is concluded that the histologic features of e. coli o157:h7-associated colitis resemble a combination of ischemic and infectious injuries similar to those described in toxin-mediated clostridium difficile-associated colitis. this suggests that the toxin(s) produced by these e. coliplay a role in the colonic injury. infection with e. coli o157:h7 should be considered in the differential diagnosis of ischemic and infectious colitis.

TI  == genetic analysis of a tetracycline resistance element from clostridium difficile  and its conjugal transfer to and from bacillus subtilis.
AB  == a tetracycline resistance (tcr) determinant from clostridium difficile strain 630 was cloned into the escherichia coli plasmid vector puc13. the resulting plasmid  pppm20, containing an insert of 3.4 kbp, was mapped and a 1.1 kbp saci-hindiii fragment wholly within the tcr gene was identified. dot-blot hybridization studies with the 1.1 kbp fragment showed that the tcr gene belonged to hybridization class m. tcr could be transferred between c. difficile strains and  to bacillus subtilis at a frequency of 10(-7) per donor cell. the element could be returned from b. subtilis to c. difficile at a frequency of 10(-8) per donor cell. this is the first demonstration of c. difficile acting as a recipient in intergeneric crosses. dna from c. difficile transconjugants digested with ecorv always has two hybridizing fragments of 9.5 and 11.0 kbp when probed with pppm20. dna from b. subtilis transconjugants digested with ecorv produced one hybridizing band of variable size when probed with pppm20. the behaviour of the element was reminiscent of the conjugative transposons. therefore we compared the element to  the conjugative transposon tn916. the hincii restriction maps of the two elements differed and no hybridization was detected to oligonucleotides directed to the ends of tn916. however, the elements do have some sequence homology, detected by  hybridization analysis.

TI  == persistent excretion of rotavirus by pregnant cows.
AB  == in a study of the epizootiology and prevalence of enteropathogens which may be involved in neonatal calf diarrhoea, 10 in-calf cows from a herd with a history of rotavirus-induced calf diarrhoea were monitored over a period of six to seven  months. all the cows excreted rotavirus intermittently without showing any clinical signs, and 21.8 per cent of faecal samples contained rotavirus. reoviruses were isolated from 87 per cent of the samples from the cows, and from  all the 10 calves born to them. however, rotavirus was detected in only one calf, and diarrhoea developed only in this calf even though the calves were housed in communal pens. campylobacter jejuni was isolated from six of the 10 dams and from five of the 10 calves, not including the calf with diarrhoea. other potential enteropathogens such as cryptosporidium, salmonella, clostridium difficile, coronavirus and other viruses were not found, but two cows and two calves shed enterotoxigenic escherichia coli.

AB  == rokitamycin, a newly developed macrolide antibiotic was orally administered to 7  healthy male volunteers (22-25 years) for 7 consecutive days to study changes in  bacterial flora and concentrations of the drug in feces, and to observe adverse reactions and laboratory test parameters. a dose of 200 mg (2 tablets: 100 mg/tablet) was given 3 times daily before meals and the fecal studies were done on the 5 days before administration (adm.) [b.a.], at the time of administration  (0), and the 3rd, 5th, 7th (the final day of treatment) days during adm. [u.a.] and the 3rd, 5th, 10th, 20th, 30th days after adm. [a.a.]. the results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. obvious changes in mean populations of total aerobes and enterobacteriaceae were not found. in changes of each bacteria of enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli was not observed in cases from initial day of treatment to the 3rd day a.a. cases from which citrobacter sp. was isolated tended to increase after 3 days u.a. and gradually decrease after 3 days a.a. among gram-negative bacilli, cases where isolation of pseudomonas sp. was observed increased temporarily on the 3rd u.a., gram-positive cocci did not show  particular patterns of changes. no changes in mean count of total anaerobes were  observed during the course of the experiment. among individual anaerobes, numbers of lactobacillus and peptococcaceae decreased slightly from the 3rd day u.a. and  returned on the 5th day a.a. 2. clostridium difficile d-1 toxin was detected in feces at amounts approximately 500 ng/g in 2 cases each on 20th and 30th day a.a., with 1 incidence occurring in the same person on the 2 separate days. 3. the drug was detected in all 7 cases on the 3rd, 5th and 7th days u.a., and in 1  cases each on the 5th and the 30th day a.a. the mean peak level was 315.5 micrograms/g on the 7th day u.a. the reason for the detection of the drug in feces in 1 case on the 30th day a.a. at a value of 5.90 micrograms/g was not clear. 4. adverse reactions and abnormal laboratory test results due to this drug were not observed in any cases.

TI  == diarrhea in developed and developing countries: magnitude, special settings, and  etiologies.
AB  == diarrheal diseases are major causes of morbidity, with attack rates ranging from  two to 12 or more illnesses per person per year in developed and developing countries. in addition, diarrheal illnesses account for an estimated 12,600 deaths each day in children in asia, africa, and latin america. the causes of diarrhea include a wide array of viruses, bacteria, and parasites, many of which  have been recognized only in the last decade or two. while enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and rotaviruses predominate in developing areas, norwalk-like viruses, campylobacter jejuni, and cytotoxigenic clostridium difficile are seen with increasing frequency in developed areas; and shigella, salmonella, cryptosporidium species, and giardia lamblia are found throughout the world. the  rational management of infectious diarrhea requires the highly selective use of laboratory tests for these varied etiologic agents, depending on the clinical and epidemiologic setting. the purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the magnitude, special settings, and etiologies of diarrhea endemic to developed  and developing countries. this information permits a practical approach to the diagnosis and management of common diarrheal illnesses in different settings.

TI  == hybridization analysis of three chloramphenicol resistance determinants from clostridium perfringens and clostridium difficile.
AB  == the chloramphenicol resistance determinant from a nonconjugative strain of clostridium perfringens was cloned and shown to be expressed in escherichia coli. subcloning and deletion analysis localized the resistance gene, catq, to within a 1.25-kilobase (kb) partial sau3a fragment. the catq gene contained internal hindii, haeiii, and drai restriction sites and was distinct from the catp gene, which was originally cloned (l. j. abraham, a. j. wales, and j. i. rood plasmid 14:37-46, 1985) from the conjugative c. perfringens r plasmid, pip401. hybridization studies were carried out with a 0.35-kb drai-p fragment of pjir260  as an internal catq-specific probe and a 0.38-kb ecorv-hinfi fragment of pjir62 as an internal catp-specific gene probe. the results showed that the catp and catq genes were not similar and that neither probe hybridized with cat genes from other bacterial genera. however, the catp gene was similar to the cloned catd gene from clostridium difficile. comparative studies with both catp and catd probes showed that these genes had significant restriction identity. we therefore suggest that these genes were derived from a common source.

TI  == etiology of childhood diarrhea in korea.
AB  == to assess the role of recently recognized enteropathogens in childhood diarrhea in korea, 231 children with diarrhea admitted to and 104 children without diarrhea seen at the well-baby clinic or the outpatient department of hanyang university hospital in seoul, korea, were evaluated during a 14-month period. stools were cultured for bacterial pathogens, including enterotoxigenic (heat-labile and heat-stable enterotoxin-producing) and enteroadherent organisms. only those stools obtained from patients with diarrhea were examined for rotavirus. all escherichia coli isolates were screened for shiga-like toxin (slt) i, slt-ii, enterohemorrhagic e. coli fimbriae, and enteroinvasiveness by colony hybridization. one or more pathogens were identified in 75.8% of the children with diarrhea. rotavirus was the most frequently identified pathogen, accounting  for 47% of the cases. other major enteropathogens were enterotoxigenic e. coli (22%), clostridium difficile (16%), enteroadherent e. coli (15%), and enteropathogenic e. coli (6%). shigella spp., campylobacter jejuni, salmonella spp., slt-i-and enterohemorrhagic-e. coli-fimbria-probe-positive e. coli serotype o26:h11 and enteroinvasive e. coli were isolated from only a few patients. aeromonas hydrophila and e. coli o157 were not isolated. compared with those of the controls, the isolation rates of heat-stable-enterotoxin-producing e. coli (p less than 0.05), c. difficile (p less than 0.025), and enteroadherent e. coli (p  less than 0.05) were significantly higher in the patients with diarrhea. the greatest number of rotavirus, enterotoxigenic e. coli, and c. difficile cases were identified during the cool, dry months of october and november.

TI  == rapid method to detect shiga toxin and shiga-like toxin i based on binding to globotriosyl ceramide (gb3), their natural receptor.
AB  == shiga toxin and the closely related shiga-like toxins produced by escherichia coli represent a group of very similar cytotoxins that may play an important role in diarrheal disease and hemolytic uremic syndrome. these toxins have the same biologic activities and according to recent studies also share the same binding receptor, globotriosyl ceramide (gb3). they are currently detected, on the basis  of their ability to damage several cell lines, by using expensive and tedious assays that require facilities for and experience with tissue cultures and are therefore most suitable for research laboratories. we have developed a rapid method to detect shiga toxin and shiga-like toxin i based on specific binding to  their gb3 natural receptor, which was coated onto microdilution plates. bound toxin was then detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) with monoclonal antibodies. the sensitivity of the gb3 elisa was 0.2 ng (2 ng/ml) of purified toxin. the assay was positive with sonic extracts of shigella dysenteriae serotype 1 strain 6or (a shiga toxin producer), e. coli serotype o26:h11 strain h30, and e. coli serotype o157:h7 (both shiga-like toxin i producers). the assay was very specific in that no cross-reactivity was noted with purified cholera toxin, e. coli heat-labile and heat-stable enterotoxins, and clostridium difficile cytotoxin, or sonic extracts of other cytotoxin-producing organisms, such as other shigellae, pathogenic and nonpathogenic e. coli, salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., and aeromonas spp. these results were in complete agreement with a [3h]thymidine-labeled hela cell cytotoxicity assay and with detection of the structural genes by dna hybridization studies with a shiga-like toxin i probe. quantitative analysis showed a high correlation between gb3 elisa and hela cell assay when fractions obtained at various stages of toxin purification were examined by both methods (r = 0.99, p < 0.01). this rapid gb3 elisa is sensitive and specific and may be diagnostically useful in cytotoxin-related infections.

TI  == bacteriotherapy for chronic relapsing clostridium difficile diarrhoea in six patients.
AB  == six patients with chronic relapsing diarrhoea caused by clostridium difficile were treated with rectal instillation of homologous faeces (one patient) or a mixture of ten different facultatively aerobic and anaerobic bacteria diluted in  sterile saline (five patients). the mixture led to a prompt loss of cl difficile  and its toxin from the stools and to bowel colonisation by bacteroides sp, which  had not been present in pre-treatment stool samples. strains of escherichia coli, cl bifermentans, and peptostreptococcus productus in the mixture inhibited the in-vitro growth of cl difficile, which in turn inhibited the growth of bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides vulgatus, and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. the finding that bacteroides sp had been absent during the patients' illness but was  present after recovery suggests that the absence of bacteroides sp may result in  chronic relapsing cl difficile diarrhoea, and that its presence may prevent colonisation by cl difficile.

AB  == lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. in this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated  antimicrobials. lomefloxacin was very active against enterobacteriaceae (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). in common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of neisseria spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), haemophilus spp. (mic90, less  than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), legionella spp. (mic90, less than or equal  to 0.06 micrograms/ml), vibrio spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 1 microgram/ml). lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of bacteroides spp. (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) or clostridium difficile mic90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of clostridium perfringens (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), chlamydia trachomatis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), mycoplasma hominis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), and urea-plasma urealyticum (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the mic with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of escherichia coli and s. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the mic. these results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections  caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by s. aureus.

TI  == cloning and characterization of overlapping dna fragments of the toxin a gene of  clostridium difficile.
AB  == clostridium difficile, a human pathogen, produces two very large protein toxins,  a and b (250-600 kda), which resist dissociation into subunits. to clone the toxin a gene, a genomic library of 3-8 kb chromosomal dna fragments of c. difficile strain vpi 10463 established in puc12 was screened with a rabbit polyclonal toxin a antiserum. thirty-five clones were isolated which carried 2.5-7.0 kb inserts representing a 10 kb region of the c. difficile genome. all the inserts were oriented in the same direction, suggesting that toxin a gene expression was under control of the lac promoter of the puc12 vector. western blot experiments revealed the presence of low amounts of fusion proteins of variable size (30-170 kda) in escherichia coli strains harbouring recombinant plasmids. as deduced from subcloning experiments, the dna sequences encoding toxin a comprised about 4 kb, corresponding to about 140 kda of the 300-600 kda protein. this was either due to incomplete cloning of the gene or it might indicate a subunit composition of toxin a. no additional gene(s) with homology to the cloned toxin a gene was detected.

TI  == management and prevention of bacterial diarrhea.
AB  == the etiology, pathogenesis, transmission and communicability, diagnosis, and management of infectious diarrhea are reviewed. infectious diarrhea is common in  both industrialized and unindustrialized areas of the world. better understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis and identification of "new" enteric pathogens has resulted in the use of a variety of drugs to relieve symptoms or to effect a  clinical cure. both host and microbial virulence factors are key in the acquisition of diarrheal illness. host factors such as extreme age, a dysfunctional gastrointestinal tract, or underlying immunodeficiency enhance the  risk of illness after ingestion of a pathogen or its toxins. microbial virulence  factors (the pathogen's ability to invade or produce enterotoxins, neurotoxins, or cytotoxins) characterize the type of illness manifested and the symptom complex (e.g., acute watery diarrhea versus chronic dysentery). supportive care is indicated in the majority of cases of infectious enteritis, and rehydration is considered the mainstay of therapy in any diarrheal illness accompanied by dehydration. antimicrobial therapy is beneficial in the treatment of severe diarrhea caused by shigella, campylobacter spp., vibrio cholerae, escherichia coli, and clostridium difficile. infectious diarrhea is common but is often self-limited and of short duration. therapy frequently consists of symptomatic relief and fluid replacement.

TI  == the histopathology of the hemolytic uremic syndrome associated with verocytotoxin-producing escherichia coli infections.
AB  == verocytotoxin-producing escherichia coli (vtec) infection was present in three cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (hus), two fatal and one non-fatal, in which detailed histopathologic investigations were conducted. two patients had a prodrome of bloody diarrhea, one of whom required a hemicolectomy for severe bleeding. the renal histopathology was characterized primarily by glomerular thrombotic microangiopathy (tma) with greater than 95% of glomeruli showing changes of capillary wall thickening, endothelial cell swelling, and narrowing or thrombosis of the capillary lumen. preglomerular arterioles were frequently thrombosed, and abnormalities of the medium-sized vessels, including endothelial  cell damage and thrombosis, were also commonly observed. gastrointestinal involvement was prominent in all three cases. the colon was most severely involved, with marked mucosal and submucosal edema and hemorrhage, in the absence of significant inflammation or widespread ulceration. microvascular angiopathy was present in all cases, with changes ranging from endothelial cell damage to overt thrombosis. similar pathology was seen throughout the small bowel, including the presence of tma. in one patient, typical morphologic changes of pseudomembranous enterocolitis were found in the absence of infection with clostridium difficile. the nature of vascular involvement in the kidneys and intestinal tract supports the hypothesis that hus is mediated by systemic toxemia, and that endothelial cells are the primary target cells for the action of verocytotoxin.

AB  == shiga toxin-resistant vero cells were isolated by treatment of the cells with nitrosoguanidine. these mutant cells were not affected by shiga toxin at more than 1 microgram/ml, although the parent vero cells were sensitive to 25 pg of the toxin per ml. immunofluorescence studies showed that all the mutant cells had lost toxin-binding capacity. the cytotoxic activities of various bacterial cultures against the parent and mutant cells were compared. all samples from 10 strains of shigella dysenteriae type 1 and all three strains of escherichia coli  o157:h7 tested showed cytotoxicity to the parent cells but not to the mutant cells. samples from other organisms, such as shigella flexneri, shigella sonnei,  clostridium difficile, aeromonas hydrophila, aeromonas sobria, and other e. coli  strains, either had no effect or were cytotoxic on both the parent and mutant cells. thus, these mutant cells could be used to identify shiga-like toxin and distinguish it from other cytotoxins. the results also suggest the presence of a  receptor for shiga-like toxin on vero cells that is essential for expression of the cytotoxicity of shiga toxin but is not essential for growth of vero cells.

AB  == a gene bank from a clinical isolate of clostridium difficile expressing high chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was constructed by cloning sau3a-cleaved clostridial dna fragments into the plasmid vector puc13. among 1,020 clones tested, 11 were resistant to chloramphenicol; 1 of these, with an insert size of 1.9 kilobases (pppm9), was studied further. the clone pppm9 was mapped using a variety of restriction enzymes, and a 0.27-kilobase ecorv-taqi restriction fragment was shown to be within the chloramphenicol resistance (cmr)  gene by using transposon (tn1000) mutagenesis. the 0.27-kilobase fragment and the 1.9-kilobase insert were radiolabeled and used as dna probes in hybridization studies. southern blot analysis with the gene probes against chromosomal dna from cmr strains of c. difficile obtained from five distinct geographical locations revealed that at least two copies of the same chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene were present for each strain. hybridization of the gene probes against cmr strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella edwardsii, escherichia coli, and to four other clostridial species revealed no homology even under conditions of low stringency.

TI  == ciprofloxacin in combination with metronidazole.
AB  == ciprofloxacin has a reduced activity against anaerobic pathogens. therefore, a combination of ciprofloxacin with an antimicrobial agent active against anaerobes, such as metronidazole, seems to be interesting for the treatment of mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections. high metronidazole concentrations (10 mg/l or 40 mg/l) neither affected the bactericidal efficacy of ciprofloxacin on aerobic pathogens, such as escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, nor on the anaerobic pathogens clostridium  perfringens and clostridium difficile, as demonstrated by kill-kinetic curves. the same high concentrations, as well as lower therapeutically achievable concentration (2 mg/l or 5 mg/l) of metronidazole in combination with ciprofloxacin were slightly more potent for the tested clostridia than ciprofloxacin or metronidazole alone.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of trospectomycin (u-63366f), a novel spectinomycin analog.
AB  == trospectomycin (u-63366f) is a novel spectinomycin analog with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. the in vitro activity of this analog was compared with that of spectinomycin and other reference antibiotics against 411 clinical isolates of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. mics were determined by agar or broth dilution methods. the stability of trospectomycin in the presence of an enzyme extract derived from spectinomycin-resistant escherichia coli was determined. trospectomycin was more active than spectinomycin (4- to 32-fold) against strains of numerous bacterial species, including staphylococci, streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, proteus species, bacteroides species, clostridium difficile, clostridium species, and chlamydia trachomatis. trospectomycin demonstrated a moderate level of activity (comparable to that of spectinomycin) for most species of the family enterobacteriaceae tested and was generally cross resistant with spectinomycin. trospectomycin was susceptible to inactivation by crude enzyme preparations from spectinomycin-inactivating strains of e. coli. trospectomycin inhibited a variety of clinically important organisms, including agents of sexually transmitted diseases and pelvic inflammatory disease. clinical studies with this novel aminocyclitol antibiotic are in progress.

TI  == infections after experimental cadaver bone marrow transplantation in beagle dogs. transplantations with and without selective gastrointestinal decontamination.
AB  == experimental transplantations of cadaver bone marrow (bmt) in beagle dogs were performed to evaluate the problems and potentials in a preclinical setting. the effectiveness of selective decontamination of the gut (sd) and gnotobiotic surveillance in preventing infections during longer aplastic periods was investigated. three groups of dogs were compared. group a: controls. group b: dogs with bmt, without sd and irregular gnotobiotic surveillance. group c: dogs with bmt, with sd and regular gnotobiotic surveillance. the intestinal colonization of normal healthy beagles shows similarities as well as dissimilarities to the human intestinal microflora. aerobic potentially pathogenic organisms do not colonize the gut of healthy beagles under our keeping conditions. sd resulted in a significant decrease in infections with escherichia  coli and plesiomonas. infections with anaerobes, as well as bacterial infections  of the respiratory tract were, however, not prevented. the intestinal colonization in dogs of group c with clostridium difficile is another obvious effect of sd. the infections encountered during the study indicate the importance of the "take" for the clinical significance and outcome of intestinal colonization with potentially pathogenic organisms. in order to reduce the drug burden of bmt patients, we consider the elimination of routine sd after bmt not to be superior to gnotobiotic surveillance and germ-specific short term decontamination.

AB  == azithromycin (cp-62,993 [9-deoxy-9a-methyl-9a-aza-9a-homoerythromycin]) is a novel macrolide antimicrobial. in this study the in vitro activity of cp-62,993 has been determined against selected enteropathogens, including clostridium difficile, and compared with that of erythromycin. mics were determined using an  agar incorporation technique in mueller-hinton medium, containing saponin-lysed horse blood at a final concentration of 10% v/v, with an inoculum of 10(4) cfu. cp-62,993 was considerably more active than erythromycin against salmonella typhi (mic90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l, respectively), s. enteritidis (mic90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l), shigella flexneri (mic90 2 and 32 mg/l), sh. dysenteriae (mic90 2 and 32 mg/l), sh. sonnei (mic90 4 and 32 mg/l), campylobacter jejuni (mic90 0.12 and 1 mg/l), vibrio cholerae (mic90 0.25 and 8 mg/l), v. parahaemolyticus (mic90 0.5 and 8 mg/l), yersinia enterocolitica (mic90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l), escherichia coli-etec (mic90 4 and 32 mg/l), e. coli-eiec  (mic90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l), plesiomonas shigelloides (mic90 1 and 8 mg/l) and aeromonas hydrophila (mic90 4 and 32 mg/l). cp-62,993 (mic90 2 mg/l) was slightly less active than erythromycin (mic90 1 mg/l) against isolates of c. difficile. the results suggest a potential clinical role for cp-62,993 in the treatment of enteric infections where antimicrobial therapy is indicated.

TI  == production of a unique cytotoxin by campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is an important diarrheal pathogen worldwide; the mechanisms by which it causes disease remain unclear. because of its association with inflammatory diarrhea, we postulated that c. jejuni might produce a cytotoxin similar to that produced by shigella sp., enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157, or clostridium difficile. filtrates of 12 polymyxin-treated isolates of c.  jejuni were placed on hela cells (sensitive to shiga toxin cytotoxicity) and chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells. of 12 isolates of c. jejuni tested, 5 killed 50% of the cells at greater than or equal to 1:4 dilutions of filtered suspensions of 10(9) bacteria per ml; killing was similar in hela and cho cells (the cho cells being insensitive to shiga cytotoxin). one isolate produced a titer of 1:32 to 1:128. the relative potency in hela cells was comparable to that of e. coli strains that produce intermediate amounts of shiga-like toxin. the other seven strains showed no cytotoxic effect, nor did the control diluents, polymyxin b, or supernatants of c. jejuni not treated with polymyxin b. sonication also released active cytotoxin, but slightly less well than did polymyxin. the cytotoxic effect was dose dependent. concentration of the c. jejuni in suspension by 10-fold before treatment with polymyxin b resulted in a 10-fold increase in the 50% cytotoxic dose. the cytotoxin effect was not neutralized by shiga toxin immune serum against either shiga-like toxin i or ii or by anti-clostridium difficile antiserum. the c jejuni cytotoxin was partially  labile to trypsin (0.25%) and to heating to greater than or equal to 60 degrees c. cytotoxicity was retained in scientific products dialysis tubing d1615-1 (mr cutoff, 12,000 to 14,000). some isolates of c. jejuni release a substance lethal  to hela or cho cells in vitro that is distinct from shiga-like or clostridium difficile toxin. this cytotoxin may contribute to the colonic mucosal invasive process that characterizes c. jejuni enteritis.

AB  == twelve healthy young male subjects received either cefixime, a new oral cephalosporin (cl 284,635), or cefaclor (six subjects on each drug) orally for 2  weeks. in the case of cefixime, single daily doses of 400 mg were taken; with cefaclor, the dosage was 250 mg three times daily. modest changes in the fecal flora were noted in both drug groups, but the changes were of different types. in the case of cefixime, there was more of an impact on the indigenous flora, and in the case of cefaclor, there was more ingrowth of new flora. with cefixime, enterobacteriaceae were usually decreased (the decrease in escherichia coli count was statistically significant), as were counts of clostridia and sometimes bifidobacterium spp.; the bacteroides fragilis group was eliminated in one subject. coincident with these decreases, four subjects had increases in counts of group d streptococci of 3 logs or more. there was new appearance of clostridium difficile in four subjects and of staphylococcus aureus in one; four  new strains of enterobacteriaceae appeared. with cefaclor, there was no decrease  of e. coli counts; two subjects had elimination of bifidobacterium spp. there was little change in counts of group d streptococci. on the other hand, there were 13 new strains of enterobacteriaceae, two of s. aureus, and three of c. difficile.

TI  == purification and characterization of clostridium sordellii lethal toxin and cross-reactivity with clostridium difficile cytotoxin.
AB  == lethal toxin (lt) was purified from clostridium sordellii ip82 by deae-trisacryl, ultrogel aca3-4 gel filtration, and hydroxyapatite column chromatography. the molecular weight of purified lt was estimated to be 240,000 to 250,000, and the pi was at ph 4.55. lt was lethal for mice by intraperitoneal injection (3.4 x 10(5) mouse lethal doses per mg of protein), cytotoxic for vero cells (6.1 x 10(4) cytotoxic units per mg of protein), erythematous and edematous by intradermal injection in guinea pigs, and induced a moderate fluid accumulation in the guinea pig intestinal loop test. the lethal activity was inactivated by n-bromosuccinimide, n-chlorosuccinimide, chloramine-t, and sodium dodecyl sulfate. the data suggest that tryptophan and methionine residues present in the  toxin are important for lethal activity. furthermore, lt was inactivated by oxidized glutathione and activated by dithiothreitol. inactivation by sulfhydryl-group reagents 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and iodoacetamide was only obtained with dithiothreitol-treated lt. thiol groups which are protected as a disulfide bond(s) seem to be essential for the lt activity. a specific antiserum against lt neutralized the biological activities of lt and also cytotoxic activity and lethal activity of clostridium difficile toxin b but  not of c. difficile toxin a. however, this serum did not recognize antigen from c. difficile culture supernatant by immunoblotting. it was concluded that antibodies prepared from c. sordellii lt that neutralized c. difficile cytotoxic  activity recognized a low number of epitopes or tertiary structures of c. difficile cytotoxin.

TI  == interaction of clostridium difficile and escherichia coli with microfloras in continuous-flow cultures and gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == we studied the interactions between the entire cecal flora of hamsters and the pathogens clostridium difficile and escherichia coli in gnotobiotic mice and in a continuous-flow (cf) culture system in which the growth medium consisted of an extract of fecal pellets from germfree mice. cf cultures and germfree mice were colonized first with c. difficile and e. coli and then with the cecal flora of hamsters. both in vivo and in vitro hamster flora markedly suppressed the potential pathogens. contents of cf cultures inoculated with hamster flora were introduced into gnotobiotic mice previously colonized with c. difficile and e. coli. these mice were compared with mice given homogenates of hamster ceca. in both groups, the c. difficile population decreased by a factor of more than 10(6) and the e. coli population decreased by a factor of 10(4) to 10(5). cf culture contents also reduced the size of the dilated germfree mouse cecum to normal. when veal infusion broth was used as a medium, contents of cf cultures colonized  with hamster flora failed to eliminate c. difficile from mice. thus, the extract  of fecal pellets appeared to contain a substance important for sustained colonization by important components of the cecal flora. we also studied the ability of collections of isolates to suppress the potential pathogens in both gnotobiotic mice and cf cultures. a total of 150 isolates obtained from predominant hamster flora at the ecologic climax stage (c flora) suppressed c. difficile and e. coli to 10 and 1 to 3%, respectively, of the population sizes attained in monoassociated mice. a total of 67 isolates obtained during ecologic  succession combined with a c flora consisting of 100 isolates suppressed the potential pathogens to 0.3 and 0.03% of their original levels, respectively. similar degrees of suppression occurred in cf cultures, further indicating that anaerobic cf cultures are promising models for investigation of the microbial ecology of c. difficile.

TI  == relationships between rotavirus diarrhea and intestinal microflora establishment  in conventional and gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == intestinal microflora did not play a role in the intensity or course of edim rotavirus-induced diarrhea, since similar results were observed in axenic and conventional mice. in conventional mice, rotavirus-induced diarrhea did not modify the establishment of lactobacillus spp. and escherichia coli before weaning. the consequences of diarrhea on the establishment of strictly anaerobic  bacteria after weaning were studied through the measurement of two bacterial functions, the microbial barrier effect against e. coli and the development of the immunoglobulin a intestinal immune system. these two bacterial functions were expressed in a similar way in diarrheic and control mice. in young gnotobiotic mice inoculated with clostridium perfringens or c. difficile, rotavirus infection led to an earlier development of both strains, as compared with controls. this effect was more pronounced with c. difficile. these results suggest that rotavirus infections might enhance opportunistic bacterial infections.

TI  == effect of beta-lactam prodrugs on human intestinal microflora.
AB  == the ampicillin prodrugs bacampicillin, pivampicillin, and talampicillin, the mecillinam prodrug pivmecillinam and the sulbactam prodrug sulbactam pivoxil all  have a greatly improved oral availability compared to the parent drug. they show  no antibacterial activity themselves until transformed into active drugs after absorption. this double advantage makes them less likely to influence the intestinal microbial ecosystem. ampicillin has been reported to cause marked changes in the colon microflora, particularly as regards enterobacter species, klebsiella species, enterococci, lactobacilli, bacteroides, and clostridia, in contrast to pivampicillin, which did not exert much influence. similarly, talampicillin has been reported to have less influence than ampicillin on the colon flora. diarrhoea was more common after ampicillin and was accompanied by an overgrowth of candida. pivmecillinam has been reported to reduce the number of escherichia coli and lactobacilli. no changes were seen in the colon flora of subjects receiving bacampicillin tablets. this was verified in a parallel group study, in which one group was given the combination of bacampicillin and sulbactam pivoxil, the other bacampicillin, for seven days. of the subjects given the combination, five had a moderate and ten a considerable change in their colon microflora. the subjects were often heavily colonized by new aerobic strains such as enterococci, e. coli, bacillus, enterobacter, aeromonas, and yeasts. among the anaerobes, veillonella, the bifidobacteria-lactobacillus group, and bacteroides decreased. some strains of clostridia decreased but there was also a colonization with new strains. one subject was colonized with clostridium difficile. diarrhoea was seen only during the week of active drug administration in the group given the combination. the symptoms generally appeared on the second or third day of treatment and had, in most cases, subsided at the end of treatment. the results illustrate the correlation between disturbances in the intestinal microbial ecosystem and intestinal adverse reactions.

TI  == [epidemiology, etiology and laboratory diagnosis of infectious diarrhea diseases  in the tropics].
AB  == diarrhoeal diseases belong to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in tropical countries, especially in infants and small children. about one billion episodes are estimated for this group of age with 4.6 million fatalities. many causes are discussed to explain the high incidence: bottle feeding of infants, protein malnutrition, unsafe drinking water and unsafe disposal of excrements and sewage, unsufficient consciousness of personal and domestic hygiene, lack of knowledge on the origin of disease, and inadequate food hygiene. among the viral  infectious agents rotavirus is isolated from 30-40% of enteritis cases in infants and small children; norwalk virus, adenovirus and human calicivirus, too, appear  to occur worldwide. enteropathogenic (epec) and, especially, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) are of primary importance as bacterial pathogens. campylobacter jejuni and c. coli primarily cause disease in infants and small children. shigellae are important whereas salmonellae are less frequently identified as a cause for diarrhoeal illness. yersinia enterocolitica is rare in  tropical countries. cholera and infections with other vibrionaceae (v. cholerae non-01, v. mimicus, v. parahaemolyticus, aeromonas, plesiomonas shigelloides) mainly occur in coastal areas. clostridium perfringens type c is the causal agent of enteritis necroticans in several countries, especially new guinea. c. difficile appears to be of minor importance. among the parasites giardia lamblia  and entamoeba histolytica are the most important organisms causing diarrhoeal disease. macroscopic (visible blood) and microscopic stool examination (faecal leukocytes) may be helpful in dysenteric disease to distinguish between shigella  and e. histolytica infections; it is, however, of limited usefulness to discriminate between organisms causing watery diarrhoea.

AB  == the appropriate approach to the diagnosis and management of acute infectious diarrhea is determined by the frequency and setting of the illness, the recognizable causes or syndromes, the cost and yield of available diagnostic tests, and the treatability of the disease. acute diarrhea affects everyone throughout the world from one to more than six times each year, depending on age, location, and living conditions. the range of identifiable viral, bacterial, and  parasitic etiologies is great, and the cost of indiscriminate use of etiologic studies for diagnosis is prohibitive. because of its insensitivity for many organisms and poor selection of cases for testing, routine stool culture has been one of the most costly and ineffective microbiologic tests; the cost per positive result has traditionally exceeded $900 to $1,000. the appropriate treatment for the vast majority of cases (independent of their cause) is simple and effective:  oral glucose- and electrolyte-containing rehydration solution. on the basis of an appropriate history and understanding of pathogenesis, fecal specimens can be selectively obtained and promptly examined for leukocytes and parasites, and the  common noninflammatory diarrheas can be separated from the inflammatory infections in order to focus further studies on the latter group. the bacteria for which specific antimicrobial therapy should be considered usually cause inflammatory diarrhea in the united states. therefore, only when the history or fecal leukocyte findings indicates an inflammatory process is it appropriate to culture for the routine invasive bacterial pathogens. in sporadic inflammatory diarrhea, culture methods should include those for campylobacter jejuni as well as salmonella and shigella. several special circumstances may prompt a consideration of parasites (including giardia, entamoeba, strongyloides, cryptosporidium), vibrio, yersinia, clostridium difficile, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, food-borne agents, or sexually transmitted pathogens. the practical value of specific identification of rotaviruses (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, rotazyme, or electron microscopy) is primarily epidemiologic, particularly in hospitalized infants or young children. using such a selective approach to fecal culture will greatly increase its yield and can reduce the cost per positive result from $1,000 to less than $150.

TI  == effect of aspoxicillin on anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == aspoxicillin (aspc), a semisynthetic penicillin has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activities against gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. its in vitro antibacterial activity was less than those of cefoxitin against peptostreptococcus and veillonella, but was significantly high against bacteroides fragilis, one of the most clinically important anaerobe. the therapeutic and/or protective effect of aspc in experimental subcutaneous abscess or experimental intraabdominal mixed infection due to beta-lactamase producing b. fragilis and non-producing escherichia coli were much stronger than those of ticarcillin. in order to account the superiority of aspc in vivo, the effects of  aspc and other beta-lactams on b. fragilis were compared and the results were analyzed in relation to their in vitro bactericidal activities, stability against the beta-lactamase, binding properties with penicillin-binding proteins and pharmacokinetic properties. interestingly, administration of aspc did not increase the bacterial counts of clostridium difficile in caecal contents, but piperacillin, ticalcillin, carbenicillin, ampicillin and cefotaxime increased the counts.

TI  == in vitro effects of sulphasalazine, azodisal sodium, and their metabolites on clostridium difficile and some other faecal bacteria.
AB  == the effects of sulphasalazine (sasp), azodisal sodium (ads), and their metabolites were tested in vitro on aerobic and anaerobic faecal bacterial strains. sulphapyridine (sp) had a mild to moderate effect on escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis. sasp also had a growth-inhibitory effect on strep. faecalis. the other substances had no effect on the aerobic strains. sasp, sp, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and, to a certain extent, n-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid exerted a growth-inhibitory effect on the anaerobic strains. of special interest  was the inhibitory effect on clostridium difficile strains. in recent years the possibility that overgrowth of cl. difficile could cause flare-ups of inflammatory bowel disease has been discussed. some studies suggested that sasp treatment could predispose to cl. difficile superinfection, whereas others found  sasp more probable to exert a prophylactic effect. our findings support the theory that sasp treatment reduces rather than promotes the risk of cl. difficile superinfection.

TI  == increased risk of illness among nursery staff caring for neonates with necrotizing enterocolitis.
AB  == in 1983 an outbreak of necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) and hemorrhagic gastroenteritis occurred in our newborn nurseries. eleven children were ill and three required bowel resections. during the outbreak many of the medical and nursing staff in the nurseries also were ill, prompting a microbiologic and epidemiologic investigation. bacterial and viral cultures, clostridium difficile  toxin assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for viral antigens and immunoelectron microscopy of stools identified no associated pathogen. however, using a method of calculating relative risk as an incidence density ratio, we found that nurses who had cared for ill infants were at higher risk for sick call within the 9 days following exposure than nurses who had cared for babies without nec (relative risk, 1.96; p = 0.05). these results provide additional evidence that a transmissible agent may be responsible for some cases of nec and support the recommendation for infection control measures during outbreaks. the epidemiologic methods used in this study may be useful in prospective studies of  nec and may help to provide further clues to the cause of this disease.

TI  == short-chain fatty acids in intestinal content of germfree mice monocontaminated with escherichia coli or clostridium difficile.
AB  == the short-chain fatty acids (scfas) have been analysed in coecal and small-intestinal content of conventional (conv) and germfree (gf) mice, in germfree mice monocontaminated with escherichia coli (mec) or clostridium difficile (mcd), and in germfree mice conventionalized by the visitor technique (exg). the total concentrations of scfas in coecal content, measured by gas chromatography, were (mean (sd), mmol/kg): conv, 125.2 (32.9); gf, 1.02 (0.39); mec, 6.88 (0.76); mcd, 4.50 (0.12); and exg, 115.6 (17.4). the concentrations of  scfas were 3- to 25-fold higher in the coecum than in the small intestine in conv, mec, and exg mice (p less than 0.05). the fermentation patterns (that is, the relative composition of the acids) of e. coli and cl. difficile were distinctively different under defined in vitro conditions and similar to those found in intestinal content of monocontaminated animals. combined gas chromatography and mass spectrometry showed that cl. difficile produced an unusual metabolite, 2-methylbutyric acid, in vitro and in vivo. the findings indicate that the fermentation patterns are closely related to the bacteria. variations in the bacterial flora may be more important in determining the concentrations and patterns of scfas in intestinal content than variations in the intake of substrate for scfas formation as dietary fibre.

TI  == studies of metabolites in diarrheal stool specimens containing shigella species by frequency-pulsed electron capture gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  == eleven diarrheal stool specimens and 10 control stool specimens from cairo, egypt, were studied by frequency-pulsed electron capture gas-liquid chromatography (fpec-glc). four cases involving shigella sonnei, three cases involving shigella boydii, and four cases involving shigella flexneri were studied. the aqueous stools were centrifuged, extracted with organic solvents, and derivatized to form specific electron-capturing derivatives of carboxylic acids, alcohols, hydroxy acids, and amines. analyses were performed on high-resolution glass columns with an instrument equipped with an extremely sensitive electron capture detector that is specific for the detection of electron-capturing compounds. the diarrheal stools studied had specific fpec-glc  profiles and contained metabolic markers that readily distinguished between the shigella spp. studied and escherichia coli producing heat-stable or heat-labile enterotoxins. s. sonnei stools contained hexanoic acid, 2-hydroxy-4-methylmethiobutyric acid, and some unidentified alcohols that distinguished this organism from other enteric pathogens. s. boydii produced an acid that was unique for this species, and s. flexneri produced alcohols that could be used to distinguish between it and other enteric organisms. the fpec-glc profiles obtained during this study were also very different from those reported  earlier for clostridium difficile and rotavirus. this study presents further evidence that the selectivity and sensitivity of fpec-glc techniques can be used  to rapidly identify causative agents of diarrhea and detect physiological changes that occur in the gut during the course of diarrheal illness.

AB  == the influence of a single intravenous dose of antibiotic on faecal flora and the  emergence of clostridium difficile was studied in volunteers. seventy-eight volunteers (13 groups of 6 receiving 5 penicillins and 8 cephalosporins) were given a single intravenous dose of antibiotic. results were compared with a control group of 6 volunteers who did not receive an antibiotic. changes in the faecal flora were monitored over two weeks. only cephalosporins were associated with emergence of cl. difficile, penicillins and controls were not. frequency of  emergence of cl. difficile in the 6 volunteers in each of the cephalosporin groups were as follows: cephaloridine 0, cephazolin, 1 cefuroxime 1, cefoxitin 2, cefotaxime 2, latamoxef 3, ceftriaxone 2, cefotetan 4. latamoxef (moxalactam) was associated with a significant rise in total aerobic bacterial counts largely due  to increased counts of enterococci. cefotetan eliminated escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis from the faecal flora three days after administration.

TI  == etiology of acute infectious diarrhea in a highly industrialized area of switzerland.
AB  == during an 18-mo period between 1981 and 1982, a prospective study was conducted in 119 adult patients with acute diarrhea. a diarrhea-inducing microorganism or toxin could be identified in 38.7% of the patients. salmonella sp and campylobacter jejuni were the leading agents that caused diarrheal illness in 25% of the investigated population. clostridium difficile was found in 6%, mainly after previous antibiotic therapy. rotavirus was rarely isolated and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli were not found. clinical features in patients in whom an invasive agent was isolated did not differ from those in patients in whom no enteropathogens were found, although the occurrence of fecal leukocytes and positive hemoccult tests in the former group was significantly more frequent. more than 30% of the patients with negative stool cultures, however, showed fecal leukocytes and positive occult blood, which is suggestive of the existence of one or more invasive agent(s) so far unknown or not recognized.

TI  == rapid differentiation of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli that produce heat-stable and heat-labile toxins by frequency-pulsed electron capture gas-liquid chromatography analysis of diarrheal stool specimens.
AB  == thirty-three stool specimens from infants in the village of tamooh near cairo, egypt, were studied by frequency-pulsed electron capture gas-liquid chromatography (fpec-glc). in 13 of the diarrheal cases, the suspected causative  agent isolated was escherichia coli which produced heat-stable toxin (st), and in 10 other cases e. coli that produced heat-labile toxin (lt) were isolated. ten control stool samples, collected from infants from whom no pathogenic organisms were isolated, were analyzed at the same time. comparisons also were made against healthy control stools from individuals in the united states who had been previously analyzed by fpec-glc (brooks et al., j. clin. microbiol. 20:549-560, 1984). the stools were suspended in water and centrifuged, and the supernatant was extracted with organic solvents and derivatized to form electron-capturing derivatives of carboxylic acids, hydroxy acids, alcohols, and amines. results from the study showed distinct differences among the fpec-glc profiles of e. coli st-positive stools, of e. coli lt-positive stools, and of the control stool samples. an unidentified compound appearing in the ether-soluble hydroxy acid fraction from e. coli st-positive stools was tentatively identified by mass spectrometry as 6-methoxy-2-hydroxyhexanoic acid. 6-methoxy-2-hydroxyhexanoic acid was found in all stools that contained e. coli st but was not present either in stools from which e. coli lt was isolated or in control samples. 6-methoxy-2-hydroxyhexanoic acid may prove to be an important marker for use in the identification of e. coli st. in addition to 6-methoxy-2-hydroxyhexanoic acid, the carboxylic acid, alcohol, and amine fpec-glc profiles obtained from stools were very different between these two organisms. the data indicate that fpec-glc analysis of diarrheal stool specimens might be a rapid way to distinguish diarrhea caused by e. coli st, e. coli lt, clostridium difficile, and rotavirus.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of mt-141, a new semisynthetic cephamycin, compared with those of five cephalosporins.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of mt-141 were compared with those of cefoxitin, cefmetazole, moxalactam, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone. the mics of mt-141 for 90% of bacterial isolates were lower than the reference drugs  against clinical isolates of campylobacter jejuni, clostridium difficile, and bacteroides fragilis, whereas against clinical isolates of other gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, the mics of mt-141 were similar to or higher than those of the reference drugs. in contrast, the bactericidal activity  of mt-141 after 6- and 24-h exposures was superior to all of the reference drugs  against 9 to 10 of the 12 bacterial strains studied, including escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enteritidis, indol-positive proteus species, serratia marcescens, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas cepacia, and clostridium perfringens. in the treatment of systemic infections in mice, mt-141  was again superior against 9 of the 12 strains tested, showing a good correlation with the bactericidal activity. it was found that the 50% effective doses of the  six cephalosporins studied correlated better with the mbcs than with the mics. as the serum levels of mt-141 in mice after subcutaneous administration were similar to those of the reference drugs, it was concluded that the bactericidal activity  of mt-141 was a dominant factor in its in vivo activity.

TI  == micro-organisms in gastroenteritis.
AB  == we present bacteriological and virological findings together with salient clinical features from a prospective study of 447 children aged under 2 years admitted to hospital with infectious gastroenteritis. putative pathogenic micro-organisms were identified in the stools of 75% of these children. eight identifiably distinct groups of viruses, found on electron microscopy and tissue  culture were present in 67% of patients--rotavirus was detected most frequently.  pathogenic bacteria (salmonellas, shigellas, escherichia coli, and campylobacter  jejuni--but excluding clostridium difficile) were found in 16% only. altogether 4 x 9% of 390 patients had gastroenteritis associated with cl difficile toxin. the  mean duration of diarrhoea was shortest in patients with identifiable virus, with rotavirus having a mean of 5 x 01 days, and was longest in patients with pathogenic bacteria in the stools (11 x 14 days). the finding of more than one type of virus did not seem to be associated with a significantly increased duration of diarrhoea. there are few clinical features which can be associated specifically with any particular micro-organism or groups of these. multiple organism isolation was common, but the severity of the illness in those patients  with at least two types of organism was not greater. certain viruses, including the norwalk-like virus, known to be associated with outbreaks of gastroenteritis  were found as frequently in a group of patients who did not have diarrhoea studied for comparison. virus was still detectable in the stools of up to 40% of  asymptomatic children on the day of discharge.

TI  == comparative study of the nature and biological activities of bacterial enterotoxins.
AB  == it is apparent that there are considerable similarities between many of the enterotoxins produced by enteric pathogens. although the effect of most of these  toxins is restricted to the intestine in vivo, many cells are also sensitive to intoxication in vitro. the resultant in-vitro biochemical changes may have no pathological significance but serve to underline the central role of cyclic nucleotides in cellular fluid regulation. the biological activity of these enterotoxins is the result of interaction with membrane-bound adenylate cyclase,  leading to persistent elevation of intracellular levels of camp. stimulation of adenylate cyclase occurs consistently after a characteristic lag phase which varies somewhat between toxins. the duration and degree of stimulation of adenylate cyclase by the various toxins may point to possible differences in affinity, dissociation and mechanism of activation of the cyclase molecule. subtle events at, or within, the cell membrane must occur during intoxication and may include complex associations of toxin with membrane lipid and protein components. the heat-labile toxins of v. cholerae, e. coli, salmonella spp., a. hydrophila and y. enterocolitica have much in common in their structures, membrane receptors and biochemical modes of action. similarly the heat-stable toxins of e. coli and y. enterocolitica, match each other in their biological activities. classified along with the enterotoxin of c. perfringens, the enterotoxin produced by sh. dysenteriae (and possibly some strains of e. coli) appears to differ from the other enterotoxins by acting on protein biosynthesis primarily and not on the nucleotide cyclase activation systems. in another category must be placed the various enterotoxins produced by staph. aureus until  more is known. surprisingly little research has been directed towards the elucidation of their mode of action, although much is known of their serological  and structural differences. evidence to date suggests that staphylococcal enterotoxins differ from the other diarrhoeagenic agents discussed in this review. the structural and immunological similarities between the various heat-labile enterotoxins suggest a common genetic origin with gene transfer between the different bacterial species being responsible for the spread of enterotoxigenicity. it is possible that many of the "newer" enterotoxins owe their origin to genetic recombination with the "older" enteropathogens like v. cholerae.

TI  == diarrhea.
AB  == the four major mechanisms of diarrhea are osmotic forces, secretory forces, exudation from a disrupted intestinal mucosa, and disturbed intestinal motility.  in many illnesses, more than one mechanism produces diarrhea. the rotaviruses and the norwalk viruses have recently been recognized as common causes of viral gastroenteritis. also, the major cause of antibiotic-associated colitis is now known to be an overgrowth of clostridium difficile. campylobacter has also been identified as a common cause of acute bacterial diarrhea both abroad and in canada. most cases of travellers' diarrhea are caused by strains of escherichia coli to which the traveller has little immunity. most travellers who develop diarrhea benefit from treatment with diphenoxylate, loperamide or bismuth subsalicylate. the few patients who develop more severe, incapacitating diarrhea  are candidates for treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. antibiotics should not be used to prevent travellers' diarrhea, because antibiotic resistance is becoming a problem.

TI  == recent advances in management of bacterial diarrhea.
AB  == the number of recognized infectious causes of diarrhea potentially treatable with specific antibiotics has markedly increased within the past ten years. laboratories are developing and expanding their abilities to deal with these new  pathogens. neither prophylaxis nor specific treatment of diarrhea in travelers is simple, practical, and safe. although enterotoxigenic escherichia coli is the most important cause of diarrhea in u.s. travelers to tropical areas, campylobacter jejuni causes acute diarrhea in persons in the united states about  as often as do salmonella and shigella. vibrio parahemolyticus is an important cause of outbreaks of gastroenteritis following ingestion of improperly cooked shellfish; bacillus cereus is important in outbreaks of diarrhea after ingestion  of improperly cooked and stored rice in chinese restaurants. although yersinia enterocolitica is probably an important cause of severe enteritis in the united states, imperfect techniques for its isolation and lack of good serologic tests have hampered recognition of its importance. practical means for diagnosing antibiotic-associated colitis and the role of clostridium difficile toxins in this disease are now available. vancomycin, metronidazole, bacitracin, and cholestyramine are useful in treatment of antibiotic-associated colitis.

AB  == a comparison was made of the in vitro activities of norfloxacin and of nine other orally administered antibacterial agents against 180 clinical isolates representing the bacterial species most frequently implicated in infections of the gastrointestinal tract in humans. the 90% minimal inhibitory concentrations showed norfloxacin to be 4, 15, 4, 17, 17, 17, and 33 times more active than the  next best compound tested against campylobacter fetus subsp. jejuni, escherichia  coli, salmonella spp., shigella spp., vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, and yersinia enterocolitica, respectively, with an overall 90% minimal inhibitory concentration of less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. norfloxacin was least active against clostridium difficile (90% minimal inhibitory concentration, 128 micrograms/ml). these results should encourage further evaluation of norfloxacin  as a potential chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of enteric bacterial infections for which antibiotic therapy is indicated.

TI  == development of gut colonisation in pre-term neonates.
AB  == twenty-eight pre-term babies of low birth weight were monitored for developing microflora in throat, stomach and faeces during the first 3 weeks of life. the flora at all levels of the gastrointestinal tract differed from that of healthy breast-fed and artificially fed full-term babies. colonisation of throat and stomach was delayed beyond 4 days of life in 87% and 60% of babies respectively.  only 10% of babies had "normal" oral flora throughout the period of study. flora  of the stomach was sparse, and resembled faecal flora. faecal flora was established more rapidly than throat or stomach flora, and 70% of babies were colonised during the first 4 days of life. initially bacteroides spp. were predominant (57% babies), but escherichia coli and other aerobic gram-negative bacilli gradually increased in frequency. colonisation by gram-positive bacteria  was slow. clostridium spp. were present in only 10% of babies during the first 4  days of life. most strains were transient. colonisation with c. butyricum (30%),  c. perfringens (35%) and c. difficile (25%) was maximum after the first 2 weeks of life. lactic-acid-producing bacteria usually appeared late in the third week of life. parenteral feeding immediately after birth was associated with delayed colonisation by a restricted number of species. parenteral antibiotics (penicillin or gentamicin or both) restricted colonisation with normal oral flora, the lactic-acid-producing bacteria and penicillin-sensitive clostridia, but had little effect on e. coli even when the colonising strain was sensitive to the aminoglycoside in the regimen. systemic spread of bacteria via the blood stream was not detected in any babies. the pattern of colonisation of the enteric tract in pre-term infants in the special-care nursery studied, differs from that  of healthy full-term babies; this merits consideration when the results of bacteriological tests of this vulnerable group of infants are being interpreted.

TI  == enteropathogenicity: recent developments.
AB  == recent studies have added important new information to our understanding of the pathogenesis and ethiology of diarrheal disease. vibrio cholerae produces a heat-labile enterotoxin, affecting cyclic amp. a very similar heat-labile enterotoxin is produced also by certain strains of escherichia coli, as well as by citrobacter, klebsiella, and aeromonas. e. coli may also produce a heat-stable enterotoxin, stimulating guanylate cyclase activity. in order to produce the pathologic effects, e. coli first attaches to epithelial cells of the intestinal  tract by means of pili or surface antigens. enterotoxin can be demonstrated by both in vivo and in vitro tests, but none are yet suitable for routine diagnostic laboratories. a third mechanism whereby e. coli causes diarrheal disease consists of enteroinvasiveness. campylobacter, yersinia, and clostridium difficile have been added to the list of enteric pathogens of man.

TI  == the bacterial flora of neonates with congenital abnormalities of the gastro-intestinal tract.
AB  == the development of the bacterial flora of neonates with congenital abnormalities  of the gastro-intestinal tract was studied in 31 infants during the first 10 days of life. specimens were collected from the umbilicus, mouth and gastro-intestinal tract on the pre-operative day, at operation and on post-operative days 1, 2, 3,  5, 7 and 10. bacteria were isolated semi-quantitatively on a variety of plain and selective media and identified by conventional methods.staphylococcus albus was the predominant species isolated from the umbilicus; it was recovered from 24 of  the 31 babies. the viridans group of streptococci and streptococcus salivarius were the commonest species isolated from the mouth; there were no differences between the babies with different abnormalities and treatment with antibiotics had no effect on the bacterial flora. ten babies were colonized by each species on the pre-operative day, and 25 and 19 respectively by the tenth post-operative  day. anaerobic gram-positive cocci were the predominant oral anaerobes. bacteria  were not isolated from the rectal swabs of babies with tracheo-oesophageal fistula (tof) or small bowel atresia on the pre-operative days. post-operatively  the predominant faecal isolates from babies with tof were str. faecalis, escherichia coli and clostridium perfringens. about 80% of the babies with small  bowel atresia were colonized by str. faecalis and bacteroides vulgatus, 60% each  by e. coli, klebsiella aerogenes and str. faecium. the five babies with necrotizing enterocolitis were colonized by str. faecalis, e. coli, cl. perfringens and cl. difficile; bacteroides spp. were not recovered from any of them. the commonest facultative species recovered from babies with large bowel obstruction were str. faecalis and e. coli. b. vulgatus, cl. perfringens and bifidobacterium spp. were the commonest anaerobes and anaerobes outnumbered aerobes. no significant isolates were recovered from the wound swabs and none of  the babies developed post-surgical sepsis.

TI  == morphologic and functional effects of clostridium difficile enterotoxin in tissue culture.
AB  == the effects of the clostridium difficile toxin were examined in hela and mouse adrenal tumor (mat) cells. cytotoxicity was evaluated by vital dye exclusion and  51cr release. in both hela and mat cells, c. difficile toxin caused rounding of virtually 100% of cells. this rounding was distinguishable from rounding produced by the escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (lt): (1) lt was inactive in hela cells; (2) in mat cells, c. difficile toxin produced uniformly rounded cells, while lt-rounded cells usually had cytoplasmic extensions and a regular background of flattened cells. in c. difficile toxin affected hela cells, there were less than mitotic figures per 1000 cells compared with 15-18 in controls. clostridium difficile toxin treated hela cells showed less than 10% cytotoxicity  in 24 h and no more than 30% by 74 h, similar to control cells. however, paralleling the suppression of mitotic figures, cell multiplication was inhibited in c. difficile toxin treated cells when subcultured in a short-term (72 h) assay compared with up to a 500% increase in control cells. this inhibition was also seen in a 6-week cloning assay in which c. difficile toxin treated cells had a cloning efficiency of less than 1% compared with approximately 10% in controls. we conclude that the major effect of the c. difficile toxin is inhibition of growth rather than immediate cell death. the relationship of this growth inhibition to colitis remains to be elucidated.

TI  == toxin-producing bacteria in infants. lack of an association with sudden infant death syndrome.
AB  == after finding enterotoxigenic (et) escherichia coli in two consecutive cases of sudden infant death syndrome (sids), we initiated a prospective search for et e coli in sids in manitoba; in addition, we looked for toxigenic clostridium botulinum and c difficile. in a 21-month period, small- and large-bowel contents  were obtained in 33 cases of sids, from 32 control subjects, and in ten suspected cases of sids. neither c botulinum nor et e coli was isolated from any of these;  c difficile was cultured from postmortem bowel contents of two sids and seven control cases. the overall isolation rate of c difficile was 17%. despite the fact that two of these cases had toxin detectable in the bowel contents, no evidence of colitis was found in any of the cases with c difficile. we conclude that c botulinum or et e coli have only a small role, if any, in the etiology of  sids, and that c difficile is found relatively commonly in the gastrointestinal tract of infants without apparent local or systemic effects.

TI  == bacterial interference between clostridium difficile and normal fecal flora.
AB  == clostridium difficile has been shown to be the cause of virtually all cases of pseudomembranous colitis related to the administration of antimicrobial agents. it is possible that some antimicrobial agents alter the normal bacterial flora of the gastrointestinal tract so as to permit colonization and/or proliferation by c. difficile. the inhibitory activity of representative fecal bacteria from 23 anaerobic and aerobic genera against c. difficile was examined using two in vitro procedures. strains of bacteria in six of the genera inhibited the multiplication of c. difficile, with lactobacillus organisms and group d enterococci displaying  the most antagonistic activity. c. difficile was examined for its ability to inhibit the multiplication of several fecal strains of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. all eight strains of c. difficile tested inhibited the growth of particular strains of bacteria in the genera bacteroides, peptococcus, and peptostreptococcus.

TI  == neutralizing activity against clostridium difficile toxin in the supernatants of  cultured colostral cells.
AB  == human colostral specimens were obtained from 60 japanese postpartum women within  the first 3 days after delivery. neutralizing activity against clostridium difficile toxin was evaluated with y1 adrenal cells in miniculture. when y1 adrenal cells were exposed briefly to the toxin, they showed a rounding response  in culture, resembling that effected by escherichia coli enterotoxin; however, preincubation of the toxin with aqueous phase of colostrum significantly reduced  its cytopathic effect on y1 adrenal cells. of 60 colostral specimens, 17 samples  had neutralizing activity against the toxin. cell-free supernatants of colostral  cells cultured for 7 days without mitogens contained significant amounts of both  immunoglobulin a (iga) and igm, but very small amounts of igg. neutralizing activity of cell-free supernatants of cultured colostral cells was evaluated as described above. neutralizing activity against the toxin was identified in five samples of culture supernatants out of 60 colostral cell specimens. in all five cases, the aqueous phase of colostrum also had a neutralizing effect against c. difficile toxin. neutralizing activity against the toxin found in five supernatants of cultured colostral cells was completely abolished only by anti-human iga antibody as assessed by immune precipitation.

TI  == effects of clostridium difficile toxin on tissue-cultured cells.
AB  == a partially purified toxin of clostridium difficile induced similar morphologic changes in three different tissue-cultured mammalian cell lines. the morphologic  changes were not associated with biochemical changes indentical to those caused by the enterotoxins of vibrio cholerae and escherichia coli. although the mechanisms responsible for the noncytotoxic morphologic effects remain to be delineated, the toxin appears to exert its effects by directly affecting membrane constituents.

TI  == clindamycin-induced enterocolitis in hamsters.
AB  == a lethal enterocolitis was induced in hamsters by oral or parenteral administration of clindamycin in amounts comparable to those used in treatment of humans. the intestinal lesions were characterized histologically as an acute inflammatory reaction with pseudomembrane formation and resembled the lesions seen in humans with antibiotic-induced colitis. results of quantitative stool cultures showed the numbers of peptostreptococcus and corynebacterium decreased in animals with colitis after challenge with 100 mg of clindamycin/kg, while numbers of escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, and clindamycin-resistant clostridium sordellii and clostridium difficile increased. bacteria were not seen within the intestinal lesions. viruses were not isolated from hamsters with colitis. although the pathogenesis of this syndrome is not completely established, the evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that the disease is caused by clostridial toxins and that the production of these toxins by organisms within the intestines is enhanced by the effects of clindamycin upon the bowel flora.

TI  == competitive effects of intestinal microflora on vibrio cholerae in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == the coexistence of vibrio cholerae and several intestinal bacteria was determined in gnotobiotic mice. the bacteria tested included a bacteroides sp, clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens type a, 2 separate isolates of escherichia coli, 2 different lactobacilli, 2 separate isolates of proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas maltophilia, and streptococcus faecalis. each species of bacteria became established and was recovered repeatedly from the stools during the studies. no single strain or species was found that would eliminate v cholerae from these mice within 2 wk. not until a combination of e coli, p mirabilis, and  s faecalis was present in the mice did v cholerae disappear from the stools in 14 da.

TI  == autoantibodies to colon in germfree rats monocontaminated with clostridium difficile.
AB  == germfree rats monocontaminated with the anaerobic microorganisms clostridium difficile or another clostridium species (strain g 62) produce auto-antibodies to colon antigen. the antigen can be extracted with phenol water from the feces of germfree rats. antibodies, demonstrable by means of passive hemagglutination of antigen sensitized sheep erythrocytes appear after monocontamination for 35 days  or longer. the indirect immunofluorescence techniques, applied to sections of germfree rat colon, gave positive mucosal staining. the staining was similar to that obtained with sera from patients with ulcerative colitis or from rats immunized with rabbit colon. no antibodies were found in the sera of germfree rats, germfree rats monocontaminated with various other bacteria, conventional rats of germfree origin, or conventional sprague-dawley rats. although the anti-colon antibodies of the clostridium infected rats reacted with the same feces extract as the antibodies of ulcerative colitis patients or of rabbit colon immunized rats, their specificity was different. while the latter cross-react with polysaccharide from e. coli o14, those from the clostridium-infected exgermfree rats did not. rats monocontaminated with cl. difficile also developed  antibodies to this organism, but no cross-reaction between cl. difficile antigen  and colon antigen could be demonstrated. this speaks against breakage of tolerance by cross-reacting bacterial antigen as the cause of autoimmunity in these rats. other possible mechanisms for autoantibody production in this model are immunogenic alteration of gastrointestinal mucins by bacterial degradation, adjuvant effects of bacterial products, or both.

TI  == immunological studies in ulcerative colitis. iv. origin of autoantibodies.
AB  == the incidence and height of antibody titers to colon, assayed by indirect hemagglutination with a heat stable colon extract from germ free rats, is significantly higher in sera from patients with ulcerative colitis than in those  from healthy controls or from patients with amebic liver abscess or dysentery. while sera from ulcerative colitis patients and controls are indistinguishable in regard to incidence and height of antibody titers to forsman antigen, staphylococcus aureus s 209, clostridium difficile, and several common strains of e. coli, they have elevated titers and increased incidence of antibodies to a heat stable antigen of e. coli o14. patients with amebic dysentery have normal titers of such antibodies. absorption of patients' sera with e. coli o14 antigen  inhibits the colon directed hemagglutination reaction in approximately 30% of the cases tested. likewise, the anti-e. coli o14 reaction can sometimes be inhibited  with the colon extract. other e. coli strains and other bacteria are inactive or  have only weak inhibitory activity. hemagglutination inhibition experiments show  that germ free rat colon and e. coli o14 contain common structures, depicted by antibodies in the patients' sera. this pattern of reactivity closely resembles that seen in rats made autoimmune to colon by injection of newborn rabbit colon.  e. coli o14 is known to carry a heterogenetic antigen present in lower concentration (or activity) in most enterobacteriaceae. hemagglutination inhibition experiments with rabbit antisera to e. coli o14 suggest that the antigen common for e. coli o14 and colon is related to this heterogenetic antigen. the findings imply that this antigen, which is constantly present in low concentrations in the human colon, may give rise to anticolon antibody formation  in ulcerative colitis through breakage of tolerance. since this antigen is present in healthy individuals as well, additional factors are required to explain the induction of anti-colon autoimmunity in ulcerative colitis.
