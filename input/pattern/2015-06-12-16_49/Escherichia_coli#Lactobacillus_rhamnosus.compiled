TI  - In vitro inhibition of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide genotoxicity by probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus IMC501.
AB  - Inhibition of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) genotoxicity by a probiotic strain of Lactobacillus rhamnosus (IMC501) was assessed by the prokaryotic short-term bioassay SOS-Chromotest, using Escherichia coli PQ37 as target organism. Results showed the ability of strain IMC501 to rapidly and markedly counteract, in vitro, the DNA damage originated by the considered genotoxin. The inhibition was associated with a spectroscopic hypsochromic shift of original 4-NQO profile and progressive absorbance increase of a new peak. IR-Raman and GC-MS analyses confirmed the disappearance of 4-NQO after contact with the microorganism showing, also, the absence of any genotoxic molecule potentially available for metabolic activation (i.e. 4-hydroxyaminoquinoline-1-oxide and 4-nitrosoquinoline-1-oxide). Further, we have shown the presence of the phenyl-quinoline and its isomers as major non-genotoxic conversion product which led to the hypothesis of a possible pattern of molecular transformation. These findings increase knowledge on lactobacilli physiology and contribute to the further consideration of antigenotoxicty as a non-conventional functional property of particular probiotic strains.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 Lactobacillus and three Bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. Agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (pH 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; CFS) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; CFW) from de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. Acid CFS and CFW showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against C. albicans. Neutralized CFS/CFW assays showed six strains active against S. aureus (L. acidophilus L-1, L. brevis 1, L. fermentum 1, B. animalis subsp. lactis L-3), E. coli (L. bulgaricus 6) or B. cereus (L. plantarum 24-4capital VE, Cyrillic). Inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized CFS (L. bulgaricus 6, L. helveticus 3, L. plantarum 24-2L, L. fermentum 1)/CFW (L. plantarum 24-5D, L. plantarum 24-4capital VE, Cyrillic) was detected. Some strains maintained activity after pH neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. The antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the Epsilometer test method. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. Four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (L. rhamnosus Lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (L. acidophilus L-1 and L. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; L. casei L-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). Vancomycin MICs > 256 mug/mL indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. The antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.
TI  - Probiotic features of Lactobacillus strains isolated from Ragusano and Pecorino Siciliano cheeses.
AB  - In the present study 177 Lactobacillus spp. strains, isolated from Ragusano and Pecorino Siciliano cheeses, were in vitro screened for probiotic traits, and their characteristics were compared to those of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, commercial strain. Based on acidic and bile salt resistance, thirteen Lactobacillus strains were selected. The multiplex-PCR application revealed that nine strains belonged to L. rhamnosus species and four to Lactobacillus paracasei species. All selected strains were further investigated for transit tolerance in simulated upper gastrointestinal tract (GI), for adhesion capacity to human intestinal cell lines, for hydrophobicity, for co-aggregation and auto-aggregation and for antimicrobial activities. Moreover, antibiotic resistance, hemolytic and bile salt hydrolase activities were investigated for safety assessment. Viable counts after simulated gastric and duodenal transit revealed that overall the selected lactobacilli tolerated better pancreatic juice and bile salts than acidic juice. In particular, three L. rhamnosus strains (FS10, FS2, and PS11) and one L. paracasei strain (PM8) increased their cell density after the simulated GI transit. The same strains showed also high percentage of auto-aggregation and co-aggregation with Escherichia coli. All strains were effective against both Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli and variability was achieved versus Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus faecalis used as pathogenic indicator strains. Different behavior was revealed by strains for adhesion ability and hydrophobicity, which are not always linked each other and are strongly strain-dependent. From the safety point of view, no isolate showed hemolytic and bile salt hydrolase activities, except one, and most of the strains were sensitive to a broad range of clinical antibiotics. This work showed that the L. rhamnosus FS10 and the L. paracasei PM8 are good promising probiotic candidates for further in vivo investigations.
TI  - Preparative scale purification of fucosyl-N-acetylglucosamine disaccharides and their evaluation as potential prebiotics and antiadhesins.
AB  - Fucosyl-N-acetylglucosamine disaccharides are important core structures that form part of human mucosal and milk glyco-complexes. We have previously shown that AlfB and AlfC alpha-L-fucosidases from Lactobacillus casei are able to synthesize fucosyl-alpha-1,3--N-acetylglucosamine (Fuc-alpha1,3-GlcNAc) and fucosyl-alpha-1,6-N-acetylglucosamine (Fuc-alpha1,6-GlcNAc), respectively, in transglycosylation reactions. Here, these reactions were performed in a semipreparative scale, and the produced disaccharides were purified. The maximum yields obtained of Fuc-alpha1,3-GlcNAc and Fuc-alpha1,6-GlcNAc were 4.2 and 9.3 g/l, respectively. The purified fucosyl-disaccharides were then analyzed for their prebiotic effect in vitro using strains from the Lactobacillus casei/paracasei/rhamnosus group and from Bifidobacterium species. The results revealed that 6 out of 11 L. casei strains and 2 out of 6 L. rhamnosus strains tested were able to ferment Fuc-alpha1,3-GlcNAc, and L. casei BL87 and L. rhamnosus BL327 strains were also able to ferment Fuc-alpha1,6-GlcNAc. DNA hybridization experiments suggested that the metabolism of Fuc-alpha1,3-GlcNAc in those strains relies in an alpha-L-fucosidase homologous to AlfB. Bifidobacterium breve and Bibidobacterium pseudocatenolatum species also metabolized Fuc-alpha1,3-GlcNAc. Notably, L-fucose was excreted from all the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains fermenting fucosyl-disaccharides, except from strains L. rhamnosus BL358 and BL377, indicating that in these latest strains, L-fucose was catabolized. The fucosyl-disaccharides were also tested for their inhibitory potential of pathogen adhesion to human colon adenocarcinoma epithelial (HT29) cell line. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) strains isolated from infantile gastroenteritis were used, and the results showed that both fucosyl-disaccharides inhibited adhesion to different extents of certain EPEC strains to HT29 cells in tissue culture.
TI  - A Selected Lactobacillus rhamnosus Strain Promotes EGFR-Independent Akt Activation in an Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli K88-Infected IPEC-J2 Cell Model.
AB  - Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are important intestinal pathogens that cause diarrhea in humans and animals. Although probiotic bacteria may protect against ETEC-induced enteric infections, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In this study, porcine intestinal epithelial J2 cells (IPEC-J2) were pre-incubated with and without Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 7469 and then exposed to F4+ ETEC. Increases in TLR4 and NOD2 mRNA expression were observed at 3 h after F4+ ETEC challenge, but these increases were attenuated by L. rhamnosus treatment. Expression of TLR2 and NOD1 mRNA was up-regulated in cells pre-treated with L. rhamnosus. Pre-treatment with L. rhamnosus counteracted F4+ ETEC-induced increases in TNF-alpha concentration. Increased PGE2. concentrations were observed in cells infected with F4+ ETEC and in cells treated with L. rhamnosus only. A decrease in phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was observed at 3 h after F4+ ETEC challenge in cells treated with L. rhamnosus. Pre-treatment with L. rhamnosus enhanced Akt phosphorylation and increased ZO-1 and occludin protein expression. Our findings suggest that L. rhamnosus protects intestinal epithelial cells from F4+ ETEC-induced damage, partly through the anti-inflammatory response involving synergism between TLR2 and NOD1. In addition, L. rhamnosus promotes EGFR-independent Akt activation, which may activate intestinal epithelial cells in response to bacterial infection, in turn increasing tight junction integrity and thus enhancing the barrier function and restricting pathogen invasion. Pre-incubation with L. rhamnosus was superior to co-incubation in reducing the adhesion of F4+ ETEC to IPEC-J2 cells and subsequently attenuating F4+ ETEC-induced mucin layer destruction and suppressing apoptosis. Our data indicate that a selected L. rhamnosus strain interacts with porcine intestinal epithelial cells to maintain the epithelial barrier and promote intestinal epithelial cell activation in response to bacterial infection, thus protecting cells from the deleterious effects of F4+ ETEC.
TI  - A tyrosine phosphorylation switch controls the interaction between the transmembrane modulator protein Wzd and the tyrosine kinase Wze of Lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: One proposed mechanism for assembly of secreted heteropolysaccharides by many Gram positive bacteria relies on the coordinated action of a polymerization complex through reversible phosphorylation events. The role of the tyrosine protein kinase transmembrane modulator is, however, not well understood. RESULTS: The protein sequences deduced from the wzb, wzd and wze genes from Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 9595 and RW-9595 M contain motifs also found in corresponding proteins CpsB, CpsC and CpsD from Streptococcus pneumoniae D39 (serotype 2). Use of an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody demonstrated that both Wzd and Wze can be found in tyrosine phosphorylated form. When tyrosine 266 was mutated to phenylalanine, WzdY266F showed slightly less phosphorylated protein than those produced by using eight other tyrosine mutated Wzd genes, when expressed along with Wze and Wzb in Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363. In order to demonstrate the importance of ATP for the interactions among these proteins, native and fusion Wzb, Wzd and Wze proteins were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli cultures. The modulator protein, Wzd, binds with the phosphotyrosine kinase Wze, irrespective of its phosphorylation status. However, Wze attained a higher phosphorylation level after interacting with phosphorylated Wzd in the presence of 10 mM ATP. This highly phosphorylated Wze did not remain in close association with phosphorylated Wzd. CONCLUSION: The Wze tyrosine kinase protein of Lactobacillus rhamnosus thus carries out tyrosine phosphorylation of Wzd in addition to auto- and trans- phosphorylation of the kinase itself.
TI  - Effects of Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lactobacillus reuteri on gut barrier function and heat shock proteins in intestinal porcine epithelial cells.
AB  - Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a set of highly conserved proteins that can serve  as intestinal gate keepers in gut homeostasis. Here, effects of a probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), and two novel porcine isolates, Lactobacillus johnsonii strain P47-HY and Lactobacillus reuteri strain P43-HUV, on cytoprotective HSP expression and gut barrier function, were investigated in a porcine IPEC-J2 intestinal epithelial cell line model. The IPEC-J2 cells polarized on a permeable filter exhibited villus-like cell phenotype with development of apical microvilli. Western blot analysis detected HSP expression in IPEC-J2 and revealed that L. johnsonii and L. reuteri strains were able to significantly induce HSP27, despite high basal expression in IPEC-J2, whereas LGG did not. For HSP72, only the supernatant of L. reuteri induced the expression, which was comparable to the heat shock treatment, which indicated that HSP72 expression was more stimulus specific. The protective effect of lactobacilli was further studied in IPEC-J2 under an enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) challenge. ETEC caused intestinal barrier destruction, as reflected by loss of cell-cell contact, reduced IPEC-J2 cell viability and transepithelial electrical resistance, and disruption of tight junction protein zonula occludens-1. In contrast, the L. reuteri treatment substantially counteracted these detrimental effects and preserved the barrier function. L. johnsonii and LGG also achieved barrier protection, partly by directly inhibiting ETEC attachment. Together, the results indicate that specific strains of Lactobacillus can enhance gut barrier function through cytoprotective HSP induction and fortify the cell protection against ETEC challenge through tight junction protein modulation and direct interaction with pathogens.
TI  - Nitrate reduction to nitrite, nitric oxide and ammonia by gut bacteria under physiological conditions.
AB  - The biological nitrogen cycle involves step-wise reduction of nitrogen oxides to  ammonium salts and oxidation of ammonia back to nitrites and nitrates by plants and bacteria. Neither process has been thought to have relevance to mammalian physiology; however in recent years the salivary bacterial reduction of nitrate to nitrite has been recognized as an important metabolic conversion in humans. Several enteric bacteria have also shown the ability of catalytic reduction of nitrate to ammonia via nitrite during dissimilatory respiration; however, the importance of this pathway in bacterial species colonizing the human intestine has been little studied. We measured nitrite, nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia formation in cultures of Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species grown at different sodium nitrate concentrations and oxygen levels. We found that the presence of 5 mM nitrate provided a growth benefit and induced both nitrite and ammonia generation in E.coli and L.plantarum bacteria grown at oxygen concentrations compatible with the content in the gastrointestinal tract. Nitrite and ammonia accumulated in the growth medium when at least 2.5 mM nitrate was present. Time-course curves suggest that nitrate is first converted to nitrite and subsequently to ammonia. Strains of L.rhamnosus, L.acidophilus and B.longum infantis grown with nitrate produced minor changes in nitrite or ammonia levels in the cultures. However, when supplied with exogenous nitrite, NO gas was readily produced independently of added nitrate. Bacterial production of lactic acid causes medium acidification that in turn generates NO by non-enzymatic nitrite reduction. In contrast, nitrite was converted to NO by E.coli cultures even at neutral pH. We suggest that the bacterial nitrate reduction to ammonia, as well as the related NO formation in the gut, could be an important aspect of the overall mammalian nitrate/nitrite/NO metabolism and is yet another way in which the microbiome links diet and health.
TI  - Characterization of Lactobacillus isolated from dairy samples for probiotic properties.
AB  - In the present study twelve Lactobacillus isolates (LBS 1-LBS 12) were characterized for probiotic properties. Out of the twelve, eight isolates (LBS 1-6, 8 and 11) were bile resistant (survival > 50% at 0.3% bile salt w/v) and five isolates (LBS 1, 2, 5, 6 and 11) were found acid pH value resistant (survival > 50% at pH 3). All twelve isolates inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus whereas isolate LBS 2 also inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Antibiotic susceptibility testing of isolates was also performed and isolate LBS 2 was selected for further study based on its broad spectrum effect in clinical pathogen inhibition. LBS 2 was characterized phenotypically at Institute of Microbial Technology (IMTECH), Chandigarh, India and was confirmed as Lactobacillus rhamnosus by 16S rDNA sequencing and subsequent analysis using BLAST. The gene sequence was deposited in GenBank with accession number KJ562858. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) study was used to study in vitro epithelial cell adherence and bile salt effect on isolate LBS 2. Epithelial cells adherence assay showed positive results and surface roughness of LBS 2 increased with increase in bile salt (0.15-0.45% w/v).
TI  - Improved in vitro assay for determining the mucin adherence of bacteria sensitive to Triton X-100 treatment.
AB  - Mucin-associated microbiota are in relatively close contact with the intestinal epithelium and may thus have a more pronounced effect on host health. We have previously developed a simple mucin agar assay to simulate initial mucus colonization by intestinal microbial communities. Adherence of microbiota was estimated using flow cytometry after detachment with Triton X-100. In this study, the effect of this detergent on the cultivability of both virulent and commensal strains was investigated. Mucin attachment of selected strains was evaluated using the mucin adhesion assay. Bacteria were dislodged from the mucin surface by incubation with Triton or from the whole mucin agar layer using a stomacher. Mechanical extraction resulted in 1.24 +/- 0.42, 2.69 +/- 0.44, and 1.56 +/- 0.85 log CFU/mL higher plate counts of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bacillus cereus, and Escherichia coli strains, respectively, than the chemical method. The sensitivity of bacteria to Triton varied among microbial species and strains. Among others, Triton inhibited the growth of Salmonella enterica LMG 10396 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa LMG 8029 on laboratory media, although these bacteria maintained their viability during this treatment. Only Gram-positive strains, Enterococcus hirae LMG 6399 and L. rhamnosus GG, were not affected by this detergent. Therefore, the mechanical method is recommended for the extraction of mucin-adhered bacteria that are sensitive to Triton, especially when followed by traditional cultivation techniques. However, this approach can also be recommended for strains that are not affected by this detergent, because it resulted in higher recovery of adhered L. rhamnosus GG compared to the chemical extraction.
TI  - Functional properties of peanut fractions on the growth of probiotics and foodborne bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Various compounds found in peanut (Arachis hypogaea) have been shown to provide multiple benefits to human health and may influence the growth of a broad range of gut bacteria. In this study, we investigated the effects of peanut white kernel and peanut skin on 3 strains of Lactobacillus and 3 major foodborne enteric bacterial pathogens. Significant (P < 0.05) growth stimulation of Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus was observed in the presence of 0.5% peanut flour (PF) made from peanut white kernel, whereas 0.5% peanut skin extract (PSE) exerted the inhibitory effect on the growth of these beneficial microbes. We also found that within 72 h, PF inhibited growth of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 (EHEC), while PSE significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited Listeria monocytogenes but promoted the growth of both EHEC and Salmonella Typhimurium. The cell adhesion and invasion abilities of 3 pathogens to the host cells were also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced by 0.5% PF and 0.5% PSE. These results suggest that peanut white kernel might assist in improving human gut flora as well as reducing EHEC, whereas the beneficial effects of peanut skins require further research and investigation.
TI  - Purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of SpaD, a backbone-pilin subunit encoded by the fimbrial spaFED operon in Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG.
AB  - SpaD is the predicted backbone-pilin subunit of the SpaFED pilus, whose loci are  encoded by the fimbrial spaFED operon in Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, a Gram-positive gut-adapted commensal strain with perceived probiotic benefits. In this study, soluble recombinant SpaD protein was overproduced in Escherichia coli and then purified by Ni2+-chelating affinity and gel-filtration chromatography. After limited proteolysis with alpha-chymotrypsin, good-quality crystals of SpaD were obtained which diffracted beyond 2.0 A resolution. These crystals belonged to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a=50.11, b=83.27, c=149.65 A. For phasing, sodium iodide-derivatized crystals were prepared using the halide quick-soaking method and diffraction data were collected in-house to a resolution of 2.2 A. An interpretable electron-density map was successfully obtained using single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD).
TI  - In vitro characterization of the digestive stress response and immunomodulatory properties of microorganisms isolated from smear-ripened cheese.
AB  - Thirty-six microorganisms (twenty-one bacteria, twelve yeasts and three fungi) were isolated from surface-ripened cheeses and subjected to in vitro digestive stress. The approach mimicked gastric and/or duodenal digestion. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 and Saccharomyces boulardii were used as reference strains. We studied the microorganisms grown separately in culture medium and then included (or not) in a rennet gel. The microorganisms' immunomodulatory abilities were also assessed by profiling cytokine induction in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The loss of viability was less than 1 log CFU/mL for yeasts under all conditions. In contrast, Gram-negative bacteria survived gastric and/or duodenal stress well but most of the Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive (especially to gastric stress). Inclusion of sensitive Gram-positive bacteria in rennet gel dramatically improved gastric survival, when compared with a non-included cultured (with a 4 log CFU/mL change in survival). However, the rennet gel did not protect the bacteria against duodenal stress. The PBMC cytokine assay tests showed that the response to yeasts was usually anti-inflammatory, whereas the response to bacteria varied from one strain to another.
TI  - Use of Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus to Prevent Cholangitis in Biliary Atresia After Kasai Operation.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Recurrent cholangitis may aggravate cholestatic liver cirrhosis in biliary atresia (BA) after the Kasai operation. This pilot study aimed to investigate whether Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus has the prophylactic efficacy for recurrent cholangitis in comparison with the conventional neomycin prophylaxis. METHODS: Twenty jaundice-free patients with BA ages 0 to 3 years who underwent a Kasai operation were enrolled and randomized into 2 groups with 10 patients each: neomycin (25 mg . kg . day for 4 days/wk) and L casei rhamnosus (8 x 10 colony-forming unit per day) groups. The treatment duration was 6 months. Bacterial stool cultures were performed before treatment and 1, 3, and 6 months after starting treatment. In addition, 10 patients with BA with similar status but without prophylaxis served as the historical control group. RESULTS: In the Lactobacillus group, 2 patients (20%, mean 0.03 +/- 0.07 episodes per month) developed cholangitis during the study period, with the same frequency as in the neomycin group and significantly lower than that in the control group (80%, P = 0.005, mean 0.22 +/- 0.16 episodes per month). The mean change in body weight z score during the 6 months in the Lactobacillus group was 0.97 +/- 0.59, which was significantly better than that in the control group (-0.01 +/- 0.79, P = 0.006). In bacterial stool cultures, the Lactobacillus and Escherichia coli populations significantly increased and decreased, respectively, in the Lactobacillus group. CONCLUSIONS: The use of L casei rhamnosus was as effective as neomycin in preventing cholangitis in patients with BA who underwent Kasai operation, and therefore could be considered as a potential alternative prophylactic regimen.
TI  - Gut commensal microvesicles reproduce parent bacterial signals to host immune and enteric nervous systems.
AB  - Ingestion of a commensal bacteria, Lactobacillus rhamnosus JB-1, has potent immunoregulatory effects, and changes nerve-dependent colon migrating motor complexes (MMCs), enteric nerve function, and behavior. How these alterations occur is unknown. JB-1 microvesicles (MVs) are enriched for heat shock protein components such as chaperonin 60 heat-shock protein isolated from Escherichia coli (GroEL) and reproduce regulatory and neuronal effects in vitro and in vivo. Ingested labeled MVs were detected in murine Peyer's patch (PP) dendritic cells (DCs) within 18 h. After 3 d, PP and mesenteric lymph node DCs assumed a regulatory phenotype and increased functional regulatory CD4(+)25(+)Foxp3+ T cells. JB-1, MVs, and GroEL similarly induced phenotypic change in cocultured DCs via multiple pathways including C-type lectin receptors specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing non-integrin-related 1 and Dectin-1, as well as TLR-2 and -9. JB-1 and MVs also decreased the amplitude of neuronally dependent MMCs in an ex vivo model of peristalsis. Gut epithelial, but not direct neuronal application of, MVs, replicated functional effects of JB-1 on in situ patch-clamped enteric neurons. GroEL and anti-TLR-2 were without effect in this system, suggesting the importance of epithelium neuron signaling and discrimination between pathways for bacteria-neuron and -immune communication. Together these results offer a mechanistic explanation of how Gram-positive commensals and probiotics may influence the host's immune and nervous systems.
TI  - The effect of a multi-strain probiotic on the resistance toward Escherichia coli  challenge in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind intervention study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several probiotic strains have been shown to enhance human resistance to infectious disease. It is speculated that these strains may impose this effect by excretion of anti-microbial components, by competing with pathogens for intestinal nutrients and/or mucosal adhesion sites or modulating the immune system. OBJECTIVE: A parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled 4-week intervention was performed in healthy males, to study the effect of a blend of probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus helveticus Rosell-52, Lactobacillus rhamnosus Rosell-11, Bifidobacterium longum ssp. longum Rosell-175) and a probiotic yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae var boulardii CNCM I-1079) on enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) challenge. Primary outcomes studied were fecal ETEC excretion and total fecal output per day. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Subjects were randomized to the probiotic (5 x 10(9) colony-forming units (CFUs); twice daily; n=30) or placebo group (twice daily; n=30). After 2 weeks, subjects were orally challenged with a live attenuated ETEC (3 x 10(9) CFU), previously demonstrated to induce mild, short-lived symptoms of a foodborne infection. Before and after ETEC challenge, subjects collected 24 h fecal samples. Compliance to study guidelines, stool consistency (Bristol Stool Score), stool frequency, and frequency and severity of gastrointestinal (GI) complaints were recorded by the subjects on a Daily Record Questionnaire. RESULTS: ETEC challenge induced a significant increase in fecal ETEC excretion in both groups. However, a statistically significant increase in fecal output was only observed in the probiotic group. ETEC challenge resulted in a decrease in the percentage of fecal dry weight, and an increase in reported Bristol Stool Score, stool frequency and GI complaints. Dietary probiotics significantly decreased the percentage of fecal dry weight. In addition, ETEC increased C-reactive protein, total secretory Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and Immunoglobulin G Colonization Factor Antigen II. CONCLUSION: Dietary probiotics did not increase resistance to oral attenuated ETEC challenge in human subjects.
TI  - Survival of pathogenic and lactobacilli species of fermented olives during simulated human digestion.
AB  - The present survey uses a dynamic gastric and small intestinal model to assess the survival of one pathogenic (Escherichia coli O157:H7 EDL 933) and three lactobacilli bacteria with probiotic potential (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. pentosus TOMC-LAB2, and L. pentosus TOMC-LAB4) during their passage through the human gastrointestinal tract using fermented olives as the food matrix. The data showed that the survival of the E. coli strain in the stomach and duodenum was very low, while its transit through the distal parts (jejunum and ileum) resulted in an increase in the pathogen population. The production of Shiga toxins by this enterohemorrhagic microorganism in the ileal e ffl uents of the in vitro system was too low to be detected by ELISA assays. On the contrary, the three lactobacilli species assayed showed a considerable resistance to the gastric digestion, but not to the intestinal one, which affected their survival, and was especially evident in the case of both L. pentosus strains. In spite of this, high population levels for all assayed microorganisms were recovered at the end of the gastrointestinal passage. The results obtained in the present study show the potential use of table olives as a vehicle of beneficial microorganisms to the human body, as well as the need for good hygienic practices on the part of olive manufacturers in order to avoid the possibility of contamination by food-borne pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antibiofilm potential of biosurfactants isolated from lactobacilli against multi-drug-resistant pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biosurfactants (BS) are amphiphilic compounds produced by microbes, either on the cell surface or secreted extracellularly. BS exhibit strong antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties, making them good candidates for applications used to combat infections. In this study, our goal was to assess the in vitro antimicrobial, anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm abilities of BS produced by Lactobacillus jensenii and Lactobacillus rhamnosus against clinical Multidrug Resistant (MDR) strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Cell-bound BS from both L. jensenii and L. rhamnosus were extracted and isolated. The surface activities of crude BS samples were evaluated using an oil spreading assay. The antimicrobial, anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm activities of both BS against the above mentioned MDR pathogens were determined. RESULTS: Surface activities for both BS ranged from 6.25 to 25 mg/ml with clear zones observed between 7 and 11 cm. BS of both L. jensenii and L. rhamnosus showed antimicrobial activities against A. baumannii, E. coli and S. aureus at 25-50 mg/ml. Anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm activities were also observed for the aforementioned pathogens between 25 and 50 mg/ml. Finally, analysis by electron microscope indicated that the BS caused membrane damage for A. baumannii and pronounced cell wall damage in S. aureus. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that BS isolated from two Lactobacilli strains has antibacterial properties against MDR strains of A. baumannii, E. coli and MRSA. Both BS also displayed anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm abilities against A. baumannii, E. coli and S. aureus. Together, these capabilities may open up possibilities for BS as an alternative therapeutic approach for the prevention and/or treatment of hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - Improvement in Th1/Th2 immune homeostasis, antioxidative status and resistance to pathogenic E. coli on consumption of probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus fermented milk in aging mice.
AB  - Imbalance in Th1/Th2 immune pathways and cellular antioxidant systems with progressive aging are among the leading causes of increased risk of morbidity and mortality in elderly. Although probiotics have been considered to boost immune system, there is a lack of comprehensive analysis of probiotic effects on aging physiology. The present study aimed at determining anti-immunosenescence potential of milk fermented with probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LR) in 16 months old mice by concurrent analysis of immunosenescence markers associated with Th1/Th2 profile of splenocytes, inflamm-aging in plasma, neutrophil functions and antibody response in intestine along with analysis of antioxidant enzymes in liver and red blood cells (RBCs) after feeding trials of 1 and 2 months, respectively. An enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (ATCC 14948)-based infection model in aging mice was also designed to validate protective attributes of LR. Splenocytes registered increased IFN-gamma and decreased IL-4 and IL-10 production in LR-fed animals. Neutrophil respiratory burst enzymes and phagocytosis increased significantly while no aggravation in plasma levels of MCP-1 and TNF-alpha was observed. Further, owing to increased Th1 response, antibodies registered a decrease in IgG1/IgG2a ratio and IgE levels in LR groups. No significant variations were observed in secretory IgA and IgA + cells in the intestine. Antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase) in LR-fed groups recorded increased activities which were more pronounced in the liver than in RBCs. LR supplementation significantly reduced E. coli translocation to organs (intestine, liver, spleen, peritoneal fluid) by enhancing E. coli-specific antibodies (IgA and IgG1) and inflammatory proteins. In conclusion, LR supplementation alleviated immunosenescence-associated Th1/Th2 imbalance, improved antioxidant capacity, and enhanced resistance of aged mice to E. coli infection thereby signifying its potential in augmenting healthy aging.
TI  - Effectiveness of alternative methods for toothbrush disinfection: an in vitro study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative methods  for toothbrush disinfection. METHODS: Two-hundred eighty toothbrushes were included in the study. The toothbrushes were divided into 7 groups and were contaminated by standardized suspensions of Lactobacillus rhamnosus (L. rhamnosus), Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Escherichia coli (E. coli). The following disinfectants were tested: 1% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), 100% and 50% white vinegar, microwave (MW) oven, ultraviolet (UV) sanitizer, and mouth rinse-containing propolis (MCP). Data were analyzed with Kruskal Wallis and Dunn's tests. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found between different methods and control group for all tested bacteria. There were statistically significant differences between all test groups for all microorganisms. MW was the most effective for L. rhamnosus and 100% white vinegar was the most effective method for S. mutans and S. aureus. NaOCl was the most effective for E. coli. CONCLUSION: This study showed that 100% white vinegar was considered to be effective for tested microorganisms. Similarly, 1% NaOCl is cost-effective, easily accessible, and comparatively effective for toothbrush disinfection. Because these agents are nontoxic, cost-effective and easily accessible, they may be appropriate for household use.
TI  - Influence of bovine lactoferrin on the growth of selected probiotic bacteria under aerobic conditions.
AB  - Bovine lactoferrin (bLf) is a natural glycoprotein, and it shows broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. However, reports on the influences of bLf on probiotic bacteria have been mixed. We examined the effects of apo-bLf (between 0.25 and 128 mg/mL) on both aerobic and anaerobic cultures of probiotics. We found that bLf had similar effects on the growth of probiotics under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, and that it actively and significantly (at concentrations of >0.25 mg/mL) retarded the growth rate of Bifidobacterium bifidum (ATCC 29521), B. longum (ATCC 15707), B. lactis (BCRC 17394), B. infantis (ATCC 15697), Lactobacillus reuteri (ATCC 23272), L. rhamnosus (ATCC 53103), and L. coryniformis (ATCC 25602) in a dose-dependent manner. Otherwise, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were 128 or >128 mg/mL against B. bifidum, B. longum, B. lactis, L. reuteri, and L. rhamnosus (ATCC 53103). With regard to MICs, bLf showed at least four-fold lower inhibitory effect on probiotics than on pathogens. Intriguingly, bLf (>0.25 mg/mL) significantly enhanced the growth of Rhamnosus (ATCC 7469) and L. acidophilus (BCRC 14065) by approximately 40-200 %, during their late periods of growth. Supernatants produced from aerobic but not anaerobic cultures of L. acidophilus reduced the growth of Escherichia coli by about 20 %. Thus, bLf displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the growth of most probiotic strains under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. An antibacterial supernatant prepared from the aerobic cultures may have significant practical use.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the mucin-adhesion ability and probiotic potential of Lactobacillus mucosae LM1.
AB  - AIMS: In this report, we characterized the probiotic potential of Lactobacillus mucosae LM1, focusing on its in vitro mucin-adhesion abilities. METHODS AND RESULTS: Screening assays were used to evaluate LM1. Previous studies on Lact. mucosae species have been performed, but few have examined the ability of this species to adhere to and colonize the intestinal mucosa. Thus, adhesion, aggregation and pathogen inhibition assays of LM1 along with microbial adhesion to solvents (MATS) assay were carried out in comparison with another putative probiotic, Lactobacillus johnsonii PF01, and the commercial strain, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. Based on MATS assay, the cell surfaces of the lactobacilli strains were found to be hydrophobic and highly electron-donating, but the average hydropathy (GRAVY) index of predicted surface-exposed proteins in the LM1 genome indicated that most were hydrophilic. LM1 showed the highest adhesion, aggregation and hydrophobicity among the strains tested and significantly inhibited the adhesion of Escherichia coli K88 and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium KCCM 40253. Correlations among adhesion, aggregation and hydrophobicity, as well as between coaggregation and displacement of E. coli, were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Increased adhesion may not always correlate with increased pathogen inhibition due to various strain-specific mechanisms. Nevertheless, LM1 has promising probiotic properties that can be explored further using a genomics approach. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our data on adhesion of LM1 strain showed a significant correlation between adhesion, hydrophobicity of cell surface and autoaggregation. This study gives basic knowledge for the elucidation of the adhesion mechanism of Lactobacillus sp. and prediction of its adherence in specific host models.
TI  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus and its cell-free culture supernatant differentially modulate inflammatory biomarkers in Escherichia coli-challenged human dendritic cells.
AB  - The intestinal immune system maintains a delicate balance between immunogenicity  against invading pathogens and tolerance to the commensal microbiota and food antigens. Different strains of probiotics possess the ability to finely regulate the activation of dendritic cells (DC), polarising the subsequent activity of T-cells. Nevertheless, information about their underlying mechanisms of action is scarce. In the present study, we investigated the immunomodulatory effects of a potentially probiotic strain, Lactobacillus rhamnosus CNCM I-4036, and its cell-free culture supernatant (CFS) on human DC challenged with Escherichia coli. The results showed that the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-12p70 were higher in the cells treated with live L. rhamnosus than in the cells treated with the CFS. In the presence of E. coli, the supernatant was more effective than the probiotic bacteria in reducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, live L. rhamnosus potently induced the production of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 and TGF-beta2, whereas the CFS increased the secretion of TGF-beta1. However, in the presence of E. coli, both treatments restored the levels of TGF-beta. The probiotic strain L. rhamnosus CNCM I-4036 and its CFS were able to activate the Toll-like receptor signalling pathway, enhancing innate immunity. The two treatments induced gene transcription of TLR-9. Live L. rhamnosus activated the expression of TLR-2 and TLR-4 genes, whereas the CFS increased the expression of TLR-1 and TLR-5 genes. In response to the stimulation with probiotic/CFS and E. coli, the expression of each gene tested was notably increased, with the exception of TNF-alpha and NFKBIA. In conclusion, the CFS exhibited an extraordinary ability to suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by DC, and may be used as an effective and safer alternative to live bacteria.
TI  - Molecular Cloning, Expression of minD Gene from Lactobacillus acidophilus VTCC-B-871 and Analyses to Identify Lactobacillus rhamnosus PN04 from Vietnam Hottuynia cordata Thunb.
AB  - The minD gene encoding an inhibitor cell division MinD homolog from Lactobacillus acidophilus VTCC-B-871 was cloned. We showed that there were 97 % homology between minD genes of L. acidophilus VTCC-B-871 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lc705. Based on the analysis of the DNA sequence data from the L. rhamnosus genome project and sequenced minD gene of L. acidophilus VTCC-B-871, a pair of primers was designed to identified the different minD genes from L. acidophilus ATCC 4356, L. rhamnosus ATCC 11443. Besides, the polymerase chain reaction product of minD gene was also obtained in L. rhamnosus PN04, a strain was isolated from Vietnamese Hottuynia cordata Thunb. In addition, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of MinD homologs from L. acidophilus VTCC-B-871 with the other strains and compared the predicted three-dimension structure of L. acidophilus VTCC-B-871 MinD with Escherichia coli MinD, there are similarity that showed evolution of these strains. The overexpression of L. acidophilus VTCC-B-871 MinD in E. coli led to cell filamentation in IPTG and morphology changes in different sugar stresses, interestingly. The present study is the first report characterizing the Lactobacilus MinD homolog that will be useful in probiotic field.
TI  - Lactobacillus strains isolated from infant faeces possess potent inhibitory activity against intestinal alpha- and beta-glucosidases suggesting anti-diabetic potential.
AB  - PURPOSE: Inhibitors of intestinal alpha-glucosidases are used therapeutically to  treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. Bacteria such as Actinoplanes sp. naturally produce potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitor compounds, including the most widely available drug acarbose. It is not known whether lactic acid bacteria (LAB) colonising the human gut possess inhibitory potential against glucosidases. Hence, the study was undertaken to screen LABs having inherent alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory potential. METHODS: This study isolated, screened, identified and extracted Lactobacillus strains (Lb1-15) from human infant faecal samples determining their inhibitory activity against intestinal maltase, sucrase, lactase and amylase. Lactobacillus reference strains (Ref1-7), a Gram positive control (Ctrl1) and two Gram negative controls (Ctrl2-3), were also analysed to compare activity. RESULTS: Faecal isolates were identified by DNA sequencing, with the majority identified as unique strains of Lactobacillus plantarum. Some strains (L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. casei and L. rhamnosus) had potent and broad spectrum inhibitory activities (up to 89%; p < 0.001; 500 mg/ml wet weight) comparable to acarbose (up to 88%; p < 0.001; 30 mg/ml). Inhibitory activity was concentration-dependent and was freely available in the supernatant, and was not present in other bacterial genera (Bifidobacterium bifidum and Escherichia coli or Salmonella typhimurium). Interestingly, the potency and spectrum of inhibitory activity across strains of a single species (L. plantarum) differed substantially. Some Lactobacillus extracts had broader spectrum activities than acarbose, effectively inhibiting beta-glucosidase activity (lactase) as well as alpha-glucosidase activities (maltase, sucrase and amylase). Anti-diabetic potential was indicated by the fact that oral gavage with a L. rhamnosus extract (1 g/kg) was able to reduce glucose excursions (Area under curve; 22%; p < 0.05) in rats during a carbohydrate challenge (starch; 2 g/kg). CONCLUSION: These results definitively demonstrate that Lactobacillus strains present in the human gut have alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory activities and can reduce blood glucose responses in vivo. Although the potential use of LAB such as Lactobacillus as a dietary supplement, medicinal food or biotherapeutic for diabetes is uncertain, such an approach might offer advantages over drug therapies in terms of broader spectrum activities and fewer unpleasant side effects. Further characterisation of this bioactivity is warranted, and chronic studies should be undertaken in appropriate animal models or diabetic subjects.
TI  - Effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  - Bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. Cell-free supernatants (CFS) were prepared from growth of Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 13525, Escherichia coli 08, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Bacillus subtilis 168, Bacillus coagulans 185A, B. coagulans 7050, Clostridium sporogenes PA3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. The inhibitory effects of CFS on the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and Tulane virus in RAW 264.7 and LLCMK2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of CFS or after exposure of host cells to CFS. Slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and Tulane virus in the continuous presence of CFS of B. subtilis 168 and E. faecalis 19433, respectively. CFS cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. Virus persisted in the CFS that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of CFS on virions. The viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.
TI  - Dose-dependent effects of Lactobacillus rhamnosus on serum interleukin-17 production and intestinal T-cell responses in pigs challenged with Escherichia coli.
AB  - The mechanism underlying the dose effect of probiotics on ameliorating diarrhea has not been fully elucidated. Here, low (1 x 10(9) CFU/ml) or high (1 x 10(11) CFU/ml) doses of Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 7469 were administered orally to piglets for 1 week before F4 (K88)-positive enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (F4(+) ETEC) challenge. Administration of a low, but not a high, dose of L. rhamnosus decreased the percentage of CD3(+) CD4(+) CD8(-) T cells in the peripheral blood. Notably, transiently increased serum concentrations of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) were observed after F4(+) ETEC challenge in pigs pretreated with a high dose of L. rhamnosus. Administration of L. rhamnosus increased the percentage of the small intestinal lamina propria CD3(+) CD4(+) CD8(-) cells and Peyer's patch CD3(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) and CD3(-) CD4(-) CD8(+) cells. The percentage of ileal intraepithelial CD3(+) CD4(-) CD8(+) cells increased only in the high-dose piglets. Administration of L. rhamnosus downregulated expression of ileal IL-17A after F4(+) ETEC challenge but had no effect on expression of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), IL-12, IL-4, and FOXP3 mRNA in the small intestine. Expression of jejunal IL-2, ileal transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), and ileal IL-10 was upregulated in the low-dose piglets after F4(+) ETEC challenge. Our findings suggest that amelioration of infectious diarrhea in piglets by L. rhamnosus is associated with the generation of lamina propria CD3(+) CD4(+) CD8(-) T cells, the expansion of Peyer's patch CD3(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) and CD3(-) CD4(-) CD8(+) cells, and the attenuation of F4(+) ETEC-induced increase in CD3(+) CD4(+) CD8(+) T cells in the small intestine. However, consumption of high doses of L. rhamnosus may increase levels of serum IL-17A after F4(+) ETEC challenge, thus eliciting a strong proinflammatory response.
TI  - Tailoring the probiotic potential of non-starter Lactobacillus strains from ripened Parmigiano Reggiano cheese by in vitro screening and principal component analysis.
AB  - Non-starter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB) inhabiting fermented food have been recently revised as source of probiotic strains. Here, we in vitro assessed the potential probiotic aptitude of a de-replicated set of NSLAB previously isolated from long ripened Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses (22 Lactobacillus rhamnosus, 18 Lactobacillus paracasei, 3 Lactobacillus casei, 2 Lactobacillus harbinensis, and 2 Lactobacillus fermentum). Most strains showed moderate to good resistance to biological barriers, including bile salts, lysozyme, and simulated gastric and pancreatic juices. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests against seven antimicrobials belonging to different categories showed that most strains are susceptible towards all the antibiotics, with the exception of vancomycin and streptomycin. The strains lost the streptomycin resistance when assayed on agar medium containing 0.5% bile salts, suggesting that detergent-like properties of cholic acids increase membrane permeability and mediate streptomycin susceptibility. No isolate showed bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activities, supporting that bile salts resistance and BSH activity are unpaired traits. Finally, NSLAB strains had moderate to high auto-aggregative and hydrophobic phenotypes, whereas two subsets of 22 and 8 strains co-aggregated with Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica s. typhimurium, respectively. A multivariate analysis was effective to segregate one L. casei and two L. rhamnosus strains showing physiological characteristics compatible with probiotic properties.
TI  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus protects human colonic muscle from pathogen lipopolysaccharide-induced damage.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus species might positively affect gastrointestinal motility. These Gram-positive bacteria bind Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) that elicits anti-inflammatory activity and exerts protective effects on damage induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Whether such effect occurs in gastrointestinal smooth muscle has not been established yet. Aim of this study was to characterize the effects of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and of supernatants harvested from LGG cultures on human colonic smooth muscle and to explore their protective activity against LPS-induced myogenic morpho-functional alterations. METHODS: The effects of LGG (ATCC 53103 strain) and of supernatants have been tested on both human colonic smooth muscle strips and isolated cells in the absence or presence of LPS obtained from a pathogenic strain of Escherichia coli. Their effects on myogenic morpho-functional properties, on LPS-induced NFkappaB activation, and on cytokine production have been evaluated. Toll-like receptor 2 expression has been analyzed by qPCR and flow cytometry. KEY RESULTS: Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG exerted negligible transient effects per se whereas it was capable of activating an intrinsic myogenic response counteracting LPS-induced alterations. In particular, both LGG and supernatants significantly reduced the LPS-induced morpho-functional alterations of muscle cells, i.e. cell shortening and inhibition of contractile response. They also hindered LPS-induced pro-inflammatory effects by decreasing pro-inflammatory transcription factor NFkappaB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 secretion, and restored the secretion levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Taken together these data demonstrate that LGG protects human colonic smooth muscle from LPS-induced myogenic damage and might be beneficial on intestinal motor disorders due to bacterial infection.
TI  - Lactobacillus reuteri and Escherichia coli in the human gut microbiota may predict weight gain associated with vancomycin treatment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotics, used for 60 years to promote weight gain in animals, have been linked to obesity in adults and in children when administered during early infancy. Lactobacillus reuteri has been linked to obesity and weight gain in children affected with Kwashiorkor using ready-to-use therapeutic food. In contrast, Escherichia coli has been linked with the absence of obesity. Both of these bacteria are resistant to vancomycin. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: We assessed vancomycin-associated weight and gut microbiota changes, and tested whether bacterial species previously linked with body mass index (BMI) predict weight gain at 1 year. All endocarditis patients treated with vancomycin or amoxicillin in our center were included from January 2008 to December 2010. Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Lactobacillus and Methanobrevibacter smithii were quantified using real-time PCR on samples obtained during the 4-6 weeks antibiotic regimen. L. reuteri, L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium animalis and E. coli were quantified on stool samples obtained during the first week of antibiotics. RESULTS: Of the193 patients included in the study, 102 were treated with vancomycin and 91 with amoxicillin. Vancomycin was associated with a 10% BMI increase (odds ratio (OR) 14.1; 95% confidence interval (CI; 1.03-194); P=0.047) and acquired obesity (4/41 versus 0/56, P=0.01). In patients treated with vancomycin, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Lactobacillus increased, whereas M. smithii decreased (P<0.05). The absence of E. coli was an independent predictor of weight gain (OR=10.7; 95% CI (1.4-82.0); P=0.02). Strikingly, a patient with an 18% BMI increase showed a dramatic increase of L. reuteri but no increase of E. coli. CONCLUSION: The acquired obesity observed in patients treated with vancomycin may be related to a modulation of the gut microbiota rather than a direct antibiotic effect. L. reuteri, which is resistant to vancomycin and produces broad bacteriocins, may have an instrumental role in this effect.
TI  - Utilization of major fucosylated and sialylated human milk oligosaccharides by isolated human gut microbes.
AB  - Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOS) are not digested in the proximal intestine. In distal intestine, HMOS collectively modify the microbiota, but the response of individual bacteria to individual components of the HMOS is not well defined. Here, each of 25 major isolates of the human intestinal microbiota was fed individual major fucosylated and sialylated HMOS in anaerobic culture. This allowed for an assessment of the influence of specific HMOS on the growth and metabolic products of individual microbiota bacteria. Most Bifidobacteria spp. and Bacteroides spp. grew, induced alpha-L-fucosidase activity, and produced abundant lactate or short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) when fed 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL), 3-FL, and lactodifucotetraose (LDFT). Lactobacillus delbrueckii ATCC7830, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC19433, and Streptococcus thermophilus ATCC19258 exhibited slight growth, pH reduction, and lactate production when supplemented with 2'-FL or 3-FL, but not LDFT. Supplementation with 3'-sialyllactose (3'-SL) and 6'-SL promoted moderate growth of Bifidobacterium longum JCM7007, 7009, 7010, 7011, 1272, 11347, ATCC15708, Bacteroides vulgatus ATCC8482, and B. thetaiotaomicron ATCC29148; accordingly, these bacteria exhibited greater neuraminidase activity and produced copious lactate, SCFA, or both. Lactobacillus delbrueckii ATCC7830 also consumed 6'-SL. In contrast, Clostridium spp., L. rhamnosus ATCC53103, E. faecalis ATCC29200, Staphylococcus spp., Enterobacter spp., and Escherichia coli K12 did not consume milk oligosaccharides nor produce appreciable acidic fermentation products. Specific Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides differentially digest specific individual HMOS, with the major fucosylated milk oligosaccharides most strongly stimulating key species of mutualist symbionts. This suggests strategies for treating dysbiosis of the microbiota and associated inflammatory disorders.
TI  - Adhesive ability means inhibition activities for lactobacillus against pathogens  and S-layer protein plays an important role in adhesion.
AB  - Eighty-five strains of lactobacillus were isolated from the pig intestine and identified by sequencing analysis based on 16S rRNA gene, from which five lactobacillus strains with high adhesive ability were selected. The inhibition ability of the five lactobacillus strains with or without S-layer proteins against adherence of Escherichia coli K88 and Salmonella enteritidis 50335 to Caco-2 was evaluated in vitro with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG strain (LGG) as a positive control. In addition, tolerance of lactobacilli to heat, acid, bile, Zn(2+) and Cu(2+) were assessed. All five selected strains, Lactobacillus salivarius ZJ614 (JN981856), Lactobacillus reuteri ZJ616 (JN981858), L. reuteri ZJ617 (JN981859), L. reuteri ZJ621 (JN981863) and L. reuteri ZJ623 (JN981865), showed inhibition against the two pathogens, E. coli K88 and S. enteritidis 50335. L. reuteri ZJ621 showed higher inhibition ability than the others to S. enteritidis 50335 (P < 0.05). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis indicated that all five strains had abundant bands with molecular weight ranging from 34 to 130 KDa as well as had a common band of approximately 42 KDa. After treatment with 5 M LiCl to remove S-layer protein, the inhibition activities of the lactobacilli against pathogens decreased significantly (P < 0.05). The results showed that higher adhesive ability means higher inhibition activity for lactobacillus against pathogen, in which S-layer proteins plays an important role.
TI  - Strain-specific probiotics properties of Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus brevis isolates from Brazilian food products.
AB  - A total of 234 LAB isolates from Brazilian food products were initially screened  for their ability to survive at pH 2.0. Fifty one of the isolates survived and were selected. They were characterized by phenotypic methods, rep-PCR and identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing as Lactobacillus fermentum (34 isolates), Lactobacillus plantarum (10) and Lactobacillus brevis (7). Based on being either highly tolerant to bile, showing an ability for auto-aggregation and/or hydrophobic properties, one L. fermentum (CH58), three L. plantarum (CH3, CH41 and SAU96) and two L. brevis (SAU105 and FFC199) were selected. The highest co-aggregation ability with Escherichia coli was observed to L. plantarum CH41. L. brevis SAU105 and FFC199 and L. fermentum CH58 exhibited antagonistic activity towards the pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. L. plantarum CH3 and CH41 and L. brevis FFC199 showed adhesion ability to Caco-2 cells (1.6, 1.1 and 0.9%, respectively) similar to the commercial probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (1.5%). They were able to increase the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of Caco-2 cells over 24 h (p < 0.05). The present work showed that the probiotic characteristics were strain-specific and that the isolates L. plantarum CH3 and CH41 (cocoa) and L. brevis FFC199 (cauim) exhibited potential probiotics properties.
TI  - Identification and characterization of toxin-antitoxin systems in strains of Lactobacillus rhamnosus isolated from humans.
AB  - The toxin-antitoxin gene systems (TASs) are present in the genomes of the overwhelming majority of bacteria and archaea. These systems are involved in various cellular regulatory processes (including stress response), and have not been previously investigated in Lactobacilli. We identified 6 putative TASs with toxins belonging to the MazE and RelE superfamilies (PemK1-capital A, Cyrillic1Lrh, PemK2-capital A, Cyrillic2Lrh, PemK3-RelB2Lrh, RelE1Lrh, RelB3-RelE3Lrh, and YefM-YoeBLrh) in the genomes of annotated strains of Lactobacillus rhamnosus. PCR analyses revealed that all systems were found in the genomes of 15 strains of L. rhamnosus isolated from humans in central Russia. These strains were highly heterogeneous with respect to the presence of TASs, as well as their nucleotide and amino acid sequences. In three cases, the relE1 genes contained IS3 elements. TAS heterogeneity may be used to reveal inter-genus differences between strains. Cloning of the toxin genes of 3 TASs inhibited Escherichia coli growth, thus confirming their functionality. Cell growth arrest caused by expression of the toxin genes could be reverted by the expression of a cognate antitoxins. Transcription of toxin-antitoxin loci in L. rhamnosus was shown by RT-PCR.
TI  - The expression of adhesin EF-Tu in response to mucin and its role in Lactobacillus adhesion and competitive inhibition of enteropathogens to mucin.
AB  - AIMS: To analyse the expression of EF-Tu in Lactobacillus strains with response to mucin exposure and its role in interfering with adhesion of enteropathogens to mucin. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Lactobacillus strains were analysed for their ability to adhere to immobilized mucin in microtiter plates. Lactobacillus delbrueckii M and Lactobacillus plantarum CS24.2 showed statistically significant adhesion to mucin, which was similar to Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, the best binding probiotic strain. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lact. delbrueckii M, Lact. plantarum CS23 and Lact. plantarum CS24.2 were able to effectively antagonize the adhesion of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi to mucin. In the presence of Lactobacillus adhesin - EF-Tu, the adhesion of Lact. delbrueckii M and the strains of Lact. plantarum to mucin was significantly inhibited. Similarly, EF-Tu also reduced the adhesion of enteropathogens to mucin. Furthermore, the relative fold change in gene expression analysis showed significant up-regulation of EF-Tu gene in the strains of Lact. plantarum and Lact. delbrueckii M when exposed to mucin for 3 h. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows the significant role of EF-Tu in lactobacilli adhesion and enteropathogens inhibition. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study suggests EF-Tu as an important factor linked to the Lactobacillus adhesion as well as enteropathogen inhibition. Lactobacillus plantarum CS23 and Lact. plantarum CS24.2 can be used as potential probiotic strains.
TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum CS24.2 prevents Escherichia coli adhesion to HT-29 cells  and also down-regulates enteropathogen-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-8 expression.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential of Lactobacillus plantarum CS24.2 to antagonize Escherichia coli adhesion and modulate expression of the responses by HT-29 cells of inflammatory molecules to E. coli adhesion. Experiments were performed under different adhesion conditions and findings compared with the responses of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. Tests of competitive adhesion, adhesion inhibition and displacement assays were performed for lactobacilli (L. rhamnosus GG and L. plantarum CS24.2) and E. coli O26:H11 to HT-29 cells. Both the lactobacilli significantly reduced E. coli adhesion to HT-29 cells (P < 0.05). The ability of lactobacilli to modulate tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-8 expression was analyzed in HT-29 cells stimulated with E. coli using qRT-PCR. L. plantarum CS24.2 significantly down regulated expression of both the genes induced by E. coli in HT-29 cells at 6 hr as well as 24 hr, which was more significant than the corresponding findings for L. rhamnosus GG. The present findings suggest that L. plantarum CS24.2 inhibits pathogen adhesion to a similar extent as does the established probiotic strain L. rhamnosus GG. It may also attenuate tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-8 expression in HT-29 cells stimulated with E. coli.
TI  - The effect of American cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) constituents on the growth inhibition, membrane integrity, and injury of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes in comparison to Lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  - The antimicrobial properties of the American cranberry were studied against Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus to determine the effects on growth inhibition, membrane permeability, and injury. Cranberry powder was separated using a C-18 Sep-Pak cartridge into sugars plus organic acids (F1), monomeric phenolics (F2), and anthocyanins plus proanthocyanidins (F3). Fraction 3 was further separated into anthocyanins (F4) and proanthocyanidins (F5) using an LH-20 Sephadex column. Each fraction was diluted in the brain heart infusion (BHI) broth to determine the minimum inhibitory/bactericidal concentrations (MIC/MBC). L. monocytogenes was the most susceptible to cranberry fraction treatment with the lowest MIC/MBC for each treatment, followed by E. coli O157:H7 and L. rhamnosus. Membrane permeability and potential was studied using LIVE/DEAD viability assay and using Bis (1, 3-dibutylbarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol (DiBAC4), respectively. L. rhamnosus demonstrated the highest permeability followed by E. coli O157:H7, and L. monocytogenes. L. rhamnosus demonstrated the highest recovery followed by E. coli O157:H7, and L. monocytogenes. Each cranberry fraction demonstrated membrane hyperpolarization at their native pH, while F2, F3, and F5 demonstrated membrane depolarization at neutral pH. With this knowledge cranberry compounds may be used to prevent maladies and potentially substitute for synthetic preservatives and antibiotics.
TI  - Study of probiotic potential of four wild Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains.
AB  - The four wild Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains were examined in vitro for resistance to simulated gastro and intestinal juices, adhesion to HT-29 cells, antagonistic activity against enteric pathogens and immunomodulating activity. The strains L. rhamnosus SB5L, J5L and IN1L were able to survive in simulated gastro juice while the strain L. rhamnosus SB31L lost viability exposed to simulated gastro juice for 3 h. The four strains had high viability in simulated small intestinal juice with little loss (<1.0 cycle reduction). The strains SB5L, J5L and IN1L antagonized against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028, Shigella sonnei ATCC 25931. The strain L. rhamnosus IN1L had the highest adhesive capability to HT-29 cells in vitro (251 bacteria cells per 100 HT-29 cells) compared to the other three L. rhamnosus strains. The live bacteria, cell wall and DNA of the four L. rhamnosus induced the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12 (p70), IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The levels of IL-12 (p70), IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha produced by stimulated PBMCs were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of the control. Those data indicated that the four L. rhamnosus strains have the potential as the probiotic for human being use, although further studies are still needed.
TI  - Immune signalling responses in intestinal epithelial cells exposed to pathogenic  Escherichia coli and lactic acid-producing probiotics.
AB  - Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 and adherent-invasive Escherichia coli are two groups of enteric bacterial pathogens associated with haemorrhagic colitis and Crohn's Disease, respectively. Bacterial contact with host epithelial cells stimulates an immediate innate immune response designed to combat infection. In this study, immune responses of human epithelial cells to pathogens, either alone or in combination with probiotic bacteria were studied. Industrially prepared Lactobacillus helveticus strain R0052 was first examined by microarray analysis and then compared to broth-grown strains of R0052 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG using quantitative realt-time polymerase chain reaction. Results showed host immune activation responses increased following pathogen exposure, which were differentially ameliorated using probiotics depending on both the preparation of probiotics employed and conditions of exposure. These findings provide additional support for the concept that specific probiotic strains serve as a promising option for use in preventing the risk of enteric bacterial infections.
TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum CS24.2 prevents E. coli adhesion to HT-29 cells and also  down-regulates enteropathogen induced TNF-alpha and IL-8 expression.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential of Lactobacillus plantarum CS24.2 to antagonize Escherichia coli adhesion and modulate the expression of inflammatory molecules by HT-29 cells response to the E. coli adhesion. This was carried out under different adhesion conditions and compared with the response seen in case of L. rhamnosus GG. The competitive adhesion, adhesion inhibition and displacement assays were carried out for adhesion of lactobacilli (L. rhamnosus GG and L. plantarum CS24.2) and E. coli O26:H11 to HT-29 cells. Both the lactobacilli significantly reduced E. coli adhesion to HT-29 cells (p < 0.05). The ability of lactobacilli to modulate TNF-alpha and IL-8 expression was analyzed in HT-29 cells stimulated with E. coli using qRT-PCR. L. plantarum CS24.2 significantly down regulated the expression of both the genes induced by E. coli in HT-29 cells at 6 h as well as 24 h which was more significant then that of L. rhamnosus GG. The results suggest that L. plantarum CS24.2 has the ability to effectively inhibit pathogen adhesion which was comparable with an established probiotic strain L. rhamnosus GG. It could also attenuate TNF-alpha and IL-8 expression in HT-29 cells stimulated with E. coli.
TI  - Competitive inhibition of three novel bacteria isolated from faeces of breast milk-fed infants against selected enteropathogens.
AB  - Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies conducted using different probiotic micro-organisms have demonstrated their ability to interfere with the growth and virulence of a variety of enteropathogens. The reported beneficial effects of the use of probiotics to complement antibiotic therapy or prevent diarrhoea or gastrointestinal infection in infants have increased in recent years. In the present study, we demonstrated the capacity of supernatants obtained from three novel probiotics (Lactobacillus paracasei CNCM I-4034, Bifidobacterium breve CNCM I-4035 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus CNCM I-4036) isolated from the faeces of breastfed infants to inhibit the growth of enterotoxigenic and enteropathogenic (EPEC) bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Shigella. To assess their potential antimicrobial activity, the 17 and 24 h cell-free supernatants broth concentrates (10x) having 1, 2 or 4 % of the three probiotics were incubated with EPEC bacteria strains. After 17 h of co-culture, the supernatants were able to inhibit the growth of E. coli, Salmonella and Shigella up to 40, 55 and 81 %, respectively. However, the inhibitory capacity of some supernatants was maintained or completely lost when the supernatants (pH 3.0) were neutralised (pH 6.5). Overall, these results demonstrated that L. paracasei CNCM I-4034, B. breve CNCM I-4035 and L. rhamnosus CNCM I-4036 produce compounds that exhibited strain-specific inhibition of enterobacteria and have the potential to be used as probiotics in functional foods.
TI  - Preventive effects of Lactobacillus mixture on experimental E. coli urinary tract infection in infant rats.
AB  - PURPOSE: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is an ascending infection of fecal uropathogens, urogenital lactobacilli are suggested to play a role in the prevention of UTI. This study was to investigate whether lactobacillus mixture (LM) could prevent the experimental infantile UTI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The LM were composed of three lactobacillus strains (L. gasseri, L. rhamnosus, and L. reuteri). Mother rats were grouped as lactobacillus (LB) group I (LB I, n=22), II (LB II, n=24) and control (n=20). LB I and LB II were fed with LM (1 mL/day) and control with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) from late pregnancy through lactation. All newborn rats were breast-fed and their urine and stool were collected at the end of the 3rd week to compare lactobacillus colony. Then, infant rats from LB II were treated with intravesical instillation of LM. Infant rats from LB I and control were instilled with PBS. Twenty-four hours later, experimental UTI was introduced by intravesical instillation of standard E. coli strain. After 72 hours later, the infant rats were sacrificed for histologic examination. RESULTS: Lactobacilli colonies in urine and stool were not statistically different among the three groups. The incidence of pyelonephritis in the LB II was 16.7% (4/24), LB I 72.7% (16.22) and control 75.0% (15/20) (p=0.015). The incidence of cystitis was not significantly different among the three groups. CONCLUSION: The intravesically instilled LM significantly prevented experimental pyelonephritis in infant rats, however, LM administered orally to the pregnant and lactating mother rats did not.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (bLf), but the results are inconsistent. Moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-bLf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield bLf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-bLf. However, whether bLf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. Therefore, various probiotic strains in Taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate in vitro. Thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, Lactobacillus salivarius ATCC 11741, Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103, Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707, and Bifidobacterium lactis BCRC 17394 were inhibited by both apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate. The growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate, including L. rhamnosus ATCC 7469, Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 23272, Lactobacillus fermentum ATCC 11739, Lactobacillus coryniformis ATCC 25602, L. acidophilus BCRC 14065, Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC 15697, Bifidobacterium bifidum ATCC 29521, and Pediococcus acidilactici ATCC 8081. However, apo-bLf and its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Moreover, the supernatants produced by L. fermentum, B. lactis, and B. longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. Importantly, a combination of apo-bLf or bLf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. In conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-bLf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.
TI  - In vitro characterization of aggregation and adhesion properties of viable and heat-killed forms of two probiotic Lactobacillus strains and interaction with foodborne zoonotic bacteria, especially Campylobacter jejuni.
AB  - Bacterial aggregation and/or adhesion are key factors for colonization of the digestive ecosystem and the ability of probiotic strains to exclude pathogens. In the present study, two probiotic strains, Lactobacillus rhamnosus CNCM-I-3698 and Lactobacillus farciminis CNCM-I-3699, were evaluated as viable or heat-killed forms and compared with probiotic reference Lactobacillus strains (Lb. rhamnosus GG and Lb. farciminis CIP 103136). The autoaggregation potential of both forms was higher than that of reference strains and twice that of pathogenic strains. The coaggregation potential of these two beneficial micro-organisms was evaluated against several pathogenic agents that threaten the global safety of the feed/food chain: Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp. and Listeria monocytogenes. The strongest coaggregative interactions were demonstrated with Campylobacter spp. by a coaggregation test, confirmed by electron microscopic examination for the two forms. Viable forms were investigated for the nature of the bacterial cell-surface molecules involved, by sugar reversal tests and chemical and enzymic pretreatments. The results suggest that the coaggregation between both probiotic strains and C. jejuni CIP 70.2(T) is mediated by a carbohydrate-lectin interaction. The autoaggregation potential of the two probiotics decreased upon exposure to proteinase, SDS or LiCl, showing that proteinaceous components on the surface of the two lactobacilli play an important role in this interaction. Adhesion abilities of both Lactobacillus strains were also demonstrated at significant levels on Caco-2 cells, mucin and extracellular matrix material. Both viable and heat-killed forms of the two probiotic lactobacilli inhibited the attachment of C. jejuni CIP 70.2(T) to mucin. In conclusion, in vitro assays showed that Lb. rhamnosus CNCM-I-3698 and Lb. farciminis CNCM-I-3699, as viable or heat-killed forms, are adherent to different intestinal matrix models and are highly aggregative in vitro with pathogens, especially Campylobacter spp., the most commonly reported zoonotic agent in the European Union. This study supports the need for further in vivo investigations to demonstrate the potential food safety benefits of Lb. rhamnosus CNCM-I-3698 and Lb. farciminis CNCM-I-3699, live or heat-killed, in the global feed/food chain.
TI  - Selection of potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria from fermented olives by in vitro tests.
AB  - The present study aims to evaluate the probiotic potential of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from naturally fermented olives and select candidates to be used as probiotic starters for the improvement of the traditional fermentation process and the production of newly added value functional foods. Seventy one (71) lactic acid bacterial strains (17 Leuconostoc mesenteroides, 1 Ln. pseudomesenteroides, 13 Lactobacillus plantarum, 37 Lb. pentosus, 1 Lb. paraplantarum, and 2 Lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei) isolated from table olives were screened for their probiotic potential. Lb. rhamnosus GG and Lb. casei Shirota were used as reference strains. The in vitro tests included survival in simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions, antimicrobial activity (against Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Enteritidis, Escherichia coli O157:H7), Caco-2 surface adhesion, resistance to 9 antibiotics and haemolytic activity. Three (3) Lb. pentosus, 4 Lb. plantarum and 2 Lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei strains demonstrated the highest final population (>8 log cfu/ml) after 3 h of exposure at low pH. The majority of the tested strains were resistant to bile salts even after 4 h of exposure, while 5 Lb. plantarum and 7 Lb. pentosus strains exhibited partial bile salt hydrolase activity. None of the strains inhibited the growth of the pathogens tested. Variable efficiency to adhere to Caco-2 cells was observed. This was the same regarding strains' susceptibility towards different antibiotics. None of the strains exhibited beta-haemolytic activity. As a whole, 4 strains of Lb. pentosus, 3 strains of Lb. plantarum and 2 strains of Lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei were found to possess desirable in vitro probiotic properties similar to or even better than the reference probiotic strains Lb. casei Shirota and Lb. rhamnosus GG. These strains are good candidates for further investigation both with in vivo studies to elucidate their potential health benefits and in olive fermentation processes to assess their technological performance as novel probiotic starters.
TI  - Inhibition of Fe-induced colon oxidative stress by lactobacilli in mice.
AB  - Iron (Fe) can promote hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and hydroxyl radical generation in the colonic surface and promote growth of Fe-dependent bacteria. Some Lactobacillus strains are resistant to oxygen free-radicals, allowing them to survive in a Fe-modulated mucosal environment and influence colon microbial ecology and redox state. Here, we investigated the capacity of lactobacilli with different antioxidant abilities to modify the bacterial profile and prevent oxidative stress in the colon of Fe-overloaded mice. Survival time of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LGG (LGG) in the presence of H(2)O(2) and hydroxyl radical was significantly longer compared with the mid- and non-antioxidative strains, Lactobacillus paracasei Fn032 and Lactobacillus plantarum Fn001, respectively. Different Lactobacillus strains are specific in free-radical scavenging activities of their cell-free extracts, which increased to varying extent depending on strains when bacteria were exposed to simulated gastric and pancreatic juice. Fe-overloaded mice showed increased colonic luminal ferrous Fe content, Enterococcus and Escherichia coli concentrations, mucosal malondialdehyde and free-radicals, and decreased mucosal total antioxidative capacity and oxidative enzymatic activity. Translocation of endotoxin to the liver was also significantly increased (P < 0.05). Lactobacilli inhibited ferrous Fe accumulation, especially in LGG and Fn032. LGG significantly inhibited the increase of colonic mucosal free-radicals and malondialdehyde content (P < 0.05). Fn032 only inhibited malondialdehyde (P < 0.05). LGG and Fn032 significantly inhibited increases in colonic Enterococcus (P < 0.05). Fn001 showed no significant antioxidative ability in vivo. The difference of these effects in vivo were well agreed with scavenging activities against reactive oxygen species (ROS) of simulated gastrointestinals fluid pretreated cells in vitro. In conclusion, ROS scavenging activities was essential for Lactobacillus to prevent oxidative stress in vivo and inhibition of ROS-producing bacterial growth and mucosal barrier injury.
TI  - Assessment of the in vitro inhibitory activity of specific probiotic bacteria against different Escherichia coli strains.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are often associated with health-promoting effects. These live microorganisms, defined as probiotics, are commonly consumed as part of fermented foods, such as yoghurt and fermented milks, or as dietary supplements. Escherichia coli is a gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms. As a part of the normal gut microbiota, this microorganism colonizes the gastrointestinal tract of animals and humans within a few hours after birth. All E. coli strains can produce a wide variety of biogenic amines responsible for potentially harmful systemic intoxications. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli serotype O157:H7 is a pathotype of diarrhoeagenic strains with a large virulence plasmid pO157 able to produce 1 or more Shiga toxins. METHODS: The overall aim of this study was to determine the inhibitory effects of different strains of probiotics on E. coli serotypes, including E. coli O157:H7 (CQ9485). In particular, the antagonistic activity of 4 Bifidobacterium strains (Probiotical SpA, Italy) and 16 lactic acid bacteria, more specifically 14 Lactobacillus spp. and 2 Streptococcus spp., was assessed against selected E. coli biotypes (ATCC 8739, ATCC 10536, ATCC 35218, and ATCC 25922). The diarrhoeagenic serotype O157:H7 was also tested. RESULTS: The experimental data collected demonstrated an in vitro significant inhibitory effect of 6 Lactobacillus strains, namely L. rhamnosus LR04, L. rhamnosus LR06, L. plantarum LP01, L. plantarum LP02, L. pentosus LPS01, and L. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii LDD01, and 2 Bifidobacterium strains, B. breve BR03 and B. breve B632. The inhibiting extent was slightly different among these strains, with L. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii LDD01 showing the highest activity on E. coli O157:H7. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the probiotics studied are able to antagonize the growth of the 5 strains of E. coli tested, including the O157:H7 biotype, well known for their characteristic to produce a wide variety of biogenic amines considered responsible for dangerous systemic intoxications.
TI  - The innovative potential of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LR06, Lactobacillus pentosus  LPS01, Lactobacillus plantarum LP01, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii Subsp. delbrueckii LDD01 to restore the "gastric barrier effect" in patients chronically treated with PPI: a pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a very widespread condition. In Europe, it is estimated that about 175 million people suffer from this disease and have to chronically take drugs to increase gastric pH. The proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, and esomeprazole are the most widely used drug typology in this regard. However, the inhibition of normal gastric acid secretion has important side effects, the most important being bacterial overgrowth in the stomach and duodenum with a concentration of >10(5) viable cells/mL. As a major consequence of this, many harmful or even pathogenic bacteria contained in some foods could survive the gastric transit and colonize either the stomach itself, the duodenum, or the gut, where they could establish acute and even chronic infections with unavoidable consequences for the host's health. In other words, the "gastric barrier effect" is strongly reduced or even disrupted. To date, there are no real strategies to deal with this widespread, although still relatively little known, problem. The aim of this study was to confirm the gastric bacterial overgrowth in long-term PPI consumers and to assess the efficacy of some probiotic bacteria, belonging to both genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, in the reduction of gastric and duodenal bacterial overgrowth, therefore partially restoring the gastric barrier effect against foodborne pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: For this purpose, probiotics with a strong demonstrated inhibitory activity on gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, were tested in a human intervention trial involving a total of 30 subjects treated with PPIs for either 3 to 12 consecutive months (short-term) or >12 consecutive months (long-term). An additional 10 subjects not taking PPIs were enrolled and used as a control group representing the general population. Four selected probiotics Probiotical SpA (Novara, Italy), namely Lactobacillus rhamnosus LR06 (DSM 21981), Lactobacillus pentosus LPS01 (DSM 21980), Lactobacillus plantarum LP01 (LMG P-21021), and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii LDD01 (DSM 22106) were administered for 10 days to 10 subjects treated with PPIs for >12 months (group B). In the 60 mg formulation, N-acetylcysteine was included as well in light of its well-known mechanical effects on bacterial biofilms. Gastroscopies were performed at the beginning of the study (d0) in all the groups (A, B, C, and D) and after 10 days (d10) in group B only; that is, at the end of probiotics intake. The total viable cells and total Lactobacillus were quantified in gastric juice and duodenal brushing material from all subjects. The results were compared among all the groups and with the control subjects (group D) to confirm the bacterial overgrowth. A comparison was made also between d0 and d10 in group B to quantify the efficacy of the 4 probiotics administered for 10 days. Fecal samples were collected from all groups at d0, including subjects not treated with PPIs, and in group B only at d10. Specific bacterial classes, namely enterococci, total coliforms, E. coli, molds, and yeasts were quantified in all fecal specimens. RESULTS: The results collected confirmed the strong bacterial overgrowth in the stomach and duodenum of people treated with PPIs compared with subjects with a normal intragastric acidity. It is also worth noting that the bacterial cell counts in subjects who underwent a long-term treatment with a PPI were greater than the results from subjects taking these drugs for 3 to 12 months. The intake of 4 specific probiotic strains with a marked antagonistic activity towards 5 E. coli bacteria, including the enterohaemorrhagic O157:H7 strain, and an effective amount of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was able to significantly reduce bacterial overgrowth in long-term PPI-treated subjects. Total lactobacilli represented the major percentage of bacterial counts, thus demonstrating the ability of such bacteria to colonize the stomach and the duodenum, at least temporarily, and to consequently restore the gastric barrier effect. A significant decrease in fecal enterococci, total coliforms, E. coli, molds, and yeasts in subjects treated with PPIs was recorded at the end of probiotics supplementation (d10) compared with baseline (d0) in group B. This is a further confirmation of the barrier effect also exerted at the stomach level. CONCLUSIONS: PPIs are the most widely sold and used drugs in the world. However, the chronic use of these pharmacological molecules exposes the subject to the risk of foodborne infections as most pathogens are able to survive the gastric transit in a condition of significantly decreased acidity.
TI  - Myosin-cross-reactive antigens from four different lactic acid bacteria are fatty acid hydratases.
AB  - The 67 kDa myosin-cross-reactive antigen (MCRA) is a member of the MCRA family of proteins present in a wide range of bacteria and was predicted to have fatty acid isomerase function. We have now characterised the catalytic activity of MCRAs from four LAB stains, including Lactobacillus rhamnosus LGG, L. plantarum ST-III, L. acidophilus NCFM and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12. MCRA genes from these strains were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein function was analysed with lipid profiles by GC-MS. The four MCRAs catalysed the conversion of linoleic acid and oleic acid to their respective 10-hydroxy derivatives, which suggests that MCRA proteins catalyse the first step in conjugated linoleic acid production. This is the first report of MCRA from L. rhamnosus with such catalytic function.
TI  - Risks associated with high-dose Lactobacillus rhamnosus in an Escherichia coli model of piglet diarrhoea: intestinal microbiota and immune imbalances.
AB  - Probiotic could be a promising alternative to antibiotics for the prevention of enteric infections; however, further information on the dose effects is required. In this study, weanling piglets were orally administered low- or high-dose Lactobacillus rhamnosus ACTT 7469 (10(10) CFU/d or 10(12) CFU/d) for 1 week before F4 (K88)-positive Escherichia coli challenge. The compositions of faecal and gastrointestinal microbiota were recorded; gene expression in the intestines was assessed by real-time PCR; serum tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) concentrations and intestinal Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) were detected by ELISA and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Unexpectedly, high-dose administration increased the incidence of diarrhoea before F4(+)ETEC challenge, despite the fact that both doses ameliorated F4(+)ETEC-induced diarrhoea with increased Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium counts accompanied by reduced coliform shedding in faeces. Interestingly, L. rhamnosus administration reduced Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium counts in the colonic contents, and the high-dose piglets also had lower Lactobacillius and Bacteroides counts in the ileal contents. An increase in the concentration of serum TNF-alpha induced by F4(+)ETEC was observed, but the increase was delayed by L. rhamnosus. In piglets exposed to F4(+)ETEC, jejunal TLR4 expression increased at the mRNA and protein levels, while jejunal interleukin (IL)-8 and ileal porcine beta-defensins 2 (pBD2) mRNA expression increased; however, these increases were attenuated by administration of L. rhamnosus. Notably, expression of jejunal TLR2, ileal TLR9, Nod-like receptor NOD1 and TNF-alpha mRNA was upregulated in the low-dose piglets after F4(+)ETEC challenge, but not in the high-dose piglets. These findings indicate that pretreatment with a low dose of L. rhamnosus might be more effective than a high dose at ameliorating diarrhoea. There is a risk that high-dose L. rhamnosus pretreatment may negate the preventative effects, thus decreasing the prophylactic benefits against potential enteric pathogens. Our data suggest a safe threshold for preventative use of probiotics in clinical practice.
TI  - Lactobacilli vs antibiotics to prevent urinary tract infections: a randomized, double-blind, noninferiority trial in postmenopausal women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Growing antibiotic resistance warrants studying nonantibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). Use of lactobacilli appears to be promising. METHODS: Between January 2005 and August 2007, we randomized 252 postmenopausal women with recurrent UTIs taking part in a double-blind noninferiority trial to receive 12 months of prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 480 mg, once daily or oral capsules containing 109 colony-forming units of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14 twice daily. Primary end points were the mean number of symptomatic UTIs, proportion of participants with at least 1 UTI during 12 months, time to first UTI, and development of antibiotic resistance by Escherichia coli. RESULTS: The mean number of symptomatic UTIs in the year preceding randomization was 7.0 in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group and 6.8 in the lactobacilli group. In the intention-to-treat analysis, after 12 months of prophylaxis, these numbers were 2.9 and 3.3, respectively. The between-treatment difference of 0.4 UTIs per year (95% CI, -0.4 to 1.5) was outside our noninferiority margin. At least 1 symptomatic UTI occurred in 69.3% and 79.1% of the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and lactobacilli participants, respectively; median times to the first UTI were 6 and 3 months, respectively. After 1 month of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis, resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and amoxicillin had increased from approximately 20% to 40% to approximately 80% to 95% in E coli from the feces and urine of asymptomatic women and among E coli causing a UTI. During the 3 months after trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole discontinuation, resistance levels gradually decreased. Resistance did not increase during lactobacilli prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: In postmenopausal women with recurrent UTIs, L rhamnosus GR-1 and L reuteri RC-14 do not meet the noninferiority criteria in the prevention of UTIs when compared with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. However, unlike trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, lactobacilli do not increase antibiotic resistance. TRIAL REGISTRATION isrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN50717094.
TI  - Evaluation of impact of exposure of Sudan azo dyes and their metabolites on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - Sudan azo dyes are banned for food usage in most countries, but they are illegally used to maintain or enhance the color of food products due to low cost, bright staining, and wide availability of the dyes. In this report, we examined the toxic effects of these azo dyes and their potential reduction metabolites on 11 prevalent human intestinal bacterial strains. Among the tested bacteria, cell growth of 2, 3, 5, 5, and 1 strains was inhibited by Sudan I, II, III, IV, and Para Red, respectively. At the tested concentration of 100 muM, Sudan I and II inhibited growth of Clostridium perfringens and Lactobacillus rhamnosus with decrease of growth rates from 14 to 47%. Sudan II also affected growth of Enterococcus faecalis. Growth of Bifidobacterium catenulatum, C. perfringens, E. faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Peptostreptococcus magnus was affected by Sudan III and IV with decrease in growth rates from 11 to 67%. C. perfringens was the only strain in which growth was affected by Para Red with 47 and 26% growth decreases at 6 and 10 h, respectively. 1-Amino-2-naphthol, a common metabolite of the dyes, was capable of inhibiting growth of most of the tested bacteria with inhibition rates from 8 to 46%. However, the other metabolites of the dyes had no effect on growth of the bacterial strains. The dyes and their metabolites had less effect on cell viability than on cell growth of the tested bacterial strains. Clostridium indolis and Clostridium ramosum were the only two strains with about a 10 % decrease in cell viability in the presence of Sudan azo dyes. The present results suggested that Sudan azo dyes and their metabolites potentially affect the human intestinal bacterial ecology by selectively inhibiting some bacterial species, which may have an adverse effect on human health.
TI  - Substances released from probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 potentiate NF-kappaB activity in Escherichia coli-stimulated urinary bladder cells.
AB  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 is a probiotic bacterium used to maintain urogenital health. The putative mechanism for its probiotic effect is by modulating the host immunity. Urinary tract infections (UTI) are often caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli that frequently evade or suppress immune responses in the bladder and can target pathways, including nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). We evaluated the role of L. rhamnosus GR-1 on NF-kappaB activation in E. coli-stimulated bladder cells. Viable L. rhamnosus GR-1 was found to potentiate NF-kappaB activity in E. coli-stimulated T24 bladder cells, whereas heat-killed lactobacilli demonstrated a marginal increase in NF-kappaB activity. Surface components released by trypsin- or LiCl treatment, or the resultant heat-killed shaved lactobacilli, had no effect on NF-kappaB activity. Isolation of released products from L. rhamnosus GR-1 demonstrated that the induction of NF-kappaB activity was owing to released product(s) with a relatively large native size. Several putative immunomodulatory proteins were identified, namely GroEL, elongation factor Tu and NLP/P60. GroEL and elongation factor Tu have previously been shown to elicit immune responses from human cells. Isolating and using immune-augmenting substances produced by lactobacilli is a novel strategy for the prevention or treatment of UTI caused by immune-evading E. coli.
TI  - Bile stimulates cell surface hydrophobicity, Congo red binding and biofilm formation of Lactobacillus strains.
AB  - Seventeen Lactobacillus strains were tested for cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) using the salt aggregation test (SAT) and Congo red binding (CRB) assay. CRB was dependent on pH and ionic strength and was protease-sensitive. In the presence of 100 mug mL(-1) cholesterol, the CRB was significantly reduced. Autoaggregating (AA) Lactobacillus crispatus strains showed 50% more CRB than the reference strain, the curli-producing Escherichia coli MC4 100. CRB of L. crispatus 12005, L. paracasei F8, L. plantarum F44 and L. paracasei F19 were enhanced when grown in Man Rogosa Sharpe (MRS) broth with 0.5% taurocholic acid (TA) or 5% porcine bile (PB) (P < 0.05). CSH was also enhanced for the non-AA strains L. plantarum F44, L. paracasei F19 and L. rhamnosus GG when grown in MRS broth with 0.5% TA, 5% PB or 0.25% mucin, with enhanced biofilm formation in MRS broth with bile (P < 0.05). Two AA strains, L. crispatus 12005 and L. paracasei F8, developed biofilm independent of bile or mucin. In summary, under bile-stressed growth conditions, early (24-h cultures) biofilm formation is associated with an increase in hydrophobic cell surface proteins and high CRB. Late mature (72-h culture) biofilm contained more carbohydrates, as shown by crystal violet staining.
TI  - In vitro study of the effect of a probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus rhamnosus against herpes simplex virus type 1.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the emergence of drug resistance in herpes simplex virus type  1 (HSV-1), researchers are trying to find other methods for treating herpes simplex virus type 1 infections. Probiotic bacteria are effective in macrophage activation and may have antiviral activities. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at verifying the direct effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, a probiotic bacterium, in comparison with Escherichia coli, a non-probiotic one, on HSV-1 infection, and determining its effect on macrophage activation for in vitro elimination of HSV-1 infection. METHODS: The above bacteria were introduced into HSV-1 infected Vero cells, and their effects were examined using both MTT and plaque assay. To determine macrophage activation against in vitro HSV-1 infection, J774 cells were exposed to these bacteria; then, macrophage viability was examined with the MTT method, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and nitric oxide (NO) assessments were performed using the ELISA method. RESULTS: A significant increased viability of macrophages was observed (p < 0.05) in the presence of Lactobacillus rhamnosus before and after HSV-1 infection when compared with Escherichia coli as a non-probiotic bacterium. However, tumor necrosis factor alpha concentration produced by Escherichia coli-treated J774 cells was significantly higher than Lactobacillus rhamnosus-treated J774 cells (p < 0.05). interferon-gamma and NO production were not different in the groups treated with Escherichia coli or with Lactobacillus rhamnosus. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that Lactobacillus rhamnosus enhances macrophage viability for HSV-1 elimination and activation against HSV-1 more effectively, when compared with non-probiotic Escherichia coli. it also seems that receptor occupation of macrophage sites decreases HSV-1 infectivity by both of the studied bacteria.
TI  - Probiotic factors partially prevent changes to caspases 3 and 7 activation and transepithelial electrical resistance in a model of 5-fluorouracil-induced epithelial cell damage.
AB  - The potential efficacy of a probiotic-based preventative strategy against intestinal mucositis has yet to be investigated in detail. We evaluated supernatants (SN) from Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) for their capacity to prevent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced damage to intestinal epithelial cells. A 5-day study was performed. IEC-6 cells were treated daily from days 0 to 3, with 1 mL of PBS (untreated control), de Man Rogosa Sharpe (MRS) broth, tryptone soy roth (TSB), LGG SN, or EcN SN. With the exception of the untreated control cells, all groups were treated with 5-FU (5 muM) for 24 h at day 3. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was determined on days 3, 4, and 5, while activation of caspases 3 and 7 was determined on days 4 and 5 to assess apoptosis. Pretreatment with LGG SN increased TEER (p < 0.05) compared to controls at day 3. 5-FU administration reduced TEER compared to untreated cells on days 4 and 5. Pretreatment with MRS, LGG SN, TSB, and EcN SN partially prevented the decrease in TEER induced by 5-FU on day 4, while EcN SN also improved TEER compared to its TSB vehicle control. These differences were also observed at day 5, along with significant improvements in TEER in cells treated with LGG and EcN SN compared to healthy controls. 5-FU increased caspase activity on days 4 and 5 compared to controls. At day 4, cells pretreated with MRS, TSB, LGG SN, or EcN SN all displayed reduced caspase activity compared to 5-FU controls, while both SN groups had significantly lower caspase activity than their respective vehicle controls. Caspase activity in cells pretreated with MRS, LGG SN, and EcN SN was also reduced at day 5, compared to 5-FU controls. We conclude that pretreatment with selected probiotic SN could prevent or inhibit enterocyte apoptosis and loss of intestinal barrier function induced by 5-FU, potentially forming the basis of a preventative treatment modality for mucositis.
TI  - Probiotics in the management of inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review of intervention studies in adult patients.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Mounting evidence suggests an important role for the intestinal microbiota in the chronic mucosal inflammation that occurs in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and novel molecular approaches have further identified a dysbiosis in these patients. Several mechanisms of action of probiotic products that may interfere with possible aetiological factors in IBD have been postulated. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to discuss the rationale for probiotics in IBD and to systematically review clinical intervention studies with probiotics in the management of IBD in adults. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in PubMed up to 1 October 2011, using defined keywords. Only full-text papers in the English language addressing clinical outcomes in adult patients were included. The 41 eligible studies were categorized on disease type (ulcerative colitis [UC] with/without an ileo-anal pouch and Crohn's disease [CD]) and disease activity. Pooled odds ratios were only calculated per probiotic for a specific patient group when more than one randomized controlled trial was available. RESULTS: Well designed randomized controlled trials supporting the application of probiotics in the management of IBD are still limited. Meta-analyses could only be performed for a limited number of studies revealing overall risk ratios of 2.70 (95% CI 0.47, 15.33) for inducing remission in active UC with Bifido-fermented milk versus placebo or no additive treatment (n = 2); 1.88 (95% CI 0.96, 3.67) for inducing remission in active UC with VSL#3 versus placebo (n = 2); 1.08 (95% CI 0.86, 1.37) for preventing relapses in inactive UC with Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 versus standard treatment (n = 3); 0.17 (95% CI 0.09, 0.33) for preventing relapses in inactive UC/ileo-anal pouch anastomosis (IPAA) patients with VSL#3 versus placebo; 1.21 (95% CI 0.57, 2.57) for preventing endoscopic recurrences in inactive CD with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG versus placebo (n = 2); and 0.93 (95% CI 0.63, 1.38) for preventing endoscopic recurrences in inactive CD with Lactobacillus johnsonii versus placebo (n = 2). CONCLUSION: Further well designed studies based on intention-to-treat analyses by several independent research groups are still warranted to support the promising results for E. coli Nissle in inactive UC and the multispecies product VSL#3 in active UC and inactive pouch patients. So far, no evidence is available to support the use of probiotics in CD. Future studies should focus on specific disease subtypes and disease location. Further insight into the aetiology of IBD and the mechanisms of probiotic strains will aid in selecting probiotic strains for specific disease entities and disease locations.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of microflora from ovine cheese.
AB  - Strains identified in ovine cheese and bryndza by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis belonged to ten species of non-enterococcal lactic acid bacteria and included Lactobacillus casei/Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactococcus lactis, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Pediococcus acidilactici. The susceptibility toward antibiotics was determined in lactobacilli, lactococci and pediococci and also in Escherichia coli for comparison. Analysis of L. fermentum and pediococci revealed the presence of non-wild-type epidemiological cut-offs in streptomycin, clindamycin or gentamicin. E. coli were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin and florfenicol. No extended spectrum beta-lactamases were detected.
TI  - Functional properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from dairy products.
AB  - Twenty-four acid- and bile-tolerant lactobacilli isolates from dairy products were identified and further in vitro characterized for the presence of functional traits potentially useful for probiotic applications, which included desirable and undesirable traits, such as biofilm formation, ability to inhibit intestinal pathogens, antibiotic susceptibility, and enzyme activity. The majority of examined strains were susceptible to certain antimicrobial agents (streptomycin, gentamicin, clindamycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, quinupristin-dalfopristin), except for three strains of Lactobacillus rhamnosus with minimal inhibitory concentration levels for streptomycin higher than the microbiological breakpoints (>/=32 mug/mL), which are considered as resistant. Undesirable traits such as alpha-chymotrypsin or N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activities were not detected, but low beta-glucuronidase, and moderate and high beta-glucosidase activities were recorded in nine strains, which were eliminated from further examination together with three isolates showing unsuitable antibiotic resistance. Of the remaining 12 isolates, 4 (Lactobacillus fermentum 202, Lactobacillus gallinarum 7001, L. rhamnosus 183, and Lactobacillus plantarum L2-1) manifested an outstanding potential to inhibit selected intestinal pathogens in an agar spot test, including Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp., and simultaneously demonstrated strong biofilm-forming capacity. In conclusion, the results of our in vitro experiments showed that the above four strains had a potential probiotic value and met the criteria to be identified as a possible probiotic microorganism, with the necessity of verification through well-designed in vivo experimental, clinical, and technological studies before the strains can be used as probiotics or as starter probiotic cultures.
TI  - Dietary addition of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG impairs the health of Escherichia  coli F4-challenged piglets.
AB  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) is a probiotic for humans and is normally not found in pigs; however, it has been shown to protect the human-derived intestinal Caco-2 cells against the damage induced by an important intestinal pathogen, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli F4 (ETEC). An experiment was conducted to test whether the dietary addition of LGG improves the growth and health of weaned pigs when orally challenged by E. coli F4. Thirty-six pigs were weaned at 21 days and assigned to a standard weaning diet with or without 1010 CFU LGG (ATCC 53103) per day. The pigs, individually penned, were orally challenged with 1.5 ml of a 1010 CFU E. coli F4 suspension on day 7 and slaughtered on day 12 or 14. With the addition of LGG, the average daily gain and the average daily feed intake were reduced after the challenge with ETEC and for the entire trial (P < 0.05). The average faecal score tended to worsen from day 11 to the end of the trial and the concentration of ETEC in the faeces tended to increase (P = 0.07) with the LGG supplementation. The counts of lactic acid bacteria, enterobacteria and yeasts in the colonic digesta were not affected. The pH values in ileal, colonic and caecal digesta, and the small intestine size were also unchanged. Regardless of the site of measurement (duodenum, jejunum or ileum), a trend of decreased villus height was seen with LGG (P = 0.10). Crypt depth and villus to crypt ratio were unchanged by the diet. A gradual increase of total seric IgA was seen after 1 week and after the challenge, in the control (P < 0.05), but not in the treated group. After the challenge, the LGG reduced the total IgA in the blood serum (P < 0.05), v. the control. The total IgA in the saliva and in the jejunum secretion were not affected by the diet. The F4-specific IgA activity was not affected by the diet at all the samplings. Our result shows that, the administration of LGG do not prevent or reduce the detrimental effect of the E. coli F4 infection on the growth performance and health status of weaned piglet.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a thermostable H2O-forming NADH oxidase from Lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  - NADH oxidase (Nox) catalyzes the conversion of NADH to NAD(+). A previously uncharacterized Nox gene (LrNox) was cloned from Lactobacillus rhamnosus and overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1359 bp, capable of encoding a polypeptide of 453 amino acid residues. The molecular mass of the purified LrNox enzyme was estimated to be ~50 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and 100 kDa by gel filtration chromatography, suggesting that the enzyme is a homodimer. The enzyme had optimal activity at pH 5.6 and temperature 65 degrees C, and k(cat)/K(m) of 3.77x10(7) s(-1) M(-1), the highest ever reported. Heat inactivation studies revealed that LrNox had high thermostability, with a half-life of 120 min at 80 degrees C. Molecular dynamics simulation studies shed light on the factors contributing to the high activity of LrNox. Although the properties of Nox from several microorganisms have been reported, this is the first report on the characterization of a recombinant H(2)O-forming Nox with high activity and thermostability. The characteristics of the LrNox enzyme could prove to be of interest in industrial applications such as NAD(+) regeneration.
TI  - Antimicrobial and Safety Properties of Lactobacilli Isolated from two Cameroonian Traditional Fermented Foods.
AB  - Twenty-one Lactobacillus isolates from "Sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "Kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. These isolates were preliminarily identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (62%), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), Lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and Lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. Twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (Trypsin, Proteinase K) and inhibition of other Lactobacillus spp. These bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin G, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. The bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the World Health Organization, as well as Multidrug-resistant strains. These include Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare Typhi, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Shigella flexneri. These Lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.
TI  - The major secreted protein Msp1/p75 is O-glycosylated in Lactobacillus rhamnosus  GG.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the occurrence, biosynthesis and possible functions of glycoproteins are increasingly documented for pathogens, glycoproteins are not yet widely described in probiotic bacteria. Nevertheless, knowledge of protein glycosylation holds important potential for better understanding specific glycan-mediated interactions of probiotics and for glycoengineering in food-grade microbes. RESULTS: Here, we provide evidence that the major secreted protein Msp1/p75 of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG is glycosylated. Msp1 was shown to stain positive with periodic-acid Schiff staining, to be susceptible to chemical deglycosylation, and to bind with the mannose-specific Concanavalin A (ConA) lectin. Recombinant expression in Escherichia coli resulted in a significant reduction in molecular mass, loss of ConA reactivity and increased sensitivity towards pronase E and proteinase K. Mass spectrometry showed that Msp1 is O-glycosylated and identified a glycopeptide TVETPSSA (amino acids 101-108) bearing hexoses presumably linked to the serine residues. Interestingly, these serine residues are not present in the homologous protein of several Lactobacillus casei strains tested, which also did not bind to ConA. The role of the glycan substitutions in known functions of Msp1 was also investigated. Glycosylation did not seem to impact significantly on the peptidoglycan hydrolase activity of Msp1. In addition, the glycan chain appeared not to be required for the activation of Akt signaling in intestinal epithelial cells by Msp1. On the other hand, examination of different cell extracts showed that Msp1 is a glycosylated protein in the supernatant, but not in the cell wall and cytosol fraction, suggesting a link between glycosylation and secretion of this protein. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we have provided the first evidence of protein O-glycosylation in the probiotic L rhamnosus GG. The major secreted protein Msp1 is glycosylated with ConA reactive sugars at the serine residues at 106 and 107. Glycosylation is not required for the peptidoglycan hydrolase activity of Msp1 nor for Akt activation capacity in epithelial cells, but appears to be important for its stability and protection against proteases.
TI  - The antimicrobial properties of the lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium) fractional components against foodborne pathogens and the conservation of probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  - The antimicrobial properties of lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium) were  studied against Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus to determine which fractional components have antimicrobial effects and which microorganisms are most susceptible to these antimicrobial properties. Lowbush blueberry extract (F1) was separated using a C-18 Sep-Pak cartridge into monomeric phenolics (F2) and anthocyanins plus proanthocyanidins (F3). Fraction 3 was further separated into anthocyanins (F4) and proanthocyanidins (F5) using a LH-20 Sephadex column. Each fraction was initially screened for antimicrobial properties using agar diffusion assay. Treatments that demonstrated inhibition were further analyzed for inhibition in liquid culture. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined using a two-fold dilution series and viable cell counts taken at 0 and 24 h to examine growth reduction. Fraction 3 demonstrated the lowest MICs/MBCs followed by F1, F2, F4, and F5. L. monocytogenes was the most susceptible to blueberry fraction treatment, followed by E. coli O157:H7, and S. Typhimurium. L. rhamnosus was the least susceptible to each fraction treatment. The results can be applied to the field of preventive medicine, food safety, and enrich the understanding of the health benefits of lowbush blueberries.
TI  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 enhances NF-kappaB activation in Escherichia coli-stimulated urinary bladder cells through TLR4.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epithelial cells of the urinary tract recognize pathogenic bacteria through pattern recognition receptors on their surface, such as toll-like receptors (TLRs), and mount an immune response through the activation of the NF-kappaB pathway. Some uropathogenic bacteria can subvert these cellular responses, creating problems with how the host eliminates pathogens. Lactobacillus is a genus of lactic acid bacteria that are part of the microbiota and consist of many probiotic strains, some specifically for urogenital infections. Immunomodulation has emerged as an important mode of action of probiotic and commensal lactobacilli and given the importance of epithelial cells, we evaluated the effect of the urogenital probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 on epithelial immune activation. RESULTS: Immune activation through the NF-kappaB pathway was initiated by stimulation of T24 urothelial cells with heat-killed Escherichia coli and this was further potentiated when cells were co-cultured with live L. rhamnosus GR-1. Heat-killed lactobacilli were poor activators of NF-kappaB. Concomitant stimulation of bladder cells with E. coli and L. rhamnosus GR-1 increased the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF, whereas IL-6 and CXCL8 levels were reduced. Another probiotic, L. rhamnosus GG, was also able to potentiate NF-kappaB in these cells although at a significantly reduced level compared to the GR-1 strain. The transcript numbers and protein levels of the lipopolysaccharide receptor TLR4 were significantly increased after co-stimulation with E. coli and lactobacilli compared to controls. Furthermore, inhibition of TLR4 activation by polymixin B completely blocked the lactobacilli potentiation of NF-kappaB. CONCLUSIONS: The immunological outcome of E. coli challenge of bladder cells was influenced by probiotic L. rhamnosus GR-1, by enhancing the activation of NF-kappaB and TNF release. Thus the urogenital probiotic L. rhamnosus GR-1 modulated the activation of the NF-kappaB through increased levels of TLR4 on the bladder cells and altered subsequent release of cytokines from urothelial cells. By influencing immunological factors such as TLR4, important in the process of fighting pathogens, lactobacilli could facilitate pathogen recognition and infection clearance.
TI  - Cytokine profile and induction of T helper type 17 and regulatory T cells by human peripheral mononuclear cells after microbial exposure.
AB  - The immunomodulatory effects of probiotics were assessed following exposure of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), cord blood cells and the spleen-derived monocyte/macrophage cell line CRL-9850 to Lactobacillus acidophilus LAVRI-A1, Lb. rhamnosus GG, exopolysaccharides (EPS)-producing Streptococcus thermophilus St1275, Bifidobacteriun longum BL536, B. lactis B94 and Escherichia coli TG1 strains. The production of a panel of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines by PBMC following bacterial stimulation was measured, using live, heat-killed or mock gastrointestinal tract (GIT)-exposed bacteria, and results show that (i) all bacterial strains investigated induced significant secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines from PBMC-derived monocytes/macrophages; and (ii) cytokine levels increased relative to the expansion of bacterial cell numbers over time for cells exposed to live cultures. Bifidobacteria and S. thermophilus stimulated significant concentrations of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, an interleukin necessary for the differentiation of regulatory T cells (T(reg) )/T helper type 17 (Th17) cells and, as such, the study further examined the induction of Th17 and T(reg) cells after PBMC exposure to selected bacteria for 96 h. Data show a significant increase in the numbers of both cell types in the exposed populations, measured by cell surface marker expression and by cytokine production. Probiotics have been shown to induce cytokines from a range of immune cells following ingestion of these organisms. These studies suggest that probiotics' interaction with immune-competent cells produces a cytokine milieu, exerting immunomodulatory effects on local effector cells, as well as potently inducing differentiation of Th17 and T(reg) cells.
TI  - Enveloped virus but not bacteria block IL-13 responses in human cord blood T cells in vitro.
AB  - Infections that occur early in life may have a beneficial effect on the immune system and thereby reduce the risk of allergen sensitization and/or allergic disease. It is not yet clear to what extent specific virus and/or bacteria can mediate this effect. The purpose of this study was to assess the role of virus and bacteria in CD4(+) T cell-derived cytokine production in newborns. We compared the effects of five bacteria (Staphlococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium bifidus) and seven virus (adenovirus, coronavirus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, influenza virus, morbillivirus and poliovirus) on the Th1/Th2 cytokine production in mixed lymphocyte reactions using CD4(+) T cells from cord blood cocultured with allogenic myeloid or plasmacytoid dendritic cells. When comparing the baseline cytokine production prior to microbial stimulation, we observed that cord plasmacytoid DC were stronger inducers of Th2 cytokines (IL-5 and IL-13) compared with cord myeloid DC and to adult DC. When adding microbes to these cultures, bacteria and virus differed in two major respects; Firstly, all enveloped viruses, but none of the bacteria, blocked Th2 (IL-13) production by cord CD4(+) cells. Secondly, all Gram-positive bacteria, but none of the virus, induced IL-12p40 responses, but the IL-12p40 responses did not affect Th1 cytokine production (IFN-gamma). Instead, Th1 responses were correlated with the capacity to induce IFN-alpha secretion, which in cord cells were induced by S. aureus and influenza virus alone. These data imply that enveloped virus can deviate Th2 responses in human cord T cells.
TI  - Effect of pepsin-treated bovine and goat caseinomacropeptide on Escherichia coli  and Lactobacillus rhamnosus in acidic conditions.
AB  - Caseinomacropeptide (CMP) is a 7-kDa phosphoglycopolypeptide released from kappa-casein during milk digestion and in the cheesemaking process. The objective of the study was to analyze the effect of pepsin-treated CMP from cow and goat milk on the resistance of Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus rhamnosus during acid stress. Bacterial cells in the exponential growth phase were suspended in acidified phosphate buffered saline with or without pepsin-treated CMP. Viability was determined during a 90-min incubation period. Pepsin-treated CMP exhibited bactericidal activity at pH 3.5 when added in a dose-dependent manner to E. coli, decreasing survival by more than 90% within 15 min at 0.25 mg/mL. At pH >4.5, the bactericidal activity disappeared, indicating that pepsin-treated CMP was efficient at low pH only. The effectiveness of pepsin-treated CMP at pH 3.5 was not affected by the presence of glycoconjugates linked to CMP or by the bovine or caprine origin of milk. In contrast, L. rhamnosus, a probiotic, was more resistant to acid stress when pepsin-treated bovine or caprine CMP was added to the media. Viability reached 50% after 60 min of incubation at pH 3 compared with 5% survival in the media without added pepsin-treated CMP. Neither glycosylation extent nor sequence variations between CMP from bovine milk and caprine milk affected the protective activity of hydrolyzed CMP toward L. rhamnosus. This suggests that encrypted bioactive peptides released by the pepsin treatment of CMP had an antibacterial effect on E. coli in acidic media, but improved the resistance of L. rhamnosus to acid stress. The peptide fragment accountable for bactericidal activity is the N-terminal region kappa-casein f(106-124).
TI  - The fate of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua and Staphylococcus aureus in Danish raw milk and cheeses determined by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR.
AB  - The purpose of this work was to study the bacterial communities in raw milk and in Danish raw milk cheeses using pyrosequencing of tagged amplicons of the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rDNA and cDNA. Furthermore, the effects of acidification and ripening starter cultures, cooking temperatures and rate of acidification on survival of added Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua and Staphylococcus aureus in cheeses at different stages of ripening were studied by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR. A high diversity of bacterial species was detected in raw milk. Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus were the main bacteria detected in raw milk and cheeses. Bacteria belonging to the genera Brevibacterium, Staphylococcus, Escherichia, Weissella, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus were also detected in both 16S rDNA and cDNA obtained from raw milk and cheeses. E. coli, which was added to milk used for production of some cheeses, was detected in both DNA and RNA extracted from cheeses at different stages of ripening showing the highest percentage of the total sequence reads at 7 days of ripening and decreased again in the later ripening stages. Growth of E. coli in cheeses appeared to be affected by the cooking temperature and the rate of acidification but not by the ripening starter cultures applied or the indigenous microbiota of raw milk. Growth of L. innocua and S. aureus added to milks was inhibited in all cheeses at different stages of ripening. The use of 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and qRT-PCR allows a deeper understanding of the behavior of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures and pathogenic bacteria in raw milk and cheeses.
TI  - Bio-control of waterborne pathogens using Lactobacillus spp.
AB  - Bacteria play a significant role in water contamination. Chemicals are mostly used for the treatment of bacteriologically contaminated water. The use of bacterial interactions is a new approach to limit the pathogens' growth. Detection of antimicrobial substances produced by lactic acid bacteria against the waterborne pathogens is the objective of this work. Microbiological and biochemical methods were used to identify lactic acid bacteria having an antimicrobial activity. Evaluation of antimicrobial activity with growth kinetic measurements was performed. Four isolates of lactic acid bacteria obtained from whey and curd were identified. The predominant species belonging to the Lactobacillus genera are: Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus paracasei, and Lactobacillus paraplantarum. The present study revealed that the Lactobacillus consortium is able to inhibit Staphylococcus aureus's growth along with Escherichia coli and Vibrio species. In mixed culture, after 24 h, the Lactobacillus consortium reduces the growth of S. aureus by 2.03 log; moreover, the growth of the latter bacteria totally ceased after 72 h of incubation. The protein produced by the Lactobacillus consortium was responsible for arresting the growth of S. aureus.
TI  - Use of rosemary, oregano, and a commercial blend of essential oils in broiler chickens: in vitro antimicrobial activities and effects on growth performance.
AB  - The present study was conducted to characterize the in vitro antimicrobial activities of 3 essential oils [oregano, rosemary, and a commercial blend of essential oils (BEO)] against pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria and to evaluate their effects on broiler chicken performances. The chemical composition of the essential oils was determined using the gas chromatography interfaced with a mass spectroscopy. The disc diffusion method, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were applied for the determination of antimicrobial activities of essential oils. In vivo study, a total of seven hundred fifty 1-d-old male broiler chickens were assigned to 6 dietary treatment groups: basal diet (control; CON), CON + 44 mg of avilamycin/kg (A), CON + 100 mg of rosemary essential oil/kg (ROS), CON + 100 mg of oregano essential oil/kg (OR), CON + 50 mg of rosemary and 50 mg of oregano essential oils/kg (RO), and CON + 1,000 mg of BEO/kg (essential oil mixture, EOM). The essential oils isolated from rosemary and oregano were characterized by their greater content of 1,8-cineole (49.99%) and carvacrol (69.55%), respectively. The BEO was mainly represented by the aldehyde (cinnamaldehyde) and the monoterpene (1,8-cineole) chemical groups. The results of the disc diffusion method indicated that the rosemary essential oil had antibacterial activity (P </= 0.05) against only 3 pathogenic bacteria, Escherichia coli (8 mm), Salmonella indiana (11 mm), and Listeria innocua (9 mm). The essential oil of oregano had antimicrobial activities (P </= 0.05) on the same bacteria as rosemary but also on Staphylococcus aureus (22 mm) and Bacillus subtilis (12 mm). Oregano essential oil had greater (P </= 0.05) antimicrobial activities against pathogenic bacteria than rosemary essential oil but they had no synergism between them. The BEO showed an increased antimicrobial activity (P </= 0.05) against all studied bacteria (pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria) except for Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The supplementation of the basal diet with avilamycin or essential oils improved (P </= 0.05) broiler chicken BW, BW gain, and G:F compared with the CON diet. There were no differences in growth performances among birds fed A, ROS, OR, RO, or EOM diets. In general, essential oils contained in rosemary, oregano, and BEO can substitute for growth promoter antibiotics. Although the 3 essential oils had different antimicrobial activities, they exhibited the same efficiency in broiler chickens.
TI  - Evaluation of beneficial attributes for phytate-degrading Pediococcus pentosaceus CFR R123.
AB  - In this study we have screened and selected potent phytate-degrading lactic acid  bacteria (LAB), and evaluated their beneficial attributes. Around 60 LAB strains were isolated from several cereal- and pulse-based conventional fermented preparations. They were screened for their ability to degrade myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) by cobalt chloride qualitative staining method (plate assay). One of the cultures, Pediococcus pentosaceus CFR R123, was capable of degrading both calcium and sodium salts of phytic acid. Additionally, we have carried out an in vitro evaluation for the beneficial attributes of phytate degrading CFR R123. P. pentosaceus CFR R123 showed 53% survivability at pH 2 and 62% at pH 2.5, whereas cultures of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG showed a survivability of 55% and 82%, respectively. CFR R123 could also withstand 0.3% ox-bile, whereas no growth was observed for GG. The strain CFR R123 exhibited 62.8% hydrophobicity to xylene whereas 59% was found for GG. Both the tested strains showed a good spectrum of antibacterial activity against food-borne pathogens like Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes Scott A, etc. P. pentosaceus CFR R123 possessed beta-galactosidase activity and cholesterol reduction ability. In conclusion, LAB with phytate degrading ability and several beneficial attributes could potentially be used as a starter culture to improve the nutritional security of functional food.
TI  - Antibacterial peptides derived from caprine whey proteins, by digestion with human gastrointestinal juice.
AB  - Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2.5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37 degrees C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, beta-lactoglobulin f(92-100) and beta-casein f(191-205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14-42) or lactoferrampin C f(268-284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey.
TI  - Disruption of urogenital biofilms by lactobacilli.
AB  - The process that changes a relatively sparse vaginal microbiota of healthy women  into a dense biofilm of pathogenic and potentially pathogenic bacteria is poorly understood. Likewise, the reverse step whereby an aberrant biofilm is displaced and returns to a healthy lactobacilli dominated microbiota is unclear. In order to study these phenomena, in vitro experiments were performed to examine the structure of biofilms associated with aerobic vaginosis, urinary tract infections, and bacterial vaginosis (BV). Uropathogenic Escherichia coli were able to form relatively thin biofilms within five days (6 mum height), while Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis formed thicker biofilms 12 mum in height within two days. Challenge of E. coli biofilms with lactobacilli did not result in pathogen displacement. However, the resulting thicker lactobacilli infused biofilms, caused significant E. coli killing. E. coli biofilms challenged with secreted products of L. rhamnosus GR-1 caused a marked decrease in cell density, and increased cell death. Similarly challenge of BV biofilms with lactobacilli infiltrated BV biofilms and caused bacterial cell death. Metronidazole produced holes in the biofilm but did not eradicate the organisms. The findings provide some evidence of how lactobacilli probiotics might interfere with an aberrant vaginal microbiota, and strengthen the position that combining probiotics with antimicrobials could better eradicate pathogenic biofilms.
TI  - Evaluation of the functional potential of Weissella and Lactobacillus isolates obtained from Nigerian traditional fermented foods and cow's intestine.
AB  - The characterisation of 24 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolates from Nigerian traditional fermented dairy foods, including some cow's intestine isolates, was conducted in order to select isolates for potential use as probiotics. LAB isolates were identified by partial sequencing the 16S rRNA gene as belonging to the species Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus brevis and mainly Weissella confusa. At the end of a characterisation process, 2 L. paracasei and 2 W. confusa isolates were selected, and their resistance to a simulated gastrointestinal digestion and their ability to adhere to eukaryotic cell lines were assessed. The survival to the simulated gastrointestinal passage was higher when bacterial suspensions were made in skimmed milk (2.0+/-0.8 log units reduction) or at the simulated gastric juice pH 3 (2.7+/-0.9 log units reduction) than at pH 2.0 (5.5+/-0.7 log units reduction). Adhesion of LAB to both intestinal and vaginal epithelial models was comparable or higher than that of the reference Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. However, some of the isolates increased the adhesion of the pathogen Escherichia coli LMG2092 to HT-29 and HeLa monolayers. Overall, isolates L. paracasei UI14 and W. confusa UI7 are good candidates for further studying potential benefits that support their use as probiotics. This is one of the few articles reporting the characterisation and the probiotic potential of Weissella, although more studies are needed in order to establish their safety for potential probiotic applications.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity against Shigella sonnei and probiotic properties of wild lactobacilli from fermented food.
AB  - Four lactobacilli strains (Lactobacillus paracasei subp. paracasei M5-L, Lactobacillus rhamnosus J10-L, Lactobacillus casei Q8-L and L. rhamnosus GG (LGG), were systematically assessed for the production of antimicrobial substances active towards Shigella sonnei, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Agar-well assay showed that the four lactobacilli strains displayed strong antibacterial activity towards S. sonnei. The nature of antimicrobial substances was also investigated and shown to be dependent on the production of organic acids, in particular the lactic acid. Time-kill assay showed that the viability of the S. sonnei was decreased by 2.7-3.6logCFU/ml after contact with CFCS (cell-free culture supernatants) of four lactobacilli for 2h, which confirmed the result of the agar-well assay. Further analysis of the organic acid composition in the CFCS revealed that the content of lactic acid range from 227 to 293mM. In addition, the aggregations properties, adherence properties and tolerance to simulated gastrointestinal conditions were also investigated in vitro tests. The result suggested that the M5-L, J10-L and Q8-L strains possess desirable antimicrobial activity towards S. sonnei and probiotic properties as LGG and could be potentially used as novel probiotic strains in the food industry.
TI  - Catabolism of L-ascorbate by Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG.
AB  - Catabolism of L-ascorbate by enteric bacteria is well documented, but no study has formally proved that bacteria of the Lactobacillus genus ferment this compound. However, some genes analogous to those of yiaK-S operon and ula regulon, which encoded proteins leading to L-ascorbate degradation by Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae , have been identified in the recently sequenced Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG genome. Investigations by HPLC and in vivo (13)C NMR using L-[1,6-(13)C]-ascorbate showed that L. rhamnosus GG, a common probiotic strain, has the ability to catabolize L-ascorbate under anaerobiosis. The main products of the ascorbate degradation have been identified as CO(2), acetate, and lactate. These results are in accordance with the metabolic pathway proposed for the fermentation of L-ascorbate by E. coli.
TI  - [Ability of human oral cavity indigenous lactobacilli to form biofilms].
AB  - AIM: To determine ability of lactobacilli strains indigenous for oral cavity of healthy persons to adhesion, autoaggregation, surface hydrophobicity, coaggregation and formation of biofilms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three anatagonistically active isolates of lactobacilli, including 5 strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, 6--L. rhamnosus, 4--L. paracasei, and 8--L. fermentum, were studied. Characteristics of lactobacilli associated with adhesion, autoaggregation, surface hydrophobicity, coaggregation, and formation of biofilms were determined. RESULTS: Bacteria were characterized by high and intermediate level of adhesion, autoaggregation, surface hydrophobicity, expressed ability to form biofilms and different coaggregation activity relative to test-strains Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus subtilis. CONCLUSION: Studied characteristics of lactobacilli could be used for development of new probiotics aimed at stabilization of oral cavity normoflora.
TI  - Lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea) and European cranberry (Vaccinium microcarpon) proanthocyanidins: isolation, identification, and bioactivities.
AB  - European, small-fruited cranberries (Vaccinium microcarpon) and lingonberries (Vaccinium vitis-idaea) were characterized for their phenolic compounds and tested for antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiadhesive, and antiinflammatory effects. The main phenolic compounds in both lingonberries and cranberries were proanthocyanidins comprising 63-71% of the total phenolic content, but anthocyanins, hydroxycinnamic acids, hydroxybenzoic acids, and flavonols were also found. Proanthocyanidins are polymeric phenolic compounds consisting mainly of catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin, and epigallocatechin units. In the present study, proanthocyanidins were divided into three groups: dimers and trimers, oligomers (mDP 4-10), and polymers (mDP > 10). Catechin, epicatechin, A-type dimers and trimers were found to be the terminal units of isolated proanthocyanidin fractions. Inhibitions of lipid oxidation in liposomes were over 70% and in emulsions over 85%, and in most cases the oligomeric or polymeric fraction was the most effective. Polymeric proanthocyanidin extracts of lingonberries and cranberries were strongly antimicrobial against Staphylococcus aureus, whereas they had no effect on other bacterial strains such as Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Escherichia coli. Polymeric fraction of cranberries and oligomeric fractions of both lingonberries and cranberries showed an inhibitory effect on hemagglutination of E. coli, which expresses the M hemagglutin. Cranberry phenolic extract inhibited LPS-induced NO production in a dose-dependent manner, but it had no major effect on iNOS of COX-2 expression. At a concentration of 100 mug/mL cranberry phenolic extract inhibited LPS-induced IL-6, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha production. Lingonberry phenolics had no significant effect on IL-1beta production but inhibited IL-6 and TNF-alpha production at a concentration of 100 mug/mL similarly to cranberry phenolic extract. In conclusion the phenolics, notably proanthocyanidins (oligomers and polymers), in both lingonberries and cranberries exert multiple bioactivities that may be exploited in food development.
TI  - Probiotic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and Taiwanese pickled cabbage.
AB  - This study assessed potential probiotic Lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from Taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. Five Lactobacillus isolates identified as Lactobacillus reuteri F03, Lactobacillus paracasei F08, Lactobacillus rhamnosus F14, Lactobacillus plantarum C06, and Lactobacillus acidophilus C11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. All the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to Caco-2 cells, particularly, strain L. plantarum C06 and L. reuteri F03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain L. rhamnosus GG. The strains L. paracasei F08 and L. acidophilus C11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. Most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. All the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica) pathogens. Moreover, the strains L. reuteri F03, L. paracasei F08, and L. plantarum C06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/mL after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees C. The viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/mL after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees C. In the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and Clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. Lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. Technologically interesting Lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.
TI  - Preservation of viability and antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus spp. in calcium alginate beads.
AB  - The objective of the study was to produce calcium alginate beads able to deliver  Lactobacillus spp. (Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Lactobacillus lactis) with preserved viability and antibacterial activity. Four types of beads, containing entrapped (E), surface and entrapped (ES), surface (S) and concentrated surface and entrapped lactobacilli (C(ES)) were prepared and physically characterized. The antibacterial activity of lactobacilli cultures before and after immobilization, freeze-drying and throughout storage was studied in relationship to the viable number of lactobacilli. Multi-resistant clinical isolates (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycine-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, VIM-2-metalo-beta-lactamase producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa and CTX-M-15-beta-lactamase producing strains: Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were used as indicator strains. Alginate beads in which lactobacilli proliferated to the beads surface (ES and C(ES)) differed significantly from the other types of beads in their physicochemical properties, showing smoother surface morphology, more spherical shape, bigger weight, lower calcium content, density and crushing force. Lactobacilli cultures, at high cell concentrations (10(8)cfu/ml) were active against both Gram-positive and negative multi-resistant bacteria. Beads containing both entrapped and surface lactobacilli (ES) resulted in viability and antibacterial activity most similar to non-processed lactobacilli cultures. The viability and antibacterial activity of the immobilized lactobacilli remained stable after 6 months storage.
TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum DSM 2648 is a potential probiotic that enhances intestinal barrier function.
AB  - The aim of this research was to identify bacterial isolates having the potential  to improve intestinal barrier function. Lactobacillus plantarum strains and human oral isolates were screened for their ability to enhance tight junction integrity as measured by the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) assay. Eight commercially used probiotics were compared to determine which had the greatest positive effect on TEER, and the best-performing probiotic strain, Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001, was used as a benchmark to evaluate the isolates. One isolate, L. plantarum DSM 2648, was selected for further study because it increased TEER 135% more than L. rhamnosus HN001. The ability of L. plantarum DSM 2648 to tolerate gastrointestinal conditions and adhere to intestinal cells was determined, and L. plantarum DSM 2648 performed better than L. rhamnosus HN001 in all the assays. Lactobacillus plantarum DSM 2648 was able to reduce the negative effect of Escherichia coli [enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC)] O127:H6 (E2348/69) on TEER and adherence by as much as 98.75% and 80.18%, respectively, during simultaneous or prior coculture compared with EPEC incubation alone. As yet, the precise mechanism associated with the positive effects exerted by L. plantarum DSM 2648 are unknown, and may influence its use to improve human health and wellness.
TI  - Cloning, expression, purification, and activity assay of proteins related to D-lactic acid formation in Lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  - Two proteins that might be responsible for D-lactic acid (D-LA) formation were screened from the genome database of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The coding genes of the two proteins in L. rhamnosus CASL, ldhD1 and ldhD2, were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta with an inducible expression vector pETDuet-1 (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany), respectively. The two purified proteins, LdhD-1 and LdhD-2, migrated as a single protein band separately, both corresponding to an apparent molecular mass between 35 kDa and 45 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The specific activities of LdhD-1 and LdhD-2 catalyzing pyruvate to LA were 0.02 U/mg and 0.21 U/mg, respectively. The configuration of LA converted from pyruvate was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with a chiral column. Only D-LA was detected when LdhD-1 and LdhD-2 were tested. In summary, the two proteins cloned and expressed in this study were most probably responsible for D-LA formation during fermentation of L. rhamnosus CASL.
TI  - Tipsitis: incidence and outcome-a single centre experience.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Infection of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPSS) called 'Tipsitis' has been reported but appears unusual. We report here our experience of patients who were diagnosed to have Tipsitis at our centre. METHODS: Retrospective single centre study. Patients identified from a dedicated data base. Patients with TIPSS with otherwise unexplained sustained bacteraemia were included. RESULTS: Over 14 years of age, of 785 patients with TIPSS, eight (1%) had Tipsitis. Indication for TIPSS: variceal bleed, seven; refractory ascites, one. Child-Pugh score: 8.3 (1.4). Seven patients had overlapping stents in situ. Duration to Tipsitis: 21.6 (7.1) months. At diagnosis, TIPSS was occluded in four and patent in three. Tipsitis developed within 2 weeks of shunt interventions in two patients and was owing to development of bilio-venous fistula in one. The organisms identified were: Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcusfaecium and Staphylococcus aureus. Median duration of antibiotic therapy: 3 (0.3-3) months. Symptoms initially resolved in all but one. Symptoms recurred in three and this was related to premature cessation of antibiotics in two. Five patients died at a median 1.3 (0.3 to 33) months after Tipsitis with Tipsitis contributing to death in three. CONCLUSION: Tipsitis is a rare but serious problem. It should be suspected in patients with TIPSS and unexplained sustained bacteraemia. Shunt interventions, where TIPSS is inserted for variceal bleed, and use of overlapping shunts at TIPSS insertion may be risk factors for its development. Prolonged antibiotics are usually required but Tipsitis may recur despite apparently successful treatment.
TI  - Probiotics and intestinal colonization by vancomycin-resistant enterococci in mice and humans.
AB  - We investigated the impact of probiotics on the intestinal carriage of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lcr35 but not Escherichia coli Nissle reduced, although not significantly, the density of VRE colonization in a murine model. No effect of Lcr35 was observed in a double-blind placebo randomized study, involving nine patients.
TI  - Lactobacillus by-products inhibit the growth and virulence of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.
AB  - Uropathogenic strains of Escherichia coli (UPEC) can colonize the vagina and cause infections within the entire urogenital tract, including those associated with urinary tract devices. Lactobacilli typically dominate the vaginal microbiota in healthy women, and studies have shown that they can inhibit UPEC growth and vaginal colonization. However, little is known regarding the mechanisms behind these effects. Using a luciferase-based reporter construct, gradients of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide and spent culture supernatants (SCS) from urogenital probiotic strains Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri RC-14 were examined for their effects on growth and virulence factor expression in UPEC isolate C1212. In a dose- and pH- dependent manner, lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide and Lactobacillus SCS all strongly inhibited UPEC C1212 growth and increased the promoter activity of outer membrane proteins (OMPs) A and X, two porins normally upregulated in response to UPEC membrane stress. Lactic acid and the culture supernatants also downregulated the promoter activity of the major subunits of type 1 and P fimbriae, critical adherence factors within the urogenital tract. Our findings indicate that compounds secreted by lactobacilli likely protect the urogenital tract from UPEC colonization and infection by inhibiting growth, inducing stress and downregulating proteins critical for host attachment.
TI  - High-level expression of heme-dependent catalase gene katA from Lactobacillus Sakei protects Lactobacillus rhamnosus from oxidative stress.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are generally sensitive to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), Lactobacillus sakei YSI8 is one of the very few LAB strains able to degrade H(2)O(2) through the action of a heme-dependent catalase. Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains are very important probiotic starter cultures in meat product fermentation, but they are deficient in catalase. In this study, the effect of heterologous expression of L. sakei catalase gene katA in L. rhamnosus on its oxidative stress resistance was tested. The recombinant L. rhamnosus AS 1.2466 was able to decompose H(2)O(2) and the catalase activity reached 2.85 mumol H(2)O(2)/min/10(8) c.f.u. Furthermore, the expression of the katA gene in L. rhamnosus conferred enhanced oxidative resistance on the host. The survival ratios after short-term H(2)O(2) challenge were increased 600 and 10(4)-fold at exponential and stationary phase, respectively. Further, viable cells were 100-fold higher in long-term aerated cultures. Simulation experiment demonstrated that both growth and catalase activity of recombinant L. rhamnosus displayed high stability under environmental conditions similar to those encountered during sausage fermentation.
TI  - Probiotics for maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis in adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate evidence for probiotic efficacy for maintaining remission  of ulcerative colitis (UC) in adults. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search (1948-November 2009) was conducted using ulcerative colitis and probiotics as terms for identifying pertinent studies. Search limits included English language and humans. Additional information was obtained from bibliographies. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Prospective trials published in English and conducted in adults were included. Two open-label and 3 double-blind randomized trials evaluated probiotic efficacy for maintaining remission of UC. Clinical and surrogate markers for maintaining remission of UC were assessed. DATA SYNTHESIS: A relationship between immune response and gastrointestinal microbials appears to be involved in the mechanism of UC. Trial results comparing the probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 to mesalazine have reported equivalent rates of UC relapse. Treatment with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG strain alone or in combination with mesalazine resulted in a nonsignificant odds ratio decrease for relapse and a significant increase in time to relapse compared to treatment with mesalazine alone. Additionally, bifidobacteria-fermented milk-supplemented patients had significant reductions in UC exacerbations when compared to nonsupplemented patients. Probiotics were well tolerated, with adverse event rates similar between treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Studies evaluating probiotics for maintaining remission of UC are limited by trial design and use of different probiotics with variable bacterial contents. Thus, questions remain regarding optimal probiotic, dosing, specific patient populations, and placement in therapy. To answer these questions, large, randomized, controlled trials need to be conducted before probiotics can be routinely recommended for maintaining remission of UC.
TI  - Mucosal adhesion properties of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG SpaCBA and SpaFED pilin subunits.
AB  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG is a well-established Gram-positive probiotic strain,  whose health-benefiting properties are dependent in part on prolonged residence in the gastrointestinal tract and are likely dictated by adherence to the intestinal mucosa. Previously, we identified two pilus gene clusters (spaCBA and spaFED) in the genome of this probiotic bacterium, each of which contained the predicted genes for three pilin subunits and a single sortase. We also confirmed the presence of SpaCBA pili on the cell surface and attributed an intestinal mucus-binding capacity to one of the pilin subunits (SpaC). Here, we report cloning of the remaining pilin genes (spaA, spaB, spaD, spaE, and spaF) in Escherichia coli, production and purification of the recombinant proteins, and assessment of the adherence of these proteins to human intestinal mucus. Our findings indicate that the SpaB and SpaF pilin subunits also exhibit substantial binding to mucus, which can be inhibited competitively in a dose-related manner. Moreover, the binding between the SpaB pilin subunit and the mucosal substrate appears to operate through electrostatic contacts and is not related to a recognized mucus-binding domain. We conclude from these results that it is conceivable that two pilin subunits (SpaB and SpaC) in the SpaCBA pilus fiber play a role in binding to intestinal mucus, but for the uncharacterized and putative SpaFED pilus fiber only a single pilin subunit (SpaF) is potentially responsible for adhesion to mucus.
TI  - Lactobacilli prevent hydroxy radical production and inhibit Escherichia coli and  Enterococcus growth in system mimicking colon fermentation.
AB  - AIMS: To explore the effect of Lactobacillus on redox state of colon chyme. METHODS AND RESULTS: Nine Lactobacillus strains were studied for the inhibition of lipid peroxide formation in Fe(2+)/ascorbate system and for their ability to chelate 'free' ferrous ion. The result shows both properties were strain specific and no relationship between them was found. Both properties of Lactobacillus paracasei Fn032, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and Lactobacillus sp. Fn001 were successively decreasing. LGG and Fn032 significantly decreased hydroxyl radicals (P < 0.01) in colonic fermentation model, in which considerable hydroxyl radicals occurred spontaneously. Addition of ferrous ion induced the production of hydroxyl radicals, which could be significantly inhibited by LGG, Fn032 (P < 0.01) and Fn001 (P < 0.05). Ferrous ion significantly induced the growth of Enterococcus and Escherichia coli, which could be inhibited by all three Lactobacillus strains. Escherichia coli and Enterococcus show significantly positive correlation with hydroxyl radicals with R of 0.96 (P = 0.0002) and 0.91 (P = 0.0017), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Antioxidative Lactobacillus could modulate redox state in colonic fermentation system, which is related to their free radical-scavenging ability or antibacterial effect. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study proves that Lactobacillus strain could influence the redox state of gut chyme. Evaluation of antioxidative ability might be a powerful method for screening probiotic Lactobacillus strains.
TI  - Effect of probiotic bacterial strains of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Enterococcus on enteroaggregative Escherichia coli.
AB  - The effects of nine probiotic strains of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Enterococcus on the growth, adhesion activity, and biofilm formation of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAggEC) were examined. The culture supernatant of the E. faecium strain, with or without pH adjustment to a neutral pH, had a strong bactericidal effect on EAggEC, including induction of membrane damage and cell lysis. Supernatants of the L. casei ss. casei and L. casei ss. rhamnosus strains also had a bactericidal effect on EAggEC, but this activity was abolished by pH adjustment to a neutral pH. No inhibitory effect of the culture supernatants of Bifidobacterium or E. faecalis strains was detected. Adhesion of EAggEC to intestinal epithelial cells was not inhibited by the bacterial strains tested. Two strains of L. casei enhanced EAggEC biofilm formation, which was characterized by increased bacterial proliferation. These results suggest that the three different bacterial species; Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Enterococcus, have different effects on EAggEC, and that further analysis is required for the practical use of these bacteria as probiotics against EAggEC infection.
TI  - Systematic review of randomised controlled trials: probiotics for functional constipation.
AB  - AIM: To systematically evaluate and update evidence on the efficacy and safety of probiotic supplementation for the treatment of constipation. METHODS: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases were searched in May 2009 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) performed in paediatric or adult populations related to the study aim. RESULTS: We included five RCTs with a total of 377 subjects (194 in the experimental group and 183 in the control group). The participants were adults (three RCTs, n = 266) and children (two RCTs, n = 111) with constipation. In adults, data suggests a favourable effect of treatment with Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010, Lactobacillus casei Shirota, and Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 on defecation frequency and stool consistency. In children, L. casei rhamnosus Lcr35, but not L. rhamnosus GG, showed a beneficial effect. CONCLUSION: Until more data are available, we believe the use of probiotics for the treatment of constipation condition should be considered investigational.
TI  - Differential induction of apoptosis in human colonic carcinoma cells (Caco-2) by  Atopobium, and commensal, probiotic and enteropathogenic bacteria: mediation by the mitochondrial pathway.
AB  - The induction of apoptosis in mammalian cells by bacteria is well reported. This  process may assist infection by pathogens whereas for non-pathogens apoptosis induction within carcinoma cells protects against colon cancer. Here, apoptosis induction by a major new gut bacterium, Atopobium minutum, was compared with induction by commensal (Escherichia coli K-12 strains), probiotic (Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium latis) and pathogenic (E. coli: EPEC and VTEC) gut bacteria within the colon cancer cell line, Caco-2. The results show a major apoptotic effect for the pathogens, mild effects for the probiotic strains and A. minutum, but no effect for commensal E. coli. The mild apoptotic effects observed are consistent with the beneficial roles of probotics in protection against colon cancer and suggest, for the first time, that A. minutum possesses similar advantageous, anti-cancerous activity. Although bacterial infection increased Caco-2 membrane FAS levels, caspase-8 was not activated indicating that apoptosis is FAS independent. Instead, in all cases, apoptosis was induced through the mitochondrial pathway as indicated by BAX translocation, cytochrome c release, and caspase-9 and -3 cleavage. This suggests that an intracellular stimulus initiates the observed apoptosis responses.
TI  - In vitro effects of food extracts on selected probiotic and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - A panel of 148 extracts from 37 food products was prepared using organic and aqueous solvents and both neutral and acidic conditions. The panel of food products tested included fruits, vegetables, grains, herbs and spices, most of which are common in a normal European-style diet. The impact of these extracts on the growth of selected probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacteria lactis) and pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli 0157:H7 and Escherichia coli LF82) was assessed using a standard minimum inhibitory concentration method. The results showed that aqueous extractions of garlic and black peppercorns significantly enhanced the growth of one strain of probiotic bacteria (L. reuteri) whilst inhibiting both pathogenic strains of E. coli at a 1:50 dilution. Aqueous extracts of banana, apple and orange all enhanced the growth of the three probiotic strains significantly, and inhibited the pathogens to approximately 80% of the controls (not significant). Both aqueous and organic extractions of ginger significantly inhibited the growth of one or both E. coli strains, respectively (also at the 1:50 dilution).
TI  - Comparison of in vitro models to study bacterial adhesion to the intestinal epithelium.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the adhesion ability of intestinal bacteria to different in vitro models of intestinal epithelia, and to estimate the suitability of these models and the type of interactions involved. METHODS AND RESULTS: The adhesion of probiotic (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bb12), commensal (B. animalis IATA-A2 and B. bifidum IATA-ES2) and potentially pathogenic bacteria (E. coli and L. monocytogenes) was determined. The adhesion models used were polycarbonate-well plates, with or without mucin, and different configurations of Caco-2 and/or HT29-MTX cell cultures. All bacteria adhered to wells without mucin (2.6-27.3%), the values being highly variable depending on the bacterial strain. Adhesion percentages of potentially probiotic bacteria to Caco-2 cultures were remarkably lower (P < 0.05) than those to mucin, and more similar to those of pathogenic strains. The lowest adhesion of different bacterial strains was detected on HT29-MTX (0.5-2.3%) cultures and Caco-2/HT29-MTX (0.6-3.2%) cocultures, while these values were increased in Caco-2 cultures plus mucin. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that bacterial strains exhibit different capacities to adhere to cellular components and several types of mucin present in different models, showing preferences for intestinal MUC2. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The use of Caco-2 cells monolayer plus mucin (type II) better approaches the physiological characteristics of in vivo situation, providing a reliable and suitable in vitro model to evaluate bacterial adhesion.
TI  - Effects of enteropathogenic bacteria & lactobacilli on chemokine secretion & Toll like receptor gene expression in two human colonic epithelial cell lines.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: The intestinal epithelium is part of the innate immune system responding to contact with pathogenic or commensal bacteria. The objective of this study was to compare innate responses of intestinal epithelial cell lines to pathogenic bacteria and to lactobacilli. METHODS: Two human intestinal epithelial cell lines, HT29 (enterocyte-like) and T84 (crypt-like), were exposed to pathogenic bacteria representative of non invasive (Vibrio cholerae O1 and O139), adherent (enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli, EHEC) or invasive (Salmonella Typhimurium and Shigella flexneri) phenotypes and to non pathogenic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG or Lactobacillus plantarum. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) was measured in culture supernatant by ELISA, while mRNA from cells was subjected to quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR for several other chemokines (CXCL1, CCL5 and CXCL5) and for Toll-like receptors (TLR) 2, 4, 5 and 9. RESULTS: V. cholerae, S. Typhimurium, S. flexneri and EHEC induced IL-8 secretion from epithelial cells into the medium. Salmonella, Shigella and EHEC, but not V. cholerae, significantly increased mRNA expression of CXCL1. None of the pathogens induced CCL5 or CXCL5. Salmonella and Vibrio significantly increased TLR4 expression, while Vibrio and EHEC decreased TLR5 expression. EHEC also decreased TLR9 expression. Lactobacilli attenuated the IL-8 response of the cell lines to V. cholerae, Salmonella, and EHEC but did not significantly change the IL-8 response to Shigella. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Distinct patterns of epithelial cell chemokine responses were induced by the bacterial pathogens studied and these were modulated by commensal lactobacilli. Alterations in TLR expression by these pathogens are likely to be important in pathogenesis.
TI  - Evaluation of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG using an Escherichia coli K88 model of piglet diarrhoea: Effects on diarrhoea incidence, faecal microflora and immune responses.
AB  - Probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) has been demonstrated to adhere to pig intestinal mucus, and is able to displace and inhibit pathogens, including Escherichia coli (E. coli), in vitro. However, currently there are few data concerning the effects of LGG on piglet health. The objectives of this study were to assess the effectiveness of LGG in reducing the incidence and severity of post-weaning diarrhoea in piglets, and to investigate its mechanisms of action. Eighteen weaned barrows were allocated to nonchallenged control (NCN), challenged control (CCN) and LGG treatment (LGG) groups. Diarrhoea incidence was significantly lower in group LGG than group CCN after E. coli challenge. Faecal coliform bacteria counts were significantly increased, while lactobacilli and bifidobacteria counts were decreased, in group CCN compared with the other groups after challenge. In the jejunum and ileum, secretory immunoglobin A (SIgA) concentrations were significantly higher in group LGG than in group CCN. In group LGG, administration of short-term LGG before E. coli infection attenuated the elevation of serum IL-6 induced by E. coli. Significantly higher concentrations of TNF-alpha were observed in group LGG than NCN and CCN at 6h. IL-1beta concentrations in group NCN were significantly higher than LGG at 6h and higher than CCN at 24h. In conclusion, LGG was effective in ameliorating diarrhoea in post-weaning piglets induced by E. coli K88, possibly via modulation of intestinal microflora, enhancement of intestinal antibody defence, and regulation of production of systemic inflammatory cytokines.
TI  - Sudan azo dyes and Para Red degradation by prevalent bacteria of the human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - Sudan azo dyes have genotoxic effects and ingestion of food products contaminated with Sudan I, II, III, IV, and Para Red could lead to exposure in the human gastrointestinal tract. In this study, we examined thirty-five prevalent species of human intestinal bacteria to evaluate their capacity to degrade Sudan dyes and Para Red. Among these tested bacterial strains, 23, 13, 33, 30, and 29 out of 35 species tested were able to reduce Sudan I, II, III, IV, and Para Red, respectively, to some extent. Bifidobacterium infantis, Clostridium indolis, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Ruminococcus obeum were able to reduce completely all four tested Sudan dyes and Para Red. Escherichia coli and Peptostreptococcus magnus were the only two strains that were not able to reduce any of the tested Sudan dyes and Para Red to any significant extent. Metabolites of the reduction of the tested Sudan dyes and Para Red by E. faecalis were isolated and identified by HPLC and LC/ESI-MS analyses and compared with authentic standards. Thus it appears that the ability to reduce Sudan dyes and Para Red except Sudan II is common among bacteria in the human colon.
TI  - A randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of lactobacillus GG in infantile diarrhea.
AB  - In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 229 infants hospitalized for acute diarrhea in rural India were given a 10-day course of Lactobacillus rhammosus GG (minimum dose, 10 degrees bacteria) or placebo. There was no difference in groups in the duration of diarrhea or numbers of stool on days 3, 6, or 10 of treatment.
TI  - Coaggregation between probiotic bacteria and caries-associated strains: an in vitro study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the in vitro abilities of probiotic bacteria derived from  consumer products to coaggregate with caries-associated mutans streptococci. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Six lactobacillus strains (L. acidophilus (CCUG 5917), L. plantarum 299v, L. rhamnosus GG and LB21, L. paracasei F19, L. reuteri PTA5289) were cultivated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees C in Man Rogosa Sharpe (MSB) broth for 24 h. Four strains of human streptococci (S. mutans Ingbritt, S. mutans (ATCC 25175), S. mutans GS-5, S. sobrinus (ATCC 33478) were similarly grown in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth. A gastrointestinal pathogen (Escherichia coli) was aerobically cultivated on BHI broth as a positive control. After incubation, the bacteria were aerobically harvested, washed, and suspended in 10 mmol/l phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2). The probiotic strains were characterized with the API 50 CH system to confirm their identity. Coaggregation was determined by spectrophotometry in mixtures and bacterial suspensions alone after 1, 2, 4, and 24 h and expressed as the aggregation ratio (%). RESULTS: All probiotic strains showed coaggregation abilities with the oral pathogens and the results were strain specific and dependent on time. S. mutans GS-5 exhibited a significantly higher ability to coaggregate with all the probiotic strains than the other mutans streptococci and E. coli. The differences among the probiotic strains were modest with L. acidophilus being the most prone and L. rhamnosus LB21 the least prone to coaggregate with the oral streptococci. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated different abilities of lactobacilli-derived probiotic bacteria to coaggregate with selected oral streptococci. Aggregation assays may be a useful complement for screening of probiotic candidates with possible anti-caries properties.
TI  - Probiotics prevent enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7-mediated inhibition of interferon-gamma-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-1.
AB  - Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 inhibits interferon (IFN)-gamma-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1 in epithelial cells. We determined the effects of probiotics on EHEC-mediated disruption of IFN-gamma-stimulated STAT-1 activation in epithelial cell lines. Confluent Intestine 407, HEp-2 and Caco-2 epithelial cells were pre-treated (3 h) with either probiotics or surface-layer proteins derived from Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 prior to infection with EHEC O157:H7 strain CL56 (m.o.i. 100:1, 6 h, 37 degrees C in 5% CO2). Subsequently, cells were washed and stimulated with human recombinant IFN-gamma (50 ng ml(-1), 0.5 h, 37 degrees C) followed by whole-cell protein extraction and immunoblotting for tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT-1. Relative to uninfected cells, STAT-1-activation was reduced after EHEC O157:H7 infection. Pre-incubation with the probiotic L. helveticus R0052 followed by EHEC infection abrogated pathogen-mediated disruption of IFN-gamma-STAT-1 signalling. As determined using Transwell inserts, probiotic-mediated protection was independent of epithelial cell contact. In contrast, pre-incubation with boiled L. helveticus R0052, an equal concentration of viable Lactobacillus rhamnosus R0011, or surface-layer proteins (0.14 mg ml(-1)) did not restore STAT-1 signalling in EHEC-infected cells. The viable probiotic agent L. helveticus R0052 prevented EHEC O157:H7-mediated subversion of epithelial cell signal transduction responses.
TI  - Reduced expression of basal and probiotic-inducible G-CSF in intestinal mononuclear cells is associated with inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in the hematopoiesis of granulocytes, neuroprotection, and immunomodulation. Previously, we have shown that probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 induces G-CSF production from bone marrow-derived macrophages. Whether this probiotic also induces G-CSF in intestinal mononuclear cells is unknown. METHODS: G-CSF release in response to L. rhamnosus GR-1 was analyzed in isolated intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and non-IBD patients. The effects of G-CSF on proinflammatory cytokine production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and intestinal tissue from C57BL/6 wildtype and G-CSF receptor knockout mice was examined. RESULTS: Normal mouse or human intestinal lamina propria cells constitutively express high levels of G-CSF, of which production was further enhanced by exogenous L. rhamnosus GR-1. However, cells obtained from IBD patients showed reduced G-CSF production under basal conditions and also lower production after exogenous GR-1 treatments. Intestinal tissue samples isolated from G-CSF receptor-deficient mice constitutively expressed higher levels of TNFalpha, IL-23, and IL-12 than those from wildtype mice, and pretreatment of G-CSF suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IL-23 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that high G-CSF production induced by commensals such as L. rhamnosus is important in maintaining normal immunological homeostasis in the intestine and defects in the production of G-CSF are associated with IBD.
TI  - Effects of probiotic bacteria and their genomic DNA on TH1/TH2-cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy and allergic subjects.
AB  - Among the factors potentially involved in the increased prevalence of allergic diseases, modification of the intestinal flora or lack of microbial exposure during childhood has been proposed. T(H)2-cytokines increase the production of IgE and stimulate mast cells and eosinophils, whereas T(H)1-cytokines, such as IFN-gamma, may suppress IgE synthesis and stimulate the expression of the secretory piece of IgA. Thus, a dysregulation in the expression of T(H)1- and T(H)2-cytokines may contribute to the initiation and maintenance of allergic diseases. Lactobacilli belonging to the natural intestinal microflora were reported to reduce the incidence of atopic dermatitis and the severity of allergic manifestations and to modulate T(H)1/T(H)2 responses. The mechanisms still remain to be elucidated. We sought to assess the effect of different probiotics, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus gasseri (PA16/8), Bifidobacterium bifidum (MP20/5), and Bifidobacterium longum (SP07/3), on the T(H)1 and T(H)2 responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy subjects and from patients with allergy against house dust mite to Staphylococcus enterotoxin A (SEA) and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dpt). To elucidate the molecular basis of these effects, the effects of bacterial genomic DNA were compared with the effects of viable bacteria. PBMCs from allergic patients and from healthy donors were incubated for 24 or 48 h, respectively, with or without SEA and Dpt allergens. The effects of preincubation with live probiotic bacteria and the effect of their genomic DNA, added simultaneously to cultures and incubated for 24h, were assessed by measuring T(H)1/T(H)2-cytokine production. The tested live Gram-positive probiotic bacteria and their genomic DNA inhibited SEA- and Dpt-stimulated secretion of T(H)2-cytokines (IL-4 and IL-5) and enhanced the stimulation of IFN-gamma. This effect was dose-dependent with a dosage-optimum, which was identical for all lactic acid producing bacteria (LAB) tested (10 bacteria per PBMC) and their DNA (75 ng/ml). Based on the maximal effects achieved with LAB and their DNA, more than 50% of the effects seem to be contributed by DNA. No significant effect was induced by the control, Gram-negative Escherichia coli TG1. Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria reduced SEA-stimulated IL-4 and IL-5 production more effectively in PBMCs from healthy subjects than from allergic patients. In contrast to this, inhibition of Dpt-stimulated IL-4- and IL-5-secretion was more pronounced in cells from allergic subjects. Compared with living LAB, bacterial DNA inhibited IL-4- and IL-5-secretion in a similar manner. SEA- and even more so Dpt-stimulated IFN-gamma stimulation by living LAB was less pronounced in allergic than in healthy subjects, whereas IFN-gamma stimulation by their DNA was more pronounced in allergic subjects. The tested probiotic bacteria as well as their genomic DNA modulated the T(H)1/T(H)2 response to some allergens dose-dependently. DNA seems to contribute to 50% of the effect exerted by living bacteria in this in vitro model. The magnitude of the probiotic effects differed between healthy and allergic subjects. Whether the modulation found for the tested strains might be useful for the prevention and treatment of allergic diseases has to be assessed in clinical trials.
TI  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus casei suppress Escherichia coli-induced chemokine expression in intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, some strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been reported to prevent the development of atopic dermatitis and to improve allergic symptoms, especially in young children. However, the mechanisms involved in these effects are not fully understood. Intestinal microbiota play critical roles in the development of host immune development and are recognized and regulated by the host through intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). We thus hypothesized that LAB influence the host immune system through the activation of IECs. To begin testing this hypothesis, chemokine expression in IECs exposed to intestinal bacteria was investigated. METHODS: Caco-2 cell monolayers were stimulated with different concentrations of various live or heat-killed intestinal bacteria or bacterial components for up to 3 h. Changes in the gene expressions of various chemokines were measured using quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: The expressions of CCL20, CXCL8, CXCL10 and CX3CL1 were strongly induced by nonpathogenic Escherichia coli in a dose-dependent manner and were partially induced by some commensal LAB. In contrast, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and Lactobacillus casei did not induce these chemokine expressions. In addition, LGG significantly suppressed the expressions of CCL20 and CXCL10 induced by E. coli, peptidoglycan or flagellin when cultured simultaneously. CONCLUSIONS: LGG and L. casei markedly suppressed E. coli-induced chemokine expression, presumably through the suppression of the Toll-like receptor-mediated signal transduction pathway, at least in part. The clinical importance of this suppressive effect and the mechanisms involved require further investigation; however, such effects can be used as a marker to identify clinically useful LAB.
TI  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus L60, a potential probiotic isolated from the human vagina.
AB  - The vagina has been increasingly viewed as an "ecosystem" whose normal microflora help protect it from invading pathogens, including those that cause urinary tract infections and sexually transmitted diseases. We tested new strains of lactobacilli as potential probiotics for maintenance of urogenital tract health, as well as prevention and therapy of urogenital infections. A strain of lactobacilli isolated from the vagina of nonpregnant, healthy, premenopausal women was identified as Lactobacillus rhamnosus L60 by 16S rDNA sequence homology. L60 was evaluated for antimicrobial activity, in vitro antibiotic resistance, autoaggregation, surface hydrophobicity, co-aggregation with other bacterial species, hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) production, and bacterial adherence. It displayed a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against urogenital pathogens, and resistance to antibiotics commonly prescribed for infections caused by these pathogens. L60 produced H(2)O(2), adhered to vaginal epithelial cells, co-aggregated with Escherichia coli and Candida albicans, and displayed self-aggregation. In view of these characteristics, L60 is considered a potential probiotic, and will be further evaluated for preventive and therapeutic application locally in the vaginal tract.
TI  - Antibacterial action of selenium-enriched probiotics against pathogenic Escherichia coli.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory activity of selenium-enriched probiotics against pathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) in vitro and in vivo. Escherichia coli was co-cultured in vitro with each probiotic strain individually, and a mixture of the four strains and its population was counted at various time points. We also collected a cell-free culture supernatant (CFCS) of each probiotic strain and the four-strain mix to examine their antibacterial activity, using the cylinder plate method. Results demonstrated that co-culture with probiotics significantly reduced the number of E. coli. The different sizes of the inhibition zones made by each CFCS proved that E. coli was inhibited by the metabolites of the probiotics. In vivo, Kunming mice were allocated to different groups supplemented with selenium-enriched and other probiotics. After 28 days, the mice were inoculated with pathogenic E. coli so that we could compare mortality rates and inspect other indexes of each treatment. The mortality of the group with selenium-enriched probiotics was the lowest. In addition, the organic antioxidant status improved, immunity was fortified, and the internal environment of the intestinal tract was enhanced with selenium-enriched probiotic supplementation. In conclusion, selenium-enriched probiotics can strongly antagonize pathogenic E. coli in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics.
AB  - According to the German definition, probiotics are defined viable microorganisms, sufficient amounts of which reach the intestine in an active state and thus exert positive health effects. Numerous probiotic microorganisms (e.g. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. reuteri, bifidobacteria and certain strains of L. casei or the L. acidophilus-group) are used in probiotic food, particularly fermented milk products, or have been investigated--as well as Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917, certain enterococci (Enterococcus faecium SF68) and the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii--with regard to their medicinal use. Among the numerous purported health benefits attributed to probiotic bacteria, the (transient) modulation of the intestinal microflora of the host and the capacity to interact with the immune system directly or mediated by the autochthonous microflora, are basic mechanisms. They are supported by an increasing number of in vitro and in vivo experiments using conventional and molecular biologic methods. In addition to these, a limited number of randomized, well-controlled human intervention trials have been reported. Well-established probiotic effects are: 1. Prevention and/or reduction of duration and complaints of rotavirus-induced or antibiotic-associated diarrhea as well as alleviation of complaints due to lactose intolerance. 2. Reduction of the concentration of cancer-promoting enzymes and/or putrefactive (bacterial) metabolites in the gut. 3. Prevention and alleviation of unspecific and irregular complaints of the gastrointestinal tracts in healthy people. 4. Beneficial effects on microbial aberrancies, inflammation and other complaints in connection with: inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, Helicobacter pylori infection or bacterial overgrowth. 5. Normalization of passing stool and stool consistency in subjects suffering from obstipation or an irritable colon. 6. Prevention or alleviation of allergies and atopic diseases in infants. 7. Prevention of respiratory tract infections (common cold, influenza) and other infectious diseases as well as treatment of urogenital infections. Insufficient or at most preliminary evidence exists with respect to cancer prevention, a so-called hypocholesterolemic effect, improvement of the mouth flora and caries prevention or prevention or therapy of ischemic heart diseases or amelioration of autoimmune diseases (e.g. arthritis). A prebiotic is "a selectively fermented ingredient that allows specific changes, both in the composition and/or activity in the gastrointestinal microflora that confers benefits upon host well being and health", whereas synergistic combinations of pro- and prebiotics are called synbiotics. Today, only bifidogenic, non-digestible oligosaccharides (particularly inulin, its hydrolysis product oligofructose, and (trans)galactooligosaccharides), fulfill all the criteria for prebiotic classification. They are dietary fibers with a well-established positive impact on the intestinal microflora. Other health effects of prebiotics (prevention of diarrhoea or obstipation, modulation of the metabolism of the intestinal flora, cancer prevention, positive effects on lipid metabolism, stimulation of mineral adsorption and immunomodulatory properties) are indirect, i.e. mediated by the intestinal microflora, and therefore less-well proven. In the last years, successful attempts have been reported to make infant formula more breast milk-like by the addition of fructo- and (primarily) galactooligosaccharides.
TI  - The potential influence of fruit polyphenols on colonic microflora and human gut  health.
AB  - The effect of common dietary polyphenols on growth of human gut bacteria and their adhesion to enterocytes was investigated. The influence on the growth of a probiotic (Lactobacillus rhamnosus), a commensal (Escherichia coli) and two pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium) was determined, together with effects on adhesion of pathogenic and probiotic bacteria to cultured Caco-2 cells. All polyphenols, except rutin, were found to affect the viability of representative gut flora in vitro, at doses likely to be present in the gastrointestinal tract, but to differing degrees. Naringenin and quercetin were the most active with the lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations for all the four bacteria tested. The remaining polyphenols had the most marked effect on the Gram positive enteropathogen S. aureus. Naringenin and phloridzin were the most effective inhibitors of S. typhimurium adherence to Caco-2 enterocytes while phloridzin and rutin enhanced the adherence of the probiotic L. rhamnosus. Polyphenols appear to have potential to alter gut microecology and, by affecting the total number of beneficial microflora in the gut, may confer positive gut health benefits.
TI  - Characterization and site-directed mutagenesis of Wzb, an O-phosphatase from Lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reversible phosphorylation events within a polymerisation complex have been proposed to modulate capsular polysaccharide synthesis in Streptococcus pneumoniae. Similar phosphatase and kinase genes are present in the exopolysaccharide (EPS) biosynthesis loci of numerous lactic acid bacteria genomes. RESULTS: The protein sequence deduced from the wzb gene in Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 9595 reveals four motifs of the polymerase and histidinol phosphatase (PHP) superfamily of prokaryotic O-phosphatases. Native and modified His-tag fusion Wzb proteins were purified from Escherichia coli cultures. Extracts showed phosphatase activity towards tyrosine-containing peptides. The purified fusion protein Wzb was active on p-nitrophenyl-phosphate (pNPP), with an optimal activity in presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA 1%) at pH 7.3 and a temperature of 75 degrees C. At 50 degrees C, residual activity decreased to 10 %. Copper ions were essential for phosphatase activity, which was significantly increased by addition of cobalt. Mutated fusion Wzb proteins exhibited reduced phosphatase activity on p-nitrophenyl-phosphate. However, one variant (C6S) showed close to 20% increase in phosphatase activity. CONCLUSION: These characteristics reveal significant differences with the manganese-dependent CpsB protein tyrosine phosphatase described for Streptococcus pneumoniae as well as with the polysaccharide-related phosphatases of Gram negative bacteria.
TI  - The effect of probiotics and organic acids on Shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.
AB  - Probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. Shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for STEC. Shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome. STEC possesses Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1) and Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2), both of which have A and B subunits. Although STEC containing both Stx1 and Stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, Stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. Thus, the effect of Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, and Bifidobacterium strains on stx2A expression levels in STEC was investigated. Lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included L. rhamnosus GG, L. curvatus, L. plantarum, L. jensenii, L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. reuteri, P. acidilactici, P. cerevisiae, P. pentosaceus, B. thermophilum, B. boum, B. suis and B. animalis. E. coli O157:H7 (EDL 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. Following RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, relative stx2A mRNA levels were determined according to a comparative critical threshold (Ct) real-time PCR. Data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and the level of stx2A expression between treated and untreated STEC was compared. Observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2A was down-regulated, when compared to the control culture. Probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in pH, influenced stx2A gene expression.
TI  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG prevents enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7-induced changes in epithelial barrier function.
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 intimately attaches to intestinal epithelial monolayers and produces attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions. In addition, EHEC infection causes disruptions of intercellular tight junctions, leading to clinical sequelae that include acute diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and the hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Current therapy remains supportive since antibiotic therapy increases the risk of systemic complications. This study focused on the potential therapeutic effect of an alternative form of therapy, probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG, to attenuate EHEC-induced changes in paracellular permeability in polarized MDCK-I and T84 epithelial cell monolayers. Changes in epithelial cell morphology, electrical resistance, dextran permeability, and distribution and expression of claudin-1 and ZO-1 were assessed using phase-contrast, immunofluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy and macromolecular flux. This study demonstrated that pretreatment of polarized MDCK-I and T84 cells with the probiotic L. rhamnosus GG reduced morphological changes and diminished the number of A/E lesions induced in response to EHEC O157:H7 infection. With probiotic pretreatment there was corresponding attenuation of the EHEC-induced drop in electrical resistance and the increase in barrier permeability assays. In addition, L. rhamnosus GG protected epithelial monolayers against EHEC-induced redistribution of the claudin-1 and ZO-1 tight junction proteins. In contrast to the effects seen with the live probiotic, heat-inactivated L. rhamnosus GG had no effect on EHEC binding and A/E lesion formation or on disruption of the barrier function. Collectively, these findings provide in vitro evidence that treatment with the probiotic L. rhamnosus strain GG could prove to be an effective management treatment for preventing injury of the epithelial cell barrier induced by A/E bacterial enteropathogens.
TI  - Subtractive screening for probiotic properties of lactobacillus species from the  human gastrointestinal tract in the search for new probiotics.
AB  - In the search for new probiotics, 61 Lactobacillus spp. isolates, belonging to 12 species and isolated as dominant lactic acid bacteria from the feces of healthy humans, were subjected to a subtractive system of in vitro analyses, which included desirable and undesirable traits. Twenty-four isolates were able to grow in 2% bovine bile, of which 13 grew in acidified broth at pH 3.5 in acidified cysteine-containing MRS broth. Intrinsic resistance to certain antimicrobial agents (cefoxitin, metronidazole, vancomycin) was observed in most isolates, but atypical resistances to erythromycin, clindamycin, or tetracycline were also found in 5 strains. Undesirable traits such as alpha-chymotrypsin or N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activities were not detected, but low beta-glucuronidase and moderate beta-glucosidase activities were recorded in 2 strains. Two Lactobacillus gasseri and 2 Lactobacillus paracasei selected strains inhibited several intestinal pathogens in an agar spot test, including strains of Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus. They also adhered to human Caco-2 and HT-29 epithelial cells in a manner comparable to Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG, and were unable to degrade pig gastric mucin in a plate assay. Together, these results suggest these 4 strains to be good probiotic candidates, concluding that the subtractive screening devised in this work could be a valuable tool in large-scale surveys for probiotics.
TI  - Commensal bacteria modulate cullin-dependent signaling via generation of reactive oxygen species.
AB  - The resident prokaryotic microflora of the mammalian intestine influences diverse homeostatic functions of the gut, including regulation of cellular growth and immune responses; however, it is unknown how commensal prokaryotic organisms mechanistically influence eukaryotic signaling networks. We have shown that bacterial coculture with intestinal epithelial cells modulates ubiquitin-mediated degradation of important signaling intermediates, including beta-catenin and the NF-kappaB inhibitor IkappaB-alpha. Ubiquitination of these proteins as well as others is catalyzed by the SCF(betaTrCP) ubiquitin ligase, which itself requires regulated modification of the cullin-1 subunit by the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8. Here we show that epithelia contacted by enteric commensal bacteria in vitro and in vivo rapidly generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Bacterially induced ROS causes oxidative inactivation of the catalytic cysteine residue of Ubc12, the NEDD8-conjugating enzyme, resulting in complete but transient loss of cullin-1 neddylation and consequent effects on NF-kappaB and beta-catenin signaling. Our results demonstrate that commensal bacteria directly modulate a critical control point of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and suggest how enteric commensal bacterial flora influences the regulatory pathways of the mammalian intestinal epithelia.
TI  - Murine immunomodulation of IL-10 and IL-12 induced by new isolates from avian type 2 Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Several bacterial and immunogenic factors are involved in the host response to probiotic strains of Lactobacillus. Here, we report the isolation of new intestinal lactobacilli from chicken, with different immunomodulating properties on lymphoid cells from SJL and C57BL/6 mice. Analysis of biochemical markers in the Lactobacillus acidophilus CBA4P, CBA3P, and TPA3P isolates reveal that these bacterial isolates belong to the type 2 prototype, although they differ from each other. The effect of conditioned media (CM) from SJL- and C57BL/6-derived peritoneal macrophages incubated with the 3 sonicated bacterial isolates from chicken, as well as with Lactobacillus rhamnosus 9595, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, or Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan were compared. Our results show that the CM of macrophages from C57BL/6 and SJL mice treated with the CBA4P isolate stimulated syngeneic splenic lymphocytes at a level similar to the one induced with CM from peptidoglycan-stimulated macrophages. In contrast, the CM from TPA3P- and CBA3P-treated macrophages promoted low or no stimulation of lymphoid cells. Incubation of splenic cells with CM from macrophages treated with L. rhamnosus or TPA3P led to a relative decrease in the percentages of splenic CD4+ T cells, whereas the relative percentages of B cells increased. The CBA4P and CBA3P isolates induced higher levels of gamma interferon when compared with the TPA3P isolate. The effects of the lactobacilli isolates differed according to the mouse strain used but correlated with the production of macrophagic tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukins 6, 10, and 12 and with the modulation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Taken together, these results indicate that the immunomodulating properties of the new L. acidophilus isolates depend on their capacity to induce production of interleukins 10 and 12 by macrophages, which is under genetic control and depends on the p38 MAPK pathway.
TI  - [Evaluation of the effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus probiotic culture added to yogurt over Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enteritidis populations].
AB  - The effect of different types of probiotics present in yogurt over known populations of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enteritidis was evaluated. The three types of yogurt used were: without added probiotics, with added probiotics (Lactobacillus casei CRL_431 and L. acidophilus CRL_730 CHR HANSEN) and another one with the same probiotics mentioned above and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LR-35) culture. About 10(9) CFU/ mL of each potentially pathogenic bacteria was added to each type of yogurt tested, and kept in refrigeration at 4 degrees C during its shelf life, about 30 days. Bacterial count was done the initial day and every four days. Results obtained show that there is a difference in the inhibition between yogurts without added probiotics and the commercial yogurt with added probiotics; there is a clear inhibitory effect of the last one over S. aureus, E. coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes. The yogurt with added probiotics and L. rhamnosus did not show any additional inhibitory effect over the bacteria tested when compared with the yogurt with added probiotics. S. enteritidis could not be evaluated because it was not detectable in any yogurt samples evaluated four days after its inoculation. This study confirms the antagonic effect of probiotic cultures over potentially pathogenic bacteria for human beings and animals that may be present in food. Nevertheless, the use of L. rhamnosus did not produce any additional inhibitory effect.
TI  - Are probiotics detectable in human feces after oral uptake by healthy volunteers?
AB  - GOALS: Assessment of the presence of probiotic bacteria in feces after oral ingestion. BACKGROUND: Probiotic bacteria are said to have beneficial effects on the host. As a precondition for any effect, probiotic strains must survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract. STUDY: The feces of seven volunteers were analyzed for the presence of probiotic strains after one week's oral ingestion of each of six commercially available products: E. coli Nissle 0.5-5 x 10(9) cells (Mutaflor), Enterococcus faecium SF 68 7.5 x 10(7) cells (Bioflorin), Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis both 1 x 10(9) cells (Infloran), Lactobacillus gasseri and Bifidobacterium longum both 1 x 10(8) cells (Omniflora), Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus 1 x 10(9) cells (Antibiophilus), and yoghurt enriched with Lactobacillus casei Immunitas 1 x 10(10) cells (Actimel). Ten colonies were selected from each stool sample, and DNA was extracted and typed using random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Typing patterns of the ingested probiotics and the fecal isolates were compared. RESULTS: Fingerprints identical to the ingested probiotic strains were recovered from fecal samples of 4/7 volunteers after one week of Mutaflor, from 4/6 after taking Bioflorin, and from 1/6 after Infloran. Cultivation of strains of the same species from fecal specimens was negative after consumption of Antibiophilus, Omniflora and Actimel. CONCLUSIONS: After oral consumption of probiotics, E. coli and enterococci could be detected in stool samples (57% and 67%, respectively). In contrast, with only one exception, ingested lactobacilli and bifidobacteria could not be detected in human feces.
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in persistent diarrhea in Indian children: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the role of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) as probiotic in persistent diarrhea (PD) in children of North Bengal, India. SETTING: Hospital-based study. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind controlled trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients of PD admitted over a period of 2 years were included in the study as per predefined inclusion criteria. They were randomized to receive oral rehydration solution (ORS) alone, or ORS plus LGG powder containing 60 million cells, twice daily for a minimum period of 7 days or till diarrhea has stopped along with correction of dehydration with ORS and/or intravenous fluids as per WHO protocol and antibiotics in culture positive patients. The duration and frequency of purge and vomiting were studied. Data were analyzed by SPSS-10 software. Statistical significance was calculated by Student t test and chi2 test. RESULTS: The study comprised of 235 patients randomized into 2 groups, cases (117) and controls (118). Both the groups were similar with respect to age, number of breastfed infants, presentation with dehydration, degree of protein energy malnutrition, and distribution of infections. Stool culture was positive in 90 (38.3%) patients, Escherichia coli being the commonest organism followed by Shigella spp. and Clostridium difficile. The mean duration of diarrhea was significantly lower in the cases than in controls (5.3 vs. 9.2 d). The average duration of hospital stay was also significantly lesser in cases. No complication was observed from the dose of LGG used. CONCLUSIONS: LGG (dose of 60 million cells) could decrease the frequency and duration of diarrhea and vomiting and reduced hospital stay in patients of PD.
TI  - Functionality of probiotics - potential for product development.
AB  - It is becoming increasingly accepted by consumers that live lactic acid bacteria  do exert health benefits when eaten. In addition, it is also becoming recognised that not all probiotic bacteria are equal. It is now no longer just a question of providing sufficient numbers of viable bacteria in a product; industry must also provide proof of efficacy for each strain. In the early 1990s, Fonterra embarked on a programme to develop proprietary probiotic strains, and as a result, commercialised two strains, Bifidobacterium lactis HN019 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001. Over the past decade, Fonterra has developed a significant body of peerreviewed published reports around these strains, including studies showing safety in animal and human trials, protection against pathogens such as Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli O157:H7, modulation of human and animal immune markers at realistic dose rates, and efficacy in human clinical trials. Based on this work, HN019 and HN001 have been applied to several functional foods both by Fonterra (under the DR10 and DR20 brands, respectively) and by third parties (e.g. under the HOWARU brand by Danisco). While the 'gold standard' of proof of efficacy is a phase III clinical trial, ethical considerations as well as expense preclude the use of clinical trials as screening tools for probiotics. Therefore, biomarkers have to be employed to identify strains with probiotic utility, and to define the different positive health benefits of existing probiotic strains. However, as the mechanisms by which most probiotic bacteria exert their health benefits remain unclear, the question of which biomarkers accurately reflect efficacy in vivo remains unresolved. With recent technological advances, and the shift toward probiotics targeted to specific conditions, researchers are beginning to tease out how probiotic bacteria work, and it is this knowledge that will inform biomarker development and improve the ability to offer the market safe and effective probiotic functional foods.
TI  - Probiotic strains and their combination inhibit in vitro adhesion of pathogens to pig intestinal mucosa.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the protective effect of commercial probiotic strains (Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus LGG) alone and in combination on the adhesion of pathogenic strains as Salmonella, Clostridium, and Escherichia coli to pig intestinal mucus obtained from different intestinal regions. In combination, probiotic strains enhanced each other's adhesion, mainly in large intestinal mucus. Treatment of intestinal mucus with Bb12 and LGG, alone or in combination, significantly reduced (P < 0.05) the adhesion of the tested pathogens. The ability to inhibit pathogen adhesion appears to depend on the specific probiotics and pathogens and on the mucosal site. B. lactis Bb12 and L. rhamnosus LGG in combination revealed a better ability to inhibit adhesion of all pathogens tested to pig intestinal mucus than probiotic strains. Probiotic combinations could be useful for counteracting disease-associated aberrations in intestinal microbiota. Specific protective probiotics could be selected for particular pig pathogens. Probiotic strains from human origin and intended for human use also adhere to pig intestinal mucus and are able to displace and inhibit pathogens.
TI  - Acquired macrolide resistance in the human intestinal strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus E41 associated with a transition mutation in 23S rRNA genes.
AB  - Restriction fragment length polymorphism and DNA sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products showed that a Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain of human origin resistant to macrolides, from which no resistance determinants have been detected by specific PCR and microarray screening, contained a heterozygous A-->G transition mutation at position 2058 (Escherichia coli numbering) of its 23S rRNA genes.
TI  - Soluble CD14 and CD83 from human neonatal antigen-presenting cells are inducible  by commensal bacteria and suppress allergen-induced human neonatal Th2 differentiation.
AB  - CD14 is expressed on the cell surface of various antigen-presenting cells, and CD83 is a maturation marker for dendritic cells (DC). CD14 and CD83 are also present as soluble proteins, and both have immunoregulatory functions. We examined whether neonatal cord blood monocytes or DC released soluble CD14 (sCD14) or sCD83 when exposed to the commensal intestinal bacteria Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides fragilis. We found that the gram-positive bacteria C. perfringens and S. aureus, but not gram-negative bacteria, induced the release of sCD14 from monocytes. DC, on the other hand, released sCD14 in response to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, the expression of the virulence factor staphylococcal protein A seemed to be important for S. aureus-induced sCD14 production from both monocytes and DC. Soluble CD83 was released from DC, but not from monocytes, when exposed to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Finally, to investigate whether sCD14 or sCD83 could modulate neonatal allergen-induced T-cell differentiation, DC were exposed to birch allergen alone or in the presence of sCD14 or sCD83 and then cocultured with autologous T cells. We demonstrate that sCD14 and sCD83 inhibited the birch allergen-induced Th2 differentiation by suppressing interleukin 13 production. Together, these results suggest that the commensal intestinal flora may be an important stimulus for the developing immune system by inducing the immunoregulatory proteins sCD14 and sCD83, which may be involved in preventing T-cell sensitization to allergens in infants.
TI  - Probiotics and prebiotics: effects on diarrhea.
AB  - Probiotics have preventive as well as curative effects on several types of diarrhea of different etiologies. Prevention and therapy (or alleviation) of diarrhea have been successfully investigated for numerous dietary probiotics to establish probiotic properties and to justify health claims (the medicinal use of probiotic food and the therapy of gastrointestinal diseases itself may not be advertised under current food laws). Other probiotic microorganisms (e.g., Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. reuteri, certain strains of L. casei, L. acidophilus, Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917, and certain bifidobacteria and enterococci (Enterococcus faecium SF68) as well as the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii have been investigated with regard to their medicinal use, either as single strains or in mixed-culture probiotics. However, the effects on humans have been assessed mainly in smaller (n<100) randomized, controlled clinical studies or in open label trials, but large intervention studies and epidemiological investigations of long-term probiotic effects are largely missing. Perhaps with the exception of nosocomial diarrhea or antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the results of these studies are not yet sufficient to give specific recommendations for the clinical use of probiotics in the treatment of diarrhea.
TI  - Influence of macrophage activation on their capacity to bind bacterial antigens studied with atomic force microscopy.
AB  - In this work we studied interactions between bacterial antigens and receptors on  the surface of macrophages using atomic force microscopy (AFM). We used two bacterial cell wall components: lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from gram-negative Escherichia coli and exopolysaccharide (EPS) derived from gram-positive Lactobacillus rhamnosus. Interactions between these bacterial antigens and immune cell receptors were studied in peritoneal macrophages derived from two strains of mice, CBA and C3H/J, in which the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is genetically disabled. We collected 500 force-distance curves for LPS-activated cells using an EPS-covered AFM tip, and for EPS-activated cells using an LPS-covered AFM tip. Nonactivated cells were tested as reference cells. The results show that LPS-primed macrophages decrease their ability to bind EPS. Surprisingly, EPS-activated macrophages maintain or even increase their ability to bind LPS. This may suggest that in vivo commensal enteric bacteria, such as lactobacilli, will enhance the defense potential of local macrophages against pathogens expressing LPS.
TI  - Adhesive and chemokine stimulatory properties of potentially probiotic Lactobacillus strains.
AB  - Five Lactobacillus plantarum strains and two Lactobacillus johnsonii strains, stemming either from African traditionally fermented milk products or children's feces, were investigated for probiotic properties in vitro. The relationship between the hydrophobic-hydrophilic cell surface and adhesion ability to HT29 intestinal epithelial cells was investigated, and results indicated that especially the L. johnsonii strains, which exhibited both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface characteristics, adhered well to HT29 cells. Four L. plantarum and two L. johnsonii strains showed high adherence to HT29 cells, generally higher than that of the probiotic control strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. Most strains with high adhesion ability also showed high autoaggregation ability. The two L. johnsonii strains coaggregated well with the intestinal pathogens Listeria monocytogenes Scott A, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028. The L. plantarum BFE 1685 and L. johnsonii 6128 strains furthermore inhibited the adhesion of at least two of these intestinal pathogens in coculture with HT29 cells in a strain-dependent way. These two potential probiotic strains also significantly increased interleukin-8 (IL-8) chemokine production by HT29 cells, although modulation of other cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), did not occur. Altogether, our results suggested that L. plantarum BFE 1685 and L. johnsonii BFE 6128 showed good adherence, coaggregated with pathogens, and stimulated chemokine production of intestinal epithelial cells, traits that may be considered promising for their development as probiotic strains.
TI  - The effect of calcium ions on adhesion and competitive exclusion of Lactobacillus ssp. and E. coli O138.
AB  - The adhesion abilities of 11 strains of Lactobacillus were determined in vitro using the IPEC-J2 cell line as a model system. Bacteria cultures included the probiotic strains L. rhamnosus GG, L. reuteri ATCC 55730, L. johnsonii NCC 533 and L. reuteri DSM 12246, and new isolates of Lactobacillus ssp. Adhesion was quantified by scintillation counting of radiolabelled bound bacteria. The highest adhesion of 38%, was determined for L. reuteri DSM 12246 followed by L. plantarum Q47 with an adhesion level of 24%. Other strains showed moderate to low binding of less than 16%. Competitive adhesion experiments on IPEC-J2 cells demonstrated that strongly adhesive strains, as L. reuteri DSM 12246 and L. plantarum Q47, significantly reduced the attachment of the less adhesive strains, such as L. rhamnosus GG and L. johnsonii NCC 533, both under condition of co-incubation and in displacement assays, indicating that bacteria may share the same binding sites for attachment to intestinal cells. Furthermore, it was revealed that calcium ions significantly increased the binding of tested lactobacilli to IPEC-J2 cells; and therefore, added calcium may be useful in enhancing the adhesion of normally weakly adhesive probiotic cultures. In contrast, no significant change in adhesion of lactobacilli was observed in the presence of Mg and Zn ions. Displacement assays performed with pathogenic E. coli O138 showed that all tested Lactobacillus strains reduced the attachment of E. coli O138 to IPEC-J2 by more than 2-fold both in the presence and the absence of calcium ions. The strains of Lactobacillus did not differ significantly in the extent of their inhibition of E. coli O138 adhesion, indicating that the reduced adhesion of E. coli O138 was due to steric hindrance of the binding sites rather than to specific interactions.
TI  - In vitro studies of the digestion of caprine whey proteins by human gastric and duodenal juice and the effects on selected microorganisms.
AB  - The in vitro digestion of caprine whey proteins was investigated by a two-step degradation assay, using human gastric juice (HGJ) at pH 2.5 and human duodenal juice (HDJ) at pH 7.5. Different protein and peptide profiles were observed after the first (HGJ) and second (HDJ) enzymatic degradation. The minor whey proteins serum albumin, lactoferrin and Ig were rapidly degraded by HGJ, while alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-LA) and beta-lactoglobulin (beta-LG) were more resistant and survived both 30 and 45 min of the enzymatic treatment. Further digestion with HDJ still showed intact beta-LG, and the main part of alpha-LA also remained unchanged. The protein degradation by HGJ and HDJ was also compared with treatment by commercial enzymes, by using pepsin at pH 2.5, and a mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin at pH 7.5. The two methods resulted in different caprine protein and peptide profiles. The digests after treatment with HGJ and HDJ were screened for antibacterial effects on some selected microorganisms, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Streptococcus mutans. Active growing cells of E. coli were inhibited by the digestion products from caprine whey obtained after treatment with HGJ and HDJ. Cells of B. cereus were inhibited only by whey proteins obtained after reaction with HGJ, while the products after further degradation with HDJ demonstrated no significant effect. Screenings performed on cells of Lb. rhamnosus GG and S. mutans all showed no signs of inhibition.
TI  - Exopolysaccharides produced by probiotic strains modify the adhesion of probiotics and enteropathogens to human intestinal mucus.
AB  - Exopolysaccharides (EPSs) are exocellular polymers present in the surface of many bacteria, including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. The genome sequence of several strains revealed the presence of EPS-encoding genes. However, the physiological role that EPSs play in the bacterial ecology still remains uncertain. In this study, we have assessed the effect of EPSs produced by Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Bifidobacterium longum NB667, and Bifidobacterium animalis IPLA-R1 on the adhesion of probiotic and enteropathogen strains to human intestinal mucus. The EPS fraction GG had no significant effect on the adhesion of L. rhamnosus GG and B. animalis IPLA-R1. However, the EPS fractions NB667 and IPLA-R1 significantly reduced the adherence of both probiotic strains. In contrast, the three EPS fractions increased the adhesion of Enterobacter sakazakii ATCC 29544 and Escherichia coli NCTC 8603. Higher adherence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 29631 and Clostridium difficile ATCC 9689 was detected in the presence of the EPS fractions GG and NB667. In general, these effects were obtained at EPS concentrations of up to 5 mg/ml, and they were EPS dose dependent. The competitive exclusion of probiotics in the presence of EPS could suggest the involvement of these biopolymers in the adhesion to mucus. The increase in the adherence of enteropathogens could be explained if components of the pathogen surface are able to bind to specific EPSs and the bound EPSs are able to adhere to mucus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work reporting the effect of EPSs from probiotics on bacterial adhesion properties.
TI  - G-CSF-mediated inhibition of JNK is a key mechanism for Lactobacillus rhamnosus-induced suppression of TNF production in macrophages.
AB  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus is a human commensal with known immunomodulatory properties. To date the mechanism of these immunomodulatory effects is not well understood. To unravel the immunomodulatory signalling mechanism, we investigated the effects of two strains of L. rhamnosus, L. rhamnosus GG and GR-1, in modulating production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) in human monocytic cell line THP-1 and mouse macrophages. Live L. rhamnosus GG and GR-1 or their spent culture supernatant induced minuscule amounts of TNF production but large quantities of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) in macrophages compared with those induced by pathogenic Escherichia coli GR-12 and Enterococcus faecalis. By using neutralizing antibodies and G-CSF receptor knockout mice, we demonstrated that G-CSF secreted from L. rhamnosus GG- and GR-1-exposed macrophages suppressed TNF production induced by E. coli- or lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages through a paracrine route. The suppression of TNF production by G-CSF was mediated through activation of STAT3 and subsequent inhibition of c-Jun-N-terminal kinases (JNKs). The inhibition of JNK activation required STAT3alpha-mediated de novo protein synthesis. This demonstrates a novel role of G-CSF in L. rhamnosus-triggered anti-inflammatory effects and its mechanism in the suppression of TNF production in macrophages.
TI  - Probiotic properties of vaginal lactic acid bacteria to prevent metritis in cattle.
AB  - AIMS: The isolation of bovine vaginal lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and the screening of their beneficial properties to select those that could be used as probiotics in the prevention of bovine metritis were performed. METHODS AND RESULTS: Out of 76 Lactobacillus sp. and seven Streptococcus sp. strains, a small number showed high- and medium hydrophobicity when the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons method (MATH) was applied. In the agar plate diffusion test, a large number of strains inhibited vaginal bovine Escherichia coli 99/14 and human E. coli. This inhibition was due to acid. Only a few strains inhibited Actinomyces pyogenes 96/393, a pathogen isolated from bovine metritis. This inhibition remained after neutralization. The taxonomic identification of the selected strains was carried out by an amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). Most of the strains were identified as Lactobacillus fermentum, a few as Lactobacillus gasseri and one as Lactobacillus rhamnosus. CONCLUSIONS: Bovine vaginal lactobacilli strains have differential surface properties. The strains selected are capable of inhibiting specific metritis pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our results can be applied for future studies to design a probiotic product to prevent metritis in dairy postpartum cows.
TI  - Short communication: effect of exopolysaccharide isolated from "viili" on the adhesion of probiotics and pathogens to intestinal mucus.
AB  - The strong ropy character of the Scandinavian fermented milk viili is conferred by the exopolysaccharides (EPS) produced by lactococcal strains. These biopolymers can be responsible for some health benefits. We have assessed the influence of the EPS fraction isolated from commercial viili on the adhesion of some probiotics and pathogens to human intestinal mucus. Concentrations of viili EPS greater than 0.1 mg/mL promoted a decrease in adherence of Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and this effect was dose-dependent. However, no modifications were detected on the adhesion levels of the pathogenic strains tested at a concentration of 1 mg/mL of EPS. Results obtained in the present work should be considered in the design of new probiotic products.
TI  - Probiotic bacteria Bifidobacterium animalis MB5 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG protect intestinal Caco-2 cells from the inflammation-associated response induced by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli K88.
AB  - Probiotic bacteria may provide protection against intestinal damage induced by pathogens, but the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. We investigated whether Bifidobacterium animalis MB5 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) protected intestinal Caco-2 cells from the inflammation-associated response induced by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) K88, by inhibiting pathogen attachment to the cells, which is the first step of ETEC pathogenicity, and regulating neutrophil recruitment, a crucial component of inflammation. A partial reduction of ETEC adhesion was exerted by probiotics and their culture supernatant fractions either undigested or digested with proteases. ETEC viability was unaffected by the presence of B. animalis, LGG or their supernatant fractions in the culture medium, indicating an absence of probiotic bactericidal activity. Probiotics and their supernatant fractions, either undigested or digested with proteases, strongly inhibited the neutrophil transmigration caused by ETEC. Both B. animalis and LGG counteracted the pathogen-induced up regulation of IL-8, growth-related oncogene-alpha and epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide-78 gene expression, which are chemokines essential for neutrophil migration. Moreover, the probiotics prevented the ETEC-induced increased expression of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha and decrease of transforming growth factor-alpha, which are regulators of chemokine expression. These results indicate that B. animalis MB5 and LGG protect intestinal cells from the inflammation-associated response caused by ETEC K88 by partly reducing pathogen adhesion and by counteracting neutrophil migration, probably through the regulation of chemokine and cytokine expression.
TI  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG decreases lipopolysaccharide-induced systemic inflammation in a gastrostomy-fed infant rat model.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A gastrostomy-fed rat infant "pup-in-a-cup" model was used to test the hypothesis that enterally administered Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) decreases the proinflammatory response induced by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the developing infant rat small intestine, plasma, lung and liver. METHODS: Two groups of 6- to 7-day-old pups were fed a rat milk substitute with LPS added via the gastrostomy tube for 6 days. One of the rat milk substitute-fed groups received supplemental LGG; another group received LPS without LGG. Age-matched mother-fed rat pups were used as controls. RESULTS: LPS treatment blunted body growth, but LGG supplementation had no effect on weight increments. LGG decreased LPS-induced inflammation in intestinal tissue; CINC-1 (rodent IL-8 equivalent) production in plasma, liver, lung and distal small intestine; and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production in plasma and lung. Cytokine multiplex assay showed lung interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, growth-related oncogene (GRO)/KC (rat CINC-1) and TNF-alpha were significantly higher in gastrostomy-fed, LPS-treated pups than in mother-reared pups, and LGG significantly blunted the LPS-induced elevation of IL-1beta, IL-10, IL-18, GRO/KC and TNF-alpha; liver GRO/KC was significantly higher in gastrostomy-fed, LPS-treated pups than in mother-reared pups, and LGG significantly blunted the LPS-induced elevation of GRO/KC. CONCLUSIONS: LGG provided by the enteral route is able to downregulate LPS-induced proinflammatory mediators. This effect is not only present in the splanchnic organs, that is, the intestine and the liver, but extends to the plasma and a distal organ, the lung.
TI  - Antagonistic activity of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria against entero- and uropathogens.
AB  - AIM: To develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: The antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus fermentum ME-3, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Lactobacillus plantarum 299v and Lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12, Bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). Bacterial fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. Pyelonephritic Escherichia coli was highly suppressed by GG and both bifidobacteria strains. Lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and ME-3 were the most effective against Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while ME-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against Shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. Lact. paracasei, Lact. rhamnosus and Lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against Helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. The highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for Lact. fermentum ME-3 (P < 0.05). No efficient antagonist against Clostridium difficile was found. The positive correlations between the pH, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics were assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of Lactobacillus and/or Bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Screening Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.
TI  - Cellular injuries upon exposure of Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus rhamnosus to high-intensity ultrasound.
AB  - AIMS: To examine cellular injuries occurring in cells of Escherichia coli (Gram-negative bacteria) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (Gram-positive bacteria) in response to a high-intensity ultrasound treatment using classical plate count technique and flow cytometry. METHOD AND RESULTS: According to plate count results, E. coli (D-value 8.3 min) was far more sensitive than L. rhamnosus (D-value 18.1 min) in their response to the ultrasound intensity applied (20 kHz, 17.6 W). The dye precursor carboxyfluorescein diacetate (cFDA) could freely diffuse across the cytoplasmic membrane of intact cells of Gram-positive bacteria L. rhamnosus, resulting in its intracellular enzymatic conversion and emission of green fluorescence. In contrast, the presence of an outer membrane on E. coli, which represents the class of Gram-negative bacteria, apparently disabled the penetration of viability marker cFDA. Ultrasound application on E. coli yielded in an increasing population with disintegrated outer membrane, which allowed penetration of cFDA and its intracellular enzymatic conversion as well as accumulation. In both organisms evaluated only a small population was labelled by propidium iodide upon exposure to ultrasound for up to 20 min. Within the experimental conditions investigated ultrasound did not considerably affect the cytoplasmic membrane, although according to plate count results viability loss occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The results compiled suggest, that ultrasound induced cell death, which may not be related to membrane damage. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Limitation on the use of bacteriocins, which are aimed on destabilization of cytoplasmic membrane but inhibited by the outer membrane, could be overcome by ultrasound-assisted physical disruption of the outer membrane.
TI  - Screening of potential lactobacilli antigenotoxicity by microbial and mammalian cell-based tests.
AB  - Antigenotoxicity is considered an important property for probiotic lactobacilli.  The ability of non probiotic lactobacilli from dairy products and starters to inhibit two reference genotoxins: 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine was evaluated. The study was carried out using short-term assays with different targets, such as procaryotic cells (SOS-Chromotest for genotoxicity in Escherichia coli and Ames test for mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium) and eucaryotic cells (Comet assay for genotoxicity in Caco-2 enterocytes). A high proportion of strains inhibiting 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide activity was found in Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Lactobacillus plantarum. Inhibition of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine activity occurred in only one L. acidophilus strain. All the strains with antigenotoxic properties also demonstrated antimutagenic activity and produced modifications in genotoxin spectroscopic profiles. Strain viability during and after genotoxin exposure was confirmed. Concordance of the results obtained with microbial and mammalian cell-based tests is underlined.
TI  - Adherence and colonization properties of Lactobacillus rhamnosus TB1, a broiler chicken isolate.
AB  - AIMS: Selected lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from intestinal tract of chicken have been studied in order to investigate their ability to adhere in vitro to Basement Membrane Matrigel (BMM). A selected strain showing a good adherence in BMM test was used for in vivo colonization assays. METHODS AND RESULTS: In vitro assessment of adhesion of broiler chicken isolates was performed using BMM assay. Among LAB strains tested, Lactobacillus rhamnosus TB1 showed a good adherence that was comparable to the one of an Escherichia coli EPEC strain used as positive control. For in vivo colonization assays this strain was fluorescently stained with the carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (cFDA-SE) thus allowing its detection in different layers of intestinal tract after inoculation in broiler chicken. Further, stained L. rhamnosus were found with a highest value in rectum, jejunum and ileum both 3 and 24 h after administration. CONCLUSIONS: BMM assay is a quick method to test in vitro adhesion properties of bacterial strains and cFDA-SE-stained bacteria may be considered as an alternative method to test in vivo adhesion and colonization properties. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Lactobacillus rhamnosus TB1 was therefore showed to be able to adhere strongly in vitro to BMM and in vivo to intestinal epithelial cells of chicken and may be considered as a potential probiotic for chicken.
TI  - CCL20/macrophage inflammatory protein 3alpha and tumor necrosis factor alpha production by primary uterine epithelial cells in response to treatment with lipopolysaccharide or Pam3Cys.
AB  - Having previously shown that CCL20/macrophage inflammatory protein 3alpha and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) are released by polarized primary rat uterine epithelial cells (UEC) in response to Escherichia coli but not to Lactobacillus rhamnosus, we sought to determine if epithelial cells are responsive to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP), including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoteichoic acid (LTA), and Pam(3)Cys, a bacterial lipoprotein analog. Epithelial cells were grown to confluence on Nunc cell culture inserts prior to apical treatment with PAMPs. In response to LPS, LTA, and Pam(3)Cys (EMC Microcollection GmbH, Tubingen, Germany), CCL20 levels increased (4- to 10-fold) while PAMPs caused increased TNF-alpha (1- to 4-fold) in the medium collected after 24 h of incubation. Both apical and basolateral secretion of CCL20 and TNF-alpha increased in response to PAMPs, but treatments had no effect on cell viability and integrity, as measured by transepithelial resistance. Time course studies of CCL20 and TNF-alpha release in response to Pam(3)Cys and LPS indicated that CCL20 release peaked between 2 and 4 h after treatment, whereas TNF-alpha release was gradual over the length of the incubation. Freeze-thaw and cell lysis experiments, along with actinomycin D studies, suggested that CCL20 and TNF-alpha are synthesized in response to PAMP stimulation. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that E. coli and selected PAMPs have direct effects on the production of CCL20 and TNF-alpha without affecting cell integrity. Since CCL20 is known to be both chemotactic and antimicrobial, the increase in apical and basolateral release by UEC in response to PAMPs suggests a new mechanism of innate immune protection in the female reproductive tract.
TI  - Comparison of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene (fbp) sequences for the identification of Lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  - Comparative analysis of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene (fbp) sequences was evaluated for the differentiation of reference and clinical strains of Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The sequences of 1,971 nucleotides of the fbp gene were determined on both DNA strands for 21 L. rhamnosus strains, representing reference, probiotic, and clinical strains. No PCR amplification of the fbp gene was observed for other species of the Lactobacillus casei complex (L. casei and L. zeae) or strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Escherichia coli. Phylogenetic analysis of the fbp putative amino acid sequences of L. rhamnosus strains by the neighbor-joining method showed clear distinct positions of this species. The phylogenetic tree, derived from fbp nucleotide sequences, showed four clear divisions between strains of L. rhamnosus. From a taxonomic point of view, our results confirm for the first time that fbp gene sequences have high discriminating power for strains of L. rhamnosus that are difficult to differentiate.
TI  - Development of a novel hand-held immunoassay for the detection of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.
AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 is an important human pathogen responsible for numerous  outbreaks of hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome world-wide. A portable detection device is needed for field testing and point-of-care testing. Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) is a solid substrate well suited for adsorption of macromolecules. The purpose of this study was to develop a hand-held enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of E. coli O157:H7 antigens. The prototype consisted of three modules: one for loading reagents, a second for immunosensor detection, and a third for discharge of wastes. Reagent delivery was achieved by using 1-ml syringes embedded within the loading module. The detection module was based on a PDMS layer on which varying concentrations of E. coli O157:H7 antigens, and negative controls (Lactobacillus rhamnosus R011 and phosphate-buffered saline) were passively adsorbed. Commercially available goat anti-E. coli O157:H7 antibody was used as a primary antibody, a donkey anti-goat IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was used as a secondary antibody, and a precipitating substrate was employed for colorimetric detection. Results obtained with the prototype were compared to those obtained using a conventional nitrocellulose membrane-based immunoassay. Using the prototype, E. coli O157:H7 antigens, in quantities from 4 to 400 ng, were accurately detected. This detection limit was comparable to that observed using conventional dot-blot assays. The PDMS layer could be re-used without loss of sensitivity. Colorimetric detection could be visualized readily without the need for sophisticated equipment. Furthermore, this device can be adapted to perform diagnostics for other microbial pathogens currently detected using immunoassay methodology.
TI  - Nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic Gram-negative pathogens. Diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a Gram stain of a vaginal smear. Treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. A study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of BV by the Gram stain-based Nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that Bacteroides or Prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. In one case, only Gardnerella vaginalis was found. These findings illustrate that BV remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either Gardnerella or Mobiluncus. Use of a FemExam system (Cooper Surgical, Shelton, CT), based upon elevated pH and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the Gram stain method. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with BV but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14. These studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for BV. If such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. fermentum RC-14.
TI  - [Search of promising strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus for the development of new biopreparations].
AB  - For the first time the species composition of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in  clinically healthy young children has been studied. As revealed in this study, the dominating species of bifidobacteria are B. longum, B. adolescentis and B. infantis, while the dominating species of lactobacilli are Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. rhamnosus. In 83 isolated cultures of bifidobacteria and 34 isolated species of lactobacilli the activity of acid formation and the antagonistic activity with respect to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens have been tested. B. longum strain 58B, B. infantis strain 37B, L. rhamnosus strain 12L and L. acidophilus strain 27L, typical for children of this age group, having good antagonistic activity and pronounced acid-forming properties, have been selected. These strains hold good promise to be used as the basis for the development of a complex probiotic preparation for correcting intestinal microflora in young children.
TI  - Selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. METHODS: A gradient plate technique was used to expose Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Neisseria subflava, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations of triclosan. Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 was included as an organism showing the triclosan resistance development trait. MIC values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. RESULTS: N. subflava, Pr. nigrescens Po. gingivalis and E. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (MIC range 0.1-3.9 mg/L), whereas the lactobacillus and S. mutans were less susceptible (MIC range 15.6-20.8 mg/L). Triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (P < 0.01) for the positive control E. coli, although its MICs towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. Minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (MIC) occurred for Pr. nigrescens and in S. sanguis and S. oralis (MBC). Mean changes in susceptibilities (MIC and MBC) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine MBCs for S. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. CONCLUSIONS: These data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for E. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. Other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than FabI that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.
TI  - Effect of Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus rhamnosus on macrophage inflammatory protein 3 alpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and transforming growth factor beta release by polarized rat uterine epithelial cells in culture.
AB  - Entry of bacteria from the vagina into the uterus raises the question of uterine  epithelial cell (UEC) signaling in response to the presence of bacteria. Our model system helps to define microbially elicited UEC basolateral cytokine release, important in regulating underlying stromal immune cell protection. UECs from adult rats were grown in cell culture inserts to establish a confluent polarized monolayer as was determined by transepithelial resistance (TER). Polarized epithelial cell cultures were treated apically with live or heat-killed Escherichia coli or Lactobacillus rhamnosus prior to collection of basolateral media after 24 h of incubation. Coculture of polarized UECs with live E. coli had no effect on epithelial cell TER. In response to exposure to live E. coli, epithelial cell basolateral release of macrophage inflammatory protein 3 alpha (MIP3 alpha) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) increased at a time when basolateral release of biologically active transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) decreased. Incubation of UECs with heat-killed E. coli resulted in an increased basolateral release of MIP3 alpha and TNF-alpha, without affecting TER or TGF-beta. In contrast to E. coli, live or heat-killed L. rhamnosus had no effect on TER or cytokine release. These studies indicate that polarized rat UECs respond to gram-negative E. coli by releasing the cytokines MIP3 alpha and TNF-alpha, signals important to both the innate and adaptive immune systems. These findings suggest that UEC responses to bacteria are selective and important in initiating and regulating immune protection in the female reproductive tract.
TI  - Immune enhancement in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) by potential probiotic  bacteria (Lactobacillus rhamnosus).
AB  - The present study assessed the immune enhancement of fish by a lactic acid bacterium (LAB) Lactobacillus rhamnosus (ATCC 53103). The bacterium was administered orally at five different doses 7.9 x 10(4) (LAB4), 2.1 x 10(6) (LAB6), 2.8 x 10(8) (LAB8), 1.9 x 10(10) (LAB10) and 9.7 x 10(10) (LAB11) CFU/g feed to rainbow trout for two weeks and the feed was changed to un-supplemented diet. From the onset of feeding supplemented diets at 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks, blood and mucus samples were taken. During the LAB feeding period L. rhamnosus persisted in the fish intestine and in the tank water in high numbers. However, L. rhamnosus disappeared from the intestine, skin mucus and tank water within one week after the change to the non-supplemented feed. In comparison to untreated control fish, respiratory burst activity of blood cells was raised significantly in the LAB4 treated group on week 2. Serum-mediated killing of Escherichia coli was increased significantly in group LAB6 on week 2. Serum immunoglobulin levels were significantly raised only in LAB8 group on week 1 and in LAB4 and LAB8 at the end of the trial. The results show that rainbow trout immune parameters were enhanced by using probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Displacement of bacterial pathogens from mucus and Caco-2 cell surface by lactobacilli.
AB  - Competition, competitive exclusion and displacement of eight strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. by Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus casei Shirota from adhesion on human intestinal mucus glycoproteins and Caco-2 cell surfaces were studied. Lactobacilli were able to compete with, exclude and displace pathogenic gastrointestinal (GI) bacteria when they were incubated together, but the degree of inhibition of adhesion was bacterial strain-dependent. Competition and exclusion profiles of GI bacteria by lactobacilli were similar. Displacement profiles of GI bacteria were different from those of competition and exclusion and the process was relatively slow: displacement equilibrium took more than 2 h. These findings are important for development, selection and in vitro assessment of target- and function-specific probiotics.
TI  - Binding of extracellular matrix molecules by probiotic bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate extracellular matrix (ECM) and mucin binding of selected bacterial isolates with probiotic features in comparison with commercially used probiotic bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: ECM molecules were immobilized in microtitre plates (mucin and fetuin) or on the surface of latex beads. Porcine mucin was bound by all 13 probiotic strains tested with important inter-strain differences; however, fetuin binding was similar (weak) for all 14 strains tested. Strongly positive (three) binding of bovine fibrinogen was expressed by strains from fermented food (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. casei Shirota and L. johnsonii La1) as well as by L. casei L.c., Lactobacillus sp. 2I3 and by L. plantarum LP. The other strains expressed moderate (2) or weakly positive (1) binding of bovine fibrinogen. Strongly positive (3) binding of porcine fibronectin was observed only with two strains; however, all other strains also bound this molecule. Bovine lactoferrin was bound to a higher extent than transferrins. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Some animal strains (at least L. casei L.c. and Lactobacillus sp. 2I3) are comparable with the commercially used strains with respect to their ECM binding ability. As this feature is important for probiotic bacteria to be able to colonize intestine, these strains should be considered for their wider use in fermented feed (or probiotic preparations) for animals.
TI  - The effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus on enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infection of human intestinal cells in vitro.
AB  - There are many examples of probiotic effects of various lactic bacteria on enteropathogens. In this study, Lactobacillus strains (L. rhamnosus, L. gasseri, L. casei and L. plantarum) were tested in an in vitro model of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection of a human colon epithelial cell line, C2BBe1. While the adhesion and colonization of EHEC was not affected by any of the lactobacillus strains tested, the internalization of EHEC into the cell line was markedly suppressed by L. rhamnosus, though not by others. Concerning the possible mechanisms, the viabilities of EHEC and host cell were not affected by the presence of L. rhamnosus. Simple competitions at certain receptors were unlikely because the suppressive effect on EHEC internalization was strictly dependent on viable L. rhamnosus and could not be observed with the conditioned medium or killed L. rhamnosus. The fact that L. rhamnosus showed outstanding potential for adhering to the colon epithelial cell line, compared with other strains, suggested that an avid interaction between L. rhamnosus and the host cell might be modulating intra-cellular events responsible for the internalization of EHEC.
TI  - Immunomodulatory consequences of oral administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG in healthy volunteers.
AB  - Probiotic microorganisms, especially lactic acid bacteria, are effective in the treatment of infectious diarrhoeal diseases and experimental colitis. Although the mechanisms by which these organisms exert their anti-inflammatory effects are largely unknown, immunomodulating effects are suggested. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of a 5-week oral administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus subspecies GG (Lb. GG) on the cellular immune response to intestinal microorganisms in ten healthy volunteers. Peripheral blood cells (PB) were stimulated with either 'self' or 'non-self' preparations of faecal samples and isolated Bacteroides fragilis group-organisms (Bfg) or Escherichia coli (Esch. coli), and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-4, IL-6, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) were measured in the culture supernatant. CD4+ T-lymphocyte activation was determined by measurement of intracellular ATP following lysis of the cells. The activational response of CD4+ T-lymphocytes towards isolated and heat-inactivated intestinal organisms was increased after the probiotic treatment. Additionally, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and in part IFN-gamma cytokine secretion by PB cells following stimulation with whole stool preparations and single members of the flora was significantly decreased, whereas the IL-10 and in part IL-4 cytokine secretion was increased at the end of the study. In contrast, the activational response of CD4+ T-lymphocytes following stimulation with whole 'non-self' intestinal flora was higher than by 'self' intestinal flora, but both responses showed a trend towards a reduction at the end of the study. This study documents a direct effect by Lb. GG on the cellular immune system of healthy volunteers and offers a promising tool to investigate systemic immunomodulation due to oral administration of probiotic microorganisms.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria isolated from dairy products inhibit genotoxic effect of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in SOS-chromotest.
AB  - Antigenotoxic activity against 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) of lactic acid bacteria isolated from commercial dairy products was studied using SOS-Chromotest. The supernatants from bacteria-genotoxin co-incubations in general exhibited a strong suppression on SOS-induction produced by 4-NQO on the tester organism Escherichia coli PQ37 (sfiA::lacZ). High genotoxicity inhibition (>75%) was found for 31/67 of the examined bacteria and the maximum values of some strains within the species were as follows: Lactobacillus casei, 99.1%; L. plantarum, 93.3%; L. rhamnosus, 93.4%; L. acidophilus, 90.9%; L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, 85.7% and Bifidobacterium bifidum, 89.6%; Strains with low antigenotoxicity (5-60%) were evidenced in both L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, whereas some inactive strains were found only in L. casei and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. Cell exposure to 100 degrees C for 15 min prevented antigenotoxicity and no effect was evidenced for cell-free spent media. The active strains survived at 0.1 mM 4-NQO exposure and generally presented some relevant functional properties, such as tolerance to bile (0.5%) or acid environment (pH 2.0) and adherence to Caco-2 enterocytes. Antigenotoxicity was always associated with modification of the 4-NQO absorbance profile.
TI  - Competition for adhesion between probiotics and human gastrointestinal pathogens  in the presence of carbohydrate.
AB  - The adhesion of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG to human enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells  was not inhibited by eight carbohydrates tested, namely N-acetyl-glucosamine, galactose, glucose, fructose, fucose, mannose, methyl-alpha-D-mannopyranoside and sucrose. The degree of hydrophobicity predicted the adhesion of L. rhamnosus GG to Caco-2 cells. L. rhamnosus GG, however, was able to compete with Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. of low hydrophobicity and high adhesin-receptor interaction for adhesion to Caco-2 cells. The interference of adhesion of these gastrointestinal (GI) bacteria by L. rhamnosus GG was probably through steric hindrance, and the degree of inhibition was related to the distribution of the adhesin receptors and hydrophobins on the Caco-2 surface. A Carbohydrate Index for Adhesion (CIA) was used to depict the binding property of adhesins on bacteria surfaces. CIA was defined as the sum of the fraction of adhesion in the presence of carbohydrates, with reference to the adhesion measured in the absence of any carbohydrate. The degree of competition for receptor sites between Lactobacillus casei Shirota and GI bacteria is a function of their CIA distance. There were at least two types of adhesins on the surface of L. casei Shirota. The study provides a scientific basis for the screening and selection of probiotics that compete with selective groups of pathogens for adhesion to intestinal surfaces. It also provides a model for the characterisation of adhesins and adhesin-receptor interactions.
TI  - Immune protection mediated by the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 (DR20)  against Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection in mice.
AB  - This study investigated the protective effects of feeding the immunoenhancing probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 against Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection in murine (BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice) challenge infection models. Mice were fed milk-based diets supplemented with L. rhamnosus HN001 (3 x 10(8) cfu g(-1)) for 7 days prior to and following oral challenge with E. coli O157:H7. Morbidity and feed intake were measured for 1 week following challenge; pathogen translocation to spleen, liver and blood, and humoral and cellular immunological responses (specific antibody and phagocytosis) were measured in a sub-sample of ostensibly healthy animals 1 week post-challenge. Results showed that, after challenge, L. rhamnosus HN001-fed mice exhibited lower cumulative morbidity and bacterial translocation rates, compared to non-probiotic-fed control mice. Significantly higher intestinal anti-E. coli IgA responses and blood leucocyte phagocytic activity were recorded among probiotic-fed mice compared to controls. These results demonstrate that feeding the probiotic L. rhamnosus HN001 to mice can reduce the severity of E. coli O157:H7 infection, and suggest that this reduction may be associated with enhanced humoral and cellular immune responses.
TI  - Reduction of sulfide, ammonia compounds, and adhesion properties of Lactobacillus casei strain KE99 in vitro.
AB  - The ability of Lactobacillus casei strain KE99 to reduce sulfide, ammonia, and to adhere to bio-surfaces was characterized and compared with three lactobacillus reference strains. Sulfide reduction by strain KE99 in MRS broth increased exponentially after 10-h growth and reached a maximum (>300 ppm reduction) within 48 h. KE99 demonstrated a maximum reduction of sulfide under anaerobic (341 ppm) growth conditions at pH 6.0-8.0 range. Maximum anaerobic reduction of sulfide was demonstrated by L. casei 393 at pH 7.0 (272 ppm); L. rhamnosus at pH 8.0 (277 ppm); and L. reuteri at pH 7.0 (244 ppm). KE99 reduced sulfide more (p < 0.0001) in MRS broth spiked with Na2S (374 ppm) than (NH4)2S (340 ppm) salts. Ammonia reduction by strain KE99 and the three lactobacillus reference strains in MRS broth was low. Ammonia reduction reached a maximum within 36 h and remained unchanged over extended incubations of 48 h to 72 h or further. KE99 reduced ammonium sulfate (37 ppm) more readily than the nitrate (31 ppm), hypophosphate (29 ppm), or chloride (20 ppm) salts of ammonia. KE99 and the three reference strains of lactobacilli demonstrated avid binding to Bio-coat (Cn type-I, Cn type-IV, laminin, fibronectin), Matrigel, and Caco-2 cell monolayers in vitro. The number of lactobacilli binding to Caco-2 was estimated at 74/cell with strain KE99, which was significantly higher compared with 40/cell (p < 0.0001), 26/cell (0.0001), and 64/cell (p < 0.002) with L. casei 393, L. reuteri, and L. rhamnosus, respectively. The interaction of KE99 to immobilized Cn type-I was saturable and reached an equilibrium within 1 h at room temperature. KE99 binding to Cn type-I occurred at a wide pH range and was biphasic with maximum binding at pH 5.5 and 7.5. Inhibition and binding-displacement experiments with different salts and sugars suggested that the KE99 binding to immobilized Cn type-I may involve a combination of electrostatic and lectin-type interactions. KE99 effectively detached the Cn-adherent E. coli O157:H7 in the range of 55% (ATCC43895) to 76% (ATCC43894). The binding-displacement values for L. casei 393, L. reuteri and L. rhamnosus to detach Cn-adherent E. coli O157:H7 (ATCC43894) were 66 +/- 4%, 59 +/- 2%, and 64 +/- 2%, respectively. Also, a reconstituted solution of the freeze-dried KE99 preparation effectively detached the Cn-adherent E. coli O157:H7 in a dose-dependent manner that reached a binding-displacement equilibrium of 85% at a 1% wt/vol KE99 concentration.
TI  - In vitro adherence properties of Lactobacillus rhamnosus DR20 and Bifidobacterium lactis DR10 strains and their antagonistic activity against an enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.
AB  - Adhesion and colonisation properties of three probiotic strains namely, Lactobacillus rhamnosus DR20, L. acidophilus HN017, and Bifidobacterium lactis DR10, were determined in vitro using the differentiated human intestinal cell-lines including HT-29, Caco-2, and HT29-MTX, and compared with properties of L. acidophilus LA-1 and L. rhamnosus GG (two commercial probiotic strains). Two independent methods were employed to quantitate the "adhesiveness" of each strain. In the first method, the bacteria adhered to human cells were detected by Gram staining and counted in different fields under a microscope. Bacteria were also radio-labelled and extent of adhesion determined by scintillation counting. All three strains showed strong adhesion with the human intestinal cell lines in vitro. Adhesion indices of the three strains to two cell lines, i.e. HT-29, and Caco-2 varied between 99 +/- 17 and 219 +/- 36. With mucus-secreting cell-line HT29-MTX, the adhesion indices of all the strains were 2-3 times higher. The adhesion indices of L. acidophilus LA-1 and L. rhamnosus GG were comparable to the other three probiotic strains. We also investigated the inhibitory effect of adhering strains against the intestinal cell monolayer colonization by a known enterotoxigenic strain of Escherichia coli (strain O157:H7). Pre-treatment of E. coli O157:H7 with 2.5-fold concentrated cell-free culture supernatants from L. acidophilus HN017, L. rhamnosus DR20 and B. lactis DR10 reduced the culturable E. coli numbers on TSB plates and also reduced the invasiveness and cell association characteristics of this toxic strain. The inhibitory molecules secreted into the spent media by these strains were partially affected by treatments with lactate dehydrogenase, trypsin and proteinase K suggesting that overall inhibition may be due to a synergistic action of lactic acid and proteinaceous substances.
TI  - Probiotic activities of Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus: in vitro adherence to intestinal cells and antimicrobial properties.
AB  - The interest of probiotics as remedies for a broad number of gastrointestinal and other infectious diseases has gained wide interest over the last few years, but little is known about their underlying mechanism of action. In this study, the probiotic activities of a human isolate of Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus strain (Lcr35) were investigated. Using intestinal Caco-2 cell line in an in vitro model, we demonstrated that this strain exhibited adhesive properties. The inhibitory effects of Lcr35 organisms on the adherence of three pathogens, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, were determined. A decrease in the number of adhering pathogens was observed, using either preincubation, postincubation or coincubation of the pathogens with Lcr35. Moreover, the antibacterial activities of cell-free Lcr35 supernatant was examined against nine human pathogenic bacteria, ETEC, EPEC, K. pneumoniae, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Clostridium difficile. The growth of all strains was inhibited, as measured by determining the number of viable bacteria over time, but no bactericidal activity was detected in this in vitro assay. Together, these findings suggest that this probiotic strain could be used to prevent colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by a large variety of pathogens.
TI  - Temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) as a tool for identification of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus zeae and Lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  - AIMS: To develop a tool for rapid and inexpensive identification of the Lactobacillus casei complex. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus zeae and Lactobacillus rhamnosus were identified by PCR-amplification of the segment between the U1 and U2 regions of 16S rDNA (position 8-357, Escherichia coli numbering) and temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE). Seven tested Lact. paracasei strains were divided into three TTGE-subgroups. CONCLUSION: TTGE successfully distinguished between the closely-related target species. TTGE is also a powerful method for revealing sequence heterogeneities in the 16S rRNA genes. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Due to rapid and easy performance, TTGE of PCR-amplified 16S rDNA fragments will be useful for the identification of extended numbers of isolates.
TI  - Assessment of adhesion properties of novel probiotic strains to human intestinal  mucus.
AB  - Potential new probiotic strains Lactobacillus brevis PELI, L. reuteri ING1, L. rhamnosus VTT E-800 and L. rhamnosus LC-705 were assessed for their adhesion properties using the human intestinal mucus model. The effect on the adhesion of exposure to acid and pepsin and to milk were tested to simulate gastric and food processing conditions, and the effect of different growth media on adhesion was tested. The properties of the four strains were compared to the well-investigated probiotic L. rhamnosus strain GG. Three of the tested strains showed significant adhesion properties in the mucus model, while L. brevis PELI had intermediate adhesion and L. rhamnosus LC-705 adhered poorly. Pretreatment with different milks decreased the adhesion and low pH and pepsin treatment reduced the adhesion of all tested strains except L. rhamnosus LC-705. No competitive exclusion of pathogenic Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli SfaII was observed. The results indicate that major differences exist between tested proposed probiotic strains. The growth media and the food matrix significantly affect the adhesive ability of the tested strains. This has previously not been taken into account when selecting novel probiotic strains.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria from healthy oral cavity of Thai volunteers: inhibition of oral pathogens.
AB  - The aims of the present study were to screen and characterize the antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria which were isolated from healthy oral cavities of Thai volunteers, and to characterize their inhibiting substances. Among 3790 isolates (suspected to be lactic acid bacteria) from 130 volunteers, five showed an appreciable effect against Sarcina lutea ATCC 9341, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Streptococcus mutans DTMU 1, Strep. salivarius DTMU 1, Strep. sanguis DTMU 1, Candida albicans ATCC 13803 and C. albicans DTMU 2, as well as the oral pathogens. These antimicrobial isolates included L17 and N14 which showed the antibacterial activity, D14 which showed the anticandidal activity, and D6 and N8 which showed both the antibacterial and anticandidal activities. The isolates were later found to be facultative anaerobic, Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-capsule-forming and catalase-negative bacilli. They could utilize casein but could not hydrolyse starch, and they produced hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. Their antimicrobial potentials were found to be affected by pH, catalase, proteolytic enzymes and temperature. The activity was partially inactivated after catalase treatment, significantly declined at pH > or =9.0 or after trypsin and pepsin treatments, and also reduced after heating at > or =100 degrees C. However, the antimicrobial activity of these five isolates was somewhat resistant to heat. When the isolates were tested for their antimicrobial sensitivity, they were shown to be sensitive to a number of antimicrobial agents. The final identification revealed that D6, D14 and N14 were Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, and L17 and N8 were Lact. rhamnosus.
TI  - Quantitative approach in the study of adhesion of lactic acid bacteria to intestinal cells and their competition with enterobacteria.
AB  - To describe the phenomena of bacterial adhesion to intestinal cells and the competition for adhesion between bacteria, mathematical equations based on a simple dissociation process involving a finite number of bacterial receptors on intestinal cell surface were developed. The equations allow the estimation of the maximum number of Lactobacillus sp. and Escherichia coli cells that can adhere to Caco-2 cells and intestinal mucus; they also characterize the affinity of the bacteria to Caco-2 cells and intestinal and fecal mucus and the theoretical adhesion ratio of two bacteria present in a mixed suspension. The competition for adhesion between Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and E. coli TG1 appeared to follow the proposed kinetics, whereas the competition between Lactobacillus casei Shirota and E. coli TG1 may involve multiple adhesion sites or a soluble factor in the culture medium of the former. The displacement of the adhered Lactobacillus by E. coli TG1 seemed to be a rapid process, whereas the displacement of E. coli TG1 by the Lactobacillus took more than an hour.
TI  - Analysis of promoter sequences from Lactobacillus and Lactococcus and their activity in several Lactobacillus species.
AB  - Promoter-active fragments were isolated from the genome of the probiotic organism Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG using the promoter-probe vector pNZ272. These promoter elements, together with a promoter fragment isolated from the vaginal strain Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 and two previously defined promoters (Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 slpA), were introduced into three strains of Lactobacillus. Primer-extension analysis was used to map the transcriptional start site for each promoter. All promoter fragments tested were functional in each of the three lactobacilli and a purine residue was used to initiate transcription in most cases. The promoter elements encompassed a 52- to 1,140-fold range in promoter activity depending on the host strain. Lactobacillus promoters were further examined by surveying previously mapped sequences for conserved base positions. The Lactobacillus hexamer regions (-35: TTgaca and -10: TAtAAT) closely resembled those of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, with the highest degree of agreement at the -10 hexamer. The TG dinucleotide upstream of the -10 hexamer was conserved in 26% of Lactobacillus promoters studied, but conservation rates differed between species. The region upstream of the -35 hexamer of Lactobacillus promoters showed conservation with the bacterial UP element.
TI  - Production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  - A total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of Turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. For detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. Lactobacillus sake Lb790, Listeria monocytogenes Li6, Staphylococcus aureus St44 and Escherichia coli NRRL B-3704 were used as indicator organisms. Strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against Clostridium perfringens 4TTK, Clostridium botulinum type A. 7948, Bacillus cereus NRRL B-3711, Micrococcus luteus NRRL B-4376 and Yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following: 19 Lactobacillus plantarum, 4 L. curvatus, 4 Pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 P. acidilactici, 2 L. pentosus, 2 L. sake, 1 L. delbrueckii, 1 L. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified Lactobacillus spp. P. pentosaceus 416, P. acidilactici 413, 419 and 446, L. curvatus 348, L. plantarum 452 and 495, and Lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.
TI  - Biosynthesis of lipoteichoic acid in Lactobacillus rhamnosus: role of DltD in D-alanylation.
AB  - The dlt operon (dltA to dltD) of Lactobacillus rhamnosus 7469 encodes four proteins responsible for the esterification of lipoteichoic acid (LTA) by D-alanine. These esters play an important role in controlling the net anionic charge of the poly (GroP) moiety of LTA. dltA and dltC encode the D-alanine-D-alanyl carrier protein ligase (Dcl) and D-alanyl carrier protein (Dcp), respectively. Whereas the functions of DltA and DltC are defined, the functions of DltB and DltD are unknown. To define the role of DltD, the gene was cloned and sequenced and a mutant was constructed by insertional mutagenesis of dltD from Lactobacillus casei 102S. Permeabilized cells of a dltD::erm mutant lacked the ability to incorporate D-alanine into LTA. This defect was complemented by the expression of DltD from pNZ123/dlt. In in vitro assays, DltD bound Dcp for ligation with D-alanine by Dcl in the presence of ATP. In contrast, the homologue of Dcp, the Escherichia coli acyl carrier protein (ACP), involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, was not bound to DltD and thus was not ligated with D-alanine. DltD also catalyzed the hydrolysis of the mischarged D-alanyl-ACP. The hydrophobic N-terminal sequence of DltD was required for anchoring the protein in the membrane. It is hypothesized that this membrane-associated DltD facilitates the binding of Dcp and Dcl for ligation of Dcp with D-alanine and that the resulting D-alanyl-Dcp is translocated to the primary site of D-alanylation.
TI  - X-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase gene (pepX) is part of the glnRA operon in Lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  - A peptidase gene expressing X-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (PepX) activity was cloned from Lactobacillus rhamnosus 1/6 by using the chromogenic substrate L-glycyl-L-prolyl-beta-naphthylamide for screening of a genomic library in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of a 3.5-kb HindIII fragment expressing the peptidase activity revealed one complete open reading frame (ORF) of 2,391 nucleotides. The 797-amino-acid protein encoded by this ORF was shown to be 40, 39, and 36% identical with PepXs from Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Lactococcus lactis, respectively. By Northern analysis with a pepX-specific probe, transcripts of 4.5 and 7.0 kb were detected, indicating that pepX is part of a polycistronic operon in L. rhamnosus. Cloning and sequencing of the upstream region of pepX revealed the presence of two ORFs of 360 and 1,338 bp that were shown to be able to encode proteins with high homology to GlnR and GlnA proteins, respectively. By multiple primer extension analyses, the only functional promoter in the pepX region was located 25 nucleotides upstream of glnR. Northern analysis with glnA- and pepX-specific probes indicated that transcription from glnR promoter results in a 2.0-kb dicistronic glnR-glnA transcript and also in a longer read-through polycistronic transcript of 7.0 kb that was detected with both probes in samples from cells in exponential growth phase. The glnA gene was disrupted by a single-crossover recombinant event using a nonreplicative plasmid carrying an internal part of glnA. In the disruption mutant, glnRA-specific transcription was derepressed 10-fold compared to the wild type, but the 7.0-kb transcript was no longer detectable with either the glnA- or pepX-specific probe, demonstrating that pepX is indeed part of glnRA operon in L. rhamnosus. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis further supported this operon structure. An extended stem-loop structure was identified immediately upstream of pepX in the glnA-pepX intergenic region, a sequence that showed homology to a 23S-5S intergenic spacer and to several other L. rhamnosus-related entries in data banks.
TI  - The effect of probiotic bacteria on the adhesion of pathogens to human intestinal mucus.
AB  - Human intestinal glycoproteins extracted from faeces were used as a model for intestinal mucus to investigate adhesion of pathogenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella strains, and the effect of probiotics on this adhesion. S-fimbriated E. coli expressed relatively high adhesion in the mucus model, but the other tested pathogens adhered less effectively. Probiotic strains Lactobacillus GG and L. rhamnosus LC-705 as well as a L. rhamnosus isolated from human faeces were able to slightly reduce S-fimbria-mediated adhesion. Adhesion of S. typhimurium was significantly inhibited by probiotic L. johnsonii LJ1 and L. casei Shirota. Lactobacillus GG and L. rhamnosus (human isolate) increased the adhesion of S. typhimurium suggesting that the pathogen interacts with the probiotic.
TI  - Lactobacilli from human gastrointestinal mucosa are strong stimulators of IL-12 production.
AB  - Interaction of macrophages with bacteria is a stimulus for production of cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-12. IL-12 stimulates T cell and natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production. IL-10 opposes the T cell-stimulating action of IL-12, decreases the release of proinflammatory cytokines from macrophages, and stimulates B cells. We have studied the capacity of human intestinal isolates from the three Lactobacillus species dominating on the human gastrointestinal mucosa, L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus and L. paracasei ssp. paracasei, to induce production of IL-10 and IL-12 from human blood mononuclear cells, or monocytes. Whole killed lactobacilli were potent stimulators of IL-12 over a wide range of bacterial concentrations. Lactobacillus paracasei gave the highest levels of IL-12 (1.5 ng/ml in response to 5 x 106 bacteria/ml), roughly 10 times more than obtained by stimulation with L. rhamnosus or L. plantarum. Escherichia coli induced on average < 50 pg/ml of IL-12 regardless of the bacterial concentration used. The secretion of free p40 subunit IL-12 followed the same pattern as the secretion of p70 (bioactive IL-12) with regard to the efficiency of different bacteria as stimulators. Escherichia coli was the most efficient trigger of IL-10 production, inducing 0.5 ng/ml IL-10 after stimulation with 5 x 106 bacteria/ml. Lactobacillus rhamnosus induced the highest levels of IL-10 among the lactobacilli (0.5 ng/ml) compared with 0.1 ng/ml evoked by L. plantarum or L. paracasei, but 10 times more bacteria were required for optimal stimulation than with E. coli. When neutralizing anti-IL-10 antibodies were added to the cultures, the IL-12-inducing capacity of L. rhamnosus was increased markedly, while that of E. coli remained low. The results show that mucosa-associated lactobacilli can be potent stimulators of IL-12, and thus potentially of cell-mediated immunity, if they pass over the gut epithelial barrier and interact with cells of the gut immune system.
TI  - Insertional inactivation of genes responsible for the D-alanylation of lipoteichoic acid in Streptococcus gordonii DL1 (Challis) affects intrageneric coaggregations.
AB  - Most human oral viridans streptococci participate in intrageneric coaggregations, the cell-to-cell adherence among genetically distinct streptococci. Two genes relevant to these intrageneric coaggregations were identified by transposon Tn916 mutagenesis of Streptococcus gordonii DL1 (Challis). A 626-bp sequence flanking the left end of the transposon was homologous to dltA and dltB of Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 7469 (formerly called Lactobacillus casei). A 60-kb probe based on this flanking sequence was used to identify the homologous DNA in a fosmid library of S. gordonii DL1. This DNA encoded D-alanine-D-alanyl carrier protein ligase that was expressed in Escherichia coli from the fosmid clone. The cloned streptococcal dltA was disrupted by inserting an ermAM cassette, and then it was linearized and transformed into S. gordonii DL1 for allelic replacement. Erythromycin-resistant transformants containing a single insertion in dltA exhibited a loss of D-alanyl esters in lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and a loss of intrageneric coaggregation. This phenotype was correlated with the loss of a 100-kDa surface protein reported previously to be involved in mediating intrageneric coaggregation (C. J. Whittaker, D. L. Clemans, and P. E. Kolenbrander, Infect. Immun. 64:4137-4142, 1996). The mutants retained the parental ability to participate in intergeneric coaggregation with human oral actinomyces, indicating the specificity of the mutation in altering intrageneric coaggregations. The mutants were altered morphologically and exhibited aberrant cell septa in a variety of pleomorphs. The natural DNA transformation frequency was reduced 10-fold in these mutants. Southern analysis of chromosomal DNAs from various streptococcal species with the dltA probe revealed the presence of this gene in most viridans streptococci. Thus, it is hypothesized that D-alanyl LTA may provide binding sites for the putative 100-kDa adhesin and scaffolding for the proper presentation of this adhesin to mediate intrageneric coaggregation.
TI  - Probiotics inhibit enteropathogenic E. coli adherence in vitro by inducing intestinal mucin gene expression.
AB  - Probiotic agents, live microorganisms with beneficial effects for the host, may offer an alternative to conventional antimicrobials in the treatment and prevention of enteric infections. The probiotic agents Lactobacillus plantarum 299v and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG quantitatively inhibited the adherence of an attaching and effacing pathogenic Escherichia coli to HT-29 intestinal epithelial cells but did not inhibit adherence to nonintestinal HEp-2 cells. HT-29 cells were grown under conditions that induced high levels of either MUC2 or MUC3 mRNA, but HEp-2 cells expressed only minimal levels of MUC2 and no MUC3 mRNA. Media enriched for MUC2 and MUC3 mucin were added exogenously to binding assays and were shown to be capable of inhibiting enteropathogen adherence to HEp-2 cells. Incubation of L. plantarum 299v with HT-29 cells increased MUC2 and MUC3 mRNA expression levels. From these in vitro studies, we propose the hypothesis that the ability of probiotic agents to inhibit adherence of attaching and effacing organisms to intestinal epithelial cells is mediated through their ability to increase expression of MUC2 and MUC3 intestinal mucins.
TI  - Human ileostomy glycoproteins as a model for small intestinal mucus to investigate adhesion of probiotics.
AB  - Human ileostomy glycoproteins were used as a model for small intestinal mucus to  investigate the adhesion of 12 Lactobacillus strains, one Lactococcus strain and one Propionibacterium strain, Both probiotic and dairy strains were tested. Adhesive and non-adhesive Escherichia coli strains were used as controls. All the strains were also tested for their adhesion to polystyrene. Adhesion to ileostomy glycoproteins and to polystyrene varied significantly among the strains tested. Lactobacillus rhamnosus (human isolate), Lactobacillus GG, Lact. acidophilus 1 and P. freudenreichii adhered to ileostomy glycoproteins. Adhesion was concentration-dependent and the most adhesive strains were able to saturate the substratum. These results indicate that human ileostomy glycoproteins can be used as a model system to select potential probiotic strains to complement the adhesion test with intestinal cell lines.
TI  - Effect of nutrient composition on the in vitro growth of urogenital lactobacilli  and uropathogens.
AB  - Previous clinical studies have shown that nutrients and probiotic agents can alter the composition of the vaginal flora. The present in vitro study has shown that uropathogens have a growth advantage over lactobacilli, but potentially there are natural substances that could be applied vaginally to stimulate lactobacilli growth to the detriment of the pathogens. When chemically defined medium representative of vaginal fluid at pH 5.5 was supplemented with skim milk, it acted as a better substrate for Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 than for uropathogenic bacteria and Candida albicans. Lactobacillus MRS medium, even at pH 4.5, supports the growth of pathogens, but when supplemented with ascorbic acid or EDTA, Lactobacillus growth was significantly higher. When L. rhamnosus GR-1 was coincubated in a combined nutrient composition of vitamins and lactose, it survived better than Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. These in vitro results provide a basis for testing nutritional supplements to alter the urogenital flora in an attempt to enhance restoration and maintenance of a normal disease-free state.
TI  - The colonization of a simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem by a  probiotic strain fed on a fermented oat bran product: effects on the gastrointestinal microbiota.
AB  - The effects of Lactobacillus-GG-fermented oat bran product on the microbiota and  its metabolic activity in the human gut were investigated, using a simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (SHIME), by analysing the bacterial population, shortchain fatty acids and gas production. In addition, the effects of fermented oat bran supernatant and supernatant samples from reactors 4, 5 and 6 (large intestine) on the growth of Escherichia coli IHE 13047, Enterococcus faecalis VTT E-93203, Lactobacillus rhamnosus VTT E-94522 (Lactobacillus GG) and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis VTT E-90414 were monitored to ascertain possible stimulatory/inhibitory effects by an in vitro turbidometric method. Our experiments showed that Lactobacillus GG colonized the SHIME reactor and this colonization could be maintained for several weeks without extra supplementation. Oat bran feeding also favoured the growth of bifidobacteria and caused an increase in the production of acetic, propionic and butyric acid as well as CH4 and CO2. However, the effects of oat bran, either on bacterial populations or on their metabolic activity, were not directly dose-dependent. In turbidometric measurements, the supernatant of fermented oat bran exerted an inhibitory effect of Lactobacillus GG, but stimulated the growth of enterococci.
TI  - Adhesion of some probiotic and dairy Lactobacillus strains to Caco-2 cell cultures.
AB  - The adhesion of 12 different Lactobacillus strains was studied using Caco-2 cell  line as an in vitro model for intestinal epithelium. Some of the strains tested have been used as probiotics, and most of them are used in the dairy and food industry. Human and bovine enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli strains were used as positive and negative control, respectively. Bacterial adhesion to Caco-2 cell cultures was quantitated using radiolabelled bacteria. The adherence of bacteria was also observed microscopically after Gram staining. Viability of bacteria prior to adhesion was verified using flow cytometry. Among the tested strains, L. casei (Fyos) was the most adhesive strain and L. casei var. rhamnosus (Lactophilus) was the least adhesive strain, approximately 14 and 3% of the added bacteria adhered to Caco-2 cell cultures, respectively. The corresponding values for positive and negative control E. coli strains were 14 and 4%, respectively. The Lactobacillus strains tested could not be divided into distinctly adhesive or non-adhesive strains, since there was a continuation of adhesion rates. The four most adhesive strains were L. casei (Fyos), L. acidophilus 1 (LC1), L. rhamnosus LC-705 and Lactobacillus GG (ATCC 53103). No significant differences in the percentage adhesion were observed between these strains. Adhesion of all the strains was dependent on the number of bacteria used, since an approximately constant number of Caco-2 cells was used, indicating that the Caco-2 cell binding sites were not saturated. Viability of bacteria was high since approximately 90% of the bacteria were viable with the exception of L. acidophilus 1 which was 74% viable. Microscopic evaluations agreed with the radiolabelled binding as evidenced by observing more bacteria in Gram-stained preparations of good adhering strains compared to poorly adhering strains.
TI  - Vaginal application of lactobacilli in the prophylaxis of recurrent lower urinary tract infection in women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether vaginal application of Lactobacillus casei v. rhamnosus reduces the reinfection rate in cystitis-prone women. DESIGN: A controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. SETTING: Division for General Practice, University of Bergen, Norway. INTERVENTION: Vaginal application of lactobacilli twice weekly. SUBJECTS: 47 women, aged 18-50 years, reporting three or more episodes of distal urinary symptoms during the previous 12 months, of which at least one episode had been medically verified as a lower UTI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The incidence rate of lower UTI during 6 months' follow-up. RESULTS: No difference in infection rate between the two groups; the incidence rate ratio between the treatment group and the placebo group was 1.41 (95% confidence interval 0.88-1.98). Lactobacilli were not found more frequently periurethrally in the treatment group than in the control group. CONCLUSION: It is still uncertain whether vaginal application of lactobacilli reduces the infection rate in cystitis-prone women.
TI  - Detection of a Lactobacillus substance that inhibits Escherichia coli.
AB  - Recent studies have shown that certain lactobacilli strains have the ability to interfere with the adherence and growth of uropathogenic bacteria. This interaction is believed to be important in the maintenance of a normal urogenital flora and in the prevention of infection in females. In the present study, Lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus acidophilus 76 were found to exert an inhibitory effect on pyelonephritogenic mutant Escherichia coli Hu 734 and E. coli ATCC 25922. The bioactivity of the inhibitor produced by strain GR-1 was retained under pH buffered conditions and was bactericidal. The bioactive substance was heat labile, not precipitated by up to 80% ammonium sulphate, and extractable in chloroform. The data indicated that the inhibitor is not lactic acid or hydrogen peroxide and has a molecular weight greater than 12,000-14,000. Human urine supported production of the inhibitor and reduced and delayed outgrowth of the E. coli. The ability of L. casei GR-1 and possibly other lactobacilli strains to produce inhibitors of uropathogenic bacteria may have clinical importance and significance in the microbial ecology of the urogenital tract.
TI  - Lactobacillus inhibitor production against Escherichia coli and coaggregation ability with uropathogens.
AB  - Previous investigations have shown that certain strains of lactobacilli can competitively exclude uropathogens from attaching to uroepithelial cells and from causing urinary tract infection in animals. The finding of an inhibitory effect produced by Lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus GR-1 against the growth of uropathogens was investigated further using two Escherichia coli indicator strains Hu 734 and ATCC 25922. There were two phases to the inhibitor studies. The first one using an agar sandwich technique showed that the inhibitor activity was heat stable and inhibitory to the E. coli. The second phase showed that MRS broth provided optimum lactobacilli growth and inhibitor production. In addition, the inhibition was present under conditions buffering for acid and pH. The data indicated that the inhibitory effect was not due to bacteriophages or hydrogen peroxide. Strain GR-1 was found to coaggregate with E. coli ATCC 25922 in urine, a phenomenon that has not previously been reported for urogenital bacteria. An in vitro assay system was developed to study the coaggregation of various lactobacilli and uropathogens. The results demonstrated that highest coaggregation scores occurred after 4 h incubation at 37 degrees C with lactobacilli and two type-1 fimbriated E. coli strains. Of the nine lactobacilli strains tested, each was found to coaggregate with 2 or more of the 13 uropathogens. The dominance of inhibitor-producing lactobacilli on the urogenital epithelium and the ability of these organisms to interact closely with uropathogens would constitute an important host defense mechanism against infection.
