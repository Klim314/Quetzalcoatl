TI  == [antibacterial activity of synthetic antimicrobial decapeptide against oral bacteria].
AB  == objective: this study aims to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide, a novel antimicrobial peptide, against several major cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria in vitro. methods in this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide against streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and saccharomyces albicans in vitro using the agar diffusion method and broth dilution method. furthermore, a time-kill kinetic study of decapeptide against s. mutans was performed. results: the results showed that decapeptide exhibited antimicrobial activity against various  oral bacteria and fungi. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of main cariogenic bacteria ranged from 62.5 mug . ml(-1) to 125 mug . ml(-1), and the mic of periodontopathogenic bacteria tested ranged from 250 mug . ml(-1) to 1,000 mug . ml(-1). among the bacteria tested, decapeptide had a strong inhibitory effect on cariogenic s. mutans. results of the time-kill kinetic studies showed that decapeptide reduced the viable counts of s. mutans by more than one order of magnitude after 20 min of incubation, and thoroughly killed s. mutans after 30 min. no viable cells could be detected after 24 h of incubation. conclusion: this study suggest that decapeptide might have potential clinical application in treating dental caries by killing s. mutans within dental plaque.

TI  == opposite effect of supernatants from selected periopathogens and oral lactobacilli cultures on atp levels in human gingival fibroblasts.
AB  == studies were performed on the effects of supernatants obtained from bacterial cultures, including cultures of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and lactobacillus acidophilus strains on atp levels in human gingival fibroblasts (hgf-1) and on their viability. atp levels were evaluated using luminescence test and cell viability was estimated using a fluorescence test. in control cultures mean levels of atp in hgf-1 amounted to 4.90+/-0.32 mln rlu. supernatants of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans cultures were found to significantly reduce atp production  in hgf-1 (mean levels of atp amounted to 3.41+/-0.33 and 3.55+/-0.3 mln rlu respectively), which was not accompanied by an increased proportion of dead fibroblasts. supernatants of p. intermedia induced no significant alterations in  atp level in hgf-1. in turn, supernatants of l. acidophilus h2o2 (+) and h2o2 (-) cultures significantly increased atp levels in hgf-1 (the mean levels amounted to 5.94+/-0.31 mln rlu and 5.88+/-0.28 mln rlu respectively). the results indicate that extracellular products of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans most probably represent mitochondria-targeted peptides, which reduce synthesis of atp  in hgf-1. in turn, extracellular products of l. acidophilus seem to represent exopolysaccharides (eps) with pro-oxidant activity, which stimulate synthesis of  atp in hgf-1.

TI  == the protective effect of recombinant foma-expressing lactobacillus acidophilus against periodontal infection.
AB  == a number of studies have shown that the outer membrane protein foma found in fusobacterium nucleatum demonstrates great potential as an immune target for combating periodontitis. lactobacillus acidophilus is a useful antigen delivery vehicle for mucosal immunisation, and previous studies by our group have shown that l. acidophilus acts as a protective factor in periodontal health. in this study, making use of the immunogenicity of foma and the probiotic properties of l. acidophilus, we constructed a recombinant form of l. acidophilus expressing the foma protein and detected the foma-specific igg in the serum and siga in the  saliva of mice through oral administration with the recombinant strains. when serum containing foma-specific antibodies was incubated with the f. nucleatum in  vitro, the number of porphyromonas gingivalis cells that coaggregated with the f. nucleatum cells was significantly reduced. furthermore, a mouse gum abscess model was successfully generated, and the range of gingival abscesses in the immune mice was relatively limited compared with the control group. the level of il-1beta in the serum and local gum tissues of the immune mice was consistently lower than in the control group. our findings indicated that oral administration  of the recombinant l. acidophilus reduced the risk of periodontal infection with  p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum.

TI  == effect of porphyromonas gingivalis and lactobacillus acidophilus on secretion of  il1b, il6, and il8 by gingival epithelial cells.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis alters cytokine expression in gingival epithelial cells, stimulating inflammatory responses that may lead to periodontal disease. this study explored the effect of lactobacillus acidophilus on the specific expressions of the interleukins (ils) il1b, il6, and il8 induced by the pathogen. human gingival epithelial cells were co-cultured with p. gingivalis, l. acidophilus, or l. acidophilus + p. gingivalis; the control group consisted of the cells alone. protein and gene expression levels of the ils were detected using elisa and qrt-pcr, respectively. the supernatant from the p. gingivalis group held significantly higher protein and mrna levels of il1b, il6, and il8, compared to the control group. in the mixed bacterial group (l. acidophilus + p.  gingivalis), the levels of all three ils decreased with increasing concentrations of l. acidophilus and were significantly different from the p. gingivalis group.  this suggests that in gingival cells, l. acidophilus offsets the p. gingivalis-induced secretion of these ils in a dose-dependent manner.

TI  == [antagonistic effects of lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium adolescents on periodontalpathogens in vitro].
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the possible antagonistic effects of lactobacillus acidophilus (la) and bifidobacterium adolescents (ba) on porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and fusobacteriurn nuclearum (fn). methods: cylinder plate method was used to observe the inhibition zone formation.the suspensions of periodontal pathogens were mixed with cell free solutions of probiotics respectively, to investigate the antagonistic effect on the production of probiotics. the data were analyzed by anova using sas 9.0 software package. results: la only inhibited the growth of pg. the cell free extract of la also significantly inhibited the growth of pg (p<0.001). there was no antagonistic effect of ba on the two periodontal pathogens. conclusions: la strongly inhibits the growth of pg by its metabolites. the new strategy of confining periodontal pathogens with la as ecological modulator is worthy of further study.

TI  == effect of the antimicrobial decapeptide ksl on the growth of oral pathogens and streptococcus mutans biofilm.
AB  == dental caries and periodontitis are common oral bacterial infectious diseases. their prevention and treatment requires control of the causative pathogens, such  as streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis, that exist within dental plaque. as one of the attractive future substitutes for conventional antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides (amps), both natural and synthetic, have been widely tested and used for controlling bacterial infections. in this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of ksl (kkvvfkvkfk-nh(2)), a novel amp, against several major cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria as well as candida albicans in vitro. streptococcus mutans, the causative agent of dental caries, was chosen for in-depth testing. bacterial susceptibility and time-kill assays were performed to investigate the sensitivity of s. mutans to ksl. the effect of ksl on biofilm formation and on pre-formed biofilm was also examined. for biofilm studies, confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) was used to observe and analyse bacterial biofilm. the results showed that ksl had antimicrobial activity against a variety of oral bacteria and fungi. streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus acidophilus were the most susceptible strains to ksl peptide [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 0.0625 mg/ml] compared with other species tested (mics of 0.125-1mg/ml). ksl also inhibited s.  mutans biofilm formation, with a minimum biofilm inhibition concentration of 0.0625-0.125 mg/ml, and reduced 1-day-old developed s. mutans biofilm, with a minimum biofilm reduction concentration of 0.25-0.5mg/ml. clsm images showed that ksl significantly reduced the viability of biofilm cells. this study suggests that ksl may have a potential clinical application in treating dental caries by killing s. mutans within dental plaque.

TI  == competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == objective: to investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. material and methods: the antimicrobial activity  of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains.  four probiotic bacterial species (lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium) were isolated from  yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. results: fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. in addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', streptococcus sanguinis. the competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. when probiotics were inoculated first, bifidobacterium inhibited porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas circumdentaria, and prevotella nigrescens; l. acidophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. circumdentaria, p. nigrescens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius; l. bulgaricus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. nigrescens; and s. thermophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and p. nigrescens. however, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens)  were inoculated simultaneously. when periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, prevotella intermedia inhibited bifidobacterium and s. thermophilus. conclusions: the results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are  capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.

TI  == methods for optimizing dna extraction before quantifying oral bacterial numbers by real-time pcr.
AB  == methods for the optimal extraction of genomic dna for real-time pcr enumeration of oral bacteria using the muramidase, mutanolysin, were developed using a simple in vitro oral flora model comprised of the facultative anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, lactobacillus acidophilus and streptococcus mutans, the gram-positive anaerobe, parvimonas micra, and the gram-negative anaerobes, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica and fusobacterium nucleatum. traditional, as well as more elaborate, methods of quantifying bacterial numbers, including colony counting and estimation of dna content using 4',6-diamino-2-phenylindole were compared in order to validate the real-time pcr approach. evidence was obtained that p. gingivalis nuclease activity adversely affected the extraction of double-stranded dna from this bacterium either alone or when it formed part of a consortium with the other bacteria. this nuclease activity could be overcome by treatment of the bacteria with either 20 mm diethyl pyrocarbonate or 70% ethanol  at 4 degrees c overnight. a final purification of the dna to remove any potential pcr inhibitors was added to the protocol in order to accurately quantify the amount of dna by real-time pcr and hence the number of bacteria in a sample.

TI  == does strontium play a role in the cariostatic activity of glass ionomer? strontium diffusion and antibacterial activity.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of strontium ions on the main pathogens of the oral flora. the leaching of strontium from resin modified glass ionomer cements (rmgic) was evaluated together with its uptake by  superficial dental enamel. methods: the antibacterial activity was measured by the growth inhibition method following exposure of supra- and sub-gingival bacteria to a range of strontium concentrations (0.19 moll(-1), 0.37 moll(-1), 0.74 moll(-1) and 1.11 moll(-1)). strontium concentrations were analyzed chemically and migration at 5 microm and 15 microm depths was quantified by microprobe following fuji ortho lc application on the vestibular enamel of extracted teeth. results: strontium was found in appreciable amounts (0.8 wt.%) in superficial enamel, but in insignificant concentrations deeper in. at the same time, 8% fluoroapatite was formed in the enamel. under our experimental conditions, strontium had no significant antibacterial activity; only one log reduction of activity was observed at the highest concentrations tested. conclusions: rmgic releases strontium ions which are rapidly exchanged for calcium ions in the superficial enamel. no significant antibacterial activity was observed for strontium ions alone at the concentrations considered. however synergistic effects with fluoride could promote antibacterial activity.

TI  == strong antibacterial effect of miswak against oral microorganisms associated with periodontitis and caries.
AB  == background: the chewing stick (miswak) is used for oral hygiene in many parts of  the world. in addition to the mechanical removal of plaque, an antibacterial effect has been postulated; however, tests of miswak extract from salvadora persica (arak) disclosed only low to moderate antibacterial effects. this may be  attributable to the extraction process. our aim was to test in vitro the antibacterial effect of miswak pieces, without extraction, on bacteria implicated in the etiology of periodontitis and caries. methods: miswak pieces were standardized by size and weight (0.07 and 0.14 g) and tested against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and, as a reference, haemophilus influenzae. the miswak pieces were tested in two ways: embedded in the agar plate or suspended above the agar plate. results: the inhibitory effect was most pronounced on p. gingivalis,  a. actinomycetemcomitans, and h. influenzae, less on s. mutans, and least on l. acidophilus. suspended miswak had comparable or stronger effects than miswak embedded in agar. the 0.14-g suspended miswak exhibited significantly greater inhibition on a. actinomycetemcomitans and h. influenzae than the 0.14-g miswak embedded in agar (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). conclusions: miswak embedded in agar or suspended above the agar plate had strong antibacterial effects against all bacteria tested. the antibacterial effect of suspended miswak pieces  suggests the presence of volatile active antibacterial compounds.

TI  == targeted profiling of oral bacteria in human saliva and in vitro biofilms with quantitative real-time pcr.
AB  == an in vitro plaque model based on the use of human salivary bacteria and tooth-like surfaces was previously developed for studying the formation of oral biofilm and its use for pre-clinical testing of candidate antimicrobial or antiplaque agents. in this study, a quantitative taqman pcr assay (qpcr) was developed to compare the bacterial compositions of in vitro biofilms to parent saliva samples, and to determine the relative contributions of different species  in the formation of the oral biofilm. in addition, the growth inhibition of saliva-derived plaque was evaluated by chlorhexidine. with this assay, which consisted of primer/probe sets targeting either 16s rdna sequences present in public databases or cloned ribosomal intergenic spacer region (isr) sequences, 15 oral bacteria derived from saliva as well as those that were responsible for biofilm formation in an in vitro plaque model were rapidly identified and quantified. among the target organisms were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, micromonas micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, tannerella forsythensis, and veillonella parvula. primer and probe sets developed were both sensitive and specific. the relative profiles of a number of bacteria in 45-h-old biofilms were determined and, when compared to saliva samples, it was found that most of the bacteria identified in  saliva also populated the in vitro plaque, including some anaerobes. brief exposure of biofilms to chlorhexidine resulted in significant losses in viability. this new broad spectrum qpcr assay in combination with the in vitro plaque model will be of significant value in the quantitative study of the microbial composition of human saliva, saliva-derived plaque, and pre-clinical evaluation of potential antimicrobial and antiplaque molecules.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis samples from different geographical origins against certain oral pathogens.
AB  == propolis is an agent having antimicrobial properties, however, its composition can vary depending on the area where it is collected. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of five propolis samples, collected from four different regions in turkey and from brazil, against nine anaerobic strains was evaluated.  ethanol extracts of propolis (eep) were prepared from propolis samples and we determined minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) of eep on the growth of test microorganisms by using agar dilution method. all strains were susceptible and mic values ranged from 4 to 512 microg/ml for propolis activity. propolis from kazan-ankara showed most effective mic values to the studied microorganisms. mbc values of kazan-ankara eep samples  were ranged from 8 to 512 microg/ml. death was observed within 4 h of incubation  for peptostreptococcus anaerobius and micros and lactobacillus acidophilus and actinomyces naeslundii, while 8 h for prevotella oralis and prevotella melaninogenica and porphyromonas gingivalis, 12 h for fusobacterium nucleatum, 16 h for veillonella parvula. it was shown that propolis samples were more effective against gram positive anaerobic bacteria than gram negative ones. the organic chemical compositions of eeps were determined by high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (gc-ms). the main compounds of eeps were flavonoids such as pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine, chrysin and aromatic acids such as cafeic acid. because of increased antimicrobial resistance, propolis may be kept in mind in the treatment of oral cavity diseases.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrate and nitrite on six common oral pathogens in vitro.
AB  == background: salivary nitrate is positively correlated with plasma nitrate and its level is 9 times the plasma level after nitrate loading. nitrate in saliva is known to be reduced to nitrite by oral bacteria. nitrate and nitrite levels in saliva are 3 - 5 times those in serum in physiological conditions respectively in our previous study. the biological functions of high salivary nitrate and nitrite are still not well understood. the aim of this in vitro study was to investigate  the antimicrobial effects of nitrate and nitrite on main oral pathogens under acidic conditions. methods: six common oral pathogens including streptococcus mutans nctc 10449, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4646, porphyromonas gingivalis  atcc 33277, capnocytophaga gingivalis atcc 33624, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953, and candida albicans atcc 10231 were cultured in liquid medium. sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite was added to the medium to final concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 10 mmol/l. all of the microorganisms were incubated for 24 to 48 hours. the optical densities (od) of cell suspensions were determined and the cultures were transferred to solid nutrient broth medium to observe the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration for the six tested pathogens. results: nitrite at concentrations of 0.5 to 10 mmol/l  had an inhibitory effect on all tested organisms at low ph values. the antimicrobial effect of nitrite increased with the acidity of the medium. streptococcus mutans nctc 10449 was highly sensitive to nitrite at low ph values. lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4646 and candida albicans atcc 10231 were relatively resistant to acidified nitrite. nitrate at the given concentrations and under acidic conditions had no inhibitory effect on the growth of any of the  tested pathogens. conclusion: nitrite, at a concentration equal to that in human  saliva, is both cytocidal and cytostatic to six principal oral pathogens in vitro, whereas nitrate at a similar concentration has no antimicrobial effect on  these organisms.

TI  == red autofluorescence of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == red autofluorescence of plaque and its relation to fluorescence of a single species in the biofilm was studied. fluorescence images of non-disclosed and disclosed plaque of 28 first-year students were captured. the plaque samples were assessed by culture methods and studied for red autofluorescence. species capable of producing red autofluorescence were cultivated from subjects with and without  red plaque autofluorescence. red autofluorescence was observed from actinomyces odontolyticus, prevotella intermedia and from porphyromonas gingivalis and peptostreptococcus micros grown together. the microbial findings indicated that the intrinsic characteristics of the mature biofilm itself are more responsible for the red autofluorescence than the characteristics of the single species.

TI  == pectin-like acidic polysaccharide from panax ginseng with selective antiadhesive  activity against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == previous studies have revealed the inhibitory effects of an acidic polysaccharide purified from the root of panax ginseng against the adhesion of helicobacter pylori to gastric epithelial cells and the ability of porphyromonas gingivalis to agglutinate erythrocytes. in this study, this acidic polysaccharide from p. ginseng, pg-f2, was investigated further, in order to characterize its antiadhesive effects against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, propionibacterium acnes, and staphylococcus aureus. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were found to be in a range of 0.25-0.5mg/ml. however, results showed no inhibitory effects of pg-f2 against lactobacillus acidophilus,  escherichia coli, or staphylococcus epidermidis. pg-f2 is a pectin-type polysaccharide with a mean mw of 1.2 x 10(4) da, and consists primarily of galacturonic and glucuronic acids along with rhamnose, arabinose, and galactose as minor components. the complete hydrolysis of pg-f2 via chemical or carbohydrolase enzyme treatment resulted in the abrogation of its antiadhesive activity, but limited hydrolysis via treatment with pectinase (ec. 3.2.1.15) yielded an oligosaccharide fraction, with activity comparable to the precursor pg-f2 (the mic of ca. 0.01 mg/ml against h. pylori and p. gingivalis). our results suggest that pg-f2 may exert a selective antiadhesive effect against pathogenic bacteria, while having no effects on beneficial and commensal bacteria.

TI  == effect of oral bacteria on growth and survival of candida albicans biofilms.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of eight aerobic and anaerobic oral commensal bacterial species on in vitro candida albicans biofilm development. a single isolate of c. albicans 2560 g, and eight different species  of oral bacteria comprising, actinomyces israelii, lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus intermedius were studied using an in vitro biofilm assay. biofilm formation was quantified in terms of the ability of candida to grow on polystyrene plastic surfaces co-cultured with the foregoing bacteria. a viable cell count was used to quantify the sessile yeast growth and scanning electron microscopy was employed to confirm and visualize biofilm formation. co-culture with differing concentrations of bacteria had variable effects on candida biofilm formation. co-culture with the highest concentrations of each of the foregoing bacteria resulted in a consistent reduction in the yeast counts in the candidal biofilm (p<0.05), except for l. acidophilus, s. mutans, and, s. intermedius co-cultures. further, on regression analysis a significant negative correlation between the co-culture concentration  of either p. gingivalis or e. coli and viable yeast counts in the biofilm was noted (p<0.05) although this was not evident for the other bacterial species. taken together, our data indicate that, quantitative and qualitative nature of the bacteria modulate c. albicans biofilm formation in mixed species environments such as the oral cavity.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial and resistance-modifying activities of aqueous crude khat  extracts against oral microorganisms.
AB  == objectives: to assess antimicrobial activities of aqueous crude khat (catha edulis) extracts against a panel of oral microorganisms and to test their ability to modify bacterial resistance to tetracycline and penicillin in vitro. design: lyophilized aqueous extracts were prepared from three khat cultivars. the agar dilution method of the nccls was used to test the extracts, at concentrations of  20-1.25 mg/ml, against 33 oral strains. mic was defined as the lowest concentration at which there was no visible growth. slight growth was defined as  marked growth reduction (mgr). the e-test was used to determine the mics of tetracycline and penicillin-g for three resistant strains in absence and presence of a sub-mic of the khat extracts (5mg/ml). results: eighteen strains (55%) were  sensitive to the extracts (mics 5-20 mg/ml). most of these were periodontal pathogens with porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythensis being the most susceptible (mic 5-10mg/ml). veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii and some streptococci were not sensitive. except for lactobacillus acidophilus that showed mgr at 1mg/ml, cariogenic species were neither sensitive. the extracts were active against streptococcus pyogenes (mic 10-20 mg/ml) but not against candida albicans and staphylococcus aureus. the presence of the khat extracts at  a sub-mic resulted in a 2-4-fold potentiation of the tested antibiotics against the resistant strains. conclusions: khat has water-soluble constituents possessing selective antibacterial activity against oral bacteria. there is preliminary evidence for presence of an antibiotic resistance-modifying component. further investigation is needed to identify the active components and  assess their clinical relevance.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == [dynamic observation of periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria in modified chemostat using confocal laser scanning microscopy].
AB  == objective: to study dynamic relation between periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria under analogous oral environment. methods: eight periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), provotella intermedium  (pi), streptococcus mutans (sm), streptococcus sanguis (ss), actinomyces viscosus (av) and lactobacillus acidophilus (la) were used. these eight strains were cultured in modified chemostat under analogous oral environment which contained 600 ml modified bm medium supplemented with 2.5 g/l porcine gastric mucin, respectively. after 1, 24, 48 and 96 h, optical sectioning of plaque biofilms on  removable and replaceable hydroxyapatite disks was analyzed by the combination of live bacterial gram fluorescence staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy. biofilm thickness and reconstruction of the three-dimensional architecture of plaque biofilms were made. results: biofilm thickness increased significantly with time (p < 0.001). biofilms of aa were thinner than those of ss and eight-specie biofilms were thicker than those formed by ss and aa per time point. three-dimensional images showed periodontal pathogens mainly occurred in cariogenic bacterial complex or on the biofilm surface. conclusions: gram-positive cariogenic species initially predominated in artificial plaque, followed by the increasing proportions of gram-negative periodontal pathogens. the relation between microecological balance among bacteria and diseases is worthy of further studies.

AB  == the aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult sudanese. whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva  and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. there were significantly ( p< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, veillonella parvula, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus salivarius, and leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( p< or =0.01) lower percentages with treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. the detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for selenomonas sputigena, s. anginosus, streptococcus sanguis, and s. salivarius and significantly lower for porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( p< or =0.01). porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, s. sputigena, s. sanguis, and streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( p< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. this study indicates that the levels of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, s.  sanguis, and s. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and  subgingival plaque.

TI  == antibacterial activity of fifth-generation dentin bonding systems.
AB  == past concepts that the pulp does not become infected until an actual carious exposure takes place have been challenged. the antibacterial effects of the dentin bonding systems single bond, prime&bond nt, and excite were evaluated using the bacteria streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, streptococcus intermedius, lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella oris, prevotella bivia, prevotella denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, and clostridium  ramosum with a disk diffusion method. chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. after incubation zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. prime&bond nt showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. lactobacillus acidophilus and streptococcus mutans were remarkably resistant to single bond, whereas ex produced no inhibitory effect on porphyromonas endodontalis, although  the adhesive produced the maximum halo inhibition to streptococcus mutans (15+/-1 mm), showing an antibacterial effect closest to chlorhexidine. the variety of results obtained in this study suggest that antibacterial properties of current dentin adhesives may depend on components that are originally incorporated to promote adhesion.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  == bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of  ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.

TI  == studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.
