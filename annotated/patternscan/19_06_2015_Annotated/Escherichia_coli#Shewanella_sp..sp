TI  == comprehensive characterization of sphingolipid ceramide n-deacylase for the synthesis and fatty acid remodeling of glycosphingolipids.
AB  == sphingolipid ceramide n-deacylase (scdase) catalyzes reversible reactions in which the amide linkage in glycosphingolipids is hydrolyzed or synthesized. while scdases show great value for the enzymatic synthesis of glycosphingolipids, they  are relatively poorly characterized enzymes. in this work, the enzymatic properties of scdase from shewanella alga g8 (sa_scd) were systematically characterized and compared with the commercially available scdase from pseudomonas sp. tk4 (ps_scd). the optimal ph values for the hydrolytic and synthetic activity of sa_scd were ph 6.0 and ph 7.5, respectively. both activities were strongly inhibited by zn2+ and cu2+, while fe2+, co2+, ni2+, mn2+, ca2+, and mg2+ promoted the hydrolytic activity but inhibited the synthetic activity. sa_scd showed very broad substrate specificity both in hydrolysis and synthesis. importantly, sa_scd has a broader specificity for acyl donor acceptance than does ps_scd, especially for unsaturated fatty acids and fatty acids with very short or long acyl chains. further kinetic analysis revealed that the k cat/k m value for the hydrolytic activity of sa_scd was 8.9-fold higher than that of ps_scd for gm1a, while the values for the synthetic activity were 38-fold higher for stearic acid and 23-fold higher for lyso-gm1a (d18:1) than those of ps_scd, respectively. the broad fatty acid specificity and high catalytic efficiency, together with the ease of expression of sa_scd in escherichia coli, make it a better biocatalyst than is ps_scd for the synthesis and structural remodeling of glycosphingolipids.

TI  == purification of a secreted lectin from andrias davidianus skin and its antibacterial activity.
AB  == a lectin secreted from andrias davidianus skin (adl) was purified by affinity chromatography on porcine stomach mucin (type iii) (psm)-crosslinked albumin, followed by gel filtration on sephadex g-100 and hplc on tsk gel g3000pwxl. the purified lectin was found to be a dimeric protein, as revealed by sds-page and maldi-tof analysis. sds-page showed that the adl protein had a molecular mass of  17 kda. adl produced an 8.5 kda band when examined using sds-page under reducing  conditions. adl agglutinated native and trypsinized human b erythrocytes. the hemagglutination activity was inhibited by glycoproteins, such as psm and asialo-psm, but not by any of the monosaccharides tested. the activity was stable between 4 degrees c and 50 degrees c. significant adl activity was observed between ph 4-5. the lectin reaction did not depend on the presence of the divalent cation ca2+ or mg2+. the n-terminal adl sequence was determined to be vgytvgatpm. the lectin exhibited antibacterial activity, involving growth and respiration inhibition in escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and shewanella sp. furthermore, adl showed inhibition activity against the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. these findings suggest that adl plays an important role in the innate immunity of a. davidianus on the body surface.

TI  == cloning, overexpression and characterization of a new oligoalginate lyase from a  marine bacterium, shewanella sp.
AB  == purpose of work: is to report an oligoalginate lyase with high enzymatic activity and high-level expression. using site-finding pcr and degenerate pcr, a gene (designated oals17) encoding a new oligoalginate lyase was cloned from shewanella sp. kz7 and expressed in escherichia coli. the gene consisted of 2,292 bp with deduced amino acid size of 763 including a putative signal peptide of 44 amino acid residues belonging to polysaccharide lyase (pl) family 17. the recombinant protein was most active at 50 degrees c and ph 6.2 in 50 mm phosphate buffer. it  degraded alginate more efficiently than polym and polyg block into a monomeric sugar acid, with a specific activity of 32 u mg(-1) toward alginate, 24 u mg(-1)  toward polym and 5 u mg(-1) toward polyg. with the high-level expression and high enzymatic activity, the recombinant oligoalginate lyase oals17 could be a potential enzyme for further research on alginate saccharification and biofuels production.

TI  == cold adaptation: structural and functional characterizations of psychrophilic and mesophilic acetate kinase.
AB  == acetate kinase catalyzes the reversible magnesium-dependent phosphoryl transfer from atp to acetate to form acetyl phosphate and adp. here, we report functional  and some structural properties of cold-adapted psychrotrophic enzyme; acetate kinase with those from mesophilic counterpart in escherichia coli k-12. recombinant acetate kinase from shewanella sp. as-11 (sak) and e. coli k-12 (eak) were purified to homogeneity following affinity chromatography and followed by super q column chromatography as reported before [44]. both purified enzymes are  shared some of the common properties such as (similar molecular mass, amino acid  sequence and similar optimum ph), but characterized shift in the apparent optimum temperature of specific activity to lower temperature as well as by a lower thermal stability compared with eak. the functional comparisons reveal that sak is a cold adapted enzyme, having a higher affinity to acetate than eak. in the acetyl phosphate and adp-forming direction, the catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/k(m)) for acetate was 8.0 times higher for sak than eak at 10 degrees c.  the activity ratio of sak to eak was increased with decreasing temperature in both of the forward and backward reactions. furthermore, the activation energy, enthalpy and entropy in both reaction directions that catalyzed by sak were lower than those catalyzed by eak. the model structure of sak showed the significantly  reduced numbers of salt bridges and cation-pi interactions as compared with eak.  these results suggest that weakening of intramolecular electrostatic interactions of sak is involved in a more flexible structure which is likely to be responsible for its cold adaptation.

TI  == antioxidant and antimicrobial potential of the bifurcaria bifurcata epiphytic bacteria.
AB  == surface-associated marine bacteria are an interesting source of new secondary metabolites. the aim of this study was the isolation and identification of epiphytic bacteria from the marine brown alga, bifurcaria bifurcata, and the evaluation of the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of bacteria extracts. the identification of epiphytic bacteria was determined by 16s rrna gene sequencing. bacteria extracts were obtained with methanol and dichloromethane (1:1) extraction. the antioxidant activity of extracts was performed by quantification of total phenolic content (tpc), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph) radical scavenging activity and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (orac). antimicrobial activities were evaluated against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida albicans. a total of 39 bifurcaria bifurcata-associated bacteria were isolated and 33 were identified as vibrio sp.  (48.72%), alteromonas sp. (12.82%), shewanella sp. (12.26%), serratia sp. (2.56%), citricoccus sp. (2.56%), cellulophaga sp. (2.56%), ruegeria sp. (2.56%)  and staphylococcus sp. (2.56%). six (15.38%) of the 39 bacteria bifurcaria bifurcata-associated bacteria presented less than a 90% basic local alignment search tool (blast) match, and some of those could be new. the highest antioxidant activity and antimicrobial activity (against b. subtilis) was exhibited by strain 16 (shewanella sp.). several strains also presented high antimicrobial activity against s. aureus, mainly belonging to alteromonas sp. and vibrio sp. there were no positive results against fungi and gram-negative bacteria. bifurcaria bifurcata epiphytic bacteria were revealed to be excellent sources of natural antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds.

TI  == tolerance of anaerobic bacteria to chlorinated solvents.
AB  == the aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of four chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (cahs), perchloroethene (pce), carbon tetrachloride (ct),  chloroform (cf) and 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-dca), on the growth of eight anaerobic bacteria: four fermentative species (escherichia coli, klebsiella sp.,  clostridium sp. and paenibacillus sp.) and four respiring species (pseudomonas aeruginosa, geobacter sulfurreducens, shewanella oneidensis and desulfovibrio vulgaris). effective concentrations of solvents which inhibited growth rates by 50% (ec50) were determined. the octanol-water partition coefficient or log po/w of a cah proved a generally satisfactory measure of its toxicity. most species tolerated approximately 3-fold and 10-fold higher concentrations of the two relatively more polar cahs cf and 1,2-dca, respectively, than the two relatively  less polar compounds pce and ct. ec50 values correlated well with growth rates observed in solvent-free cultures, with fast-growing organisms displaying higher  tolerance levels. overall, fermentative bacteria were more tolerant to cahs than  respiring species, with iron- and sulfate-reducing bacteria in particular appearing highly sensitive to cahs. these data extend the current understanding of the impact of cahs on a range of anaerobic bacteria, which will benefit the field of bioremediation.

TI  == expression, purification, and characterization of cold-adapted inorganic pyrophosphatase from psychrophilic shewanella sp. as-11.
AB  == in the presence of divalent cations, inorganic pyrophosphatase is activated to hydrolyze inorganic pyrophosphate to inorganic phosphate. here, we clone, express, purify, and characterize inorganic pyrophosphatase from the psychrophilic shewanella sp. as-11 (sh-ppase). the recombinant sh-ppase was expressed in escherichia coli bl21 (de3) at 20 degrees c using pet16b as an expression vector and purified from the cell extracts by a combination of ammonium sulfate fractionation and anion-exchange chromatography. sh-ppase was found to be a family ii ppase with a subunit molecular mass of 34 kd that preferentially utilizes mn(2)(+) over mg(2)(+) ions for activity. the functional  characteristics of sh-ppase, such as activity, temperature dependency, and thermal inactivation, were greatly influenced by manganese ions. manganese ion activation increased the enzyme's activity at low temperatures; therefore, it was required to gain the cold-adapted characteristics of sh-ppase.

TI  == changes in translational efficiency is a dominant regulatory mechanism in the environmental response of bacteria.
AB  == to understand how cell physiological state affects mrna translation, we used shewanella oneidensis mr-1 grown under steady state conditions at either 20% or 8.5% o2. using a combination of quantitative proteomics and rna-seq, we generated high-confidence data on >1000 mrna and protein pairs. by using a steady state model, we found that differences in protein-mrna ratios were primarily due to differences in the translational efficiency of specific genes. when oxygen levels were lowered, 28% of the proteins showed at least a 2-fold change in expression.  transcription levels were sp. significantly altered for 26% of the protein changes; translational efficiency was significantly altered for 46% and a combination of both was responsible for the remaining 28%. changes in translational efficiency were significantly correlated with the codon usage pattern of the genes and measurable trna pools changed in response to altered o2  levels. our results suggest that changes in the translational efficiency of proteins, in part due to altered trna pools, is a major determinant of regulated  alterations in protein expression levels in bacteria.

TI  == n-acetylgalactosamine utilization pathway and regulon in proteobacteria: genomic  reconstruction and experimental characterization in shewanella.
AB  == we used a comparative genomics approach to reconstruct the n-acetyl-d-galactosamine (galnac) and galactosamine (galn) utilization pathways and transcriptional regulons in proteobacteria. the reconstructed galnac/galn utilization pathways include multiple novel genes with specific functional roles. most of the pathway variations were attributed to the amino sugar transport, phosphorylation, and deacetylation steps, whereas the downstream catabolic enzymes in the pathway were largely conserved. the predicted galnac kinase agak,  the novel variant of galnac-6-phosphate deacetylase agaa(ii) and the galn-6-phosphate deaminase agas from shewanella sp. ana-3 were validated in vitro using individual enzymatic assays and reconstitution of the three-step pathway. by using genetic techniques, we confirmed that agas but not agai functions as the main galn-6-p deaminase in the galnac/galn utilization pathway in escherichia coli. regulons controlled by agar repressors were reconstructed by bioinformatics in most proteobacterial genomes encoding galnac pathways. candidate agar-binding  motifs share a common sequence with consensus ctttc that was found in multiple copies and arrangements in regulatory regions of aga genes. this study provides comprehensive insights into the common and distinctive features of the galnac/galn catabolism and its regulation in diverse proteobacteria.

TI  == fluorescence studies on the stability, flexibility and substrate-induced conformational changes of acetate kinases from psychrophilic and mesophilic bacteria.
AB  == the acetate kinase from the antarctic psychrophilic shewanella sp. as-11 (sak) has a significantly higher catalytic efficiency at low temperatures when compared with that from mesophilic escherichia coli k-12 (eak). to examine the stability and conformational flexibility of sak and eak, steady state intrinsic fluorescence studies were performed. eak contains only one trp at a position 46,  while sak contains two trps at positions 46 and 388. from the fluorescence emission spectra, quenching with acrylamide, cs(+) and i(-) at different temperatures and denaturation with guanidine-hcl, it was revealed that the sak bears more flexible and unstable structure than that of eak. substrate-induced conformational changes reflect that sak reached transition state through more conformational changes than eak. in combination of our thermodynamic studies on the enzymatic reaction and present research findings, it can be concluded that these structural features of sak may contribute to its high catalytic efficiency  at low temperatures.

TI  == coastal seawater bacteria harbor a large reservoir of plasmid-mediated quinolone  resistance determinants in jiaozhou bay, china.
AB  == diversity and prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants were investigated in environmental bacteria isolated from surface seawater of jiaozhou bay, china. five qnr gene alleles were identified in 34 isolates by pcr  amplification, including qnra3 gene in a shewanella algae isolate, qnrb9 gene in  a citrobacter freundii isolate, qnrd gene in 22 proteus vulgaris isolates, qnrs1  gene in 1 enterobacter sp. and 4 klebsiella spp. isolates, and qnrs2 gene in 1 pseudomonas sp. and 4 pseudoalteromonas sp. isolates. the qnrc, aac(6')-ib-cr, and qepa genes could not be detected in this study. the 22 qnrd-positive proteus  vulgaris isolates could be differentiated into four genotypes based on eric-pcr assay. the qnrs1 and qnrd genes could be transferred to escherichia coli j53 azi(r) or e. coli top10 recipient strains using conjugation or transformation methods. among the 34 qnr-positive isolates, 30 had a single point mutation in the qrdrs of gyra protein (ala67ser, ser83ile, or ser83thr), indicating that cooperation of chromosome- and plasmid-mediated resistance contributed to the spread and evolution of quinolone resistance in this coastal bay. eighty-five percent of the isolates were also found to be resistant to ampicillin, and bla(cmy), bla(oxy), bla(shv), and bla(tem) genes were detected in five isolates that also harbored the qnrb9 or qnrs1 gene. our current study is the first identification of qnrs2 gene in pseudoalteromonas and pseudomonas strains, and qnrd gene in proteus vulgaris strains. high prevalence of diverse qnr genes in jiaozhou bay indicates that coastal seawater may serve as an important reservoir, natural source, and dissemination vehicle of quinolone resistance determinants.

TI  == the acid-tolerant l-arabinose isomerase from the mesophilic shewanella sp. ana-3  is highly active at low temperatures.
AB  == background: l-arabinose isomerases catalyse the isomerization of l-arabinose into l-ribulose at insight biological systems. at industrial scale of this enzyme is used for the bioconversion of d-galactose into d-tagatose which has many applications in pharmaceutical and agro-food industries. the isomerization reaction is thermodynamically equilibrated, and therefore the bioconversion rates is shifted towards tagatose when the temperature is increased. moreover, to prevent secondary reactions it will be of interest to operate at low ph. the profitability of this d-tagatose production process is mainly related to the use  of lactose as cheaper raw material. in many dairy products it will be interesting to produce d-tagatose during storage. this requires an efficient l-arabinose isomerase acting at low temperature and ph values. results: the gene encoding the l-arabinose isomerase from shewanella sp. ana-3 was cloned and overexpressed in escherichia coli. the purified protein has a tetrameric arrangement composed by four identical 55 kda subunits. the biochemical characterization of this enzyme showed that it was distinguishable by its maximal activity at low temperatures comprised between 15-35 degrees c. interestingly, this biocatalyst preserves more than 85% of its activity in a broad range of temperatures from 4.0 to 45 degrees  c. shewanella sp. ana-3 l-arabinose isomerase was also optimally active at ph 5.5-6.5 and maintained over 80% of its activity at large ph values from 4.0 to 8.5. furthermore, this enzyme exhibited a weak requirement for metallic ions for  its activity evaluated at 0.6 mm mn2+. stability studies showed that this protein is highly stable mainly at low temperature and ph values. remarkably, t268k mutation clearly enhances the enzyme stability at low ph values. use of this l-arabinose isomerase for d-tagatose production allows the achievement of attractive bioconversion rates of 16% at 4 degrees c and 34% at 35 degrees c. conclusions: here we reported the purification and the biochemical characterization of the novel shewanella sp. ana-3 l-arabinose isomerase. determination of the biochemical properties demonstrated that this enzyme was highly active at low temperatures. the generated t268k mutant displays an increase of the enzyme stability essentially at low ph. these features seem to be very attractive for the bioconversion of d-galactose into d-tagatose at low temperature which is very interesting from industrial point of view.

TI  == identification and characterization of alkaline serine protease from goat skin surface metagenome.
AB  == metagenomic dna isolated from goat skin surface was used to construct plasmid dna library in escherichia coli dh10b. recombinant clones were screened for functional protease activity on skim milk agar plates. upon screening 70,000 clones, a clone carrying recombinant plasmid psp1 exhibited protease activity. in vitro transposon mutagenesis and sequencing of the insert dna in this clone revealed an orf of 1890 bp encoding a protein with 630 amino acids which showed significant sequence homology to the peptidase s8 and s53 subtilisin kexin sedolisin of shewanella sp. this orf was cloned in pet30b and expressed in e. coli bl21 (de3). although the cloned alkaline serine protease (as-protease) was overexpressed, it was inactive as a result of forming inclusion bodies. after solubilisation, the protease was purified using ni-nta chromatography and then refolded properly to retain protease activity. the purified as-protease with a molecular mass of ~63 kda required a divalent cation (co2+ or mn2+) for its improved activity. the ph and temperature optima for this protease were 10.5 and  42 degrees c respectively.

TI  == a novel low-temperature-active beta-glucosidase from symbiotic serratia sp. tn49  reveals four essential positions for substrate accommodation.
AB  == a 2,373-bp full-length gene (bgla49) encoding a 790-residue polypeptide (bgla49)  with a calculated mass of 87.8 kda was cloned from serratia sp. tn49, a symbiotic bacterium isolated from the gut of longhorned beetle (batocera horsfieldi) larvae. the deduced amino acid sequence of bgla49 showed the highest identities of 80.1% with a conceptually translated protein from pantoea sp. at-9b (eew02556), 38.3% with the identified glycoside hydrolase (gh) family 3 beta-glucosidase from clostridium stercorarium ncbi 11754 (cab08072), and <15.0%  with the low-temperature-active gh 3 beta-glucosidases from shewanella sp. g5 (abl09836) and paenibacillus sp. c7 (aax35883). the recombinant enzyme (r-bgla49) was expressed in escherichia coli and displayed the typical characteristics of low-temperature-active enzymes, such as low temperature optimum (showing apparent optimal activity at 35 degrees c), activity at low temperatures (retaining approximately 60% of its maximum activity at 20 degrees c and approximately 25% at 10 degrees c). compared with the thermophilic gh 3 beta-glucosidase, r-bgla49  had fewer hydrogen bonds and salt bridges and less proline residues. these features might relate to the increased structure flexibility and higher catalytic activity at low temperatures of r-bgla49. the molecular docking study of four gh  3 beta-glucosidases revealed five conserved positions contributing to substrate accommodation, among which four positions of r-bgla49 (r192, y228, d260, and e449) were identified to be essential based on site-directed mutagenesis analysis.

TI  == crystal structure of stable protein cuta1 from psychrotrophic bacterium shewanella sp. sib1.
AB  == cuta1 is widely found in bacteria, plants and animals, including humans. the functions of cuta1, however, have not been well clarified. it is known that cuta1s from pyrococcus horikoshii, thermus thermophilus and oryza sativa unfold at temperatures remarkably higher than the growth temperatures of the host organisms. in this work the crystal structure of cuta1 from the psychrotrophic bacterium shewanella sp. sib1 (sib1-cuta1) in a trimeric form was determined at 2.7 a resolution. this is the first crystal structure of a psychrotrophic cuta1.  the overall structure of sib1-cuta1 is similar to those of cuta1 from homo sapiens, escherichia coli, pyrococcus horikoshii, thermus thermophilus, termotoga maritima, oryza sativa and rattus norvergicus. a peculiarity is observed in the beta2 strand. the beta2 strand is divided into two short beta strands, beta2a and beta2b, in sib1-cuta1. a thermal denaturation experiment revealed that sib1-cuta1 does not unfold completely at 363 k at ph 7.0, although shewanella sp. sib1 cannot grow at temperatures exceeding 303 k. these results indicate that the trimeric structural motif of cuta1 is the critical factor in its unusually high stability and suggest that cuta1 needs to maintain its high stability in order to function, even in psychrotrophs.

TI  == defensin of the zebra mussel (dreissena polymorpha): molecular structure, in vitro expression, antimicrobial activity, and potential functions.
AB  == a 409 bp full length defensin gene was cloned and sequenced based on an expressed sequence tag (est) obtained from a normalized zebra mussel (dreissena polymorpha) foot cdna library developed in our laboratory. the d. polymorpha defensin (dpd) gene encoded a peptide with 76 amino acid residues. the mature dpd contains 54 amino acids with a fully functional insect defensin a domain. homologue searching against genbank database suggested that this dpd was phylogenetically close to defensins from a group of insects with six conserved cysteine residues. predicted with homology-modeling method, the three-dimensional structure of dpd also demonstrated a significant similarity with insect defensin a. the recombinant dpd was in vitro expressed through an escherichia coli expression system. the antimicrobial activities of the refolded recombinant dpd were found against the growth of morganella sp., plesiomonas shigelloides, edwardsiella tarda, e. coli and staphylococcus aureus aureus (atcc12598) with the minimal inhibition concentration (mic) 0.35, 0.43, 1.16, 6.46, and 30.39 microm, respectively. however, with less than 50 microm no detectable inhibition activities were observed against the other four gram-negative bacteria (aeromonas salmonicida salmonicida, motile aeromonas, flavobacterium sp., pseudomonas fluorescens, shewanella putrifaciens), as well as the other gram-positive bacteria (bacillus megaterium atcc14581, carnobacterium maltaromaticum atcc27865, enterococcus faecalis atcc19433, and micrococcus leteus atcc4698), and the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. the rna fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) of dpd in the zebra  mussel suggested that the dpd was expressed in a variety of tissues, such as foot, retractor muscle, ctenidium, mantle, hemocytes, gonad, digestive gland, and intestine. by using the quantitative pcr, the expression level of dpd in the zebra mussel foot was the highest, followed by the muscle. by comparing the amount of dpd transcripts in the zebra mussel foot under two different byssogenesis conditions (byssogenesis and non-byssogenesis) with qpcr, we found that the higher expression levels of dpd were always associated with the byssogenesis status from 2 to 4 days after the start of byssogenesis. findings of this study suggest that the expression of the dpd gene was upregulated in vivo by byssogeneis, and by hemocytes in vitro upon stimulation with microbial antigens.

TI  == possible biosynthetic pathways for all cis-3,6,9,12,15,19,22, 25,28-hentriacontanonaene in bacteria.
AB  == a very long chain polyunsaturated hydrocarbon, hentriacontanonaene (c31:9), was detected in an eicosapentaenoic acid (epa)-producing marine bacterium, which was  isolated from the mid-latitude seashore of hokkaido, japan, and was tentatively identified as mesophilic shewanella sp. strain osh08 from 16s rrna gene sequencing. the geometry and position of the double bonds in this compound were determined physicochemically to be all cis at positions 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 19, 22,  25, and 28. although c31:9 was detected in all of the seven epa- or/and docosahexaenoic acid-producing bacteria tested, an epa-deficient mutant (strain ik-1delta8) of one of these bacteria had no c31:9. strain ik-1delta8 had defects  in the pfad gene, one of the five pfa genes responsible for the biosynthesis of epa. although escherichia coli dh5alpha does not produce epa or dha inherently, cells transformed with the pfa genes responsible for the biosynthesis of epa and  dha produced epa and dha, respectively, but not c31:9. these results suggest that the pfa protein complex is involved in the biosynthesis of c31:9 and that pfa genes must not be the only genes responsible for the formation of c31:9. in this  report, we determined for the first time the molecular structure of the c31:9 and discuss the possible biosynthetic pathways of this compound.

TI  == lysine-91 of the tetraheme c-type cytochrome cyma is essential for quinone interaction and arsenate respiration in shewanella sp. strain ana-3.
AB  == the tetraheme c-type cytochrome, cyma, is essential for arsenate respiratory reduction in shewanella sp. ana-3, a model arsenate reducer. cyma is predicted to mediate electron transfer from quinols to the arsenate respiratory reductase (arrab). here, we present biochemical and physiological evidence that cyma interacts with menaquinol (mqh(2)) substrates. fluorescence quench titration with the mqh(2) analog, 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-n-oxide (hoqno), was used to demonstrate quinol binding of e. coli cytoplasmic membranes enriched with various forms of cyma. wild-type cyma bound hoqno with a k (d) of 0.1-1 microm. it was also shown that the redox active mqh(2) analog, 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone  (dmnh(2)), could reduce cyma in cytoplasmic membrane preparations. based on a cyma homology model made from the nrfh tetraheme cytochrome structure, it was predicted that lys91 would be involved in cyma-quinol interactions. cyma with a k91q substitution showed little interaction with hoqno. in addition, dmnh(2)-dependent reduction of cyma-k91q was diminished by 45% compared to wild-type cyma. a deltacyma ana-3 strain containing a plasmid copy of cyma-k91q failed to grow with arsenate as an electron acceptor. these results suggest that  lys91 is physiologically important for arsenate respiration and support the hypothesis that cyma interacts with menaquinol resulting in the reduction of the  cytochrome.

TI  == engineering of monomeric fk506-binding protein 22 with peptidyl prolyl cis-trans  isomerase. importance of a v-shaped dimeric structure for binding to protein substrate.
AB  == fk506-binding protein 22 (fkbp22) from the psychrotrophic bacterium shewanella sp. sib1 is a homodimeric protein with peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase (ppiase) (ec 5.2.1.8) activity. each monomer consists of 205 amino acid residues. according to a tertiary model, sib1 fkbp22 assumes a v-shaped structure, in which two monomers interact with each other at their n-termini. each monomer consists of an n-terminal domain with a dimerization core and a c-terminal catalytic domain, which are separated by a 40-residue-long a-helix. to clarify the role of  this v-shaped structure, we constructed a mutant protein, in which the n-domain is tandemly repeated through a flexible linker. this protein, termed nnc-fkbp22,  is designed such that two repetitive n-domains are folded into a structure similar to that of the shewanella sp. sib1 fkbp22 wild-type protein (wt). nnc-fkbp22 was overproduced in escherichia coli in a his-tagged form, purified and biochemically characterized. gel-filtration chromatography and ultracentrifugation analyses indicate that nnc-fkbp22 exists as a monomer. analysis of thermal denaturation using differential scanning calorimetry indicates that nnc-fkbp22 unfolds with two transitions, as does the wt protein. nnc-fkbp22 exhibited ppiase activity for both peptide and protein substrates. however, in contrast to its activity for peptide substrate, which was comparable  to that of the wt protein, its activity for protein substrate was reduced by five- to six-fold, compared to that of the wt. surface plasmon resonance analyses indicate that nnc-fkbp22 binds to a reduced form of a-lactalbumin with a six-fold weaker affinity than that of wt. these results suggest that a v-shaped structure  of sib1 fkbp22 is important for efficient binding to a protein substrate.

AB  == a cryptic plasmid psfkw33 from psychrotrophic bacterium shewanella sp. 33b, an isolate from the gulf of gdansk (the baltic sea), was sequenced and characterized. it is an 8021bp circular molecule with 38% gc content, which shows a distinctive nucleotide sequence without homology to other known plasmids. the nucleotide sequence analysis predicts eight open reading frames. the deduced amino acid sequence of orf-1 shared significant similarity with the phage integrase protein from pseudomonas putida gb-1. the orf2 product showed some similarity with the hypothetical protein shal_1786 from shewanella halifaxensis haw-eb4. the orf-3 product revealed high amino acid sequence homology with the escherichia coli replication initiation protein similar to pi protein of r6k plasmid. five repeat regions (three perfect 22-bp repeats and two imperfect motifs), a putative ribosome binding site, and -10 and -35 promotor sequences were identified upstream of the orf-3 (rep). the rep module is very similar to several theta replicating iteron family plasmids, suggesting that psfkw33 replication follows the same course. the orf-5 product revealed significant identity with the entry exclusion protein 1 of plasmid pis2 from enteropathogenic strain e. coli 0111:h. the orf-6 product showed significant identity with the putative transcriptional regulator protein from shewanella benthica kt99 belonging to hth-xre-family protein. the orf-8 encoded protein that showed some similarity with the hypothetical protein kt99_00146 from shewanella benthica kt99. the orf-4 and orf-7 encoded putative proteins of 189 and 118 amino acid residues, respectively, with no homologies to any known proteins. the absolute copy number of psfkw33 was estimated to be five copies per chromosome by real-time pcr.

TI  == identification and characterization of n-acylhomoserine lactone-acylase from the  fish intestinal shewanella sp. strain mib015.
AB  == n-acylhomoserine lactones (ahls) are used as quorum-sensing signal molecules by many gram-negative bacteria. we have reported that shewanella sp. strain mib015 degrades ahls. in the present study, we cloned the aac gene from mib015 by pcr with specific primers based on the aac gene in shewanella oneidensis strain mr-1, which showed high homology with the known ahl-acylases. escherichia coli expressing aac showed high degrading activity of ahls with long acyl chains. hplc analysis revealed that aac worked as ahl-acylase, which hydrolyzed the amide bond of ahl. in addition, expression of aac in fish pathogen vibrio anguillarum markedly reduced ahl production and biofilm formation. in conclusion, this study  indicates that aac might be effective in quenching quorum sensing of fish pathogens.

TI  == expression of chromate resistance genes from shewanella sp. strain ana-3 in escherichia coli.
AB  == the plasmidic chromate resistance genes chrbac from shewanella sp. strain ana-3 were transferred to escherichia coli. expression of chra alone, on a high- or low-copy number plasmid, conferred increased chromate resistance. in contrast, expression of the complete operon chrbac on a high-copy number plasmid did not result in a significant increase in resistance, although expression on a low-copy number plasmid made the cells up to 10-fold more resistant to chromate. the chra  gene also conferred increased chromate resistance when expressed in pseudomonas aeruginosa. the chrr gene from the p. aeruginosa chromosome was necessary for full chromate resistance conferred by chra. a diminished chromate uptake in cells expressing the chra gene suggests that chromate resistance is due to chromate efflux.

TI  == characterization of the arsenate respiratory reductase from shewanella sp. strain ana-3.
AB  == microbial arsenate respiration contributes to the mobilization of arsenic from the solid to the soluble phase in various locales worldwide. to begin to predict  the extent to which as(v) respiration impacts arsenic geochemical cycling, we characterized the expression and activity of the shewanella sp. strain ana-3 arsenate respiratory reductase (arr), the key enzyme involved in this metabolism. arr is expressed at the beginning of the exponential phase and persists throughout the stationary phase, at which point it is released from the cell. in  intact cells, the enzyme localizes to the periplasm. to purify arr, a heterologous expression system was developed in escherichia coli. arr requires anaerobic conditions and molybdenum for activity. arr is a heterodimer of approximately 131 kda, composed of one arra subunit (approximately 95 kda) and one arrb subunit (approximately 27 kda). for arr to be functional, the two subunits must be expressed together. elemental analysis of pure protein indicates that one mo atom, four s atoms associated with a bis-molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide cofactor, and four to five [4fe-4s] are present per arr. arr has an  apparent melting temperature of 41 degrees c, a km of 5 microm, and a vmax of 11,111 micromol of as(v) reduced min(-1) mg of protein(-1) and shows no activity  in the presence of alternative electron acceptors such as antimonite, nitrate, selenate, and sulfate. the development of a heterologous overexpression system for arr will facilitate future structural and/or functional studies of this protein family.

AB  == the gene encoding rnase hii from the psychrotrophic bacterium, shewanella sp. sib1 was cloned, overexpressed in escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein was purified and biochemically characterized. sib1 rnase hii is a monomeric protein with 212 amino acid residues and shows an amino acid sequence identity of 64% to e. coli rnase hii. the enzymatic properties of sib1 rnase hii, such as metal ion preference, ph optimum, and cleavage mode of substrate, were similar to those of e. coli rnase hii. sib1 rnase hii was less stable than e. coli rnase hii, but the difference was marginal. the half-lives of sib1 and e. coli rnases hii at 30 degrees c were approximately 30 and 45 min, respectively. the midpoint  of the urea denaturation curve and optimum temperature of sib1 rnase hii were lower than those of e. coli rnase hii by approximately 0.2 m and approximately 5  degrees c, respectively. however, sib1 rnase hii was much more active than e. coli rnase hii at all temperatures studied. the specific activity of sib1 rnase hii at 30 degrees c was 20 times that of e. coli rnase hii. because sib1 rnase hii was also much more active than sib1 rnase hi, rnases hi and hii represent low- and high-activity type rnases h, respectively, in sib1. in contrast, rnases  hi and hii represent high- and low-activity type rnases h, respectively, in e. coli. we propose that bacterial cells usually contain low- and high-activity type rnases h, but these types are not correlated with rnase h families.

TI  == stabilities and activities of the n- and c-domains of fkbp22 from a psychrotrophic bacterium overproduced in escherichia coli.
AB  == fkbp22 from a psychrotrophic bacterium shewanella sp. sib1, is a dimeric protein  with peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase (ppiase) activity. according to homology modeling, it consists of an n-terminal domain, which is involved in dimerization  of the protein, and a c-terminal catalytic domain. a long alpha3 helix spans these domains. an n-domain with the entire alpha3 helix (n-domain+) and a c-domain with the entire alpha3 helix (c-domain+) were overproduced in escherichia coli in a his-tagged form, purified, and their biochemical properties were compared with those of the intact protein. c-domain+ was shown to be a monomer and enzymatically active. its optimum temperature for activity (10 degrees c) was identical to that of the intact protein. determination of the ppiase activity using peptide and protein substrates suggests that dimerization is required to make the protein fully active for the protein substrate or that the n-domain is involved in substrate-binding. the differential scanning calorimetry studies revealed two distinct heat absorption peaks at 32.5 degrees c and 46.6 degrees c for the intact protein, and single heat absorption peaks at 44.7 degrees c for n-domain+ and 35.6 degrees c for c-domain+. these results indicate that the thermal unfolding transitions of the intact protein at lower and higher temperatures represent those of c- and n-domains, respectively. because the unfolding temperature of c-domain+ is much higher than its optimum temperature for activity, sib1 fkbp22 may adapt to low temperatures by increasing a local flexibility around the active site. this study revealed the relationship  between the stability and the activity of a psychrotrophic fkbp22.

TI  == possible involvement of an fkbp family member protein from a psychrotrophic bacterium shewanella sp. sib1 in cold-adaptation.
AB  == a psychrotrophic bacterium shewanella sp. strain sib1 was grown at 4 and 20 degrees c, and total soluble proteins extracted from the cells were analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. comparison of these patterns  showed that the cellular content of a protein with a molecular mass of 28 kda and an isoelectric point of four greatly increased at 4 degrees c compared to that at 20 degrees c. determination of the n-terminal amino acid sequence, followed by the cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding this protein, revealed that this  protein is a member of the fkbp family of proteins with an amino acid sequence identity of 56% to escherichia coli fkbp22. this protein was overproduced in e. coli in a his-tagged form, purified, and analyzed for peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity. when this activity was determined by the protease coupling assay using n-succinyl-ala-leu-pro-phe-p-nitroanilide as a substrate at various temperatures, the protein exhibited the highest activity at 10 degrees c with a k(cat)/k(m) value of 0.87 micro m(-1) x s(-1). when the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity was determined by the rnase t(1) refolding assay at 10 and 20  degrees c, the protein exhibited higher activity at 10 degrees c with a k(cat)/k(m) value of 0.50 micro m(-1) x s(-1). these k(cat)/k(m) values are lower but comparable to those of e. coli fkbp22. we propose that a fkbp family protein  is involved in cold-adaptation of psychrotrophic bacteria.

TI  == genetic identification of a respiratory arsenate reductase.
AB  == for more than a decade, it has been recognized that arsenate [h2aso41-; as(v)] can be used by microorganisms as a terminal electron acceptor in anaerobic respiration. given the toxicity of arsenic, the mechanistic basis of this process is intriguing, as is its evolutionary origin. here we show that a two-gene cluster (arrab; arsenate respiratory reduction) in the bacterium shewanella sp. strain ana-3 specifically confers respiratory as(v) reductase activity. mutants with in-frame deletions of either arra or arrb are incapable of growing on as(v), yet both are able to grow on a wide variety of other electron acceptors as efficiently as the wild-type. complementation by the wild-type sequence rescues the mutants' ability to respire as(v). arra is predicted to encode a 95.2-kda protein with sequence motifs similar to the molybdenum containing enzymes of the  dimethyl sulfoxide reductase family. arrb is predicted to encode a 25.7-kda iron-sulfur protein. arra and arrb comprise an operon that contains a twin arginine translocation (tat) motif in arra (but not in arrb) as well as a putative anaerobic transcription factor binding site upstream of arra, suggesting that the respiratory as(v) reductase is exported to the periplasm via the tat pathway and under anaerobic transcriptional control. these genes appear to define a new class of reductases that are specific for respiratory as(v) reduction.

TI  == identification of a plasmid-encoded gene from haemophilus ducreyi which confers nad independence.
AB  == members of the family pasteurellaceae are classified in part by whether or not they require an nad supplement for growth on laboratory media. in this study, we  demonstrate that this phenotype can be determined by a single gene, nadv, whose presence allows nad-independent growth of haemophilus influenzae and actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. this gene was cloned from a 5.2-kb plasmid which was previously shown to be responsible for nad independence in haemophilus ducreyi. when transformed into a. pleuropneumoniae, this cloned gene allowed nad-independent growth on complex media and allowed the utilization of nicotinamide in place of nad on defined media. sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1,482 bp that is predicted to encode a protein with a molecular  mass of 55,619 da. compared with the sequence databases, nadv was found to have significant sequence homology to the human pre-b-cell colony-enhancing factor pbef and to predicted proteins of unknown function identified in the bacterial species mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma pneumoniae, shewanella putrefaciens, synechocystis sp., deinococcus radiodurans, pasteurella multocida, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. p. multocida and a. actinomycetemcomitans are among the nad-independent members of the pasteurellaceae. homologues of nadv  were not found in the sequenced genome of h. influenzae, an nad-dependent member  of the pasteurellaceae, or in species known to utilize a different pathway for synthesis of nad, such as escherichia coli. sequence alignment of these nine homologues revealed regions and residues of complete conservation that may be directly involved in the enzymatic activity. identification of a function for this gene in the pasteurellaceae should help to elucidate the role of its homologues in other species.
