TI  == characterization of films based on chitosan lactate and its blends with oxidized  starch and gelatin.
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of chitosan lactate (chl) was tested against bacteria and phytopathogenic fungi. then, the structural, physicochemical and antimicrobial properties of films based on chl, oxidized potato starch (ops), and gelatin (gel) were investigated. with the exception of rhizopus nigricans, chl was effective against the target organisms. gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus) were more sensitive to chl than gram-negative bacteria (pectobacterium carotovorum and escherichia coli). cryo-sem images showed total miscibility between the polymers in the blends and the atr-ftir spectra revealed that there was an interaction among the polymeric components. pure chl films displayed the highest moisture content (25.51%), water vapor permeability (48.78gmmm(-2)d(-1)kpa(-1)), and the lowest tensile and puncture strength (2.00 and 1.45mpa, respectively) among the studied films. chl50/gel50 films had lower permeability, higher mechanical strength, and lower elongation compared to chl50/ops50 films. films obtained from chl and chl50/gel50 were completely water-soluble and did not show sorbitol recrystallization. the incorporation of chl into ops and gel films did not affect their transparency and improved uv-blocking capacity. chl films were the only ones that exhibited antibacterial efficiency. antifungal activities against alternaria alternata and  monilinia fructigena were detected for chl and chl50/gel50 films.

TI  == [cross-immunogenicity of various bacterial l-asparaginases].
AB  == aim: evaluate immune response in mice against various l-asparaginases and determine their cross-immunogenicity. materials and methods: the studies were carried out in c57bl(6j) line mice. immunogenicity of l-asparaginases was studied: escherichia coli type ii (recombinant) (medak, germany) (eca); erwinia carotovora type ii (era); yersinia pseudotuberculosis type ii (ypa); rhodospirillum rubrum type i (rra); wollinella succinogenes type ii (wsa). immune response against the administered antigens was determined in eia. results: y. pseudotuberculosis l-asparaginase was the most immunogenic, e. coli--the least immunogenic. e. carotovora, r. rubrum, w. succinogenes asparaginases displayed intermediate immunogenicity. the results of cross-immunogenicity evaluation have  established, that blood sera of mice, that had received ypa, showed cross-immunogenicity against all the other l-asparaginase preparations except e.  carotovora. during immunization with e. coli l-asparaginase the developed antibodies also bound preparation from e. carotovora. sera from mice immunized with w. succinogenes, e. carotovora and r. rubrum l-asparaginases had cross-reaction only with eca and did not react with other preparations. conclusion: cross-immunogenicity of the studied l-asparaginases was determined. a sequence of administration of the studied preparation is proposed that allows to  minimize l-asparaginase neutralization by cross-reacting antibodies.

TI  == deciphering the dual effect of lipopolysaccharides from plant pathogenic pectobacterium.
AB  == lipopolysaccharides (lps) are a component of the outer cell surface of almost all gram-negative bacteria and play an essential role for bacterial growth and survival. lipopolysaccharides represent typical microbe-associated molecular pattern (mamp) molecules and have been reported to induce defense-related responses, including the expression of defense genes and the suppression of the hypersensitive response in plants. however, depending on their origin and the challenged plant, lps were shown to have complex and different roles. in this study we showed that lps from plant pathogens pectobacterium atrosepticum and pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum induce common and different responses in a. thaliana cells when compared to those induced by lps from non-phytopathogens escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. among common responses to both types of lps are the transcription of defense genes and their ability to limit of cell death induced by pectobacterium carotovorum subsp carotovorum. however, the differential kinetics and amplitude in reactive oxygen  species (ros) generation seemed to regulate defense gene transcription and be determinant to induce programmed cell death in response to lps from the plant pathogenic pectobacterium. these data suggest that different signaling pathways could be activated by lps in a. thaliana cells.

TI  == studies on deimmunization of antileukaemic l-asparaginase to have reduced clinical immunogenicity- an in silico approach.
AB  == protein therapeutics, particularly of heterologous origin are shown to elicit immunogenic responses which result in adverse allergic reactions in spite of their promising clinical benefit. l-asparaginase is one such well known chemotherapeutic agent that has enhanced the survival rates to 90 % in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia for past 30 years. but the use of this enzyme is accompanied by hypersensitive reactions ranging from allergy to anaphylactic shock which have a drastic influence in treatment outcomes. numerous attempts have been made to minimize the problems of immunogenicity, which remained as a major bottleneck in the treatment protocols. conjugating the enzyme l- asparaginase with peg was successful as it has reduced the complications in therapy and frequency of injections (dosages), and thus became prominent in reducing the immunogenicity up to a certain extent. keeping the bottlenecks in consideration during the development of therapeutics, the present study concentrates on engineering of protein as an alternative to the pegylated enzyme, having reduced immunogenicity as an inbuilt character of protein by using in silico approaches. l-asparaginase from escherichia coli and pectobacterium carotovorum were selected for the present study. the methodology consists of (i)  locating the b and cd4+ t cell epitopes of enzyme by in silico tools (ii) generating point mutations of these epitopes to alter or reduce the immunogenicity of protein (iii) generating enzyme models by molecular modelling (iv) assessing the binding affinity of the substrate with l-asparaginase variants by in silico docking methods using autodock 4.2 and (v) validating the mutated model for stability by molecular dynamics simulation studies using gromacs.

TI  == characterization of an extensin-modifying metalloprotease: n-terminal processing  and substrate cleavage pattern of pectobacterium carotovorum prt1.
AB  == compared to other plant cell wall-degrading enzymes, proteases are less well understood. in this study, the extracellular metalloprotease prt1 from pectobacterium carotovorum (formerly erwinia carotovora) was expressed in escherichia coli and characterized with respect to n-terminal processing, thermal stability, substrate targets, and cleavage patterns. prt1 is an autoprocessing protease with an n-terminal signal pre-peptide and a pro-peptide which has to be  removed in order to activate the protease. the sequential cleavage of the n-terminus was confirmed by mass spectrometry (ms) fingerprinting and n-terminus  analysis. the optimal reaction conditions for the activity of prt1 on azocasein were at ph 6.0, 50 degrees c. at these reaction conditions, k m was 1.81 mg/ml and k cat was 1.82 x 10(7) u m(-1). the enzyme was relatively stable at 50 degrees c with a half-life of 20 min. ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) treatment abolished activity; zn(2+) addition caused regain of the activity, but  zn(2+)addition decreased the thermal stability of the prt1 enzyme presumably as a result of increased proteolytic autolysis. in addition to casein, the enzyme catalyzed degradation of collagen, potato lectin, and plant extensin. analysis of the cleavage pattern of different substrates after treatment with prt1 indicated  that the protease had a substrate cleavage preference for proline in substrate residue position p1 followed by a hydrophobic residue in residue position p1' at  the cleavage point. the activity of prt1 against plant cell wall structural proteins suggests that this enzyme might become an important new addition to the  toolbox of cell-wall-degrading enzymes for biomass processing.

TI  == ecdysone mediates the development of immunity in the drosophila embryo.
AB  == beyond their role in cell metabolism, development, and reproduction, hormones are also important modulators of the immune system. in the context of inflammatory disorders, systemic administration of pharmacological doses of synthetic glucocorticoids (gcs) is widely used as an anti-inflammatory treatment [1, 2]. however, not all actions of gcs are immunosuppressive, and many studies have suggested that physiological concentrations of gcs can have immunoenhancing effects [3-7]. for a more comprehensive understanding of how steroid hormones regulate immunity and inflammation, a simple in vivo system is required. the drosophila embryo has recently emerged as a powerful model system to study the recruitment of immune cells to sterile wounds [8] and host-pathogen dynamics [9]. here we investigate the immune response of the fly embryo to bacterial infections and find that the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-he) can regulate the quality of the immune response and influence the resolution of infection in drosophila embryos.

TI  == a sequence-based approach for prediction of csra/rsma targets in bacteria with experimental validation in pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == csra/rsma homologs are an extensive family of ribonucleic acid (rna)-binding proteins that function as global post-transcriptional regulators controlling important cellular processes such as secondary metabolism, motility, biofilm formation and the production and secretion of virulence factors in diverse bacterial species. while direct messenger rna binding by csra/rsma has been studied in detail for some genes, it is anticipated that there are numerous additional, as yet undiscovered, direct targets that mediate its global regulation. to assist in the discovery of these targets, we propose a sequence-based approach to predict genes directly regulated by these regulators.  in this work, we develop a computer code (csra_target) implementing this approach, which leads to predictions for several novel targets in escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the predicted targets in other bacteria, specifically salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, pectobacterium carotovorum  and legionella pneumophila, also include global regulators that control virulence in these pathogens, unraveling intricate indirect regulatory roles for csra/rsma. we have experimentally validated four predicted rsma targets in p. aeruginosa. the sequence-based approach developed in this work can thus lead to several testable predictions for direct targets of csra homologs, thereby complementing and accelerating efforts to unravel global regulation by this important family of proteins.

TI  == mechanism of the c5 stereoinversion reaction in the biosynthesis of carbapenem antibiotics.
AB  == the bicyclic beta-lactam/2-pyrrolidine precursor to all carbapenem antibiotics is biosynthesized by attachment of a carboxymethylene unit to c5 of l-proline followed by beta-lactam ring closure. carbapenem synthase (carc), an fe(ii) and 2-(oxo)glutarate (fe/2og)-dependent oxygenase, then inverts the c5 configuration. here we report the structure of carc in complex with its substrate and biophysical dissection of its reaction to reveal the stereoinversion mechanism. an fe(iv)-oxo intermediate abstracts the hydrogen (h*) from c5, and tyrosine 165, a residue not visualized in the published structures of carc lacking bound substrate, donates h* to the opposite face of the resultant radical. the reaction oxidizes the fe(ii) cofactor to fe(iii), limiting wild-type carc to one turnover, but substitution of the h*-donating tyrosine disables stereoinversion and confers to carc the capacity for catalytic substrate oxidation.

TI  == [antitumor activity of l-asparaginase from erwinia carotovora from against different leukemic and solid tumours cell lines].
AB  == we have studied dose- and time-dependent antitumor and cytotoxic effects of erwinia carotovora l-asparaginase (ecar lans) and escherichia coli l-asparaginase (medac) on human leukemic cells and human and animal solid tumor cells. we determined the sensitivity of tumor cells to l-asparaginases, as well the effect  l-asparaginases on cell growth rate, protein and dna synthesis per se and with addition of different cytostatics. the data obtained demonstrated that ecar lans  l-asparaginase suppressed growth of all tested solid tumor cells. evaluation of leukemic cell number after treatment with l-asparaginases for 24, 48 and 72 h demonstrated that asparagine deficiency did not kill cells but stopped normal cell division and had no effect on protein and dna synthesis. cytofluorometric study of solid and leukemic cells demonstrated that the treatment with l-asparaginase for 72 h did not change cell cycle phase distribution and did not  increase the number of apoptotic cells. the hl-60 cell line was only exemption. at the same time, cells treatment with l-asparaginase and doxorubicin combination leaded to increase of apoptotypical cell number to 60% for mcf7 cells, to 40% for jurkat cells and to 99% for hl-60 cells. we have excluded apoptosis as main reason for tumor cell death after asparaginase treatment because multi resistant  jurkat/a4 cells have been asparaginase sensitive. we have not found ecar lans l-asparaginase effect on normal human fibroblasts growth ability and we had come  to conclusion that enzyme cytotoxcisity related only with asparagine deficiency.

TI  == functional characterization of the sucrose isomerase responsible for trehalulose  production in plant-associated pectobacterium species.
AB  == fifty-three plant-associated microorganisms were investigated for their ability to convert sucrose to its isomers. these microorganisms included one dickeya zeae isolate and 7 enterobacter, 3 pantoea, and 43 pectobacterium species. eleven out  of the 53 strains (21%) showed the ability to transform sucrose to isomaltulose and trehalulose. among those, pectobacterium carotovorum kkh 3-1 showed the highest bioconversion yield (97.4%) from sucrose to its isomers. in this strain,  the addition of up to 14% sucrose in the medium enhanced sucrose isomerase (siase) production. the siase activity at 14% sucrose (47.6 u/mg dcw) was about 3.6-fold higher than that of the negative control (13.3 u/mg dcw at 0% sucrose).  the gene encoding siase, which is comprised a 1776 bp open reading frame (orf) encoding 591 amino acids, was cloned from p. carotovorum kkh 3-1 and expressed in escherichia coli. the recombinant siase (pcsi) was shown to have optimum activity at ph 6.0 and 40 degrees c. the reaction temperature significantly affected the ratio of sucrose isomers produced by pcsi. the amount of trehalulose increased from 47.5% to 79.1% as temperature was lowered from 50 degrees c to 30 degrees c, implying that siase activity can be controlled by reaction temperature.

TI  == salmonella enterica suppresses pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum population and soft rot progression by acidifying the microaerophilic environment.
AB  == although enteric human pathogens are usually studied in the context of their animal hosts, a significant portion of their life cycle occurs on plants. plant disease alters the phyllosphere, leading to enhanced growth of human pathogens; however, the impact of human pathogens on phytopathogen biology and plant health  is largely unknown. to characterize the interaction between human pathogens and phytobacterial pathogens in the phyllosphere, we examined the interactions between pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and salmonella enterica or  escherichia coli o157:h7 with regard to bacterial populations, soft rot progression, and changes in local ph. the presence of p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum enhanced the growth of both s. enterica and e. coli o157:h7 on leaves. however, in a microaerophilic environment, s. enterica reduced p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum populations and soft rot progression by moderating local environmental ph. reduced soft rot was not due to s. enterica proteolytic activity. limitations on p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum growth, disease progression, and ph elevation were not observed on leaves coinoculated with e. coli o157:h7 or when leaves were coinoculated with s. enterica in an aerobic environment. s. enterica also severely undermined the relationship between the phytobacterial population and disease progression of a p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum budb mutant defective in the 2,3-butanediol pathway for acid neutralization. our results show that s. enterica and e. coli o157:h7 interact differently with the enteric phytobacterial pathogen p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum. s. enterica inhibition of soft rot progression may conceal a rapidly growing human pathogen population. whereas soft rotted produce can alert consumers to the possibility of food-borne pathogens, healthy-looking produce may entice consumption of contaminated vegetables. importance: salmonella enterica and escherichia coli o157:h7 may use plants to move between animal and human hosts. their populations are higher on plants cocolonized with the common bacterial soft rot pathogen pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, turning edible plants into a risk factor for human disease. we inoculated leaves  with p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and s. enterica or e. coli o157:h7 to study the interactions between these bacteria. while p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum enhanced the growth of both s. enterica and e. coli o157:h7, these human pathogens affected p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum fundamentally differently. s. enterica reduced p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum growth and acidified the environment, leading to less soft rot on leaves; e. coli o157:h7 had no such effects. as soft rot signals a food safety risk, the reduction of soft rot symptoms in the presence of s. enterica may lead consumers to eat healthy-looking but s. enterica-contaminated produce.

TI  == complete genome sequence and characterization of the n-acylhomoserine lactone-degrading gene of the potato leaf-associated solibacillus silvestris.
AB  == n-acylhomoserine lactones (ahls) are used as quorum-sensing signal molecules by many gram-negative bacteria. we have reported that solibacillus silvestris, which was isolated from the potato leaf, has ahl-degrading activity. to identify the ahl-degrading gene, whole genome sequencing of s. silvestris stlb046 was performed by using pyrosequencing technology. as the result of the blast search,  one predicted orf (ahls) showed slight similarity to aiia-like ahl lactonase from bacillus cereus group. escherichia coli harboring the ahls-expressing plasmid showed high ahl-degrading activity. the ahls-cording region was also amplified by pcr from the other potato leaf-associated and ahl-degrading s. silvestris strains. purified ahls as a maltose binding fusion protein showed high ahl-degrading activity and catalyzes ahl ring opening by hydrolyzing lactones. in addition, expression of ahls in plant pathogen pectobacterium carotovorum subsp.  carotovorum attenuated maceration of the potato slices. our results suggest that  ahl-degrading activity of ahls might perform useful functions such as useful biocontrol agents.

TI  == cloning, purification, and functional characterization of carocin s2, a ribonuclease bacteriocin produced by pectobacterium carotovorum.
AB  == background: most isolates of pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum (pcc)  produce bacteriocins. in this study, we have determined that pcc strain f-rif-18  has a chromosomal gene encoding the low-molecular-weight bacteriocin, carocin s2, and that this bacteriocin inhibits the growth of a closely related strain. carocin s2 is inducible by ultraviolet radiation but not by mutagenic agents such as mitomycin c. results: a carocin s2-defective mutant, tf1-2, was obtained by tn5 insertional mutagenesis using f-rif-18. a 5706-bp dna fragment was detected by southern blotting, selected from a genomic dna library, and cloned to the vector, pms2ki. two adjacent complete open reading frames within pms2ki were sequenced, characterized, and identified as caros2k and caros2i, which respectively encode the killing protein and immunity protein. notably, carocin s2 could be expressed not only in the mutant tf1-2 but also in escherichia coli dh5alpha after entry of the plasmid pms2ki. furthermore, the c-terminal domain of caros2k was homologous to the nuclease domains of colicin d and klebicin d. moreover, sds-page analysis showed that the relative mass of caros2k was 85 kda and that of caros2i was 10 kda. conclusion: this study shown that another nuclease type of bacteriocin was found in pectobacterium carotovorum. this new type of bacteriocin, carocin s2, has the ribonuclease activity of caros2k and the immunity protein activity of caros2i.

TI  == optimization of biomass composition explains microbial growth-stoichiometry relationships.
AB  == integrating microbial physiology and biomass stoichiometry opens far-reaching possibilities for linking microbial dynamics to ecosystem processes. for example, the growth-rate hypothesis (grh) predicts positive correlations among growth rate, rna content, and biomass phosphorus (p) content. such relationships have been used to infer patterns of microbial activity, resource availability, and nutrient recycling in ecosystems. however, for microorganisms it is unclear under which resource conditions the grh applies. we developed a model to test whether the response of microbial biomass stoichiometry to variable resource stoichiometry can be explained by a trade-off among cellular components that maximizes growth. the results show mechanistically why the grh is valid under p limitation but not under n limitation. we also show why variability of growth rate-biomass stoichiometry relationships is lower under p limitation than under n or c limitation. these theoretical results are supported by experimental data on  macromolecular composition (rna, dna, and protein) and biomass stoichiometry from two different bacteria. in addition, compared to a model with strictly homeostatic biomass, the optimization mechanism we suggest results in increased microbial n and p mineralization during organic-matter decomposition. therefore,  this mechanism may also have important implications for our understanding of nutrient cycling in ecosystems.

TI  == the serratia luxr family regulator carr 39006 activates transcription independently of cognate quorum sensing signals.
AB  == in gram-negative bacteria, quorum sensing control of gene expression is mediated  by transcription factors of the luxr family, whose dna-binding affinity is modulated by diffusible n-acyl homoserine lactone (ahl) signalling molecules. in  serratia sp. atcc 39006 and the plant pathogen erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora (ecc), the biosynthesis of the beta-lactam antibiotic 1-carbapen-2-em-3-carboxylic acid (car) is under quorum sensing control. this study has revealed that, uniquely, the luxr family transcriptional activator carr(39006) from serratia 39006 has no detectable affinity for cognate ahl molecules. furthermore, carr(39006) was shown to be naturally competent to bind to its target promoter with high affinity, activate transcription and resist cellular proteolysis, and was unaffected by ahl signals. experiments with chimeric proteins suggest that the c-terminal dna-binding domain of carr(39006) may be responsible for conferring ahl independence. in contrast, we show that the homologous carr(ecc) protein binds to its 3o-c6-hsl ligand with high affinity, and that the highly conserved trp-44 residue is critical for this interaction. unlike trar from agrobacterium tumefaciens, carr(ecc) is not directly protected from cellular proteolysis by ahl binding, but via ahl-induced dna binding. at physiological protein concentrations, ahl binding induces carr(ecc) to bind to its target promoter with higher affinity and activate transcription.

TI  == characterization of a new bacteriocin, carocin d, from pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum pcc21.
AB  == two different bacteriocins, carotovoricin and carocin s1, had been found in pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, which causes soft-rot disease in diverse plants. previously, we reported that the particular strain pcc21, producing only one high-molecular-weight bacteriocin, carried a new antibacterial activity against the indicator strain pcc3. here, we report that this new antibacterial activity is due to a new bacteriocin produced by strain pcc21 and named carocin d. carocin d is encoded by the carodk gene located in the genomic dna together with the carodi gene, which seems to encode an immunity protein. n-terminal amino acid sequences of purified carocin d were determined by edman degradation. in comparison with the primary translation product of carodk, it was found that 8 amino acids are missing at the n terminus. this finding proved that  carocin d is synthesized as a precursor peptide and that 8 amino acids are removed from its n terminus during maturation. carocin d has two putative translocation domains; the n-terminal and c-terminal domains are homologous to those of escherichia coli colicin e3 and pseudomonas aeruginosa s-type pyocin, respectively. when carodk and carodi genes were transformed into carocin d-sensitive bacteria such as pcc3, the bacteria became resistant to this bacteriocin. carocin d has one putative dnase domain at the extreme c terminus and showed dnase activity in vitro. this bacteriocin had slight tolerance to heat but not to proteases. the carodk gene was present in only 5 of 54 strains of p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum. these results indicate that carocin d is a third  bacteriocin found in p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, and this bacteriocin can  be readily expressed in carocin d-sensitive nonpathogenic bacteria, which may have high potential as a biological control agent in the field.

TI  == regulation of motility in erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora: quorum-sensing signal controls flhdc, the global regulator of flagellar and exoprotein genes, by modulating the production of rsma, an rna-binding protein.
AB  == erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora causes soft-rotting (tissue-macerating) disease in many plants and plant organs. although pectinases are the primary determinants of virulence, several ancillary factors that augment bacterial virulence have also been identified. one such factor is bacterial motility. flagellum formation and bacterial movement are regulated in many enterobacteria,  including e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, by flhdc, the master regulator of flagellar genes and flia, a flagellum-specific sigma factor. we document here that motility of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora is positively regulated by the quorum-sensing signal, n-acylhomoserine lactone (ahl), and negatively regulated by rsma, a post-transcriptional regulator. rsma, an rna-binding protein, causes translational repression and promotes rna decay. our data show that rsma negatively regulates flhdc and flia expression. moreover, the chemical stabilities of transcripts of these genes are greater in an rsma- mutant than in  rsma+ bacteria. these observations contrast with positive regulation of flhdc and motility by csra (=rsma) in escherichia coli. in the absence of ahl, the ahl receptors expr1/expr2 (=ahlr) in erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora negatively  regulate motility and expression of flhdc and flia by activating rsma production. in the presence of ahl, regulatory effects of expr1/expr2 are neutralized, resulting in reduced levels of rsma expression and enhanced motility.

TI  == [the association of pigment-containing lipid and low-molecular bacteriocin of erwinia carotovora].
AB  == in contrast to lysates of uninduced cells those of e. carotovora j2/s2 induced by nalidixic acid contain the component which has the additional maximum of uv-absorption at 331 nm. bacteriocin samples, concentrated by ammonium sulfate and purified on deae-sepharose column in saccharose gradient do not lose this substance. this component is supposed to represent the precursor of carotenoid synthesis of e. carotovora. the chloroform treatment of the bacteriocin preparation did not affect its killer activity against both e. carotovora and escherichia coli. its chloroform extract has the greatest killer activity against e. coli be cells and as a result has two additional maximums of uv-absorption at  315 and 331 nm. the pronase treatment at 60 degrees c for 5 min resulted in the destruction of the complex and the loss of the killer activity by bacteriocin. lipase a destroys the complex lipid-bacteriocin. such disruption of the complex increases with the concentration of lipase a. chromatography of the disrupted preparations has been performed on the plate silufor vu 254 using the mixture chloroform: ethanol. as a result the mobility of disrupted preparation was three  times higher than that of the native complex. thus, we have discovered a new type of carotovoricins, which are a stable complex which consists of protein, lipid and pigment, presumably the precursor of carotinoid synthesis.

AB  == the rcs phosphorelay is a signal transduction system that influences the virulence phenotype of several pathogenic bacteria. in the plant pathogen pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum (pcc) the response regulator of the rcs phosphorelay, rcsb, represses expression of plant cell wall degrading enzymes (pcwde) and motility. the focus of this study was to identify genes directly regulated by the binding of rcsb that also regulate expression of pcwde genes in  pcc. rcsb-binding sites within the regulatory regions of the flhdc operon and the rpra and rsmb genes were identified using dnase i protection assays, while in vivo studies using flhdc : : gusa, rsmb : : gusa and rpra : : gusa gene fusions revealed gene regulation. these experiments demonstrated that the operon flhdc, a flagellar master regulator, was repressed by rcsb, and transcription of rpra was  activated by rcsb. regulation of the rsmb promoter by rcsb is more complicated. our results show that rcsb represses rsmb expression mainly through modulating flhdc transcription. neverthless, direct binding of rcsb on the rsmb promoter region is possible in certain conditions. using an rpra-negative mutant, it was further demonstrated that rpra rna is not essential for regulating expression of  pcwde under the conditions tested, whereas overexpression of rpra increased protease expression in wild-type cells. stationary-phase sigma factor, rpos, is the only known target gene for rpra rna in escherichia coli; however, in pcc the  effect of rpra rna was found to be rpos-independent. overall, our results show that the rcs phosphorelay negatively affects expression of pcwde by inhibiting expression of flhdc and rsmb.

TI  == identification and characterization of the metal ion-dependent l-alanoyl-d-glutamate peptidase encoded by bacteriophage t5.
AB  == although bacteriophage t5 is known to have lytic proteins for cell wall hydrolysis and phage progeny escape, their activities are still unknown. this is  the first report on the cloning, expression and biochemical characterization of a bacteriophage t5 lytic hydrolase. the endolysin-encoding lys gene of virulent coliphage t5 was cloned in escherichia coli cells, and an electrophoretically homogeneous product of this gene was obtained with a high yield (78% of total activity). the protein purified was shown to be an l-alanoyl-d-glutamate peptidase. the enzyme demonstrated maximal activity in diluted buffers (25-50 mm) at ph 8.5. the enzyme was strongly inhibited by edta and bapta, and fully reactivated by calcium/manganese chlorides. it was found that, along with e. coli peptidoglycan, peptidase of bacteriophage t5 can lyse peptidoglycans of other gram-negative microorganisms (pectobacterium carotovorum, pseudomonas putida, proteus vulgaris, and proteus mirabilis). this endolysin is the first example of  an l-alanoyl-d-glutamate peptidase in a virulent phage infecting gram-negative bacteria. there are, however, a great many sequences in databases that are highly similar to that of bacteriophage t5 hydrolase, indicating a wide distribution of  endolytic l-alanoyl-d-glutamate peptidases. the article discusses how an enzyme with such substrate specificity could be fixed in the process of evolution.

TI  == novel low-temperature-active phytase from erwinia carotovora var.carotovota accc  10276.
AB  == a phytase with high activity at low temperatures has great potential for feed applications, especially in aquaculture. therefore, this study used a degenerate  pcr and tail pcr to clone a phytase gene from erwinia carotovora var. carotovota, the cause of soft rot of vegetables in the ground or during cold storage. the full-length 2.5-kb fragment included an open reading frame of 1,302 bp and encoded a putative phytase of 45.3 kda with a 50% amino acid identity to the klebsiella pneumoniae phytase. the phytase contained the active site rhgxrxp and  hd sequence motifs that are typical of histidine acid phosphatases. the enzyme was expressed in escherichia coli, purified, and displayed the following characteristics: a high catalytic activity at low temperatures (retaining over 24% activity at 5 degrees c) and remarkably thermal lability (losing >96% activity after incubation at 60 degrees c for 2 min). the optimal phytase activity occurred at ph 5.5 and approximately 40 degrees c, and the enzyme activity rapidly decreased above 40 degrees c. when compared with mesophilic counterparts, the phytase not only exhibited a high activity at a low temperature, but also had a low k(m) and high k(cat). these temperature characteristics and kinetic parameters are consistent with low-temperature-active enzymes. to our knowledge, this would appear to be the first report of a low-temperature-active phytase and its heterogeneous expression.

TI  == extracellular secretion of carocin s1 in pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum occurs via the type iii secretion system integral to the bacterial flagellum.
AB  == background: pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum is a phytopathogenic enterobacterium responsible for soft rot, a disease characterized by extensive maceration of the affected plant tissue. this species also produces two or more antibacterial substances called bacteriocins, which enhance its competitiveness against related rival species. however, the secretion mechanism for low-molecular-weight bacteriocin is still unknown. results: a mutant (flhc::tn5)  that did not secrete the low-molecular-weight bacteriocin (lmwb), carocin s1, was generated by tn5 insertional mutagenesis. sequence analysis indicated that this insertion disrupted open reading frame 2 (orf2) and orf3 of this strain. deletion and rescue experiments indicated that orf2 and orf3 were both required for extracellular lmwb secretion. the orf2 and orf3 sequences showed high homology with the flhd and flhc gene sequences of pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. atroseptica, serratia marcescens, yersinia enterocolitica, and escherichia coli,  indicating that they likely encoded key regulatory components of the type iii flagella secretion system. conclusion: thus, the extracellular export of carocin  s1 by pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum appears to utilize the type iii secretion system integral to bacterial flagella.

TI  == control of foodborne pathogens and soft-rot bacteria on bell pepper by three strains of bacterial antagonists.
AB  == forty-two representative strains of native bacteria associated with fresh peeled  baby carrots were isolated and characterized. two of these strains, identified as pseudomonas fluorescens ag3a (pf ag3a) and bacillus yd1, were evaluated in conjunction with another known antagonist, p. fluorescens 2-79 (pf 2-79), for their potential as biocontrol agents of human pathogens (listeria monocytogenes,  yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella enterica, and escherichia coli o157:h7) and soft-rot bacteria (erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, pseudomonas marginalis,  and pseudomonas viridiflava). when grown on iron-deficient agar media, all three  antagonists produced inhibition zones up to 25 mm in diameter against the growth  of human pathogens and soft-rot bacteria. however, when grown on iron-rich agar media, only pf 2-79 and bacillus yd1 exhibited antimicrobial activity. treatment  of bell pepper disks with pf 2-79 or bacillus yd1 reduced the growth of pathogen  by 1.4 to 4.1 log units, depending upon the ratio of the number of antagonist cells to pathogen cells (1:1, 10:1, 100:1, or 1,000:1). the greatest reduction was observed when 10- to 100-fold higher number of antagonists than pathogens was applied. pf ag3a and bacillus yd1 reduced the growth of pathogens on pepper disks at 20 degrees c but not at 10 degrees c. however, pf 2-79 reduced the growth of l. monocytogenes and y. enterocolitica by up to 4 log units at either 20 or 10 degrees c. treatment of pepper disks with pf 2-79 also reduced the incidence of soft rot induced by soft-rot bacteria by 40 to 70%. pf 2-79 is the most effective of the three antagonists tested for control of spoilage bacteria and human pathogens on bell pepper.

TI  == the phage abortive infection system, toxin, functions as a protein-rna toxin-antitoxin pair.
AB  == various mechanisms exist that enable bacteria to resist bacteriophage infection.  resistance strategies include the abortive infection (abi) systems, which promote cell death and limit phage replication within a bacterial population. a highly effective 2-gene abi system from the phytopathogen erwinia carotovora subspecies  atroseptica, designated toxin, is described. the toxin abi system also functions  as a toxin-antitoxin (ta) pair, with toxn inhibiting bacterial growth and the tandemly repeated toxi rna antitoxin counteracting the toxicity. ta modules are currently divided into 2 classes, protein and rna antisense. we provide evidence  that toxin defines an entirely new ta class that functions via a novel protein-rna mechanism, with analogous systems present in diverse bacteria. despite the debated role of ta systems, we demonstrate that toxin provides viral  resistance in a range of bacterial genera against multiple phages. this is the first demonstration of a novel mechanistic class of ta systems and of an abi system functioning in different bacterial genera, both with implications for the  dynamics of phage-bacterial interactions.

TI  == structural and functional insights into erwinia carotovora l-asparaginase.
AB  == bacterial l-asparaginases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of l-asparagine to aspartic acid. for the past 30 years, these enzymes have been used as therapeutic agents in the treatment of acute childhood lymphoblastic leukemia. their intrinsic low-rate glutaminase activity, however, causes serious  side-effects, including neurotoxicity, hepatitis, coagulopathy, and other dysfunctions. erwinia carotovora asparaginase shows decreased glutaminase activity, so it is believed to have fewer side-effects in leukemia therapy. to gain detailed insights into the properties of e. carotovora asparaginase, combined crystallographic, thermal stability and cytotoxic experiments were performed. the crystal structure of e. carotovoral-asparaginase in the presence of l-asp was determined at 2.5 a resolution and refined to an r cryst of 19.2 (r  free = 26.6%) with good stereochemistry. cytotoxicity measurements revealed that  e. carotovora asparaginase is 30 times less toxic than the escherichia coli enzyme against human leukemia cell lines. moreover, denaturing experiments showed that e. carotovora asparaginase has decreased thermodynamic stability as compared to the e. coli enzyme and is rapidly inactivated in the presence of urea. on the  basis of these results, we propose that e. carotovora asparaginase has limited potential as an antileukemic drug, despite its promising low glutaminase activity. our analysis may be applicable to the therapeutic evaluation of other asparaginases as well.

TI  == functional diversity among metallo-beta-lactamases: characterization of the car-1 enzyme of erwinia carotovora.
AB  == metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls) are zinc-dependent bacterial enzymes characterized by an efficient hydrolysis of carbapenems and a lack of sensitivity to commercially available beta-lactamase inactivators. apart from the acquired subclass b1 enzymes, which exhibit increasing clinical importance and whose evolutionary origin remains unclear, most mbls are encoded by resident genes found in the genomes of organisms belonging to at least three distinct phyla. using genome database mining, we identified an open reading frame (orf) (eca2849) encoding an mbl-like protein in the sequenced genome of erwinia carotovora, an important plant pathogen. although no detectable beta-lactamase activity could be found in e. carotovora, a recombinant escherichia coli strain in which the eca2849 orf was cloned showed decreased susceptibility to several beta-lactams, while carbapenem mics were surprisingly poorly affected. the enzyme, named car-1, was purified by means of ion-exchange chromatography steps, and its characterization revealed unique structural and functional features. this new mbl was able to efficiently hydrolyze cephalothin, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime and, to a lesser extent, penicillins and the other cephalosporins but only poorly hydrolyzed meropenem, while imipenem was not recognized. car-1 is the first example of a functional naturally occurring mbl in the family enterobacteriaceae  (order enterobacteriales) and highlights the extraordinary structural and functional diversity exhibited by mbls.

TI  == regulatory network controlling extracellular proteins in erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora: flhdc, the master regulator of flagellar genes, activates rsmb regulatory rna production by affecting gaca and hexa (lrha) expression.
AB  == erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora produces an array of extracellular proteins  (i.e., exoproteins), including plant cell wall-degrading enzymes and harpin, an effector responsible for eliciting hypersensitive reaction. exoprotein genes are  coregulated by the quorum-sensing signal, n-acyl homoserine lactone, plant signals, an assortment of transcriptional factors/regulators (gacs/a, expr1, expr2, kdgr, rpos, hexa, and rsmc) and posttranscriptional regulators (rsma, rsmb rna). rsmb rna production is positively regulated by gacs/a, a two-component system, and negatively regulated by hexa (pect in erwinia chrysanthemi; lrha [lysr homolog a] in escherichia coli) and rsmc, a putative transcriptional adaptor. while free rsma, an rna-binding protein, promotes decay of mrnas of exoprotein genes, binding of rsma with rsmb rna neutralizes the rsma effect. in the course of studies of gaca regulation, we discovered that a locus bearing strong homology to the flhdc operon of e. coli also controls extracellular enzyme production. a transposon insertion flhdc(-) mutant produces very low levels of pectate lyase, polygalacturonase, cellulase, protease, and e. carotovora subsp. carotovora harpin (harpin(ecc)) and is severely attenuated in its plant virulence. the production of these exoproteins is restored in the mutant carrying an flhdc(+) plasmid. sequence analysis and transcript assays disclosed that the flhd operon of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, like those of other enterobacteria, consists of flhd and flhc. complementation analysis revealed that the regulatory effect requires functions of both flhd and flhc products. the data presented here show that flhdc positively regulates gaca, rsmc, and flia and negatively regulates hexa (lrha). evidence shows that flhdc controls extracellular protein production through cumulative effects on hexa and gaca. reduced levels of gaca and elevated levels of hexa in the flhdc(-) mutant are responsible for the inhibition of rsmb rna production, a condition conducive to the accumulation of free rsma. indeed, studies with an rsma(-) flhdc(-) double mutant and multiple copies of rsmb(+) dna establish that the negative effect of flhdc deficiency is exerted via rsma. the flhdc-mediated regulation of flia has no bearing on exoprotein production in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora. our observations for the first time establish a regulatory connection between flhdc,  hexa, gaca, and rsmb rna in the context of the exoprotein production and virulence of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora.

AB  == aims: to evaluate the efficacy of ultraviolet (uv) light (254 nm) combined with hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) to inactivate bacteria on and within fresh produce.  methods and results: the produce was steep inoculated in bacterial cell suspension followed by vacuum infiltration. the inoculated samples were sprayed with h(2)o(2) under constant uv illumination. the log count reduction (lcr) of salmonella on and within lettuce was dependent on the h(2)o(2) concentration, temperature and treatment time with uv intensity being less significant. by using the optimized parameters (1.5% h(2)o(2) at 50 degrees c, uv dose of 37.8 mj cm(-2)), the surface salmonella were reduced by 4.12 +/- 0.45 and internal counts by 2.84 +/- 0.34 log cfu, which was significantly higher compared with h(2)o(2) or uv alone. higher lcr of escherichia coli o157:h7, pectobacterium carotovora, pseudomonas fluorescens and salmonella were achieved on leafy vegetables compared with produce, such as cauliflower. in all cases, the surface lcr were significantly higher compared with the samples treated with 200 ppm hypochlorite. uv-h(2)o(2)-treated lettuce did not develop brown discolouration during storage but growth of residual survivors occurred with samples held at 25 degrees c. conclusions: uv-h(2)o(2) reduce the bacterial populations on and within fresh produce without affecting the shelf-life stability. significance of the study: uv-h(2)o(2) represent an alternative to hypochlorite washes to decontaminate fresh produce.

TI  == efficacy of neutral electrolyzed water (new) for reducing microbial contamination on minimally-processed vegetables.
AB  == consumption of minimally-processed, or fresh-cut, fruit and vegetables has rapidly increased in recent years, but there have also been several reported outbreaks associated with the consumption of these products. sodium hypochlorite  is currently the most widespread disinfectant used by fresh-cut industries. neutral electrolyzed water (new) is a novel disinfection system that could represent an alternative to sodium hypochlorite. the aim of the study was to determine whether new could replace sodium hypochlorite in the fresh-cut produce  industry. the effects of new, applied in different concentrations, at different treatment temperatures and for different times, in the reduction of the foodborne pathogens salmonella, listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli o157:h7 and against the spoilage bacterium erwinia carotovora were tested in lettuce. lettuce was artificially inoculated by dipping it in a suspension of the studied pathogens at 10(8), 10(7) or 10(5) cfu ml(-1), depending on the assay. the new treatment was always compared with washing with deionized water and with a standard hypochlorite treatment. the effect of inoculum size was also studied. finally, the effect of new on the indigenous microbiota of different packaged fresh-cut products was also determined. the bactericidal activity of diluted new  (containing approximately 50 ppm of free chlorine, ph 8.60) against e. coli o157:h7, salmonella, l. innocua and e. carotovora on lettuce was similar to that  of chlorinated water (120 ppm of free chlorine) with reductions of 1-2 log units. there were generally no significant differences when treating lettuce with new for 1 and 3 min. neither inoculation dose (10(7) or 10(5) cfu ml(-1)) influenced  the bacterial reduction achieved. treating fresh-cut lettuce, carrot, endive, corn salad and 'four seasons' salad with new 1:5 (containing about 50 ppm of free chlorine) was equally effective as applying chlorinated water at 120 ppm. microbial reduction depended on the vegetable tested: new and sodium hypochlorite treatments were more effective on carrot and endive than on iceberg lettuce, 'four seasons' salad and corn salad. the reductions of indigenous microbiota were smaller than those obtained with the artificially inoculated bacteria tested (0.5-1.2 log reduction). new seems to be a promising disinfection method as it would allow to reduce the amount of free chlorine used for the disinfection of fresh-cut produce by the food industry, as the same microbial reduction as sodium hypochlorite is obtained. this would constitute a safer, 'in situ', and easier to handle way of ensuring food safety.

TI  == a metagenomic analysis of soil bacteria extends the diversity of quorum-quenching lactonases.
AB  == a metagenomic library of 10,121 clones, generated from bacteria inhabiting a pasture soil from france, was screened for the presence of fosmids conferring either n-acylhomoserine lactone (nahl) synthesis or nahl degradation ability upon their escherichia coli host. no clone producing nahls was identified whereas one, containing a 31 972 bp insert in fosmid p2h8, allowed nahl degradation. this led  to the cloning and identification of a gene, qlca, encoding an nahl-lactonase activity, as judged by lactone-ring closure and hplc/ms analyses of nahl degradation products. the qlca gene efficiently quenched quorum-sensing regulated pathogenic functions when expressed in pectobacterium carotovorum. the qlca peptide belongs to the family of zinc-dependent metallohydrolases and appears to  be distantly related to other nahl-lactonases discovered in agrobacterium, bacillus, photorhabdus and rhizobium. in-silico analysis of the metagenomic insert revealed the occurrence of 20 orf, with a constant gc% and codon usage, suggesting a unique bacterial origin. nine out of these 20 orf were homologous to genes encoding biosynthesis of arginine; they were clustered with an unusual succession argfjadbcrgh. the fosmid p2h8 is able to complement the arga, argb and argc mutants in e. coli. phylogenetic analysis showed that 9 orf out of 20 were related to sequences from members of the acidobacteria, supporting the hypothesis that the analysed insert might be originated from an organism related to this phylum.

TI  == secondary structures and functional requirements for thim riboswitches from desulfovibrio vulgaris, erwinia carotovora and rhodobacter spheroides.
AB  == abstract bacterial thim riboswitches contain aptamer domains that bind the metabolite thiamine pyrophosphate (tpp). binding of tpp to the aptamer domain induces structural rearrangements that are relayed to the expression domain, thereby interfering with gene expression. here, we report identification of three putative thim riboswitches from different bacteria and analysis of their secondary structures. chemical probing revealed that the riboswitches share similar secondary structures in their aptamer domains that can communicate with the highly variant expression domains in a mechanism likely involving sequestration of the shine-dalgarno sequence. remarkably, the aptamer domain of the thim gene of desulfovibrio vulgaris binds tpp with similar affinity and selectivity as that of escherichia coli, although nucleotides previously shown to form direct contacts to the metabolite are mutated. we also designed small rna hairpins for each riboswitch that bind the rna only in the absence of the metabolite. our study shows that aptamer domains in riboswitches with high similarity in their secondary structures can communicate with a broad variety of  non-related expression domains by similar mechanisms.

TI  == short-tailed stx phages exploit the conserved yaet protein to disseminate shiga toxin genes among enterobacteria.
AB  == infection of escherichia coli by shiga toxin-encoding bacteriophages (stx phages) was the pivotal event in the evolution of the deadly shiga toxin-encoding e. coli (stec), of which serotype o157:h7 is the most notorious. the number of different  bacterial species and strains reported to produce shiga toxin is now more than 500, since the first reported stec infection outbreak in 1982. clearly, stx phages are spreading rapidly, but the underlying mechanism for this dissemination has not been explained. here we show that an essential and highly conserved gene  product, yaet, which has an essential role in the insertion of proteins in the gram-negative bacterial outer membrane, is the surface molecule recognized by the majority (ca. 70%) of stx phages via conserved tail spike proteins associated with a short-tailed morphology. the yaet gene was initially identified through complementation, and its role was confirmed in phage binding assays with and without anti-yaet antiserum. heterologous cloning of e. coli yaet to enable stx phage adsorption to erwinia carotovora and the phage adsorption patterns of bacterial species possessing natural yaet variants further supported this conclusion. the use of an essential and highly conserved protein by the majority  of stx phages is a strategy that has enabled and promoted the rapid spread of shigatoxigenic potential throughout multiple e. coli serogroups and related bacterial species. infection of commensal bacteria in the mammalian gut has been  shown to amplify shiga toxin production in vivo, and the data from this study provide a platform for the development of a therapeutic strategy to limit this yaet-mediated infection of the commensal flora.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to clone the carocin s1 gene and express it in a non-carocin-producing strain of erwinia carotovora. a mutant, th22-10, which produced a high-molecular-weight bacteriocin but not a low-molecular-weight bacteriocin, was obtained by tn5 insertional mutagenesis using h-rif-8-2 (a spontaneous rifampin-resistant mutant of erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora 89-h-4). using thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr, the dna sequence from the tn5 insertion site and the dna sequence of the contiguous 2,280-bp region were determined. two complete open reading frames (orf), designated orf2 and orf3, were identified within the sequence fragment. orf2 and orf3 were identified with  the carocin s1 genes, caros1k (orf2) and caros1i (orf3), which, respectively, encode a killing protein (caros1k) and an immunity protein (caros1i). these genes were homologous to the pyocin s3 gene and the pyocin ap41 gene. carocin s1 was expressed in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora ea1068 and replicated in th22-10 but could not be expressed in escherichia coli (jm101) because a consensus sequence resembling an sos box was absent. a putative sequence similar to the consensus sequence for the e. coli cyclic amp receptor protein binding site (-312 bp) was found upstream of the start codon. production of this bacteriocin was also induced by glucose and lactose. the homology search results indicated that the carocin s1 gene (between bp 1078 and bp 1704) was homologous to the pyocin s3 and pyocin ap41 genes in pseudomonas aeruginosa. these genes encode proteins with nuclease activity (domain 4). this study found that carocin s1 also has nuclease  activity.

AB  == the erwinia carotoerora strains bearing exogenous plasmid r68.45 have been obtained by means of transconjugation. dynamics and frequency characteristics of  plasmid transfer to erwinia cells have been studied. plasmid-phage interrelations have been studied for the first time in e. carotovora. it has been established that the presence of exogenous plasmid r68.45 affects essentially the culture growth parameters and lisogenization of e. carotovora by the wild phage zf40 and  its clear-mutants. the phage infection leads to the exclusion of plasmid r68.45 with different frequency (from 23 to 45% depending on the phage mutant). the presence of plasmid r68.45 in the erwinia cells destabilizes the defective lysogeny in e. carotovora.

TI  == direct visualization of red fluorescent lipoproteins indicates conservation of the membrane sorting rules in the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == chimeras created by fusing the monomeric red fluorescent protein (rfp) to a bacterial lipoprotein signal peptide (liporfps) were visualized in the cell envelope by epifluorescence microscopy. plasmolysis of the bacteria separated the inner and outer membranes, allowing the specific subcellular localization of liporfps to be determined in situ. when equipped with the canonical inner membrane lipoprotein retention signal cdsr, liporfp was located in the inner membrane in escherichia coli, whereas the outer membrane sorting signal cssr caused liporfp to localize to the outer membrane. cfsr-rfp was also routed to the outer membrane, but cfnsr-rfp was located in the inner membrane, consistent with  previous data showing that this sequence functions as an inner membrane retention signal. these four lipoproteins exhibited identical localization patterns in a panel of members of the family enterobacteriaceae, showing that the lipoprotein sorting rules are conserved in these bacteria and validating the use of e. coli as a model system. although most predicted inner membrane lipoproteins in these bacteria have an aspartate residue after the fatty acylated n-terminal cysteine residue, alternative signals such as cfn can and probably do function in parallel, as indicated by the existence of putative inner membrane lipoproteins with this sequence at their n termini.

TI  == the dcta gene of pseudomonas chlororaphis o6 is under rpon control and is required for effective root colonization and induction of systemic resistance.
AB  == transcription from the dcta gene, which encodes an organic acid transporter in the root-colonizing bacterium pseudomonas chlororaphis o6, is under complex regulatory control. promoter sequence analysis revealed an rpon binding site. the regulation of transcript accumulation by the level of ammonium ions in the growth medium confirmed rpon regulation, even in the presence of glucose. a dcta mutant  colonized tobacco roots to a lesser extent than the wild-type mutant during early seedling development. colonization by the dcta mutant, as compared to the wild type, also reduced the level of systemically induced resistance against the soft  rot pathogen erwinia carotovora scc1. we ascribe this reduced colonization to the inability of the mutant to utilize certain organic acid components in the root exudates. the dcta mutant failed to grow on succinate and fumarate, and showed reduced growth on malate. all altered properties of the mutant were complemented  by the full-length dcta gene. we propose that organic acids in root exudates may  provide important nutrient sources for the beneficial root-colonizing pseudomonad.

AB  == aims: polish isolates of pectinolytic bacteria from the species pectobacterium carotovorum were screened for the presence of a dna restriction-modification (r-m) system. methods and results: eighty-nine strains of p. carotovorum were isolated from infected potato plants. sixty-six strains belonged to p. carotovorum ssp. atrosepticum and 23 to p. carotovorum ssp. carotovorum. the presence of restriction enzyme pca17ai, which is an isoschizomer of ecorii endonuclease, was observed in all isolates of p. c. atrosepticum but not in p. c. carotovorum. the biochemical properties, pcr amplification, and sequences of the  pca17ai restriction endonuclease and methyltransferase genes were compared with the prototype ecorii r-m system genes. only when dna isolated from cells of p. c. atrosepticum was used as a template, amplification of a 680 bp homologous to the  gene coding ecorii endonuclease. conclusions: endonuclease pca17ai, having a relatively low temperature optimum, was identified. pcr amplification revealed that the nucleotide sequence of genes for ecorii and pca17ai r-m are different. dcm methylation was observed in all strains of pectobacterium and other erwinia species tested. the sequence of a dna fragment coding dcm methylase in p. carotovorum was different from that of escherichia coli. significance and impact  of the study: pca17ai is the first psychrophilic isoschizomer of ecorii endonuclease. the presence of specific dcm methylation in chromosomal dna isolated from p. carotovorum is described for the first time. a 680 bp pcr product, unique for p. c. atrosepticum strains, could serve as a molecular marker for detection of these bacteria in environmental samples.

TI  == expr, a luxr homolog of erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, activates transcription of rsma, which specifies a global regulatory rna-binding protein.
AB  == n-acyl homoserine lactone (ahl) is required by erwinia carotovora subspecies for  the expression of various traits, including extracellular enzyme and protein production and pathogenicity. previous studies with e. carotovora subsp. carotovora have shown that ahl deficiency causes the production of high levels of rsma, an rna binding protein that functions as a global negative regulator of extracellular enzymes and proteins and secondary metabolites (rsm, regulator of secondary metabolites). we document here that expr, a putative ahl receptor belonging to the luxr family of regulators, activates rsma production. in the absence of ahl, an expr(+) e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain compared to its expr(-) mutant, produces higher levels of rsma rna and better expresses an rsma-lacz transcriptional fusion. moreover, the expression of the rsma-lacz fusion in escherichia coli is much higher in the presence of expr(71) (the expr gene of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain ecc71) than in its absence. we also show that purified preparation of mbp-expr(71) binds (mbp, maltose binding protein) rsma dna. by contrast, mbp-expr(71) does not bind ahli (gene for ahl synthase), pel-1 (gene for pectate lyase), or rsmb (gene for regulatory rna that  binds rsma), nor does expr(71) activate expression of these genes. these observations strongly suggest transcriptional activation of rsma resulting from a direct and specific interaction between expr(71) and the rsma promoter. several lines of evidence establish that n-3-oxohexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-c6-hl), the major ahl analog produced by e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain ecc71, inhibits expr(71)-mediated activation of rsma expression. these findings for the first time establish that the expr effect in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora is channeled via rsma, a posttranscriptional regulator of e. carotovora subspecies, and ahl neutralizes this expr effect.

AB  == bacterial l-asparaginases (e.c. 3.5.1.1) have been used as therapeutic agents in  the treatment of acute childhood lymphoblastic leukaemia. l-asparaginase from erwinia carotovora ncyc 1526 (era) was cloned and expressed in e. coli. the enzyme was purified to homogeneity by a two-step procedure comprising cation-exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography on immobilised l-asparagine. the enzymatic properties of the recombinant enzyme were investigated and the kinetic parameters (k(m), k(cat)) for a number of substrates were determined. molecular modelling studies were also employed to create a model of era, based on the known structure of the erwinia chrysanthemi enzyme. the molecular model was used to help interpret biochemical data concerning substrate  specificity and catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. the kinetic parameters of selected substrates were determined at various ph values, and the ph-dependence profiles of v(max) and v(max)/k(m) were analyzed. the ph-dependence of v(max) shows one transition in the acidic ph range with pk(a)=5.4, and the ph-dependence of v(max)/k(m) exhibits two transitions with pk(a)=5.4 and 8.5. based on analysis of alternative substrates and molecular modelling studies, it was concluded that  the pk(a) at the acidic ph range corresponds to the active site residues asp115 or glu82, whereas the pk(a) observed at the alkaline ph range is not due to substrate amino group ionisation, but rather is the result of enzyme ionisation.  the effect of temperature and viscosity on the catalytic activity of the enzyme was also investigated and it was concluded that the rate-limiting step of the catalytic reaction is relevant to structural transitions of the protein. thermodynamic analysis of the activity data showed that the activation energies are dependent on the substrate, and entropy changes appear to be the main determinant contributing to substrate specificity.

TI  == comparative genomics of the kdgr regulon in erwinia chrysanthemi 3937 and other gamma-proteobacteria.
AB  == in the plant-pathogenic enterobacterium erwinia chrysanthemi, almost all known genes involved in pectin catabolism are controlled by the transcriptional regulator kdgr. in this study, the comparative genomics approach was used to analyse the kdgr regulon in completely sequenced genomes of eight enterobacteria, including erw. chrysanthemi, and two vibrio species. application of a signal recognition procedure complemented by operon structure and protein sequence analysis allowed identification of new candidate genes of the kdgr regulon. most  of these genes were found to be controlled by the camp-receptor protein, a global regulator of catabolic genes. at the next step, regulation of these genes in erw. chrysanthemi was experimentally verified using in vivo transcriptional fusions and an attempt was made to clarify the functional role of the predicted genes in  pectin catabolism. interestingly, it was found that the kdgr protein, previously  known as a repressor, positively regulates expression of two new members of the regulon, phosphoenolpyruvate synthase gene ppsa and an adjacent gene, ydia, of unknown function. other predicted regulon members, namely chmx, dhfx, gntb, pykf, spix, sota, tpfx, yeeo and yjgk, were found to be subject to classical negative regulation by kdgr. possible roles of newly identified members of the erw. chrysanthemi kdgr regulon, chmx, dhfx, gntdbmnac, spix, tpfx, ydia, yeeo, ygjv and yjgk, in pectin catabolism are discussed. finally, complete reconstruction of the kdgr regulons in various gamma-proteobacteria yielded a metabolic map reflecting a globally conserved pathway for the catabolism of pectin and its derivatives with variability in transport and enzymic capabilities among species. in particular, possible non-orthologous substitutes of isomerase kdui and a new oligogalacturonide transporter in the vibrio species were detected.

AB  == a green fluorescent protein-based in vivo expression technology leaf array was used to identify genes in erwinia chrysanthemi 3937 that were specifically upregulated in plants compared with growth in a laboratory culture medium. of 10,000 e. chrysanthemi 3937 clones, 61 were confirmed as plant upregulated. on the basis of sequence similarity, these were recognized with probable functions in metabolism (20%), information transfer (15%), regulation (11%), transport (11%), cell processes (11%), and transposases (2%); the function for the remainder (30%) is unknown. upregulated genes included transcriptional regulators, iron uptake systems, chemotaxis components, transporters, stress response genes, and several already known or new putative virulence factors. ten  independent mutants were constructed by insertions in these plant-upregulated genes and flanking genes. two different virulence assays, local leaf maceration and systemic invasion in african violet, were used to evaluate these mutants. among these, mutants of a purm homolog from escherichia coli (purm::tn5), and hrpb, hrcj, and a hrpd homologs from the erwinia carotovorum hrpa operon (hrpb::tn5, hrcj::tn5, and hrpd::tn5) exhibited reduced abilities to produce local and systemic maceration of the plant host. mutants of rhit from e. chrysanthemi (rhit::tn5), and an eutr homolog from salmonella typhimurium (eutr::tns) showed decreased ability to cause systemic inva sion on african violet. however, compared with the wild-type e. chrysanthemi 3937, these mutants  exhibited no significant differences in local leaf maceration. the pheno type of  hrpb::tn5, hrcc::tn5, and hrpd::tn5 mutants further confirmed our previous findings that hrp genes are crucial virulence determinants in e. chrysanthemi 3937.

TI  == isolation and characterisation of a class of carbohydrate oxidases from higher plants, with a role in active defence.
AB  == in a search for novel plant-derived antimicrobial proteins, we screened extracts  from salicylic acid (sa)-treated lettuce and sunflower leaves. these extracts displayed very potent antimicrobial activity against a set of phytopathogens. characterisation of these extracts revealed that in both extracts, proteins of approximately 60 kda were responsible for the antimicrobial activity. further characterisation of these proteins and cloning of the respective cdnas revealed close homology to a range of (plant) oxidases. dissection of the enzymatic activity of both proteins revealed them to be carbohydrate oxidases (helianthus annuus carbohydrate oxidase (ha-chox) and lactuca sativa carbohydrate oxidase (ls-chox)) with broad substrate specificity and with hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) as one of the reaction products. the sunflower transcript, in addition to being sa inducible, was also inducible by fungal pathogens but not by ethylene and jasmonate. to determine whether ha-chox plays a role in pathogen defence, it was  transformed into tobacco and the effect of resistance to pectobacterium carotovorum ssp. carotovorum was examined. transgenic plants overexpressing ha-chox displayed enhanced resistance to infection by this pathogen, and the resistance level was proportional to enzyme expression.

AB  == we used genetic and biochemical methods to examine the genomic diversity of the enterobacterial plant pathogen erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. the results  obtained with each method showed that e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strains isolated from one ecological niche, potato plants, are surprisingly diverse compared to related pathogens. a comparison of 23 partial mdh sequences revealed  a maximum pairwise difference of 10.49% and an average pairwise difference of 2.13%, values which are much greater than the maximum variation (1.81%) and average variation (0.75%) previously reported for escherichia coli. pulsed-field  gel electrophoresis analysis of i-ceui-digested genomic dna revealed seven rrn operons in all e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strains examined except strain wpp17, which had only six copies. we identified 26 i-ceui restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns and observed significant polymorphism in fragment sizes ranging from 100 to 450 kb for all strains. we detected large plasmids in two strains, including the model strain e. carotovora subsp. carotovora 71. the two least virulent strains had an unusual chromosomal structure, suggesting that  a particular pulsotype is correlated with virulence. to compare chromosomal organization of multiple enterobacterial genomes, several genes were mapped onto  i-ceui fragments. we identified portions of the genome that appear to be conserved across enterobacteria and portions that have undergone genome rearrangements. we found that the least virulent strain, wpp17, failed to oxidize cellobiose and was missing several hrp and hrc genes. the unexpected variability  among isolates obtained from clonal hosts in one region and in one season suggests that factors other than the host plant, potato, drive the evolution of this common environmental bacterium and key plant pathogen.

TI  == insecticidal bacillus thuringiensis silences erwinia carotovora virulence by a new form of microbial antagonism, signal interference.
AB  == it is commonly known that bacteria may produce antibiotics to interfere with the  normal biological functions of their competitors in order to gain competitive advantages. here we report that bacillus thuringiensis suppressed the quorum-sensing-dependent virulence of plant pathogen erwinia carotovora through a new form of microbial antagonism, signal interference. e. carotovora produces and responds to acyl-homoserine lactone (ahl) quorum-sensing signals to regulate antibiotic production and expression of virulence genes, whereas b. thuringiensis strains possess ahl-lactonase, which is a potent ahl-degrading enzyme. b. thuringiensis did not seem to interfere with the normal growth of e. carotovora;  rather, it abolished the accumulation of ahl signal when they were cocultured. in planta, b. thuringiensis significantly decreased the incidence of e. carotovora infection and symptom development of potato soft rot caused by the pathogen. the  biocontrol efficiency is correlated with the ability of bacterial strains to produce ahl-lactonase. while all the seven ahl-lactonase-producing b. thuringiensis strains provided significant protection against e. carotovora infection, bacillus fusiformis and escherichia coli strains that do not process ahl-degradation enzyme showed little effect in biocontrol. mutation of aiia, the  gene encoding ahl-lactonase in b. thuringiensis, resulted in a substantial decrease in biocontrol efficacy. these results suggest that signal interference mechanisms existing in natural ecosystems could be explored as a new version of antagonism for prevention of bacterial infections.

AB  == the erwinia carotorova cara, carb, and carc gene products are essential for the biosynthesis of (5r)-carbapen-2-em-3-carboxylic acid, the simplest carbapenem beta-lactam antibiotic. cara (hereafter named carbapenam synthetase) has been proposed to catalyze formation of (3s,5s)-carbapenam-3-carboxylic acid from (2s,5s)-5-carboxymethyl proline based on characterization of the products of fermentation experiments in escherichia coli cells transformed with pet24a/carb and pet24a/carab, and on sequence homology to beta-lactam synthetase, an enzyme that catalyzes formation of a monocyclic beta-lactam ring with concomitant atp hydrolysis. in this study, we have purified recombinant carbapenam synthetase and shown in vitro that it catalyzes the atp-dependent formation of (3s,5s)-carbapenam-3-carboxylic acid from (2s,5s)-5-carboxymethyl proline. the kinetic mechanism is bi-ter where atp is the first substrate to bind followed by  (2s,5s)-5-carboxymethyl proline and ppi is the last product released based on initial velocity, product and dead-end inhibition studies. the reactions catalyzed by carbapenam synthetase with different diastereomers of the natural substrate and with alternate alpha-amino diacid substrates were studied by hplc,  esi mass spectrometry, and steady-state kinetic analysis. on the basis of these results, we have proposed a role for each moiety of (2s,5s)-5-carboxymethyl proline for binding to the active site of carbapenam synthetase. coupled enzyme assays of amp and pyrophosphate release in the reactions catalyzed by carbapenam  synthetase with adipic and glutaric acid, which lack the alpha-amino group, in the presence and absence of hydroxylamine support the formation of an acyladenylate intermediate in the catalytic cycle.

TI  == ahld, an n-acylhomoserine lactonase in arthrobacter sp., and predicted homologues in other bacteria.
AB  == quorum sensing is a signalling mechanism that controls diverse biological functions, including virulence, via n-acylhomoserine lactone (ahl) signal molecules in gram-negative bacteria. with the aim of isolating strains or enzymes capable of blocking quorum sensing by inactivating ahl, bacteria were screened for ahl degradation by their ability to utilize n-3-oxohexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (ohhl) as the sole carbon source. among four isolates, strain ibn110, identified as arthrobacter sp., was found to grow rapidly on ohhl, and to degrade various ahls with different lengths and acyl side-chain substitutions. co-culture of arthrobacter sp. ibn110 and the plant pathogen erwinia carotovora significantly reduced both the ahl amount and pectate lyase activity in co-culture medium, suggesting the possibility of applying arthrobacter sp. ibn110 in the control of ahl-producing pathogenic bacteria. the ahld gene from arthrobacter sp. ibn110 encoding the enzyme catalysing ahl degradation was cloned, and found to encode a protein of 273 amino acids. a mass spectrometry analysis showed that ahld probably hydrolyses the lactone ring of n-3-hexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone, indicating that ahld is an n-acylhomoserine lactonase (ahlase). a comparison of ahld with other known ahl-degrading enzymes,  bacillus sp. 240b1 aiia, a bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kyushuensis aiia homologue and agrobacterium tumefaciens attm, revealed 25, 26 and 21 % overall identities, respectively, in the deduced amino acid sequences. although these identities were relatively low, the hxdh approximately h approximately d motif was conserved in all the ahlases, suggesting that this motif is essential for ahlase activity. from a genome database search based on the conserved motif, putative ahld-like lactonase genes were found in several other bacteria, and ahl-degrading activities were observed in klebsiella pneumoniae and bacillus stearothermophilus. furthermore, it was verified that ahlk, an ahld homologue, encodes an ahl-degrading enzyme in k. pneumoniae. accordingly, the current results suggest the possibility that ahld-like ahlases could exist in many other  micro-organisms.

AB  == erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora is a causal agent of soft-rot diseases in a  wide variety of plants. here, we have isolated a new regulatory factor involved in the virulence of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora by in vivo insertional mutagenesis using a transposon tn5. the gene was homologous to cytr encoding a transcriptional repressor of nucleoside uptake and catabolism genes in escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and vibrio cholerae. phenotypic characterization of a nonpolar deletion mutant of the cytr homologue (delta cytr) revealed that the delta cytr mutant produced a reduced level of polygalacturonase (peh) and lost its motility compared to that in the parental strain. with electron microscopy, the delta cytr mutant was shown to be aflagellate. furthermore, the expression of flia and flic (encoding sigma28 and flagellin, respectively) was also reduced in delta cytr mutant. the virulence of delta cytr  mutant was reduced in chinese cabbage and potato compared to that of the parental strain. these results suggest that the cytr homologue of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora positively controls peh production and flagellum synthesis and plays an important role in its pathogenicity.

TI  == [type iii secretion system in se9r can recognize and secret harpin in erwinia amylovora].
AB  == bacterial pathogens of both animals and plants use type iii secretion machines to secret virulence proteins. the signal that leads to tye type iii secretion is encoded as stem loop structure in the messenger rna. harpin, produced by erwinia  anylovora is secreted via type iii secretion. erwinia carotovora se9r and erwinia amylovora belong to the same genus and they use type iii secretion machines to secret virulence proteins. we used pcr to amplify hrpn from pcpp430 which harbors hrpn gene cluster, and cloned it to pgem-t vector to get pwgf1, which was then chemically transformed into dh5 alpha (pcpp430hrpn-) and electrotransformed into  se9r. dh5 alpha (pcpp430hrpn-/pwgf1) induced hypersensitive response on tomato leaf and se9r(pwgf1) showed significantly reduced virulence than se9r on chinese  cabbage leaf. western-blotting analysis of the cfep of se9r(pwgf1) showed production of harpin protein. these results suggest the type iii secretion machine in se9r can recognize secretion singal in the gene of harpin in erwinia amylovora and secret it as a biologically native form.

TI  == nitric oxide contributes to induction of innate immune responses to gram-negative bacteria in drosophila.
AB  == studies in mammals uncovered important signaling roles of nitric oxide (no), and  contributions to innate immunity. suggestions of conservation led us to explore the involvement of no in drosophila innate immunity. inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (nos) increased larval sensitivity to gram-negative bacterial infection, and abrogated induction of the antimicrobial peptide diptericin. nos was up-regulated after infection. antimicrobial peptide reporters revealed that no triggered an immune response in uninfected larvae. no induction of diptericin reporters in the fat body required immune deficiency (imd) and domino. these findings show that nos activity is required for a robust innate immune response to gram-negative bacteria, nos is induced by infection, and no is sufficient to trigger response in the absence of infection. we propose that no mediates an early step of the signal transduction pathway, inducing the innate immune response upon natural infection with gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == genes encoding the n-acyl homoserine lactone-degrading enzyme are widespread in many subspecies of bacillus thuringiensis.
AB  == gram-negative bacteria can communicate with each other by n-acyl homoserine lactones (ahls), which are quorum-sensing autoinducers. recently, the aiia gene (encoding an enzyme catalyzing the degradation of ahl) has been cloned from bacillus sp. strain 240b1. during investigations in the course of the ongoing bacillus thuringiensis subsp. morrisoni genome project, an aiia homologue gene in the genome sequence was found. these results led to consideration of the possibility of the widespread existence of the gene in b. thuringiensis. aiia homologue genes were found in 16 subspecies of b. thuringiensis, and their sequences were determined. comparison of the bacillus sp. strain 240b1 aiia gene  with the b. thuringiensis aiia homologue genes showed high homologies of 89 to 95% and 90 to 96% in the nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence, respectively. among the subspecies of b. thuringiensis having an aiia gene, the subspecies aizawai, galleriae, kurstaki, kyushuensis, ostriniae, and subtoxicus were shown to degrade ahl. it was observed that recombinant escherichia coli producing aiia proteins also had ahl-degrading activity and could also attenuate  the plant pathogenicity of erwinia carotovora. these results indicate that insecticidal b. thuringiensis strains might have potential to compete with gram-negative bacteria in natural ecosystems by autoinducer-degrading activity.

TI  == interaction of ozone and negative air ions to control micro-organisms.
AB  == aims: the aims of this study were to investigate the effect of ozone and/or negative air ions (nai) on the viability of bacteria. methods and results: dilute cell suspensions of pseudomonas fluorescens, erwinia carotovora pv. carotovora and escherichia coli were inoculated onto agar and subsequently exposed to ozone  and/or nai. ozone concentration was maintained at 100 +/- 5 nl l-1 and nai at 106 ml-1. when exposed to a combination of ozone and nai, viability among all three bacterial species decreased more rapidly when they were inoculated onto potato dextrose agar (pda) than onto nutrient agar (na). a subsequent test examined the  effect of ozone and nai alone or in combination on the bacteria inoculated onto pda only. treatment with nai alone had no killing effect on any of the bacterial  species. however, a strong interaction between ozone and nai was observed. pseudomonas fluorescens was most susceptible to the combined treatment. cell viability was reduced to 0.7% after 6 h, while 76% of the cells remained viable when exposed to ozone alone. viability of erwinia carotovora pv. carotovora was reduced to 4% after 6 h in the combined treatment compared with 69% when exposed  to ozone alone. escherichia coli was relatively more resistant to the combined treatment; viability was reduced to 40% after 11 h compared with 70% in the ozone alone treatment. conclusions: a strong synergism between ozone and nai on bacterial cell death was found, but the degree of this effect varied depending on bacterial species. significance and impact of the study: the synergism of ozone with nai may provide an effective method of reducing food-borne disease and decay of fresh produce.

TI  == sample sequencing of a selected region of the genome of erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica reveals candidate phytopathogenicity genes and allows comparison with escherichia coli.
AB  == genome sequencing is making a profound impact on microbiology. currently, however, only one plant pathogen genome sequence is publicly available and no genome-sequencing project has been initiated for any species of the genus erwinia, which includes several important plant pathogens. this paper describes a targeted sample sequencing approach to study the genome of erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica (eca), a major soft-rot pathogen of potato. a large insert dna (approx. 115 kb) library of eca was constructed using a bacterial artificial chromosome (bac) vector. hybridization and end-sequence data revealed two overlapping bac clones that span an entire hrp gene cluster. random subcloning and one-fold sequence coverage (>200 kb) across these bacs identified 25 (89%) of 28 hrp genes predicted from the orthologous hrp cluster of erwinia amylovora. regions flanking the hrp cluster contained orthologues of known or putative pathogenicity operons from other erwinia species, including dspef (e. amylovora), hecab and pecsm (e. chrysanthemi), sequences similar to genes from the plant pathogen xylella fastidiosa, including haemagglutinin-like genes, and sequences similar to genes involved in rhizobacterium-plant interactions. approximately 10% of the sequences showed strongest nucleotide similarities to genes in the closely related model bacterium and animal pathogen escherichia coli. however, the positions of some of these genes were different in the two genomes. approximately 30% of sequences showed no significant similarity to any database entries. a physical map was made across the genomic region spanning the hrp cluster by hybridization to the bac library and to digested bac clones, and by pcr between sequence contigs. a multiple genome coverage bac library and one-fold sample sequencing are an effective combination for extracting useful information from important regions of the eca genome, providing a wealth of candidate novel pathogenicity genes for functional analyses. other genomic regions could be similarly targeted.

TI  == overexpresssion of a legionella pneumophila homologue of the e. coli regulator csra affects cell size, flagellation, and pigmentation.
AB  == legionella pneumophila is an inhabitant of the aquatic environment and the causative agent of a bacterial pneumonia. we identified the presence of an l. pneumophila homologue of csra of e. coli and rsma of erwinia carotovora, genes which regulate gene expression by destabilising mrna and which have been shown to relate to environmental fitness and pathogenicity. the legionella csra was able to complement a csra-negative mutant of e. coli. overproduction of csra in l. pneumophila lead to a reduction of flagellation and pigmentation and an increase  in bacterial cell size. csra overproduction was associated with a reduction of flia and flaa transcripts. this suggests that similar to e. coli and erwinia, l.  pneumophila csra is a regulator of gene expression and may contribute to the capability of the pathogen to rapidly adapt to changing environments.

TI  == isolation and characterisation of the major outer membrane protein of erwinia carotovora.
AB  == the purified major outer membrane protein (37275 da) from the psychrotrophic phytopathogen erwinia carotovora mfcl0 was structurally characterised by maldi-tof mass spectrometry, n-terminal microsequencing and dna sequence determinations, and secondary structure prediction analyses. the deduced amino acid sequence showed 76% and 72% of similarities with the serratia marcescens and escherichia coli ompa proteins respectively. dendrogram analysis allowed to point out that e. carotovora is close to the genus serratia. after reconstitution into  planar lipid bilayers, this major protein induced ion channels with a major conductance level of 630 ps in 1 m nacl and a weak cationic selectivity. these functional and structural features allowed to identify this major outer membrane  component of e. carotovora as an ompa-like protein, i.e., a channel-forming protein which could be involved in the infection process of this phytopathogen agent.

TI  == dna inversion in the tail fiber gene alters the host range specificity of carotovoricin er, a phage-tail-like bacteriocin of phytopathogenic erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora er.
AB  == carotovoricin er is a phage-tail-like bacteriocin produced by erwinia carotovora  subsp. carotovora strain er, a causative agent for soft rot disease in plants. here we studied binding and killing spectra of carotovoricin er preparations for  various strains of the bacterium (strains 645ar, ec-2, n786, and p7) and found that the preparations contain two types of carotovoricin er with different host specificities; carotovoricin era possessing a tail fiber protein of 68 kda killed strains 645ar and ec-2, while carotovoricin erb with a tail fiber protein of 76 kda killed strains n786 and p7. the tail fiber proteins of 68 and 76 kda had identical n-terminal amino acid sequences for at least 11 residues. a search of the carotovoricin er region in the chromosome of strain er indicated the occurrence of a dna inversion system for the tail fiber protein consisting of (i) two 26-bp inverted repeats inside and downstream of the tail fiber gene that flank a 790-bp fragment and (ii) a putative dna invertase gene with a 90-bp recombinational enhancer sequence. in fact, when a 1,400-bp region containing the 790-bp fragment was amplified by a pcr using the chromosomal dna of strain er as  the template, both the forward and the reverse nucleotide sequences of the 790-bp fragment were detected. dna inversion of the 790-bp fragment also occurred in escherichia coli dh5alpha when two compatible plasmids carrying either the 790-bp fragment or the invertase gene were cotransformed into the bacterium. furthermore, hybrid carotovoricin cge possessing the tail fiber protein of 68 or  76 kda exhibited a host range specificity corresponding to that of carotovoricin  era or erb, respectively. thus, a dna inversion altered the c-terminal part of the tail fiber protein of carotovoricin er, altering the host range specificity of the bacteriocin.

TI  == nkbor, a mini-tn10-based transposon for random insertion in the chromosome of gram-negative bacteria and the rapid recovery of sequences flanking the insertion sites in escherichia coli.
AB  == we have constructed an r6k-based suicide vector that permits the random insertion of a mini-transposon named nkbor into the chromosome of gram-negative bacteria and the subsequent rapid cloning of sequences flanking the insertion site in escherichia coli. this mini-transposon contains a conditional r6k plasmid origin  of replication, a kanamycin resistance gene and unique restriction sites between  the is10 inverted repeats. nkbor can be propagated by replication in an e. coli strain containing the r6k replicase pi protein. alternatively the mini-transposon can be replicated in a psc 101 derivative that is thermosensitive for its replication so that the mini-transposon acts as a suicide plasmid at nonpermissive temperatures. efficient nkbor transposition is ensured by expression of an adjacent transposase gene and has been demonstrated in e. coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, and erwinia carotovora. sequences flanking the insertion sites in these strains can be rapidly recovered and identified in e. coli strains expressing the r6k pi protein.

TI  == effects of the two-component system comprising gaca and gacs of erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora on the production of global regulatory rsmb rna, extracellular enzymes, and harpinecc.
AB  == posttranscriptional regulation mediated by the regulator of secondary metabolites (rsm) rsma-rsmb pair is the most important factor in the expression of genes for  extracellular enzymes and harpinecc in erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. rsma is a small rna-binding protein, which acts by lowering the half-life of a mrna species. rsmb specifies an untranslated regulatory rna and neutralizes the rsma effect. it has been speculated that gaca-gacs, members of a two-component system, may affect gene expression via rsma. because expa, a gaca homolog, and exps (or rpfa), a gacs homolog, have been identified in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, we examined the effects of these gaca and gacs homologs on the expression of rsma, rsmb, and an assortment of exoprotein genes. the gaca gene of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain 71 stimulated transcription of genes for several extracellular enzymes (pel-1, a pectate lyase gene; peh-1, a polygalacturonase gene; and celv, a cellulase gene), hrpnecc (an e. carotovora subsp. carotovora gene specifying the elicitor of hypersensitive reaction), and rsmb in gaca+ and gacs+ e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strains. similarly, the e. carotovora subsp. carotovora gaca gene stimulated csrb (rsmb) transcription in escherichia coli. a gacs- mutant of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain ah2 and a gaca- mutant of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain ecc71 compared with their parent strains produced very low levels of rsmb, pel-1, peh-1, celv, and hrpnecc transcripts but produced similar levels of rsma rna and rsma protein as well as transcripts of hyperproduction of extracellular enzymes (hex) hexa, kdgr (repressor of genes for uronate and pectate catabolism), rsmc, and rpos (gene for sigma-s, an alternate sigma factor). the levels of rsmb, pel-1, peh-1, celv, and  hrpnecc transcripts as well as production of pectate lyase, polygalacturonase, cellulase, protease, and harpinecc proteins were stimulated in gacs- and gaca- mutants by gacs+ or gaca+ plasmids, respectively. the gaca effect on exoenzyme genes and hrpnecc was abrogated in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora mutants deficient in rsma and rsmc or rsma, rsmc, and rsmb rna. the expression of lacz transcriptional fusions of rsmb of erwinia amylovora and erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae was markedly reduced in a gaca- and a gacs- mutant of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. southern blot hybridization revealed the presence of gaca  and gacs homologs in all tested strains of soft-rotting erwinia spp. and several  nonsoft-rotting erwinia species such as e. amylovora, e. rhapontici, e. herbicola, e. stewartii, and e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae. these findings establish that the gaca-gacs system controls transcription of rsmb of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, e. amylovora, and e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae and  support the hypothesis that the effects of this two-component system on extracellular protein production in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora is mediated,  at least in part, via the levels of rsmb transcripts.

TI  == hexa of erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora strain ecc71 negatively regulates production of rpos and rsmb rna, a global regulator of extracellular proteins, plant virulence and the quorum-sensing signal, n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone.
AB  == the soft-rotting bacterium, erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora (e. c. carotovora), produces an array of extracellular enzymes (= exoenzymes), including pectate lyase (pel), polygalacturonase (peh), cellulase (cel) and protease (prt), as well as harpinecc, the elicitor of hypersensitive reaction (hr). the production of these exoenzymes and harpinecc responds to plant products and the quorum-sensing signal [n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone; ohl] and is subject to both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. hexa of e. c. carotovora strain ecc71 (hereafter hexa71), like that of another e. c. carotovora strain, negatively controls the production of exoenzymes, ohl and virulence in e. c. carotovora strain ecc71. in addition to exoenzymes, hexa71 negatively regulates the expression of hrpnecc, the structural gene for harpinecc. exoenzyme overproduction is abolished by ohl deficiency in a hexa- and ohll- double mutant, indicating that hexa and ohl are components of a common regulatory pathway controlling exoenzyme production. hexa71 negatively affects rpos, as the levels of this alternative sigma factor are higher in the hexa- mutant than in the hexa+ strain. however, a hexa- and rpos double mutant produces higher levels of exoenzymes and transcripts of pel-1, peh-1 and celvgenes than the hexa- and rpos+ parent. thus, the elevated levels of rpos protein in the hexa- mutant do not account for exoenzyme overproduction. the following evidence  associates for the first time the phenotypic changes in the hexa mutant to overproduction of rsmb rna, a global regulator of exoenzymes, harpinecc, ohl and  secondary metabolites. analyses of rsmb transcripts and expression of an rsmb-laczoperon fusion in e. c. carotovora strain ecc71 revealed that hexa71 negatively regulates transcription of rsmb. multiple copies of hexa71+ dna suppress various phenotypes, including exoenzyme production in e. c. carotovora strain ecc71, and concomitantly inhibit the production of rsmb, pel-1, peh-1, celv and hrpnecc transcripts. multiple copies of rsmb+ dna, on the other hand, stimulate exoenzyme production by relieving the negative effects of a chromosomal copy of hexa+. the occurrence of hexa homologues and the negative effect of the dosage of hexa71 dna on rsmb transcripts were also detected in other e. c. carotovora strains as well as erwinia carotovora atroseptica and erwinia carotovora betavasculorum. extrapolating from the findings with lrha, the escherichia coli homologue of hexa, and the presence of spre homologues in e. carotovora subspecies, we propose that hexa71 controls several regulatory pathways in e. carotovora including rsmb transcription and the production of spreecc which, in turn, affects rpos levels. a model is presented that integrates the findings presented here and our current knowledge of the major regulatory network that controls exoprotein production in soft-rotting erwinia carotovora subspecies.

AB  == a potato gene encoding a putative wrky protein was isolated from a cdna library enriched by suppression subtractive hybridization for sequences upregulated 1 h postinoculation with erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica. the cdna encodes a putative polypeptide of 172 amino acids, containing a single wrky domain with a zinc finger motif and preceded by a potential nuclear localization site. st-wrky1 was strongly upregulated in compatible, but only weakly in incompatible, interactions with phytophthora infestans where, in all cases, it was coregulated  with class i endochitinase, associating its expression with a known defense response. whereas st-wrky1 was strongly induced by e. carotovora culture filtrate (cf), confirming it to be an elicitor-induced gene, no such induction was detected after treatment with salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, ethylene, or wounding. st-wrky1 was upregulated by treatment of potato leaves with cfs from recombinant escherichia coli containing plasmids expressing e. carotovora pectate lyase genes pelb and peld, suggesting that either proteins encoded by these genes, or oligogalacturonides generated by their activity, elicit a potato defense pathway associated with st-wrky1.

TI  == a two-component regulatory system, pehr-pehs, controls endopolygalacturonase production and virulence in the plant pathogen erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora.
AB  == genes coding for the main virulence determinants of the plant pathogen erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, the plant cell wall-degrading enzymes, are under the coordinate control of global regulator systems including both positive and negative factors. in addition to this global control, some virulence determinants are subject to specific regulation. we have previously shown that mutations in the pehr locus result in reduced virulence and impaired production of one of these enzymes, an endopolygalacturonase (peha). in contrast, these pehr strains produce essentially wild-type levels of other extracellular enzymes including pectate lyases and cellulases. in this work, we characterized the pehr locus and  showed that the dna sequence is composed of two genes, designated pehr and pehs,  present in an operon. mutations in either pehr or pehs caused a peh-negative phenotype and resulted in reduced virulence on tobacco seedlings. complementation experiments indicated that both genes are required for transcriptional activation of the endopolygalacturonase gene, peha, as well as restoration of virulence. structural characterization of the pehr-pehs operon demonstrated that the corresponding polypeptides are highly similar to the two-component transcriptional regulators phop-phoq of both escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. functional similarity of pehr-pehs with phop-phoq of e. coli and s.  typhimurium was demonstrated by genetic complementation.

TI  == quorum sensing in the plant pathogen erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora: the role of expr(ecc).
AB  == the production of the main virulence determinants of the plant pathogen erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, the extracellular cell wall-degrading enzymes, is partly controlled by the diffusible signal molecule n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (ohhl). ohhl is synthesized by the product of the expi/cari gene. linked to expi we found a gene encoding a putative transcriptional regulator of the luxr-family. this gene, expr(ecc), is transcribed convergently to the expi gene and the two open reading frames are partially overlapping. the expr(ecc) protein showed extensive amino acid sequence similarity to the repressor esar from pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii (formerly erwinia stewartii subsp. stewartii) and to the expr(ech) protein of erwinia chrysanthemi. inactivation of the e. carotovora subsp. carotovora expr(ecc) gene caused no decrease in virulence or production of virulence determinants in vitro. in contrast, there was a slight increase in the maceration capacity of the mutant strain. the effects of expr(ecc) were probably mediated by changes in ohhl levels. inactivation of expr(ecc) resulted in increased ohhl levels during early logarithmic growth. in addition, overexpression of expr(ecc)  caused a clear decrease in the production of virulence determinants and part of this effect was likely to be caused by ohhl binding to expr(ecc). expr(ecc) did not appear to exhibit transcriptional regulation of expi, but the effect on ohhl  was apparently due to other mechanisms.

TI  == the response regulator expm is essential for the virulence of erwinia carotovora  subsp. carotovora and acts negatively on the sigma factor rpos (sigma s).
AB  == the main virulence factors of erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, the secreted, extracellular cell-wall-degrading enzymes, are controlled by several regulatory mechanisms. we have isolated transposon mutants with reduced virulence on tobacco. one of these mutants, with a mutation in a gene designated expm, was characterized in this study. this mutant produces slightly reduced amounts of extracellular enzymes in vitro and the secretion of the enzymes is also affected. the expm wild-type allele was cloned together with an upstream gene, designated expl, that has an unknown function. the expm gene was sequenced and found to encode a protein with similarity to the rssb/spre protein of escherichia coli and the mvia protein of salmonella typhimurium. these proteins belong to a new type of two-component response regulators that negatively regulate the stability of the sigma factor rpos (sigma s) at the protein level. the results of this study suggest that expm has a similar function in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora. we also provide evidence that the overproduction of rpos in the expm mutant is an important factor for the reduced virulence phenotype and that it partly causes the observed phenotype seen in vitro. however, an expm/rpos double mutant is still affected in secretion of extracellular enzymes, suggesting that expm in addition to rpos also acts on other targets.

AB  == a novel erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora mutant designated rexz, (regulator of exoenzymes) showed reduced production of the degradative exoenzymes. the rexz  gene product shows similarity of the kdgr regulatory protein from erwinia chrysanthemi, described as the major repressor of the pectin catabolism pathway genes in the latter species. in vitro dna-protein interaction experiments demonstrated that the synthesis of the rexz protein is controlled by the camp-crp (camp-receptor protein) complex. western blot analysis also revealed the presence of a second kdgr homologue (distinct from rexz) which, like rexz, was present in  all species of the genus erwinia tested. the corresponding kdgr proteins from both e. carotovora subsp. carotovora and e. carotovora subsp. atroseptica share a high level of sequence identity with the kdgr homologues from e. chrysanthemi and escherichia coli. although the e. carotovora subsp. carotovora rexz regulatory region displayed specific interactions with both the purified e. chrysanthemi kdgr repressor and the partially purified e. carotovora subsp. carotovora kdgr, in vivo quantification revealed that the cellular level of rexz protein was unaffected by the presence of pectic compounds. this study shows that the complex regulatory network governing virulence in the erwinias involves two totally distinct, but highly conserved, members of the icir class of dna binding proteins: rexz and kdgr.

AB  == erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora produces extracellular pectate lyase (pel),  polygalacturonase (peh), cellulase (cel), and protease (prt). the concerted actions of these enzymes largely determine the virulence of this plant-pathogenic bacterium. e. carotovora subsp. carotovora also produces harpinecc, the elicitor  of the hypersensitive reaction. we document here that kdgrecc (kdg, 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate; kdgr, general repressor of genes involved in pectin and  galacturonate catabolism), a homolog of the e. chrysanthemi repressor, kdgrech and the escherichia coli repressor, kdgreco, negatively controls not only the pectinases, pel and peh, but also cel, prt, and harpinecc production in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora. the levels of pel-1, peh-1, celv, and hrpnecc transcripts are markedly affected by kdgrecc. the kdgrecc- mutant is more virulent than the kdgrecc+ parent. thus, our data for the first time establish a  global regulatory role for kdgrecc in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora. another novel observation is the negative effect of kdgrecc on the transcription of rsmb  (previously aeph), which specifies an rna regulator controlling exoenzyme and harpinecc production. the levels of rsmb rna are higher in the kdgrecc- mutant than in the kdgrecc+ parent. moreover, by dnase i protection assays we determined that purified kdgrecc protected three 25-bp regions within the transcriptional unit of rsmb. alignment of the protected sequences revealed the 21-mer consensus  sequence of the kdgrecc-binding site as 5'-g/aa/ta/tgaaa[n6]tttcag/tg/ta-3'. two  such kdgrecc-binding sites occur in rsmb dna in a close proximity to each other within nucleotides +79 and +139 and the third kdgrecc-binding site within nucleotides +207 and +231. analysis of lacz transcriptional fusions shows that the kdgr-binding sites negatively affect the expression of rsmb. kdgrecc also binds the operator dnas of pel-1 and peh-1 genes and represses expression of a pel1-lacz and a peh1-lacz transcriptional fusions. we conclude that kdgrecc affects extracellular enzyme production by two ways: (i) directly, by inhibiting  the transcription of exoenzyme genes; and (ii) indirectly, by preventing the production of a global rna regulator. our findings support the idea that kdgrecc  affects transcription by promoter occlusion, i.e., preventing the initiation of transcription, and by a roadblock mechanism, i.e., by affecting the elongation of transcription.

TI  == identification and cloning of an erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora bacteriocin regulator gene by insertional mutagenesis.
AB  == avirulent erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora cge234-m403 produces two types of  bacteriocin. for the purpose of cloning the bacteriocin genes of strain cge234m403, a spontaneous rifampin-resistant mutant of this strain, m-rif-11-2, was isolated. by tn5 insertional mutagenesis using m-rif-11-2, a mutant, tm01a01, which produces the high-molecular-weight bacteriocin but not the low-molecular-weight bacteriocin was obtained. by thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr, the dna sequence from the tn5 insertion site and the dna sequence of a contiguous 1,280-bp region were determined. one complete open reading frame (orf), designated orf2, was identified within the sequenced fragment. the 3' end  of another orf, orf1, was located upstream of orf2. a noncoding region and a putative promoter were located between orf1 and orf2. downstream from orf2, the 5' end of another orf (orf3) was found. deduction from the nucleotide sequence indicated that orf2 encodes a protein of 99 amino acids, which showed high homology with yersinia enterocolitica yrp, a regulator of enterotoxin (y-st) production; escherichia coli host factor 1, required for qbeta-replicase; and azorhizobium caulinodans nrfa, required for the expression of nifa. orf2 was designated brg, bacteriocin regulator gene. a fragment containing orf2 and its promoter was amplified and cloned into pbr322 and phsg415r, and the recombinant plasmids, pbyl1 and phyl1, were transferred into e. coli dh5. plasmid pbyl1 was reisolated and transferred into the insertion mutant tm01a01. transformants carrying the plasmid, which was reisolated and designated pbyl1, re-produced the  low-molecular-weight bacteriocin.

TI  == identification and characterization of the fis operon in enteric bacteria.
AB  == the small dna binding protein fis is involved in several different biological processes in escherichia coli. it has been shown to stimulate dna inversion reactions mediated by the hin family of recombinases, stimulate integration and excision of phage lambda genome, regulate the transcription of several different  genes including those of stable rna operons, and regulate the initiation of dna replication at oric. fis has also been isolated from salmonella typhimurium, and  the genomic sequence of haemophilus influenzae reveals its presence in this bacteria. this work extends the characterization of fis to other organisms. very  similar fis operon structures were identified in the enteric bacteria klebsiella  pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, erwinia carotovora, and proteus vulgaris but not in several nonenteric bacteria. we found that the deduced amino acid sequences for fis are 100% identical in k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, e. coli, and s. typhimurium and 96 to 98% identical when e. carotovora and p. vulgaris fis are considered. the deduced amino acid sequence for h. influenzae fis is about 80% identical and 90% similar to fis in enteric bacteria. however, in spite of these  similarities, the e. carotovora, p. vulgaris, and h. influenzae fis proteins are  not functionally identical. an open reading frame (orf1) preceding fis in e. coli is also found in all these bacteria, and their deduced amino acid sequences are also very similar. the sequence preceding orf1 in the enteric bacteria showed a very strong similarity to the e. coli fis p region from -53 to +27 and the region around -116 containing an ihf binding site. both beta-galactosidase assays and primer extension assays showed that these regions function as promoters in vivo and are subject to growth phase-dependent regulation. however, their promoter strengths vary, as do their responses to fis autoregulation and integration host  factor stimulation.

TI  == the oxyr gene from erwinia carotovora: cloning, sequence analysis and expression  in escherichia coli.
AB  == homologs of the escherichia coli oxyr gene were identified in several erwinia species, using a combination of pcr and southern hybridization analysis. the oxyr gene from erwinia carotovora was isolated on a cosmid clone and characterized. the gene and deduced gene product shared high level sequence identity with their  e. coli counterparts (78 and 89% identity, respectively). in e. coli, the oxyr gene is a transcriptional activator that, under oxidizing conditions, induces expression of a set of oxidative defence genes. oxyr null mutants are, therefore, sensitive to hydrogen peroxide. introduction of the e. carotovora oxyr gene into  an e. coli oxyr mutant resulted in transformants that were hydrogen peroxide resistant, indicating that the erwinia protein was functional in e. coli.

TI  == global regulation by the small rna-binding protein csra and the non-coding rna molecule csrb.
AB  == csr (carbon storage regulator) is a recently discovered global regulatory system  that controls bacterial gene expression post-transcriptionally. its effector is a small rna-binding protein referred to as csra or, in phytopathogenic erwinia species, rsma (repressor of stationary phase metabolites). numerous genes whose expression occurs in the stationary phase of growth are repressed by csra/rsma, and csra activates certain exponential-phase metabolic pathways. glycogen synthesis and catabolism, gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, motility, cell surface properties and adherence are modulated by csra in escherichia coli, while the production of several secreted virulence factors, the plant hypersensitive response elicitor hrpn(ecc) and, potentially, other secondary metabolites are regulated by rsma in erwinia carotovora. csra represses glycogen synthesis by binding to and destabilizing glgcap mrna and is hypothesized to repress other genes by a similar mechanism. the second component of the csr system is csrb (aeph in erwinia species), a non-coding rna molecule that forms a large globular  ribonucleoprotein complex with approximately 18 csra subunits and antagonizes the effects of csra in vivo. highly repeated sequence elements found within the loops of predicted stem-loops and other single-stranded segments of csrb rna may facilitate csra binding. current information supports a model in which csra exists in an equilibrium between csrb and csra-regulated mrnas, which predicts that csrb levels may be a key determinant of csra activity in the cell. the presence of csra homologues in phylogenetically diverse species further suggests  that this novel kind of regulatory system is likely to play a broad role in modulating eubacterial gene expression.

TI  == characterization of a novel rna regulator of erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora that controls production of extracellular enzymes and secondary metabolites.
AB  == the enterobacterium erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora strain 71 (hereafter ecc71) produces extracellular enzymes such as pectate lyase isozymes (pels), cellulase (cel), polygalacturonase (peh) and protease (prt). these enzymes degrade plant cell wall components and are largely responsible for the elicitation of soft-rot diseases in plants and plant products. ecc71 also produces harpinecc, the elicitor of hypersensitive reaction (hr) and the quorum-sensing signal, n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (ohl). ohl controls extracellular enzyme and harpinecc production. the levels of these enzymes, as well as the expression of hrpnecc, the structural gene for harpinecc, and ohll, the gene specifying ohl synthesis, are negatively regulated by rsmaa. rsmb, formerly aeph, on the other hand, positively regulates extracellular enzyme production. 6his-rsma recombinant protein purified from e. coli binds rsmb rna as indicated by gel mobility shift assays. rsmb comprises 547 bp dna, which is transcribed from a single start site immediately after a sigma70-like promoter. in ecc71, two rsmb rna species are detected: a full-length 479 base rsmb rna and  a 259 base rsmb' rna. rsmb' dna hybridizes with the 259 base and the 479 base transcripts. a 3' rnase protection assay revealed that the 259 base and the 479 base rna species end at the same position immediately after the putative rho-independent terminator. the expression of rsmb-lacz transcriptional fusions established that the rsmb' rna is not produced because of the activation of an internal promoter. these data strongly suggest that the 259 base rsmb' rna is derived by processing of the primary rsmb rna. in ecc71, rsmb' expression driven  by the lac promoter causes overproduction of pel, peh, cel and prt, and accumulation of pel-1, peh-1, hrpnecc and ohll transcripts. by contrast, a plasmid with the rsmb' dna sequence deleted fails to cause overproduction of the  extracellular enzymes in ecc71. the rsmb' effect also occurs in escherichia coli  as glycogen accumulation is stimulated in the presence of rsmb'. in vivo and in vitro translation as well as mutational analysis of rsmb' have established that rsmb' rna does not yield a translational product. therefore, we concluded that the rsmb' rna itself functions as the regulator. indeed, the expression rsmb' dna leads to neutralization of the negative effects of the rna-binding protein, rsma, in ecc71 and serratia marcescens strain sm274. we propose a model that explains how rsma and rsmb control the expression of genes for extracellular enzymes.

TI  == evidence against the double-arginine motif as the only determinant for protein translocation by a novel sec-independent pathway in escherichia coli.
AB  == proteins which are synthesized with a signal peptide containing a 'double-arginine' motif may be translocated across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane by a mechanism that is different from the known sec and signal recognition particle pathways. the function of the double-arginine motif as a determinant for this novel pathway was studied by expressions of gene constructs  coding for the high potential iron-sulfur protein (hipip) from chromatium vinosum d in escherichia coli. when the protein was produced with its original double-arginine motif-containing signal peptide, it was in part translocated into the periplasm and thereby processed, as shown by immunoblots after cell fractionation and n-terminal sequencing of purified hipip. processing was not inhibited significantly by 3 mm sodium azide, indicating that translocation of hipip occurs by a seca-independent pathway. translocation of hipip could be altered to the seca-dependent mode when its signal peptide was substituted by that of pelb from erwinia carotovora. when the hipip double-arginine motif (srrdavk) was introduced into the corresponding position of the pelb signal peptide, the transport pathway remained seca-dependent. this indicates that additional determinants are required for translocation by the sec-independent pathway.

TI  == two-component regulators involved in the global control of virulence in erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora.
AB  == production of extracellular, plant cell wall degrading enzymes, the main virulence determinants of the plant pathogen erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, is coordinately controlled by a complex regulatory network. insertion mutants in the exp (extracellular enzyme production) loci exhibit pleiotropic defects in virulence and the growth-phase-dependent transcriptional activation of genes encoding extracellular enzymes. two new exp mutations, designated expa and  exps, were characterized. introduction of the corresponding wild-type alleles to  the mutants complemented both the lack of virulence and the impaired production of plant cell wall degrading enzymes. the expa gene was shown to encode a 24-kda  polypeptide that is structurally and functionally related to the uvry gene product of escherichia coli and the gaca response regulator of pseudomonas fluorescens. functional similarity of expa and uvry was demonstrated by genetic complementation. the expa gene is organized in an operon together with a uvrc-like gene, identical to the organization of uvry and uvrc in e. coli. the unlinked exps gene encodes a putative sensor kinase that shows 92% identity to the recently described rpfa gene product from another e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain. our data suggest that exps and expa are members of two-component sensor kinase and response regulator families, respectively. these  two proteins might interact in controlling virulence gene expression in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora.

TI  == rpos (sigma-s) controls expression of rsma, a global regulator of secondary metabolites, harpin, and extracellular proteins in erwinia carotovora.
AB  == rpos (sigma-s or sigma-38) controls a large array of genes that are expressed during stationary phase and under various stress conditions in escherichia coli and other bacteria. we document here that plant pathogenic and epiphytic erwinia  species, such as e. amylovora; e. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, betavasculorum,  and carotovora; e. chrysanthemi; e. herbicola; e. rhapontici; and e. stewartii, possess rpos genes and produce the alternate sigma factor. we show that rpos transcription in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora is driven from a major promoter  which resides within the nlpd gene located upstream of rpos as in e. coli. rpos-  e. carotovora subsp. carotovoa strain ac5061, constructed by marker exchange, is  more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, carbon starvation, and acidic ph than its rpos+ parent strain, ac5006. the basal levels of extracellular pectate lyase, polygalacturonase, and cellulase as well as those of transcripts of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora hrpn (hrpnecc), the gene for the elicitor of the hypersensitive reaction, are higher in the rpos- strain than in the rpos+ parent. likewise, compared to ac5006, ac5061 causes more extensive maceration of celery petioles. our findings with the rpos- mutant and strains carrying multiple copies rpos+ dna reveal that rpos positively controls rsma expression. we also present evidence that supports the hypothesis that the rpos effect on extracellular enzyme levels, hrpnecc expression, and virulence manifests itself by the modulation of rsma expression.

TI  == external loops at the c terminus of erwinia chrysanthemi pectate lyase c are required for species-specific secretion through the out type ii pathway.
AB  == the type ii secretion system (main terminal branch of the general secretion pathway) is used by diverse gram-negative bacteria to secrete extracellular proteins. proteins secreted by this pathway are synthesized with an n-terminal signal peptide which is removed upon translocation across the inner membrane, but the signals which target the mature proteins for secretion across the outer membrane are unknown. the plant pathogens erwinia chrysanthemi and erwinia carotovora secrete several isozymes of pectate lyase (pel) by the out-encoded type ii pathway. however, these two bacteria cannot secrete pels encoded by heterologously expressed pel genes from the other species, suggesting the existence of species-specific secretion signals within these proteins. the functional cluster of e. chrysanthemi out genes carried on cosmid pcpp2006 enables escherichia coli to secrete e. chrysanthemi, but not e. carotovora, pels. we exploited the high sequence similarity between e. chrysanthemi pelc and e. carotovora pel1 to construct 15 hybrid proteins in which different regions of pelc were replaced with homologous sequences from pell. the differential secretion of these hybrid proteins by e. coli(pcpp2006) revealed m118 to d175 and v215 to c329 as regions required for species-specific secretion of pelc. we propose that the primary targeting signal is contained within the external loops  formed by g274 to c329 but is dependent on residues in m118 to d170 and v215 to g274 for proper positioning.

AB  == erwinia carotovora subsp. betavasculorum ecb168 causes vascular necrosis and root rot of sugar beet and produces an antibiotic(s) that is antagonistic against other erwinia spp. ecbi- mutants of ecb168, each containing a single transposon insertion in the ecbi gene (for erwinia carotovora subsp. betavasculorum inducer), do not produce detectable levels of extracellular protease or antibiotic(s), and express less pectate lyase activity and virulence than the wild-type strain. a plasmid containing the cloned ecbi gene complemented the ecbi- mutants for these phenotypes. protease production by ecbi- mutants grown on agar surfaces was restored by neighboring cells of escherichia coli containing ecbi. production of a diffusible n-acylhomoserine lactone autoinducer by wild-type ecb168 was detected with indicator strains of e. coli and agrobacterium tumefaciens. ecbi- mutant strains did not produce an autoinducer detected by the  indicator strains. antibiotic production by ecbi- mutants was restored by cell-free culture supernatants of ecb168 or e. coli containing a cloned ecbi gene. the predicted amino acid sequence of ecbi is similar to those of cari, expi, and hsii, three luxi homologs required for production of a diffusible n-acylhomoserine lactone autoinducer in erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. a luxr homolog, termed ecbr (for erwinia carotovora subsp. betavasculorum regulator), is convergently transcribed and overlaps with ecbi by 17 bp at their  3' ends. these results are consistent with the hypothesis that a quorum-sensing system related to the prototypic luxi-luxr gene pair controls antibiotic and exoenzyme production in erwinia carotovora subsp. betavasculorum.

TI  == the rna molecule csrb binds to the global regulatory protein csra and antagonizes its activity in escherichia coli.
AB  == the rna-binding protein csra (carbon storage regulator) is a new kind of global regulator, which facilitates specific mrna decay. a recombinant csra protein containing a metal-binding affinity tag (csra-h6) was purified to homogeneity and authenticated by n-terminal sequencing, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry, and other studies. this protein was entirely contained within a globular complex of approximately 18 csra-h6 subunits and a single approximately 350-nucleotide rna, csrb. cdna cloning and nucleotide sequencing revealed that the csrb gene is located downstream from syd in the 64-min region of the escherichia coli k-12 genome and  contains no open reading frames. the purified csra-csrb ribonucleoprotein complex was active in regulating glg (glycogen biosynthesis) gene expression in vitro, as was the rna-free form of the csra protein. overexpression of csrb enhanced glycogen accumulation in e. coli, a stationary phase process that is repressed by csra. thus, csrb rna is a second component of the csr system, which binds to csra and antagonizes its effects on gene expression. a model for regulatory interactions in csr is presented, which also explains previous observations on the homologous system in erwinia carotovora. a highly repeated nucleotide sequence located within predicted stem-loops and other single-stranded regions of csrb, cagga(u/a/c)g, is a plausible csra-binding element.

AB  == the production of pectin lyase (pnl) in erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora strain 71 is induced by dna-damaging agents such as mitomycin c (mc). this induction requires functions of reca, rdga and rdgb genes. based upon sequence homology, rdga was predicted to encode a repressor and rdgb was presumed to specify a transcriptional activator. to elucidate the function of rdga, the gene has been over-expressed in escherichia coli, and the 30 kda product purified by ammonium-sulphate precipitation, heparin-agarose chromatography and gel filtration. the results of gel mobility-shift and dnase i protection assays revealed that purified rdga specifically binds the rdga operator sequence located between the -10 and -35 boxes. the expression of a rdga-lacz gene fusion in e. coli mc4100 is suppressed upon overproduction of rdga from a ptac-rdga construct  induced by isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside (iptg). however, the suppression of rdga-tacz expression is relieved by mc in the reca+ e. coli strain mc4100, but not in its reca- derivative, mc4160. an immunoblot analysis revealed  reca-dependent in vivo cleavage of the 30 kda rdga protein upon mc treatment. these results demonstrate that the transcription of rdga is autoregulated, and strongly support the idea that proteolytic activity of reca* is responsible for the derepression of rdga expression.

AB  == carbapenems are beta-lactam antibiotics which have an increasing utility in chemotherapy, particularly for nosocomial, multidrug-resistant infections. strain gs101 of the bacterial phytopathogen, erwinia carotovora, makes the simple beta-lactam antibiotic, 1-carbapen-2-em-3-carboxylic acid. we have mapped and sequenced the erwinia genes encoding carbapenem production and have cloned these  genes into escherichia coli where we have reconstituted, for the first time, functional expression of the beta-lactam in a heterologous host. the carbapenem synthesis gene products are unrelated to enzymes involved in the synthesis of the so-called sulphur-containing beta-lactams, namely penicillins, cephamycins and cephalosporins. however, two of the carbapenem biosynthesis genes, cara and carc, encode proteins which show significant homology with proteins encoded by the streptomyces clavuligerus gene cluster responsible for the production of the beta-lactamase inhibitor, clavulanic acid. these homologies, and some similarities in genetic organization between the clusters, suggest an evolutionary relatedness between some of the genes encoding production of the antibiotic and the beta-lactamase inhibitor. our observation are consistent with  the evolution of a second major biosynthetic route to the production of beta-lactam-ring-containing antibiotics.

TI  == genetic organization of a dna-processing region required for mobilization of a non-self-transmissible plasmid, pec3, isolated from erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora.
AB  == a non-self-transmissible multiple-copy plasmid, pec3, isolated from the phytopathogenic bacterium, erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, can be mobilized by an incp-type plasmid. the hybrid plasmid vector, petc3, constructed from pec3  by fusion to markers conferring tcr and cmr, was transferred by conjugation from  escherichia coli (ec) to various genera of enterobacteriaceae and to other genera of gram(-) bacteria which included xanthomonas, agrobacterium and rhizobium. deletion analysis and successive subcloning of pec3 revealed that a cis-acting locus, orit and a trans-acting locus, mob, were involved in mobilization of pec3. five open reading frames (orfs) were found in the mob region, of which four were  identified as moba, b, c and d. the moba gene overlapped with mobc, b, d and orf1 that were transcribed polycistronically from upstream from mobc. the nature of the four products of mob genes, moba, b, c and d, was verified by use of the t7 promoter system in ec.

TI  == complementation of deletion mutations in a cloned functional cluster of erwinia chrysanthemi out genes with erwinia carotovora out homologues reveals outc and outd as candidate gatekeepers of species-specific secretion of proteins via the type ii pathway.
AB  == the type ii or sec-dependent secretion system is used by diverse gram-negative bacteria for secretion of extracellular proteins. of the 12-15 proteins involved  in secretion, the requirement for many has not been demonstrated and little is known about their functions in the secretion process. the plant pathogens erwinia chrysanthemi and erwinia carotovora secrete extra-cellular pectate lyases (pels)  using the type ii or out pathway. however, these two bacteria cannot secrete pels encoded by heterologously expressed genes from the other species, suggesting the  presence of species-specific recognition factors in the out systems of the two erwinia species. we previously reported the isolation of a cosmid clone, pcpp2oo6, from e. chrysanthemi ec16, which enables escherichia coil to secrete heterologously expressed e. chrysanthemi pels. sequencing in a region required for secretion revealed the presence of 12 genes, outc-m and outo. we report here  the construction of functionally non-polar mutations in each gene in the outc-m operon and outs and outb using a pola(ts) strain of e. coli to facilitate homologous recombination between out genes carrying deletions and their wild-type copies on pcpp2006. by testing for complementation of each deletion with wild-type out genes from e. chrysanthemi ec16 and e. carotovora scri193 we have demonstrated that: (i) each out gene is required for secretion of e. chrysanthemi pele from e. coli with the exception of outh; (ii) each mutation can be complemented by its homologue from e. carotovora, except for outc and outd; (iii) outc and outd from e. carotovora do not confer secretion of pel1 on the e. chrysanthemi out system; and (iv) pel1 secretion can be conferred on the e. chrysanthemi out system by the presence of outc-m, s and b from e. carotovora. the data suggest that outc and outd are gatekeepers of the out system involved in recognition of pels targeted for secretion but that outc and outd from e. carotovora cannot be successfully assembled into the e. chrysanthemi out system.

TI  == global regulation in erwinia species by erwinia carotovora rsma, a homologue of escherichia coli csra: repression of secondary metabolites, pathogenicity and hypersensitive reaction.
AB  == our previous studies revealed that rsma of erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora strain 71 suppressed the synthesis of the cell density (quorum) sensing signal n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone, the production of extracellular enzymes and tissue macerating ability in soft-rotting erwinia species and that homologues of this negative regulator gene were present in other erwinia species. northern blot data presented here demonstrate that rsma and rsma-like genes are also expressed in soft-rotting and non-soft-rotting erwinia spp. such as e. amylovora, e. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, e. carotovora subsp. betavasculorum, e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, e. chrysanthemi, e. herbicola and e. stewartii. a low-copy plasmid carrying rsma of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain 71 caused suppression of antibiotic production in e. carotovora subsp. betavasculorum, flagellum formation in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, carotenoid production in e. herbicola and e. stewartii, and indigoidine production in e. chrysanthemi. in e. amylovora, rsma of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora suppressed the elicitation of the hypersensitive reaction in tobacco leaves and the production of disease symptoms in apple shoots, in addition to repressing motility and extracellular polysaccharide production. we conclude that rsma homologues function as global regulators of secondary metabolic pathways as  well as factors controlling host interaction of erwinia species.

TI  == identification of a global repressor gene, rsma, of erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora that controls extracellular enzymes, n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone, and pathogenicity in soft-rotting erwinia spp.
AB  == the production of extracellular enzymes such as pectate lyase (pel), polygalacturonase (peh), cellulase (cel), and protease (prt) is activated by the  cell density (quorum)-sensing signal, n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (hsl); plant signals; and aep genes during postexponential growth of erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora 71. studies with mutants of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora 71 derepressed in exoenzyme production led to the identification of a  negative regulator gene, rsma (rsm, repressor of secondary metabolites). nucleotide sequencing, transcript assays, and protein analysis established that a 183-bp open reading frame encodes the 6.8-kda rsma. rsma has extensive homology with the csra gene of escherichia coli, which specifies a negative regulator of carbon storage. moreover, the suppression of glycogen synthesis in e. coli by rsma indicates that the erwinia gene is functionally similar to csra. southern hybridizations revealed the presence of rsma homologs in soft-rotting and non-soft-rotting erwinia spp. and in other enterobacteria such as enterobacter aerogenes, e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, serratia marcescens, and yersinia pseudotuberculosis. rsma suppresses production of pel, peh, cel, and prt, plant pathogenicity, and synthesis of hsl in e. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, e. carotovora subsp. betavasculorum, e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, and e. chrysanthemi. in the e. carotovora subsp. carotovora 71, rsma  reduces the levels of transcripts of hsli, a luxi homolog required for hsl biosynthesis. this specific effect and the previous finding that hsl is required  for extracellular enzyme production and pathogenicity in soft-rotting erwinia spp. support the hypothesis that rsma controls these traits by modulating the levels of the cell density (quorum)-sensing signal.

TI  == nucleotide sequence, organization and expression of rdga and rdgb genes that regulate pectin lyase production in the plant pathogenic bacterium erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora in response to dna-damaging agents.
AB  == in most soft-rotting erwinia spp., including e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain 71 (ecc71), production of the plant cell wall degrading enzyme pectin lyase (pnl) is activated by dna-damaging agents such as mitomycin c (mc). induction of pnl production in ecc71 requires a functional reca gene and the rdg  locus. dna sequencing and rna analyses revealed that the rdg locus contains two regulatory genes, rdga and rdgb, in separate transcriptional units. there is high homology between rdga and repressors of lambdoid phages, specially phi 80. rdgb,  however, has significant homology with transcriptional activators of mu phage. both rdga and rdgb are also predicted to possess helix-turn-helix motifs. by replacing the rdgb promoter with the iptg-inducible tac promoter, we have determined that rdgb by itself can activate pnl production in escherichia coli. however, deletion analysis of rdg+ dna indicated that, when driven by their native promoters, functions of both rdga and rdgb are required for the induction  of pnla expression by mc treatment. while rdgb transcription occurs only after mc treatment, a substantial level of rdga mrna is detected in the absence of mc treatment. moreover, upon induction with mc, a new rdga mrna species, initiated from a different start site, is produced at a high level. thus, the two closely linked rdga and rdgb genes, required for the regulation of pnl production, are expressed differently in ecc71.

TI  == regulation of the production of extracellular pectinase, cellulase, and protease  in the soft rot bacterium erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora: evidence that aeph of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora 71 activates gene expression in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, e. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, and escherichia coli.
AB  == the production of pectolytic enzymes (pectate lyase [pel] and polygalacturonase [peh]), cellulase (cel), and protease (prt) is activated in the soft rot bacterium erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora by aepa (activator of extracellular protein production) and celery extract (y. liu, h. murata, a. chatterjee, and a. k. chatterjee, mol. plant-microbe interact. 6:299-308, 1993).  we recently isolated a new class of mutants of strain e. carotovora subsp. carotovora 71 which overproduces pel, peh, cel, and prt. from the overproducing strain ac5034, we identified an activator locus, designated aeph*, which stimulated pel, peh, cel, and prt production in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora 71 or its derivatives. the nucleotide sequence of the aeph* dna segment revealed  an open reading frame of 141 bp that could encode a small (5.45-kda) highly basic (pi 11.7) protein of 47 amino acid residues. analyses of deletions and mudi insertions indicated that the activator function required the 508-bp dna segment  which contains this open reading frame. the wild-type locus, aeph+, is localized  within a dna segment upstream of aepa. an aeph- strain constructed by exchanging  aeph+ with aeph*::mudi was deficient in pel, peh, cel, and prt production; exoenzyme production was restored upon the introduction of a plasmid carrying aeph+ or aeph*. plasmids carrying either aeph+ or aeph* activated the production  of pel-1, peh-1, and cel in escherichia coli hb101 carrying the cognate genes. the aeph effect in e. coli was due to the activation of transcription, as indicated by assays of pel-1 and peh-1 mrnas. the aeph+ and aeph* plasmids also stimulated pel, peh, cel, and prt production in other wild-type e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strains as well as in e. carotovora subsp. atroseptica. although the stimulatory effect was generally more pronounced with aeph* than with aeph+, the extent of activation in the wild-type strains depended upon the bacterial strain and the growth medium. southern blot hybridization revealed the  presence of aeph homologs in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora and e. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, and provided physical evidence for linkage between aepa and aeph homologs in genomes of these bacteria. we conclude that aeph-mediated activation of exoprotein gene expression is a feature common to most strains of e. carotovora.

TI  == nucleotide sequence and expression of a novel pectate lyase gene (pel-3) and a closely linked endopolygalacturonase gene (peh-1) of erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora 71.
AB  == our previous genetic analysis (j. w. willis, j. k. engwall, and a. k. chatterjee, phytopathology 77:1199-1205, 1987) had revealed a tight linkage between pel-3 (pel, pectate lyase gene) and peh-1 (peh, polygalacturonase gene) within the chromosome of erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora 71. nucleotide sequencing, transcript assays, and expression of enzymatic activities in escherichia coli have now confirmed that a 3,500-bp segment contains the open reading frames (orfs) for pel-3 and peh-1. the 1,041-bp pel-3 orf and the 1,206-bp peh-1 orf are separated by a 579-bp sequence. the genes are transcribed divergently from their  own promoters. in e. coli and e. carotovora subsp. carotovora 71, peh-1 is better expressed than pel-3. however, plant signals activate the expression of both the  genes in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora. a consensus integration host factor (ihf)-binding sequence upstream of pel-3 appears physiologically significant, since pel-3 promoter activity is higher in an e. coli ihf+ strain than in an ihf- strain. while peh-1 has extensive homology with plant and bacterial peh genes, pel-3 appears not to have significant homology with the pel genes belonging to the pelbc, pelade, or periplasmic pel families. pel-3 also is unusual in that it  is predicted to contain an atp- and gtp-binding site motif a (p-loop) not found in the other pels.

TI  == beta-lactamase topology probe analysis of the outo nmephe peptidase, and six other out protein components of the erwinia carotovora general secretion pathway  apparatus.
AB  == the out gene cluster of erwinia spp. encodes the proteins of the general secretory pathway (gsp) apparatus that is required for pectinase and cellulase secretion. we have used fusions between erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora (ecc) out genes and the topology probe blam to assess the ability of out protein  regions to export blam across the cytoplasmic membrane in escherichia coli and ecc. for the outo gene product (an nmephe peptidase), seven transmembrane regions have been identified and one more is predicted. the region of outo with the highest level of hydrophilicity is likely to exist as a large cytoplasmic loop, located between two hydrophobic domains, and is positioned towards the n-terminus of the protein. when blam was fused on the c-terminal side of the last hydrophobic stretch of outo, the resulting hybrid protein transferred the blam moiety to the periplasm whilst retaining outo activity. removal of a portion of this hydrophobic stretch resulted in the loss of outo activity, suggesting that there are tight constraints on the topological integrity of outo for maintaining  catalytic function. when outg, -h, -i, -j, -k and -n were fused to blam, the resulting phenotype suggested that the majority of each protein was targeted to the periplasm. our results indicate that these six out proteins, when produced by e. coli or ecc, each adopt, at least temporarily, a type ii bitopic conformation  in the cytoplasmic membrane. for outg, -h, -i and -j this probably represents the membrane topology prior to processing by outo in ecc. when produced in vivo from  a t7 gene 10 promoter construct, the outg product was processed in ecc whereas the outo mutant rjp249 failed to process pre-outg. blam fusions positioned on the c-terminal side of the hydrophobic stretches of pre-outg, -h, -i, and -j were processed by wild-type ecc but not rjp249 or e. coli dh1. thus the periplasmic domains of these proteins play no role in the peptidase cleavage reaction. an outg-blam fusion construct was used to demonstrate nmephe peptidase activity in other bacterial strains including e. carotovora subsp. carotovora (atcc39048), e. carotovora subsp. atroseptica (scri1043) and erwinia chrysanthemi (3937).

AB  == the structural gene for the major cellulase of erwinia carotovora subspecies carotovora (ecc) was isolated and expressed in escherichia coli. sequencing of the gene (celv) revealed a typical signal sequence and two functional domains in  the enzyme; a catalytic domain linked by a short proline/threonine-rich linker to a cellulose-binding domain (cbd). the deduced amino acid sequence of the catalytic domain showed homology with cellulases of family a, including enzymes from bacillus spp. and erwinia chrysanthemi celz, whereas the cbd showed homology with cellulases from several diverse families, supporting a "mix-and-match" hypothesis for evolution of this domain. analysis of the substrate specificity of celv showed it to be an endoglucanase with some exoglucanase activity. the ph optimum is about 7.0 and the temperature optimum about 42 degrees c. celv is secreted by ecc and by the taxonomically related erwinia carotovora subspecies atroseptica (eca) but not by e. coli. overproduction of the enzyme from multicopy plasmids in ecc appears to overload the secretory mechanism.

TI  == a small diffusible signal molecule is responsible for the global control of virulence and exoenzyme production in the plant pathogen erwinia carotovora.
AB  == virulence of the plant pathogen erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora is dependent on the production and secretion of a complex arsenal of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes. production of these exoenzymes is controlled by a global regulatory mechanism. a virulent mutants in one of the regulatory loci, expi, show a pleiotropic defect in the growth phase-dependent transcriptional activation of exoenzyme gene expression. the expi gene encodes a 26 kda polypeptide that is structurally and functionally related to the luxi gene product of vibrio fischeri. functional similarity of expi and luxi has been demonstrated by reciprocal genetic complementation experiments. luxi controls bioluminescence in  v.fischeri in a growth phase-dependent manner by directing the synthesis of the diffusible autoinducer, n-(3-oxohexanoyl) homoserine lactone. e.c. subsp. carotovora expi+ strains or escherichia coli harboring the cloned expi gene excrete a small diffusible signal molecule that complements the expi mutation of  erwinia as well as a luxi mutation of v.fischeri. this extracellular complementation can also be achieved by e.coli harboring the luxi gene from v.fischeri or by adding the synthetic v.fischeri autoinducer. both the production of the plant tissue-macerating exoenzymes and the ability of the bacteria to propagate in planta are restored in expi mutants by autoinducer addition. these data suggest that the same signal molecule is employed in control of such diverse processes as virulence in a plant pathogen and bioluminescence in a marine bacterium, and may represent a general mechanism by which bacteria modulate gene  expression in response to changing environmental conditions.

AB  == the phytopathogenic bacterium erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora w3c105 produced the hydroxamate siderophore aerobactin under iron-limiting conditions. a survey of 22 diverse strains of e. carotovora revealed that strain w3c105 alone produced aerobactin. the ferric-aerobactin receptor of strain w3c105 was an 80-kda protein, identified by immunoblots of sarkosyl-soluble proteins obtained from e. carotovora cells grown in iron-depleted medium and probed with antiserum  raised against the 74-kda ferric-aerobactin receptor encoded by the pcolv-k30 plasmid of escherichia coli. genes determining aerobactin biosynthesis and uptake were localized to an 11.3-kb ecori-hindiii chromosomal fragment of strain w3c105. a 10-kb subclone of the fragment conferred on e. coli dh5 alpha both aerobactin biosynthesis and uptake, determined by cloacin df13 sensitivity, the presence of  the 80-kda receptor protein, and iron-independent growth of e. coli clones. the aerobactin biosynthesis genes of e. carotovora w3c105 hybridized to those of the  pcolv-k30 plasmid of e. coli, but the restriction patterns of the aerobactin regions of e. coli and e. carotovora differed. although the aerobactin region of  enteric bacteria is commonly flanked by is1-like sequences, is1 sequences were not detected in the genomic dna or the cloned aerobactin region of e. carotovora. e. coli dh5 alpha cells harboring cloned aerobactin biosynthesis genes from e. carotovora w3c105 produced greater quantities of aerobactin and the 80-kda ferric-aerobactin receptor when grown in iron-limited than in iron-replete medium. strain w3c105 grew on an iron-limited medium, whereas derivatives that lacked a functional aerobactin iron acquisition system did not grow on the medium. these results provide evidence for the occurrence and heterogeneity of aerobactin as a high-affinity iron uptake system of both clinical and phytopathogenic species of the enterobacteriaceae. although future studies may reveal a role for aerobactin in the virulence or ecology of strain w3c105, a functional aerobactin iron acquisition system is not necessary for the pathogenicity of e. carotovora.

TI  == [mu-induced deletions and mutations of erwinia carotovora chromosomes, including  resident prophages e105 and 59].
AB  == the plasmid rp4::mu cts62 in stably inherited by erwinia carotovora 268 strain. under the conditions of thermoinduction bacteriophage mu is segregated and completely eliminated more intensively than in escherichia coli cells. at thermoinduction the transposition of bacteriophage mu cts62 into different chromosomal sites takes place, causing the induction of chlorate resistant and auxotrophic mutants with the frequency of 10(-4). two clones deficient in production of 2 of the 4 resident prophages of erwinia carotovora 268 strain were found among mu-induced mutants. the deleted prophages are e105 and 59. dna-dna hybridization has revealed the complete and partial deletions of bacteriophage e105 with the level of l-asparaginase production in the cells remaining intact. the damage of the prophage 59 is probably caused by point mutations or short deletions.

TI  == tnblam: a transposon for directly tagging bacterial genes encoding cell envelope  and secreted proteins.
AB  == a transposon, tnblam, designed for the direct selection of bacterial mutants with insertions in genes encoding cell envelope and secreted proteins, was constructed and subcloned into plasmid and bacteriophage lambda delivery vectors. tnblam is a spectinomycin-resistant derivative of tn5 with an unexpressed open reading frame  encoding mature beta-lactamase (blam) at its left end. therefore, when it inserts into genes in the correct orientation and reading frame, gene fusions encoding hybrid proteins are generated. by introducing tnblam into bacterial cells and selecting ampicillin-resistant (apr) colonies, the subset of isolates producing extracytoplasmic blam, and hence containing tnblam inserted in genes encoding secreted proteins and cell envelope proteins, can be directly selected. tnblam, like tnphoa, can therefore be used to preferentially mutagenise genes encoding extracytoplasmic proteins, but it has the advantage over tnphoa that the desired  mutants can be isolated by direct selection (as apr colonies) rather than by phenotypic screening. isolates in which tnblam occupies sites in the chromosome from which it can transpose at high frequency are readily identifiable, and constitute tnblam donors, with which to simply and efficiently generate rare types of insertion mutants. moreover, the apr selection that is used with tnblam  can be fine-tuned to obtain blam fusions to poorly or well-expressed genes.

TI  == construction of a recombinant bacterial human cd4 expression system producing a bioactive cd4 molecule.
AB  == the cd4 protein expressed on helper t lymphocytes is a restriction element for major histocompatibility class ii immune responses. this molecule is also used by the human immunodeficiency virus as its specific cellular receptor facilitating binding of virus to cells. as soluble forms of cd4 inhibit hiv infection in tissue culture, attention has focused on this molecule. bacterially produced cd4  would facilitate studies of the biology of the cd4 molecule. however, bacterially expressed cd4 must be refolded for assumption of its interaction with conformationally dependent anti-cd4 monoclonal antibodies as well as the hiv-1 envelope protein gp120. we report here the engineering of an external domain construct of the cd4 gene into a novel expression vector containing the nucleotide sequence encoding the pelb leader peptide of erwinia carotovara (pdabl), to facilitate correct folding of cd4 in bacteria. monoclonal antibodies  specific for important conformational epitopes of the cd4 molecule were able to bind bacterial colonies containing the pdabl/cd4 vector but not colonies with vector alone. importantly, recombinant gp120 produced in baculovirus bound specifically to bacterial colonies expressing the cd4 recombinant molecule. this  system presents a simple screening mechanism for molecules that bind to the external domain of the cd4 glycoprotein. vectors such as pdabl will also facilitate the production of large amounts of biologically active proteins in bacteria.

TI  == erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora extracellular protease: characterization and nucleotide sequence of the gene.
AB  == the prt1 gene encoding extracellular protease from erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora ec14 in cosmid pca7 was subcloned to create plasmid psk1. the partial  nucleotide sequence of the insert in psk1 (1,878 bp) revealed a 1,041-bp open reading frame (orf1) that correlated with protease activity in deletion mutants.  orf1 encodes a polypeptide of 347 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 38,826 da. escherichia coli transformed with psk1 or psk23, a subclone of psk1, produces a protease (prt1) intracellularly with a molecular mass of 38 kda and a  pi of 4.8. prt1 activity was inhibited by phenanthroline, suggesting that it is a metalloprotease. the prt1 promoter was localized between 173 and 1,173 bp upstream of orf1 by constructing transcriptional lacz fusions. primer extension identified the prt1 transcription start site 205 bp upstream of orf1. the deduced amino acid sequence of orf1 showed significant sequence identity to metalloproteases from bacillus thermoproteolyticus (thermolysin), b. subtilis (neutral protease), legionella pneumophila (metalloprotease), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (elastase). it has less sequence similarity to metalloproteases from serratia marcescens and erwinia chrysanthemi. locations for three zinc ligands and the active site for e. carotovora subsp. carotovora protease were predicted from thermolysin.

TI  == cloning and characterization of a pectate lyase gene from erwinia carotovora ec153.
AB  == a pel gene cloned from strain ec153 of erwinia carotovora encoded a pectate lyase that macerated plant tissue with moderate efficiency. this gene, called pel153, was sequenced and found to possess considerable homology with a pectate lyase gene from yersinia pseudotuberculosis. the yersinia protein, however, was truncated at the carboxyl terminal end relative to the erwinia gene product and had a lower isoelectric point. the erwinia pel153 gene was overexpressed in cells of escherichia coli, and a 56-kda protein was observed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. this compares with a molecular weight of 61 kda for  the mature, secreted protein as determined from sequencing data. southern blot analysis disclosed the presence of the pel153 gene in three different strains of  e. carotovora, but mutation of the gene in strain ec153 did not affect its ability to soft-rot potato tubers.
