TI  == a natural rice rhizospheric bacterium abates arsenic accumulation in rice (oryza  sativa l.).
AB  == main conclusion: a natural rice rhizospheric isolate abates arsenic uptake in rice by increasing fe plaque formation on rice roots. rice (oryza sativa l.) is the staple food for over half of the world's population, but its quality and yield are impacted by arsenic (as) in some regions of the world. bacterial inoculants may be able to mitigate the negative impacts of arsenic assimilation in rice, and we identified a nonpathogenic, naturally occurring rice rhizospheric bacterium that decreases as accumulation in rice shoots in laboratory experiments. we isolated several proteobacterial strains from a rice rhizosphere  that promote rice growth and enhance the oxidizing environment surrounding rice root. one pantoea sp. strain (ea106) also demonstrated increased iron (fe)-siderophore in culture. we evaluated ea106's ability to impact rice growth in the presence of arsenic, by inoculation of plants with ea106 (or control), subsequently grew the plants in as-supplemented medium, and quantified the resulting plant biomass, fe and as concentrations, localization of fe and as, and fe plaque formation in ea106-treated and control plants. these results show that  both arsenic and iron concentrations in rice can be altered by inoculation with the soil microbe ea106. the enhanced accumulation of fe in the roots and in root  plaques suggests that ea106 inoculation improves fe uptake by the root and promotes the formation of a more oxidative environment in the rhizosphere, thereby allowing more expansive plaque formation. therefore, this microbe may have the potential to increase food quality through a reduction in accumulation of toxic as species within the aerial portions of the plant.

TI  == microbiota associated with pollen, bee bread, larvae and adults of solitary bee osmia cornuta (hymenoptera: megachilidae).
AB  == using cultivation-dependant method, we isolated 184 strains from fresh and old bee bread, pollen, larvae and adults of solitary bee osmia cornuta. the 16s rdna  sequencing of 79 selected isolates gave the final species-specific identification of strains. phylogenetic analysis indicated that microbiota isolated from five different sources were represented with 29 species within three different phyla,  firmicutes with 25 species, actinobacteria with only one species and proteobacteria with three species of enterobacteriaceae. bacterial biodiversity presented with shannon-wiener index (h') was highest in the alimentary tract of adults and old bee bread (h' = 2.43 and h' = 2.53, respectively) and in the same  time no dominance of any species was scored. on the contrary, results obtained for simpson index (d) showed that in pollen samples the dominant species was pantoea agglomerans (d = 0.42) while in fresh bee bread that was staphylococcus sp. (d = 0.27). we assume that microbial diversity detected in the tested samples of solitary bee o. cornuta probably come from environment.

TI  == pediatric acute dacryocystitis.
AB  == purpose: to review and summarize the symptomatology, microbiology, special clinical entities, management, complications, and outcomes of pediatric acute dacryocystitis. methods: the author performed a pubmed search of all articles published in english on acute dacryocystitis. pediatric subpopulations of these articles were reviewed along with the scant literature of direct references to neonatal and pediatric acute dacryocystitis. data reviewed included demographics, presentations, microbiological work up, management, complications, and outcomes.  results: acute dacryocystitis is not very common in the pediatric age groups and  occurs mostly as a complication of congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction. the  age of onset is usually in the neonatal period with a female preponderance. the clinical spectrum ranges from classic pediatric acute dacryocystitis to meningitis. staphylococcus aureus is the commonest isolate. occasionally acquired etiologies and rare organisms like pantoea sp., epstein-barr virus, and sporothrix are implicated in the etiopathogenesis. the diagnosis is usually clinical aided by laboratory investigations. better antibiotics, well-established laboratory techniques and surgical modalities, and improved patient care logistics have contributed to good outcomes; however, complications are still being noted although infrequently. conclusions: pediatric acute dacryocystitis is a distinct entity with unique features of its own. it is a serious infection that warrants careful evaluation and immediate management. in the era of antibiotic resistance, microbiological work up of pediatric acute dacryocystitis is very useful for subsequent treatment. surgical challenges in the pediatric age group are distinct and the outcomes are good if standard protocols are followed.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of endophytic bacterial isolates from leaves of the medicinal plant trichilia elegans a. juss. (meliaceae).
AB  == various organisms such as fungi and bacteria can live inside plants, inhabiting the aerial parts (primarily the leaves) without causing damage. these microorganisms, called endophytes, produce an extensive variety of compounds that can be useful for medical and agronomic purposes. trichilia elegans a. juss., belonging to the meliaceae family, shows wide dispersion in south america, and phytochemical analyses from these plants and endophyte isolates have shown biological activity. accordingly, the aim of this study was to verify the diversity of bacterial endophytes from t. elegans using partial sequencing of 16s rrna, followed by phylogenetic analysis. isolation was performed by cutting the leaves, after disinfection with 5% sodium hypochlorite (naocl), in 1-2-mm2 fragments, which were equally placed on dishes containing tsa and fungicide benlate at 75 mug/ml. all dishes were incubated at 28 degrees c in the biochemical oxygen demand system for 5 days and periodically checked. afterwards, the colonization frequency (%) was determined: (number of fragments colonized by  bacteria/total number of fragments) x 100. three isolations between september 2011 and march 2012 were performed; the growth frequency ranged between 1.6 and 13.6%. following sequencing of 16s rrna and phylogenetic analysis, the genera identified were: staphylococcus, bacillus, microbacterium, pseudomonas, and pantoea. these results will provide important knowledge on the diversity of endophytic bacteria inhabiting medicinal plants, and a better understanding of the microbiome of t. elegans would reinforce the necessity of endophyte studies with a focus on their future applications in biotechnological areas of agriculture, medicine, and the environment.

TI  == epiphytic and endophytic bacteria that promote growth of ethnomedicinal plants in the subtropical forests of meghalaya, india.
AB  == the present study was aimed to investigate the endophytic and epiphytic bacteria  associated with selected ethnomedicinal plants from the pristine subtropical forests of meghalaya and analyse them for plant growth promotion and antagonistic ability. this study is an attempt to explore plant associated bacteria which are  beneficial to host plants, and thus aid in the conservation of ethnomedicinal plants of the studied subtropical forests, which are dwindling due to exploitation. the plant growth promotion parameters like indole acetic acid (iaa) production, mineral phosphate solubilisation, acid phosphatase activity, presence of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase (acc) gene, nitrogen fixation, cellulose digestion, chitin and pectin degrada- tion were screened among the isolates. the study revealed significant differences in bacterial population not  only between the epiphytic and endophytic microhabitats, but also amongst the host plants. out of the 70 isolated plant associated bacteria, bacillus sp., serratia sp., pseudomonas sp., pantoea sp., and lysinibacillus sp. showed potent  plant growth promotion properties. bacillus siamensis c53 and b. subtilis cenb showed significant antagonistic activity against the tested pathogens. this study indicated the isolates inhabiting the plants prevalent in the subtropical sacred  forests could be explored for use as plant growth promoters while practising the  cultiva- tion and conservation of ethnomedicinal plants.

TI  == screening of the novel colicinogenic gram-negative rods against pathogenic escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == purpose: escherichia coli (e. coli) o157:h7 is gram-negative enteric pathogen producing different types of shiga toxin. this bacterium is the most corporate cause of haemorrhagic colitis in human. administration of antibiotics (particularly sulfa drugs) against this pathogen is a debatable topic as this may increase the risk of uremic syndrome; especially in children and aged people. around the world, microbiologists are in search of alternative therapeutic methods specially probiotics against this pathogen. in the present study, we have focused on the investigation of alternate bio-therapeutics (probiotics) for the treatment of patients infected with e. coli o157:h7. this study is based on the identification of colicin-producing gram-negative bacteria (particularly enterobacteriaceae) which can competently exclude e. coli o157:h7 from the gut of the infected individual. materials and methods: hundred samples from human, animal faeces and septic tank water were analysed for nonpathogenic gram-negative rods (gnrs). results: out of these samples, 175 isolates of gnrs were checked for their activity against e. coli o157:h7. only 47 isolates inhibited the growth of  e. coli o157:h7, among which majority were identified as e. coli. these e. coli strains were found to be the efficient producers of colicin. some of the closely  related species i. e., citrobacter sp, pantoea sp. and kluyvera sp. also showed considerable colicinogenic activity. moreover, colicinogenic species were found to be nonhaemolytic, tolerant to acidic environment (ph 3) and sensitive to commonly used antibiotics. conclusion: nonhaemolytic, acid tolerant and sensitive to antibiotics suggests the possible use of these circulating endothelial cells (cec) as inexpensive and inoffensive therapeutic agent (probiotics) in e. coli o157:h7 infections.

TI  == arsenic biotransformation in solid waste residue: comparison of contributions from bacteria with arsenate and iron reducing pathways.
AB  == arsenic- and iron-reducing bacteria play an important role in regulating as redox transformation and mobility. the motivation of this study was to compare the contributions of different as- and fe-reducing bacteria to as biotransformation.  in this work, three bacteria strains with different functional genes were employed including pantoea sp. imh with the arsc gene, alkaliphilus oremlandii ohilas possessing the arra gene, and shewanella oneidensis mr-1, an iron reducer. the incubation results showed that pantoea sp. imh aerobically reduced 100% of as(v) released from waste residues, though total as release was not enhanced. similarly, strain ohilas anaerobically reduced dissolved as(v) but could not enhance as release. in contrast, strain mr-1 substantially enhanced as mobilization because of iron reduction, but without changing the as speciation. the formation of the secondary iron mineral pyrite in the mr-1 incubation experiments, as evidenced by the x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (xanes)  analysis, contributed little to the uptake of the freed as. our results suggest that the arsc gene carriers mainly control the as speciation in the aqueous phase in aerobic environments, whereas in anaerobic conditions, the as speciation should be regulated by arra gene carriers, and as mobility is greatly enhanced by iron reduction.

TI  == aerobic microbial community of insectary population of phlebotomus papatasi.
AB  == background: microbes particularly bacteria presenting in the gut of haematophagous insects may have an important role in the epidemiology of human infectious disease. methods: the microbial flora of gut and surrounding environmental of a laboratory strain of phlebotomus papatasi, the main vector of  zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (zcl) in the old world, was investigated. biochemical reactions and 16s rdna sequencing of the isolated bacteria against 24 sugars and amino acids were used for bacteria species identification. common mycological media used for fungi identification as well. results: most isolates belonged to the enterobacteriaceae, a large, heterogeneous group of gram-negative rods whose natural habitat is the intestinal tract of humans and animals. enterobacteriaceae groups included edwardsiella, enterobacter, escherichia, klebsiella, kluyvera, leminorella, pantoea, proteus, providencia, rahnella, serratia, shigella, tatumella, and yersinia and non enterobacteriaceae groups included bacillus, staphylococcus and pseudomonas. the most prevalent isolates were proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris. these saprophytic and swarming motile bacteria were isolated from all immature, pupae, and mature fed or unfed male or  female sand flies as well as from larval and adult food sources. five fungi species were also isolated from sand flies, their food sources and colonization materials where candida sp. was common in all mentioned sources. conclusion: midgut microbiota are increasingly seen as an important factor for modulating vector competence in insect vectors so their possible effects of the mirobiota on the biology of p. papatasi and their roles in the sandfly-leishmania interaction  are discussed.

TI  == microbial diversity observed during hemp retting.
AB  == historically used in textile and paper industry, hemp fibres have started to find new applications in composite materials with important economic and ecological advantages. however, their applications are limited since manufacturers have some difficulties to standardise fabrication processes. this study is a first step before selection and isolation of strains that could later be used to optimise microbial retting efficiency and hence fibre quality. we studied six samples harvested on different ground types, at different dates and with different retting durations on field to obtain an exhaustive representation of the process. after dna extraction, total bacteria and fungi associated with stems during retting were specifically quantified using real-time pcr. then, using sequence analysis of randomly cloned 16s and 18s ribosomal rna (rrna) genes, a phylogenetic characterisation of the dominant microorganisms was carried out. quantitatively, we showed that there were 8.1-9.5 log10 16s rrna gene copies per  gram of hemp straw for bacteria and 8.6-9.6 log10 18s rrna gene copies per gram for fungi. qualitatively, we noticed a higher bacterial diversity in comparison to fungi. this work showed that in the different samples, the same species were present but in significantly different proportions according to ground type, harvest dates and retting durations on field. the most frequent bacterial sequences were affiliated to species escherichia coli, pantoea agglomerans, pseudomonas rhizosphaerae, rhodobacter sp., pseudomonas fulva, rhizobium huautlense and massilia timonae, whereas fungal sequences were principally related to the genera cladosporium and cryptococcus.

TI  == microbial evaluation of sandboxes located in urban area.
AB  == this paper presents the results of a study on the degree of bacteriological pollution of sandboxes situated in fenced and unfenced housing estates located in an urban area in olsztyn, poland. heterotrophic plate counts (hpc22, hpc37), enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and  clostridium perfringens determined by cultivation and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) methods were used as indicators of the sanitary state. their maximum number in the sand samples reached values of up to 5.4x10(7), 2.6x10(6),  3.3x10(4), 2.1x10(3), 1.8x10(4), 1.9x10(1) and 1.2x10(4)cfu/g, respectively. it was found that values of culture-independent method were two-four orders greater  than those obtained by the cultivation method. among identified enterobacteriaceae, pantoea spp. and enterobacter cloacae were the most numerous, whereas escherichia cells were detected only occasionally. pathogenic bacteria of the genus salmonella sp. were isolated from sandboxes also when e. coli were absent. bacteria from staphylococcus genus were isolated irrespective of the site and time of sampling. additionally, the presence of molds and yeasts was studied. maximum counts of these microorganisms amounted to 1.0x10(5) and to 3.5x10(4)cfu/g. aspergillus, penicillium, alternaria and trichoderma genera were  most numerous among molds, whereas trichosporon was detected most frequently among yeasts. sandboxes in the fenced housing estate and those located in the area which is not close to trees were less polluted than the sand collected from  sandboxes in the unfenced housing estate. potentially pathogenic bacteria of the  genus salmonella spp. were identified in analyzed sandboxes, also when toxocara and e. coli were absent. it seems that assessing the contamination of children's  play areas basing only on fecal bacteria counts and by monitoring number of parasites' eggs may be insufficient to evaluate microbial pollution of sandboxes  and may not fully reflect their safety for children.

TI  == nutrients can enhance the abundance and expression of alkane hydroxylase cyp153 gene in the rhizosphere of ryegrass planted in hydrocarbon-polluted soil.
AB  == plant-bacteria partnership is a promising strategy for the remediation of soil and water polluted with hydrocarbons. however, the limitation of major nutrients  (n, p and k) in soil affects the survival and metabolic activity of plant associated bacteria. the objective of this study was to explore the effects of nutrients on survival and metabolic activity of an alkane degrading rhizo-bacterium. annual ryegrass (lolium multiflorum) was grown in diesel-contaminated soil and inoculated with an alkane degrading bacterium, pantoea sp. strain btrh79, in greenhouse experiments. two levels of nutrients were applied and plant growth, hydrocarbon removal, and gene abundance and expression were determined after 100 days of sowing of ryegrass. results obtained from these experiments showed that the bacterial inoculation improved plant growth and hydrocarbon degradation and these were further enhanced by nutrients application. maximum plant biomass production and hydrocarbon mineralization was  observed by the combined use of inoculum and higher level of nutrients. the presence of nutrients in soil enhanced the colonization and metabolic activity of the inoculated bacterium in the rhizosphere. the abundance and expression of cyp153 gene in the rhizosphere of ryegrass was found to be directly associated with the level of applied nutrients. enhanced hydrocarbon degradation was associated with the population of the inoculum bacterium, the abundance and expression of cyp153 gene in the rhizosphere of ryegrass. it is thus concluded that the combination between vegetation, inoculation with pollutant-degrading bacteria and nutrients amendment was an efficient approach to reduce hydrocarbon  contamination.

TI  == pantoea sp. isolated from tropical fresh water exhibiting n-acyl homoserine lactone production.
AB  == n-acyl homoserine lactone (ahl) serves as signaling molecule for quorum sensing (qs) in gram-negative bacteria to regulate various physiological activities including pathogenicity. with the aim of isolating freshwater-borne bacteria that can cause outbreak of disease in plants and portrayed qs properties, environmental water sampling was conducted. here we report the preliminary screening of ahl production using chromobacterium violaceum cv026 and escherichia coli [psb401] as ahl biosensors. the 16s rdna gene sequence of isolate m009 showed the highest sequence similarity to pantoea stewartii s9-116, which is a plant pathogen. the isolated pantoea sp. was confirmed to produce n-3-oxohexanoyl-l-hsl (3-oxo-c6-hsl) through analysis of high resolution mass tandem mass spectrometry.

TI  == the astaxanthin dideoxyglycoside biosynthesis pathway in sphingomonas sp. pb304.
AB  == a major carotenoid in sphingomonas sp. pb304, originally isolated from a river in daejon city, south korea, was identified as astaxanthin dideoxyglycoside. gene clusters encoding the astaxanthin dideoxyglycoside biosynthetic enzymes were identified by screening sphingomonas sp. pb304 fosmid libraries using degenerate  probes that harbor highly conserved sequences from the sphigomonas elodea-derived crti and nostoc sp. pcc 7120-dervied crtw genes. selected positive gene clusters  were fully sequenced and annotated, revealing genes encoding six putative carotenogenic enzymes: phytoene synthase (crtb), phytoene desaturase (crti), lycopene cyclase (crty), carotene hydroxylase (crtz), carotene ketolase (crtw), and glycosyltransferase (crtx). all of the carotenogenic enzymes, except for crtx, were functional in the recombinant host escherichia coli expressing synthetic carotenogenic modules from pantoea agglomerans. crtx did not take up udp-glucose or gdp-fucose as sugar substrates during the in vitro reaction. although no direct experimental evidence was obtained for the function of sphingomonas sp. pb304 crtx, it can be categorized as a putative deoxyglycosyltransferase based on the presence of astaxanthin dideoxyglycoside in sphingomonas sp. pb304, a putative corresponding gene in the carotenoid biosynthetic gene cluster, and high amino acid sequence homology to the existing  glycosyltransferases. therefore, we propose that astaxanthin dideoxyglycoside can be synthesized in sphingomonas sp. pb304 via sequential reactions of six pathway  enzymes, including crtx on the phytoene intermediate.

TI  == characterization of the wzc gene from pantoea sp. strain ppe7 and its influence on extracellular polysaccharide production and virulence on pleurotus eryngii.
AB  == to characterize of the pathogenicity gene from the soft rot pathogen pantoea sp.  ppe7 in pleurotus eryngii, we constructed over 10,000 kanamycin-resistant transposon mutants of pantoea sp. strain ppe7 by transposon mutagenesis. one mutant, pantoea sp. nppe9535, did not cause a soft rot disease on pleurotus eryngii was confirmed by the pathogenicity test. the transposon was inserted into the wzc gene and the disruption of the wzc gene resulted in the reduction of polysaccharide production and abolished the virulence of pantoea sp. strain ppe7  in p. eryngii. analysis of the hydropathic profile of this protein indicated that it is composed of two main domains: an n-terminal domain including two transmembrane alpha-helices and a c-terminal cytoplasmic domain consisting of a tyrosine-rich region. comparative analysis indicated that the amino acid sequence of wzc is similar to that of a number of proteins involved in the synthesis or export of polysaccharides in other bacterial species. purified gst-wzc was found  to affect the phosphorylation of tyrosine residue in vivo. these results showed that the wzc gene might play an important role in the virulence of pantoea sp. strain ppe7 in p. eryngii.

TI  == isolation and enzyme bioprospection of endophytic bacteria associated with plants of brazilian mangrove ecosystem.
AB  == the mangrove ecosystem is a coastal tropical biome located in the transition zone between land and sea that is characterized by periodic flooding, which confers unique and specific environmental conditions on this biome. in these ecosystems,  the vegetation is dominated by a particular group of plant species that provide a unique environment harboring diverse groups of microorganisms, including the endophytic microorganisms that are the focus of this study. because of their intimate association with plants, endophytic microorganisms could be explored for biotechnologically significant products, such as enzymes, proteins, antibiotics and others. here, we isolated endophytic microorganisms from two mangrove species, rhizophora mangle and avicennia nitida, that are found in streams in two mangrove systems in bertioga and cananeia, brazil. bacillus was the most frequently isolated genus, comprising 42% of the species isolated from cananeia and 28% of the species from bertioga. however, other common endophytic genera such as pantoea, curtobacterium and enterobacter were also found. after identifying the isolates, the bacterial communities were evaluated for enzyme production. protease activity was observed in 75% of the isolates, while endoglucanase activity occurred in 62% of the isolates. bacillus showed the highest activity rates for amylase and esterase and endoglucanase. to our knowledge, this is the first reported diversity analysis performed on endophytic  bacteria obtained from the branches of mangrove trees and the first overview of the specific enzymes produced by different bacterial genera. this work contributes to our knowledge of the microorganisms and enzymes present in mangrove ecosystems.

TI  == effects of ensiling fermentation and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community in italian ryegrass, guinea grass, and whole-crop maize silages stored  at high moisture content.
AB  == the effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in italian ryegrass (ir), guinea grass (gg), and whole-crop maize (wm) silages. direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content  of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the ir, gg, and wm silages, respectively. the acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type  of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of  gg ensiling. pantoea agglomerans, rahnella aquatilis, and enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the ir silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. staphylococcus sciuri and bacillus pumilus were detected when ir silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community  at silo opening. lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the gg silage. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. enterobacter cloacae appeared when the gg silage was spoiled. in the wm silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. throughout the ensiling, weissella paramesenteroides, weissella confusa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to l. plantarum, l. brevis, and l. lactis. upon deterioration, acetobacter pasteurianus, klebsiella variicola, enterobacter hormaechei, and bacillus gibsonii were detected. these results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling  and aerobic spoilage of ir, gg, and wm silages.

TI  == combined use of alkane-degrading and plant growth-promoting bacteria enhanced phytoremediation of diesel contaminated soil.
AB  == inoculation of plants with pollutant-degrading and plant growth-promoting microorganisms is a simple strategy to enhance phytoremediation activity. the objective of this study was to determine the effect of inoculation of different bacterial strains, possessing alkane-degradation and 1-amino-cyclopropane-1 -carboxylic acid (acc) deaminase activity, on plant growth and phytoremediation activity. carpet grass (axonopus affinis) was planted in soil spiked with diesel  (1% w/w) for 90 days and inoculated with different bacterial strains, pseudomonas sp. itrh25, pantoea sp. btrh79 and burkholderia sp. psjn, individually and in combination. generally, bacterial application increased total numbers of culturable hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in the rhizosphere ofcarpet grass, plant biomass production, hydrocarbon degradation and reduced genotoxicity. bacterial strains possessing different beneficial traits affect plant growth and  phytoremediation activity in different ways. maximum bacterial population, plant  biomass production and hydrocarbon degradation were achieved when carpet grass was inoculated with a consortium of three strains. enhanced plant biomass production and hydrocarbon degradation were associated with increased numbers of  culturable hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in the rhizosphere of carpet grass. the present study revealed that the combined use of different bacterial strains, exhibiting different beneficial traits, is a highly effective strategy to improve plant growth and phytoremediation activity.

TI  == phosphate solubilization potential and modeling of stress tolerance of rhizobacteria from rice paddy soil in northern iran.
AB  == the purposes of this study were to evaluate the phosphate solubilization activity of bacteria isolated from the rhizosphere of rice paddy soil in northern iran, and to study the effect of temperature, nacl and ph on the growth of these isolates by modeling. three of the most effective strains from a total of 300 isolates were identified and a phylogenetic analysis was carried out by 16s rdna  sequencing. the isolates were identified as pantoea ananatis (m36), rahnella aquatilis (m100) and enterobacter sp. (m183). these isolates showed multiple plant growth-promoting attributes such as phosphate solubilization activity and indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) production. the m36, m100 and m183 isolates were able  to solubilize 172, 263 and 254 microg ml(-1) of ca3(po4)2 after 5 days of growth  at 28 degrees c and ph 7.5, and to produce 8.0, 2.0 and 3.0 mug ml(-1) of iaa when supplemented with l-tryptophan (1 mg ml(-1)) for 72 h, at 28 degrees c and ph 7.0, respectively. the solubilization of insoluble phosphate was associated with a drop in the ph of the culture medium and there was an inverse relationship between ph and solubilized p (r = -0.98, p < 0.0952). there were no significant differences among isolates in terms of acidity tolerance based on their confidence limits as assessed by segmented model analysis and all isolates were able to grow at ph 4.3-11 (with optimum at 7.0-7.5). based on a sigmoidal trend of a three-parameter logistic model, the salt concentration required for 50 % inhibition was 8.15, 6.30 and 8.23 % nacl for m36, m100 and m183 isolates, respectively. moreover, the minimum and maximum growth temperatures estimated by  the segmented model were 5.0 and 42.75 degrees c for m36, 12.76 and 40.32 degrees c for m100, and 10.63 and 43.66 degrees c for m183. the three selected isolates could be deployed as inoculants to promote plant growth in an agricultural environment.

TI  == synergistic activity of biocides and antibiotics on resistant bacteria from organically produced foods.
AB  == synergism between biocides and antibiotics was investigated in 20 biocide and antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains that were previously isolated from organically produced foods, according to their antimicrobial resistance profiles. most of the antibiotic/biocide combinations yielded synergistic interactions, reducing the inhibitory concentrations of biocides and antibiotics by 4- to 16-fold. among enterococci, synergism with biocides was detected for amoxicillin  (am), cefuroxime (cx), erythromycin (em), ciprofloxacin (cp), and trimethoprim/sulphametoxazol (t/s). among staphylococci, interactions were synergistic (am) and either synergistic or indifferent (cx and em, depending on biocide). among the three methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus clinical strains included in the study, the combinations of methicillin and triclosan or hexachlorophene acted synergistically in all strains, but interactions were either synergistic or indifferent for the other biocides, depending on the strain. all combinations tested were synergistic for lactobacillus (am, cx, em, and cp) and micrococcus (am, em). in salmonella, interactions were indifferent (am, cx, em, and cp) or synergistic (t/s). synergism with biocides was also detected in klebsiella isolates (am, cx, and t/s), enterobacter sp. (am, cx, em,  and t/s), pantoea (am, cx, em, cp, and t/s), and chryseobacterium sp. (em). these results suggest that combinations of biocides and antibiotics may open new possibilities to combat antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == identification of polybacterial communities in patients with postoperative, posttraumatic, and endogenous endophthalmitis through 16s rrna gene libraries.
AB  == endophthalmitis is a potential vision-threatening complication following surgical procedures (postoperative endophthalmitis [poe]), trauma (posttraumatic endophthalmitis [pte]), and bacteremic seeding of the eye from a distant infection site (endogenous endophthalmitis [ee]). several studies have revealed the polybacterial characteristics of endophthalmitis, which make the administration of antibiotics to treat the disease challenging. however, until now, the polybacterial communities of poe, pte, and ee have not been precisely studied. hence, the present study was designed to identify the bacterial community of endophthalmitis through 16s rrna gene libraries. of the 40 intraocular samples tested, 30 libraries were constructed with bacterial nested-pcr-positive samples. the obtained recombinant clones were screened through amplified rrna gene restriction analysis (ardra) to identify unique clones. the multiple types of ardra patterns (p=0.345) and diverse bacterial sequences (p=0.277) within the libraries revealed the polybacterial nature of infection in poe, pte, and ee. moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on polybacterial infection in ee. gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus spp. (n=19), streptococcus spp. (n=18), staphylococcus spp. (n=6), exiguobacterium spp. (n=3), gemella spp. (n=2), enterococcus spp. (n=2), a lysinibacillus sp. (n=1), a clostridium sp. (n=1), and a nocardia sp. (n=1), and  gram-negative bacteria, including serratia spp. (n=18), pseudomonas spp. (n=10),  enterobacter spp. (n=8), acinetobacter spp. (n=3), pantoea spp. (n=3), a haemophilus sp. (n=1), and a massilia sp. (n=1), were identified. interestingly,  among them, 10 bacterial species were not previously reported to be associated with endophthalmitis or other ocular infections. besides, the presence of 4 unidentifiable clones suggests the possibility of novel organisms that might cause eye infections. therefore, it is recommended that, in addition to the polybacterial nature of poe, pte, and ee infections, the spectrum of the pathogenic bacterial community identified in this work should be considered while administering antibiotic therapy in suspected endophthalmitis cases.

TI  == control of diatraea saccharalis by the endophytic pantoea agglomerans 33.1 expressing cry1ac7.
AB  == despite the fact that bacillus thuringiensis (bt) is found in more than 90 % of the products used against insects, it has some difficulty reaching the internal regions where the larvae feed. to solve this problem, many genetically modified microorganisms that colonize the same pests have been developed. thus, the endophytic bacterium pantoea agglomerans (33.1), which has been recently described as a promising sugarcane growth promoter, was genetically modified with the pjtt vector (which carries the gene cry1ac7) to control the sugarcane borer,  diatraea saccharalis. firstly, the bioassays for d. saccharalis control by 33.1:pjtt were conducted with an artificial diet. a new in vivo methodology was also developed, which confirmed the partial control of larvae by 33.1:pjtt. the 33.1:pjtt strain was inoculated into sugarcane stalks containing the d. saccharalis larvae. in the sugarcane stalks, 33.1:pjtt was able to increase the mortality of d. saccharalis larvae, impair larval development and decrease larval weight. sugarcane seedlings were inoculated with 33.1:pjtt, and re-isolation confirmed the capacity of 33.1:pjtt to continuously colonize the sugarcane. these results prove that p. agglomerans (33.1), a sugarcane growth promoter, can be improved by expressing the cry protein, and the resulting strain is able to control the sugarcane borer.

TI  == simultaneous profiling of seed-associated bacteria and fungi reveals antagonistic interactions between microorganisms within a shared epiphytic microbiome on triticum and brassica seeds.
AB  == in order to address the hypothesis that seeds from ecologically and geographically diverse plants harbor characteristic epiphytic microbiota, we characterized the bacterial and fungal microbiota associated with triticum and brassica seed surfaces. the total microbial complement was determined by amplification and sequencing of a fragment of chaperonin 60 (cpn60). specific microorganisms were quantified by qpcr. bacteria and fungi corresponding to operational taxonomic units (otu) that were identified in the sequencing study were isolated and their interactions examined. a total of 5477 otu were observed  from seed washes. neither total epiphytic bacterial load nor community richness/evenness was significantly different between the seed types; 578 otu were shared among all samples at a variety of abundances. hierarchical clustering revealed that 203 were significantly different in abundance on triticum seeds compared with brassica. microorganisms isolated from seeds showed 99-100% identity between the cpn60 sequences of the isolates and the otu sequences from this shared microbiome. bacterial strains identified as pantoea agglomerans had antagonistic properties toward one of the fungal isolates (alternaria sp.), providing a possible explanation for their reciprocal abundances on both triticum and brassica seeds. cpn60 enabled the simultaneous profiling of bacterial and fungal microbiota and revealed a core seed-associated microbiota shared between diverse plant genera.

TI  == functional characterization of the sucrose isomerase responsible for trehalulose  production in plant-associated pectobacterium species.
AB  == fifty-three plant-associated microorganisms were investigated for their ability to convert sucrose to its isomers. these microorganisms included one dickeya zeae isolate and 7 enterobacter, 3 pantoea, and 43 pectobacterium species. eleven out  of the 53 strains (21%) showed the ability to transform sucrose to isomaltulose and trehalulose. among those, pectobacterium carotovorum kkh 3-1 showed the highest bioconversion yield (97.4%) from sucrose to its isomers. in this strain,  the addition of up to 14% sucrose in the medium enhanced sucrose isomerase (siase) production. the siase activity at 14% sucrose (47.6 u/mg dcw) was about 3.6-fold higher than that of the negative control (13.3 u/mg dcw at 0% sucrose).  the gene encoding siase, which is comprised a 1776 bp open reading frame (orf) encoding 591 amino acids, was cloned from p. carotovorum kkh 3-1 and expressed in escherichia coli. the recombinant siase (pcsi) was shown to have optimum activity at ph 6.0 and 40 degrees c. the reaction temperature significantly affected the ratio of sucrose isomers produced by pcsi. the amount of trehalulose increased from 47.5% to 79.1% as temperature was lowered from 50 degrees c to 30 degrees c, implying that siase activity can be controlled by reaction temperature.

AB  == twenty four bacterial strains from four different regions of mud volcano and lime cave were isolated to estimate their diversity, plant growth promoting and biocontrol activities to use them as inoculant strains in the fields. an excellent antagonistic effect against four plant pathogens and plant growth promoting properties such as iaa production, hcn production, phosphate solubilization, siderophore production, starch hydrolysis and hydrolytic enzymes  syntheses were identified in om5 (pantoea agglomerans) and em9 (exiguobacterium sp.) of 24 studied isolates. seeds (chili and tomato) inoculation with plant growth promoting strains resulted in increased percentage of seedling emergence,  root length and plant weight. results indicated that co-inoculation gave a more pronounced effects on seedling emergence, secondary root numbers, primary root length and stem length, while inoculation by alone isolate showed a lower effect. our results suggest that the mixed inocula of om5 and em9 strains as biofertilizers could significantly increase the production of food crops in andaman archipelago by means of sustainable and organic agricultural system.

TI  == physical impaction injury effects on bacterial cells during spread plating influenced by cell characteristics of the organisms.
AB  == aims: to understand the factors that contribute to the variations in colony-forming units (cfu) in different bacteria during spread plating. methods and results: employing a mix culture of vegetative cells of ten organisms varying in cell characteristics (gram reaction, cell shape and cell size), spread plating to the extent of just drying the agar surface (50-60 s) was tested in comparison  with the alternate spotting-and-tilt-spreading (sats) approach where 100 mul inoculum was distributed by mere tilting of plate after spotting as 20-25 microdrops. the former imparted a significant reduction in cfu by 20% over the spreader-independent sats approach. extending the testing to single organisms, gram-negative proteobacteria with relatively larger cells (escherichia, enterobacter, agrobacterium, ralstonia, pantoea, pseudomonas and sphingomonas spp.) showed significant cfu reduction with spread plating except for slow-growing methylobacterium sp., while those with small rods (xenophilus sp.) and cocci (acinetobacter sp.) were less affected. among gram-positive nonspore formers, staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant cfu reduction while staphylococcus haemolyticus and actinobacteria (microbacterium, cellulosimicrobium and brachybacterium spp.) with small rods/cocci were unaffected. vegetative cells of bacillus pumilus and b. subtilis were generally unaffected while others with larger rods (b. thuringiensis, brevibacillus, lysinibacillus and paenibacillus spp.) were significantly affected. a simulated plating study coupled with live-dead bacterial staining endorsed the chances of cell disruption with spreader impaction in afflicted organisms. conclusions: significant reduction in cfu could occur during spread plating due to physical impaction injury to bacterial cells depending on the spreader usage and the variable effects on different organisms are determined by gram reaction, cell size and cell shape. the inoculum spreader could impart physical disruption of vegetative cells against a hard surface. significance and impact of study: possibility of cfu reduction in sensitive organisms and the skewed selection of hardier organisms during spread plating, and the recommendation of sats as an easier and safer alternative for cfu enumerations.

TI  == production and glucosylation of c50 and c 40 carotenoids by metabolically engineered corynebacterium glutamicum.
AB  == the yellow-pigmented soil bacterium corynebacterium glutamicum atcc13032 is accumulating the cyclic c50 carotenoid decaprenoxanthin and its glucosides. carotenoid pathway engineering was previously shown to allow for efficient lycopene production. here, engineering of c. glutamicum for production of endogenous decaprenoxanthin as well as of the heterologous c50 carotenoids c.p.450 and sarcinaxanthin is described. plasmid-borne overexpression of genes for lycopene cyclization and hydroxylation from c. glutamicum, dietzia sp., and micrococcus luteus, in a lycopene-producing platform strain constructed here, resulted in accumulation of these three c50 carotenoids to concentrations of about 3-4 mg/g cdw. chromosomal deletion of a putative carotenoid glycosyltransferase gene cg0730/crtx in these strains entailed production of non-glucosylated derivatives of decaprenoxanthin, c.p.450, and sarcinaxanthin, respectively. upon introduction of glucosyltransferase genes from m. luteus, c. glutamicum, and pantoea ananatis, these hydroxylated c50 carotenoids were glucosylated. we here also demonstrate production of the c40 carotenoids beta-carotene and zeaxanthin in recombinant c. glutamicum strains and co-expression of the p. ananatis crtx gene was used to obtain glucosylated zeaxanthin. together, our results show that c. glutamicum is a potentially valuable host for production of a wide range of glucosylated c40 and c50 carotenoids.

TI  == diversity of sporadic symbionts and nonsymbiotic endophytic bacteria isolated from nodules of woody, shrub, and food legumes in ethiopia.
AB  == fifty-five bacterial isolates were obtained from surface-sterilized nodules of woody and shrub legumes growing in ethiopia: crotalaria spp., indigofera spp., and erythrina brucei, and the food legumes soybean and common bean. based on partial 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, the majority of the isolates were identified as gram-negative bacteria belonging to the genera achromobacter, agrobacterium, burkholderia, cronobacter, enterobacter, mesorhizobium, novosphingobium, pantoea, pseudomonas, rahnella, rhizobium, serratia, and variovorax. seven isolates were gram-positive bacteria belonging to the genera bacillus, paenibacillus, planomicrobium, and rhodococcus. amplified fragment length polymorphism (aflp) fingerprinting showed that each strain was genetically distinct. according to phylogenetic analysis of reca, glnii, rpob, and 16s rrna gene sequences, rhizobium, mesorhizobium, and agrobacterium were further classified into six different genospecies: agrobacterium spp., agrobacterium radiobacter, rhizobium sp., rhizobium phaseoli, mesorhizobium sp., and putative new rhizobium species. the strains from r. phaseoli, rhizobium sp. iar30, and mesorhizobium sp. err6 induced nodules on their host plants. the other strains did not form nodules on their original host. nine endophytic bacterial strains representing seven genera, agrobacterium, burkholderia, paenibacillus, pantoea, pseudomonas, rhizobium, and serratia, were found to colonize nodules of crotalaria incana and common bean on co-inoculation with symbiotic rhizobia. four endophytic rhizobium and two agrobacterium strains had identical nifh gene sequences with symbiotic rhizobium strains, suggesting horizontal gene transfer.  most symbiotic and nonsymbiotic endophytic bacteria showed plant growth-promoting properties in vitro, which indicate their potential role in the promotion of plant growth when colonizing plant roots and the rhizosphere.

AB  == four isolates of gram-negative facultatively anaerobic bacteria, three of them producing ndm-1 carbapenemase, were isolated from hospitalized patients and outpatients attending two military hospitals in rawalpindi, pakistan, and studied for their taxonomic position. initially the strains were phenotypically identified as citrobacter species. comparative analysis of 16s rrna gene sequences then showed that the four strains shared >97%, but in no case >98.3%, 16s rrna gene sequence similarities to members of the genera citrobacter, kluyvera, pantoea, enterobacter and raoultella, but always formed a separate cluster in respective phylogenetic trees. based on multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa) including partial recn, rpoa, thdf and rpob gene sequence and respective amino acid sequence analysis it turned out that the strains also here always formed separate clusters. based on further comparative analyses including dna-dna hybridizations, genomic fingerprint analysis using rep- and rapd-pcrs and physiological tests, it is proposed to classify these four strains into the novel genus pseudocitrobacter gen. nov. with a new species pseudocitrobacter faecalis sp. nov. with strain 25 cit(t) (=ccm 8479(t)=lmg 27751(t)) and pseudocitrobacter  anthropi sp. nov. with strain c138(t) (=ccm 8478(t)=lmg 27750(t)), as the type strains, respectively.

AB  == this study focused on an endophytic bacterial strain, pantoea sp. sd-1, which can be used to degrade lignin and rice straw. this strain was isolated from rice seeds by an optimized surface sterilization method. pantoea sp. sd-1 showed exceptional ability to degrade rice straw and lignin. in rice straw or kraft lignin-containing medium supplemented with 1% glucose and 0.5% peptone, pantoea sp. sd-1 effectively reduced the rice straw mass weight by 54.5% after 6 days of  treatment. the strain was also capable of reducing the lignin colour (52.4%) and  content (69.1%) after 4 days of incubation. the findings suggested that the rice  endophytic bacterium pantoea sp. sd-1 could be applied for the degradation of lignocellulose biomass, such as rice straw. significance and impact of the study: rice straw, an abundant agricultural by-product in china, is very difficult to degrade because of its high lignin content. due to the immense environmental adaptability and biochemical versatility of bacteria, endophytic bacteria are useful resources for biodegradation. in this study, we screened for endophytic bacteria capable of biodegrading rice straw and lignin and obtained one strain, pantoea sp. sd-1, with suitable characteristics. sd-1 could be used for degradation of rice straw and lignin, and may play an important role in biodegradation of this agricultural by-product.

TI  == cefotaxime prevents microbial contamination and improves microspore embryogenesis in wheat and triticale.
AB  == key message: cefotaxime (100 mg/l) mitigate occasional gram negative bacterial contamination in wheat and triticale microspore culture and most importantly it increases cell growth and green plant production. isolated microspore culture is  a promising option to rapidly fix the product of meiotic recombination of f1 hybrids, in the process of varietal development. clean culture and high embryogenesis rate are essential to commercial triticale and wheat microspore cultures. so, this study investigated (1) contaminants from isolated microspores  cultures, (2) two antibiotics to control bacterial growth, and (3) the contribution of antibiotics to increased microspore-derived embryo-like structures (els), green and albino plants. five species of bacteria were identified in contaminated cultures (erwinia aphidicola, pantoea agglomerans, pseudomonas sp., staphylococcus epidermis and staphylococcus warneri) using fatty acid analysis and 16s ribosomal rna sequences analysis, and yeast. antibacterial  susceptibility test using cefotaxime and vancomycin resulted in strong inhibition of 24 bacterial isolates, using cefotaxime at 100 mg/l, but not pseudomonas sp. other antibiotic treatments inhibited bacterial growth at least partially. microspore induction medium supplemented with the same antibiotics treatments resulted in successful microspore embryogenesis and green plant production. antibiotic treatments were first tested in triticale and then validated in wheat  cultivars ac carberry and ac andrew. induction medium supplemented with cefotaxime at 50 and 100 mg/l substantially increased the formation of els and green plants in triticale and wheat, respectively. incidentally, it also affected the occurrence of albinism in all genotypes. our results demonstrated dual purpose of cefotaxime for isolated microspore culture, most importantly it increases cell growth and success of microspore cultures in triticale and wheat genotypes, but would also prevent accidental loss of cultures with most common bacterial contaminants.

AB  == plant-bacteria partnership is a promising approach for remediating soil contaminated with organic pollutants. the colonization and metabolic activity of  an inoculated microorganism depend not only on environmental conditions but also  on the physiological condition of the applied microorganisms. this study assessed the influence of different inoculum pretreatments on survival, gene abundance and catabolic gene expression of an applied strain (pantoea sp. strain btrh79) in the rhizosphere of ryegrass vegetated in diesel contaminated soil. maximum bacterium  survival, gene abundance and expression were observed in the soil inoculated with bacterial cells that had been pregrown on complex medium, and hydrocarbon degradation and genotoxicity reduction were also high in this soil. these findings propose that use of complex media for growing plant inocula may enhance  bacterial survival and colonization and subsequently the efficiency of pollutant  degradation.

TI  == physiologic and metabolic characterization of a new marine isolate (bm39) of pantoea sp. producing high levels of exopolysaccharide.
AB  == background: marine environments are the widest fonts of biodiversity representing a resource of both unexploited or unknown microorganisms and new substances having potential applications. among microbial products, exopolysaccharides (eps) have many physiological functions and practical applications. since eps production by many bacteria is too scarce for practical use and only few species  are known for their high levels of production, the search of new high eps producers is of paramount importance. many marine bacteria, that produce eps to cope with strong environmental stress, could be potentially exploited at the industrial level. results: a novel bacterium, strain bm39, previously isolated from sediments collected in the tyrrhenian sea, was selected for its production of very high levels of eps. bm39 was affiliated to pantoea sp. (enterobacteriaceae) by 16s rrna gene sequencing and biochemical tests. according to the phylogenetic tree, this strain, being quite far from the closest known pantoea species (96% identity with p. agglomerans and p. ananatis) could belong to a new species. eps production was fast (maximum of ca. 21 g/l in 24 h on glucose medium) and mainly obtained during the exponential growth. preliminary characterization, carried out by thin layer and gel filtration chromatography, showed that the eps, being a glucose homopolymer with mw of ca. 830 kda, appeared to be different from those of other bacteria of same genus. the bacterium showed  a typical slightly halophilic behavior growing optimally at nacl 40 per thousand  (growing range 0-100 per thousand). flow cytometry studies indicated that good cell survival was maintained for 24 h at 120 per thousand. survival decreased dramatically with the increase of salinity being only 1 h at 280 per thousand. the biochemical characterization, carried out with the biolog system, showed that mb39 had a rather limited metabolic capacity. its ability, rather lower than that of p. agglomerans, was almost only confined to the metabolization of simple sugars and their derivatives. few alcohols, organic acids and nitrogen compounds  were partially used too. conclusions: strain bm39, probably belonging to a new species, due to its remarkable eps production, comparable to those of known industrial bacterial producers, could be suggested as a new microorganism for industrial applications.

TI  == diversity of the bacterial and fungal microflora from the midgut and cuticle of phlebotomine sand flies collected in north-western iran.
AB  == background: phlebotomine sand flies are the vectors of the leishmaniases, parasitic diseases caused by leishmania spp. little is known about the prevalence and diversity of sand fly microflora colonizing the midgut or the cuticle. particularly, there is little information on the fungal diversity. this information is important for development of vector control strategies. methodology/principal findings: five sand fly species: phlebotomus papatasi, p. sergenti, p. kandelakii, p. perfiliewi and p. halepensis were caught in bileh savar and kaleybar in north-western iran that are located in endemic foci of visceral leishmaniasis. a total of 35 specimens were processed. bacterial and fungal strains were identified by routine microbiological methods. we characterized 39 fungal isolates from the cuticle and/or the midgut. they belong  to six different genera including penicillium (17 isolates), aspergillus (14), acremonium (5), fusarium (1), geotrichum (1) and candida (1). we identified 33 gram-negative bacteria: serratia marcescens (9 isolates), enterobacter cloacae (6), pseudomonas fluorescens (6), klebsiella ozaenae (4), acinetobacter sp. (3),  escherichia coli (3), asaia sp. (1) and pantoea sp. (1) as well as gram-positive  bacteria bacillus subtilis (5) and micrococcus luteus (5) in 10 isolates. conclusion/significance: our study provides new data on the microbiotic diversity of field-collected sand flies and for the first time, evidence of the presence of asaia sp. in sand flies. we have also found a link between physiological stages (unfed, fresh fed, semi gravid and gravid) of sand flies and number of bacteria that they carry. interestingly pantoea sp. and klebsiella ozaenae have been isolated in old world sand fly species. the presence of latter species on sand fly cuticle and in the female midgut suggests a role for this arthropod in dissemination of these pathogenic bacteria in endemic areas. further experiments  are required to clearly delineate the vectorial role (passive or active) of sand  flies.

AB  == pine wilt disease (pwd), a destructive disease for pine trees, is caused by the pine wood nematode (pwn), bursaphelenchus xylophilus and additional bacteria. in  this study, extracts of zostera marina showed a high nematicidal activity against pwn and some of the bacteria that it carries. light yellow crystals were obtained from extracts of z. marina through solvent extraction, followed by chromatography on ab-8 resin and crystallization. the nmr and hplc analysis showed that the isolated compound was rosmarinic acid (rosa). rosa showed effective nematicidal activity, of which the lc(5)(0) (50% lethal concentration) to pwn at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h was 1.18 mg/g, 1.05 mg/g and 0.95 mg/g, respectively. to get a high yield rate of rosa from z. marina, single factor experiments and an l(9) (3(4)) orthogonal experiment were performed. this extraction process involved 70% ethanol for 3 h at 40 degrees c. the extraction dosage was 1:50 (w/v). the highest yield of rosa from zostera was 3.13 mg/g dw (dried weight). the crude extracts of zostera marina (10 mg/ml) and rosa (1 mg/ml) also showed inhibitory effects to some bacterial strains carried by pwn: klebsiella sp., stenotrophomonas maltophilia, streptomyces sp. and pantoea agglomerans. the results of these studies provide clues for preparing pesticide to control pwd from z. marina.

TI  == isolation and characterization of indigenous endophytic bacteria associated with  leaves of switchgrass (panicum virgatum l.) cultivars.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterize indigenous bacterial endophytes from cultivars  of switchgrass and study their antimicrobial and growth promoting potential. methods and results: the diversity, molecular and biochemical characterizations of indigenous and culturable bacterial endophytes residing in leaves of switchgrass have not been studied previously. this study describes the characterization of 31 bacterial endophytes from three switchgrass cutlivars: cave-in rock, blue jacket and tecumseh. molecular and phylogenetic analysis based on the 16s rrna sequence grouped the endophytes into eight different taxa that shared high homology of 98-99% with other known sequences. bacterial endophytes were identified as microbacterium testaceum, curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, bacillus subtilis and bacillus pumilus, pseudomonas fluorescens, sphingomonas parapaucimobilis, serratia sp. and pantoea ananatis. some endophytes were detected in switchgrass seeds and in plants that originated from seeds collected  a year earlier, confirming vertical transmission to the next generation of the host. selected endophytes produced cellulases and were capable of solubilizing inorganic phosphorus. analysis of cell-free culture filtrate of selected strains  using direct infusion orbitrap mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of several well-characterized lipopeptide toxins and phytohormones. re-inoculation of the roots of switchgrass seedlings with endophytes singly or combined confirmed their migration to the upper aerial parts of the plant. conclusions: our findings suggest that switchgrass leaves harbour a diversity of bacterial endophytes, some of which could potentially be applied as growth promoting bacteria. significance and impact of the study: this is the first report on the characterization of indigenous bacterial endophytes and their potential use as biofertilizers.

TI  == pathways for degrading tnt by thu-z: a pantoea sp. strain.
AB  == 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt), an extensively used and versatile explosive, is harmful in soil and water. in the present study, four bacterial strains capable of degrading tnt have been isolated from contaminated sites and named as thu-a, thu-b, thu-c, and thu-z. thu-z, which gave the highest degradation efficiency compared to the others, was assigned to the genus pantoea according to its 16s rrna gene. similarities in both biochemical properties and morphology suggested that thu-z was a pantoea sp. strain. thu-z was proved to be capable of using tnt  as a sole nitrogen source by cleaving no(2) from the nitroaromatic ring by direct aromatic ring reduction. under nitrogen-limited conditions, 96.6 % n of tnt was consumed by thu-z for growth, which was determined in terms of nano(2). trace nitro reduction metabolites such as 2,4-diamino-6-nitrotoluene (24dam) and 2,6-diamino-4-nitrotoluene (26dam) were identified in the presence of (nh(4))(2)so(4). on the other hand, 4,4',6,6'-tetranitro-2,2'-azoxytoluene (22azo) and 2,2',6,6'-tetranitro-4,4'-azoxytoluene (44azo) were detected in the absence of (nh(4))(2)so(4). these indicated the existence of a dual pathway for thu-z, while the direct aromatic ring reduction was predominant. addition of a nitrogen source ((nh(4))(2)so(4)) after inoculation stimulated the growth of thu-z and accelerated tnt degradation.

TI  == sugarcane growth promotion by the endophytic bacterium pantoea agglomerans 33.1.
AB  == the promotion of sugarcane growth by the endophytic pantoea agglomerans strain 33.1 was studied under gnotobiotic and greenhouse conditions. the green fluorescent protein (gfp)-tagged strain p. agglomerans 33.1::pnkgfp was monitored in vitro in sugarcane plants by microscopy, reisolation, and quantitative pcr (qpcr). using qpcr and reisolation 4 and 15 days after inoculation, we observed that gfp-tagged strains reached similar density levels both in the rhizosphere and inside the roots and aerial plant tissues. microscopic analysis was performed at 5, 10, and 18 days after inoculation. under greenhouse conditions, p. agglomerans 33.1-inoculated sugarcane plants presented more dry mass 30 days after inoculation. cross-colonization was confirmed by reisolation of the gfp-tagged strain. these data demonstrate that 33.1::pnkgfp is a superior colonizer of sugarcane due to its ability to colonize a number of different plant parts. the growth promotion observed in colonized plants may be related to the ability of p. agglomerans 33.1 to synthesize indoleacetic acid and solubilize phosphate. additionally, this strain may trigger chitinase and cellulase production by plant roots, suggesting the induction of a plant defense system. however, levels of indigenous bacterial colonization did not vary between inoculated and noninoculated sugarcane plants under greenhouse conditions, suggesting that the presence of p. agglomerans 33.1 has no effect on these communities. in this study, different techniques were used to monitor 33.1::pnkgfp during sugarcane cross-colonization, and our results suggested that  this plant growth promoter could be used with other crops. the interaction between sugarcane and p. agglomerans 33.1 has important benefits that promote the plant's growth and fitness.

TI  == the inoculation method affects colonization and performance of bacterial inoculant strains in the phytoremediation of soil contaminated with diesel oil.
AB  == plants in combination with microorganisms can remediate soils, which are contaminated with organic pollutants such as petroleum hydrocarbons. inoculation  of plants with degrading bacteria is one approach to improve remediation processes, but is often not successful due to the competition with resident microorganisms. it is therefore of high importance to address the persistence and colonization behavior of inoculant strains. the objective of this study was to determine whether the inoculation method (seed imbibement and soil inoculation) influences bacterial colonization, plant growth promotion and hydrocarbon degradation. italian ryegrass was grown in non-sterilized soil polluted with diesel and inoculated with different alkane-degrading strains pantoea sp. itsi10, pantoea sp. btrh79 and pseudomonas sp. mixri75 individually as well as in combination. inoculation generally had a beneficial effect on plant biomass production and hydrocarbon degradation, however, strains inoculated in soil performed better than applied by seed imbibement. performance correlated with the colonization efficiency of the inoculated strains. the highest hydrocarbon degradation was observed in the treatment, in which all three strains were inoculated in combination into soil. our study revealed that besides the degradation potential and competitive ability of inoculant strains the inoculation method plays an important role in determining the success of microbial inoculation.

TI  == characterization and screening of plant probiotic traits of bacteria isolated from rice seeds cultivated in argentina.
AB  == many seeds carry endophytes, which ensure good chances of seedling colonization.  in this work, we have studied the seed-borne bacterial flora of rice varieties cultivated in the northeast of argentina. surface-sterilized husked seeds of the  rice cultivars ct6919, el paso 144, camba, and irga 417 contained an average of 5x10(6) cfu/g of mesophilic and copiotrophic bacteria. microbiological, physiological, and molecular characterization of a set of 39 fast-growing isolates from the ct6919 seeds revealed an important diversity of seed-borne mesophiles and potential plant probiotic activities, including diazotrophy and antagonism of fungal pathogens. in fact, the seed-borne bacterial flora protected the rice seedlings against curvularia sp. infection. the root colonization pattern of 2 pantoea isolates from the seeds was studied by fluorescence microscopy of the inoculated axenic rice seedlings. both isolates strongly colonized the site of emergence of the lateral roots and lenticels, which may represent the entry sites for endophytic spreading. these findings suggest that rice plants allow grain colonization by bacterial species that may act as natural biofertilizers and bioprotectives early from seed germination.

AB  == aims: acetic acid is considered an important preservative in tropical grass ensiling. the objective of the current experiments was to follow the ensiling fermentation of low dry matter (dm) tropical grass as a model to study changes in bacterial communities during acetic acid fermentation. methods and results: direct-cut and wilted guinea grass silage was prepared with and without molasses. a high acetic acid level was observed during the fermentation of direct-cut silage, and long storage increased the butyric acid and ethanol content if molasses was not added. the lactic acid production in wilted silage was greater than the acetic acid production, but prolonged ensiling decreased the lactic to acetic acid ratio regardless of molasses addition. adding molasses enhanced the lactic acid content in both direct-cut and wilted silage. the bacterial community, identified by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, was affected by wilting and molasses addition. bands for pantoea sp. and morganella sp. became faint when acetic acid fermentation was suppressed, and those for pediococcus pentosaceus and lactococcus garvieae were detected when lactic acid fermentation  was enhanced by wilting and molasses addition. lactobacillus plantarum and lactococcus lactis were found throughout the ensiling process in all silage types. conclusion: distinct changes occurred in the bacterial community in guinea grass silage because of wilting and molasses addition. these changes could explain how lactic acid fermentation was enhanced but could not help determine which bacteria were associated with enhanced acetic acid fermentation. significance and impact of the study: the study reveals the effects of wilting and molasses during ensiling of low dm tropical grasses and the associated bacteria.

TI  == comparative genomics of the type vi secretion systems of pantoea and erwinia species reveals the presence of putative effector islands that may be translocated by the vgrg and hcp proteins.
AB  == background: the type vi secretion apparatus is assembled by a conserved set of proteins encoded within a distinct locus. the putative effector proteins hcp and  vgrg are also encoded within these loci. we have identified numerous distinct type vi secretion system (t6ss) loci in the genomes of several ecologically diverse pantoea and erwinia species and detected the presence of putative effector islands associated with the hcp and vgrg genes. results: between two and four t6ss loci occur among the pantoea and erwinia species. while two of the loci (t6ss-1 and t6ss-2) are well conserved among the various strains, the third (t6ss-3) locus is not universally distributed. additional orthologous loci are present in pantoea sp. ab-valens and erwinia billingiae eb661. comparative analysis of the t6ss-1 and t6ss-3 loci showed non-conserved islands associated with the vgrg and hcp, and vgrg genes, respectively. these regions had a g+c content far lower than the conserved portions of the loci. many of the proteins encoded within the hcp and vgrg islands carry conserved domains, which suggests they may serve as effector proteins for the t6ss. a number of the proteins also show homology to the c-terminal extensions of evolved vgrg proteins. conclusions: extensive diversity was observed in the number and content of the t6ss loci among the pantoea and erwinia species. genomic islands could be observed within some of t6ss loci, which are associated with the hcp and vgrg proteins and carry putative effector domain proteins. we propose new hypotheses concerning a role for these islands in the acquisition of t6ss effectors and the development of novel evolved vgrg and hcp proteins.

AB  == the aim of the study was to evaluate bacterial antibiotic resistance in seawater  from four beaches in algiers. the most significant resistance rates were observed for amoxicillin and ticarcillin, whereas they were relatively low for ceftazidime, cefotaxime and imipenem. according to sampling sites, the highest resistance rates were recorded for 2 sites subjected to chemical and microbiological inputs (amoxicillin, 43% and 52%; ticarcillin, 19.6% and 47.7%),  and for 2 sites relatively preserved from anthropogenic influence, resistance rates were lowest (amoxicillin, 1.5% and 16%; ticarcillin, 0.8% and 2.6%). thirty-four bacteria resistant to imipenem (n=14) or cefotaxime (n=20) were identified as pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=15), pseudomonas fluorescens (7), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4), burkholderia cepacia (2), bordetella sp. (1), pantoea sp. (1), acinetobacter baumannii (1), chryseomonas luteola (1), ochrobactrum anthropi (1) and escherichia coli (1). screening for extended spectrum beta-lactamase showed the presence of ctx-m-15 beta-lactamase in the e.  coli isolate, and the encoding gene was transferable in association with the inci1 plasmid of about 50 kbp. insertion sequence isecp1b was located upstream of the ctx-m-15 gene. this work showed a significant level of resistance to antibiotics, mainly among environmental saprophytic bacteria. transmissible ctx-m-15 was detected in e. coli; this may mean that contamination of the environment by resistant bacteria may cause the spread of resistance genes.

AB  == this study used a multiphasic approach, characterized by the simultaneous use of  culture-dependent and culture-independent methods, to investigate endophytic bacterial communities in strawberry (fragaria ananassa) fruit. a total of 92 bacterial endophytes were isolated and initially grouped by their repetitive extragenic palindromic (rep)-pcr banding pattern and biochemical features. phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequences of 45 representatives showed that the isolates belonged to the species bacillus subtilis (eight isolates), bacillus sp. (seven isolates), enterobacter sp. (seven isolates), enterobacter ludwigii (six isolates), lactobacillus plantarum (six isolates), pseudomonas sp.  (five isolates), pantoea punctata (three isolates), and curtobacterium citreum (three isolates). nucleic acids were extracted from the strawberry fruit and subjected to 16s rrna gene directed polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (16s rrna pcr-dgge). the species b. subtilis, enterobacter sp., and pseudomonas sp. were detected both by isolation and dgge. the dgge fingerprints of total bacterial dna did not exhibit bands corresponding to several of the representative species isolated in the extinction dilution (l. plantarum, c. citreum, and p. punctata). in contrast, bands in the dgge profile that were identified as relatives of arthrobacter sp. and one uncultivable erythrobacter sp. were not recovered by cultivation techniques. after isolation,  the nitrogen fixation ability and the in vitro production of indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) equivalents and siderophores were evaluated. a high percentage of isolates  were found to possess the ability to produce siderophores and iaa equivalents; however, only a few isolates belonging to the genera pseudomonas and enterobacter showed the ability to fix nitrogen. plant growth promotion was evaluated under greenhouse conditions and revealed the ability of the bacillus strains to enhance the number of leaves, shoot length, root dry weight, and shoot dry weight. the activity of the bacterial isolate identified as b. subtilis na-108 exerted the greatest influence on strawberry growth and showed a 42.8% increase in number of  leaves, 15.26% for high shoot, 43.5% increase in root dry weight, and a 77% increase in shoot dry weight when compared with untreated controls.

AB  == microorganisms play important roles in the tobacco aging process. however, microbial communities on flue-cured tobacco leaves (fctl) remain largely unknown. in this study, the total microbial genomic dna of unaged and aging fctl from zimbabwe were isolated using a culture-independent method, and the bacterial communities were investigated through analyzing two 16s rrna gene libraries. eighty-four and 65 operational taxonomic units were obtained from the libraries of the unaged and aging fctl, respectively. the following genera were represented more than 4% in both libraries (aging and unaged library): sphingomonas (4.84%, 4.18%), stenotrophomonas (4.84%, 5.23%), erwinia (5.81%, 4.88%), pantoea (19.35%, 18.47%), and pseudomonas (21.29%, 24.04%). the dominant species varied between the two libraries. specifically, several dominant species in unaged fctl including pseudomonas fulva, pseudomonas sp. (am909658), klebsiella sp. (hm584796), and pantoea sp. (ay501386) were not identified in aging fctl, while several dominant species in aging fctl such as pantoea sp. (gu566350), pseudomonas sp. (ef157292), and buttiauxella izardii were not found in unaged fctl. the phylogenetic analysis showed that bacteria from unaged and aging fctl were divided into two clades, and two unique subclades were identified in aging fctl. our results revealed for the first time the bacterial diversities on zimbabwe tobacco, and provided a basis for clarifying the roles of bacteria in aging process of fctl.

AB  == to compare the spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation process carried out in different cocoa-producing regions, heap and box (one ivorian farm) and box (two brazilian farms) fermentations were carried out. all fermentations were studied through a multiphasic approach. in general, the temperature inside the fermenting mass increased throughout all fermentations and reached end-values of 42-48 degrees c. the main end-products of pulp carbohydrate catabolism were ethanol, lactic acid, acetic acid, and/or mannitol. in the case of the fermentations on the selected ivorian farm, the species diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and acetic acid bacteria (aab) was restricted. lactobacillus fermentum and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides were the predominant lab species, due to their ethanol and acid tolerance and citrate consumption. the levels of mannitol, ascribed to growth of l. fermentum, were fermentation-dependent. also, enterobacterial species, such as erwinia soli and pantoea sp., were among the predominating microbiota during the early stages of both heap and box fermentations in ivory coast, which could be responsible for gluconic acid production. consumption of gluconic acid at the initial phases of the ivorian fermentations could be due to yeast growth. a wider microbial species diversity throughout the fermentation process was seen in the case of the box fermentations on the selected brazilian farms, which differed, amongst other factors, regarding pod/bean selection on these farms as compared to fermentations on the selected ivorian farm. this microbiota included lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus durianis, l. fermentum, lactobacillus mali, lactobacillus nagelii, l. pseudomesenteroides, and pediococcus acidilactici, as well as bacillus subtilis that was present at late fermentation, when the temperature inside the fermenting mass reached values higher than 50 degrees c. moreover, aab seemed to dominate the brazilian box fermentations studied, explaining higher acetic acid concentrations in the pulp and the beans. to conclude, it turned out that the species diversity and community dynamics, influenced by local operational practices, in particular pod/bean selection, impact the quality of fermented cocoa beans.

TI  == a novel low-temperature-active beta-glucosidase from symbiotic serratia sp. tn49  reveals four essential positions for substrate accommodation.
AB  == a 2,373-bp full-length gene (bgla49) encoding a 790-residue polypeptide (bgla49)  with a calculated mass of 87.8 kda was cloned from serratia sp. tn49, a symbiotic bacterium isolated from the gut of longhorned beetle (batocera horsfieldi) larvae. the deduced amino acid sequence of bgla49 showed the highest identities of 80.1% with a conceptually translated protein from pantoea sp. at-9b (eew02556), 38.3% with the identified glycoside hydrolase (gh) family 3 beta-glucosidase from clostridium stercorarium ncbi 11754 (cab08072), and <15.0%  with the low-temperature-active gh 3 beta-glucosidases from shewanella sp. g5 (abl09836) and paenibacillus sp. c7 (aax35883). the recombinant enzyme (r-bgla49) was expressed in escherichia coli and displayed the typical characteristics of low-temperature-active enzymes, such as low temperature optimum (showing apparent optimal activity at 35 degrees c), activity at low temperatures (retaining approximately 60% of its maximum activity at 20 degrees c and approximately 25% at 10 degrees c). compared with the thermophilic gh 3 beta-glucosidase, r-bgla49  had fewer hydrogen bonds and salt bridges and less proline residues. these features might relate to the increased structure flexibility and higher catalytic activity at low temperatures of r-bgla49. the molecular docking study of four gh  3 beta-glucosidases revealed five conserved positions contributing to substrate accommodation, among which four positions of r-bgla49 (r192, y228, d260, and e449) were identified to be essential based on site-directed mutagenesis analysis.

TI  == spatiotemporal development of the bacterial community in a tubular longitudinal microbial fuel cell.
AB  == the spatiotemporal development of a bacterial community in an exoelectrogenic biofilm was investigated in sucrose-fed longitudinal tubular microbial fuel cell  reactors, consisting of two serially connected modules. the proportional changes  in the microbial community composition were assessed by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and dna sequencing in order to relate them to the performance and stability of the bioelectrochemical system. the reproducibility of duplicated reactors, evaluated by cluster analysis and jaccard's coefficient, shows 80-90% similarity in species composition. biofilm development through fed-batch start-up and subsequent stable continuous operation results in a population shift from gamma-proteobacteria- and bacteroidetes- to firmicutes-dominated communities, with other diverse species present at much lower relative proportions. dgge patterns were analysed by range-weighted richness (rr) and pareto-lorenz evenness distribution curves to investigate the evolution of the bacterial community. the first modules shifted from dominance by species closely related to bacteroides graminisolvens, raoultella ornithinolytica and klebsiella sp. bm21 at the start of continuous-mode operation to a community dominated by paludibacter propionicigenes-, lactococcus sp.-, pantoea agglomerans- and klebsiella oxytoca-related species with stable power generation (6.0 w/m(3)) at day 97. operational strategies that consider the dynamics of the population will provide  useful parameters for evaluating system performance in the practical application  of microbial fuel cells.

TI  == bacterial species associated with sound and botrytis-infected grapes from a greek vineyard.
AB  == grape bacterial microbiota plays central roles in the quality of grapes and wine, yet its diversity remains poorly described. in the present study, bacterial species associated with sound and botrytis-infected grapes of two cultivars originating from the same vineyard were assessed. isolates were identified by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) and sequence analysis of partial 16s rrna gene. comparable counts were recorded between botrytis-infected  and sound grape samples. in all cases, the majority of isolates belonged to different species of enterobacteriaceae. the dominant species in the vineyard was klebsiella oxytoca that was found in different combinations with citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., erwinia sp., pantoea dispersa, tatumella ptyseos or  other species. in fermenting musts, those populations declined while other species evolved, like lactobacillus plantarum and enterobacter ludwigii. populations in botrytised samples persisted longer during spontaneous fermentations. present study suggests that bacterial diversity on grapes may be wider than previously described.

TI  == characterization of acc deaminase-producing endophytic bacteria isolated from copper-tolerant plants and their potential in promoting the growth and copper accumulation of brassica napus.
AB  == one hundred cu-resistant-endophytic bacteria were isolated from cu-tolerant plants grown on cu mine wasteland, of which, eight cu-resistant and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (acc) deaminase-producing endophytic bacteria were obtained based on the acc deaminase activity of the bacteria and characterized with respect to metal resistance, production of acc deaminase, indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) as well as siderophores and mineral phosphate solubilization. ralstonia sp. j1-22-2, pantoea agglomerans jp3-3, and pseudomonas thivervalensis y1-3-9 with higher acc deaminase activity (ranging from 213 to 370 mum alpha-ketobutyrate mg(-1)h(-1)) were evaluated for promoting plant growth and cu uptake of rape grown in quartz sand containing 0, 2.5, and 5 mg kg(-1) of cu in pot experiments. the eight bacteria were found to exhibit different multiple heavy metal resistance characteristics, to show different levels of acc deaminase activity and to produce indole acetic acid. seven bacteria produced siderophores  and solubilized inorganic phosphate. pot experiments showed that inoculation with the strains (j1-22-2, jp3-3, and y1-3-9) was found to increase the biomass of rape. increases in above-ground tissue cu contents of rape cultivated in 2.5 and  5 mg kg(-1) of cu-contaminated substrates varied from 9% to 31% and from 3 to 4-fold respectively in inoculated-rape plants compared to the uninoculated control. the maximum cu uptake of rape was observed after inoculation with p. agglomerans jp3-3. the results show that metal-resistant and plant growth promoting endophytic bacteria play an important role in plant growth and cu uptake which may provide a new endophytic bacterial-assisted phytoremediation of  cu-contaminated environment.

TI  == [isolation, identification and characterization of acc deaminase-containing endophytic bacteria from halophyte suaeda salsa].
AB  == objective: we isolated and characterized 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (acc)  deaminase-containing endophytic bacteria from halophyte suaeda salsa to understand the interactions between endophytes and halophyte. methods: acc deaminase-containing endophytic bacteria were isolated from root, stalk and leaf  of suaeda salsa and were identified based on morphological, physiological-biochemical properties, api and 16s rrna sequence analysis. isolates were evaluated for their acc deaminase, antifungal, protease activity, siderophores and phytohormones, such as indole-3-acetic acid, gibberellic acid and abscisic acid production, as well as atmospheric nitrogen fixation and phosphate solubilization. results: four acc deaminase-containing endophytic bacteria strains named as lp11, ss12, tw1 and tw2 were isolated and identified as pseudomonas oryzihabitans, pseudomonas sp., pantoea agglomerans and pseudomonas putida respectively. all the strains possessed the phosphate-solubilizing ability and could produce siderophores and phytohormones more or less. none of them could fix atmospheric nitrogen or produce protease. only strain ss12 showed antagonism  against two phytopathogenic fungi viz fusarium oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans and  f. oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum. conclusion: acc deaminase-containing endophytic  bacteria of pseudomonas sp. and pantoea sp. isolated from halophyte suaeda salsa  have abundant biological characteristics related to plant growth promotion, stress homeostasis regulation and biocontrol activity.

TI  == soil type affects plant colonization, activity and catabolic gene expression of inoculated bacterial strains during phytoremediation of diesel.
AB  == the combined use of plants and associated microorganisms has great potential for  cleaning up soils contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons. apart from environmental conditions the physicochemical properties of the soil are the main  factors influencing the survival and activity of an inoculated strain as well as  the growth of plants. this study examined the effect of different soil types (sandy, loamy sand and loam) on the survival, gene abundance and catabolic gene expression of two inoculated strains (pseudomonas sp. strain itri53 and pantoea sp. strain btrh79) in the rhizosphere and shoot interior of italian ryegrass vegetated in diesel contaminated soils. high colonization, gene abundance and expression in loamy soils were observed. by contrast, low colonization, gene abundance and absence of gene expression in sandy soil were found. the highest levels of genes expression and hydrocarbon degradation were seen in loamy soil that had been inoculated with btrh79 and were significantly higher compared to those in other soils. a positive correlation was observed between gene expression and hydrocarbon degradation indicating that catabolic gene expression is necessary for contaminant degradation. these results suggest that soil type influences the bacterial colonization and microbial activities and subsequently the efficiency of contaminant degradation.

AB  == three endophytic bacterial isolates were obtained in italy from olive knots caused by pseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi. phenotypic tests in combination  with 16s rrna gene sequence analysis indicated a phylogenetic position for these  isolates in the genera erwinia or pantoea, and revealed two other strains with highly similar 16s rrna gene sequences (>99 %), cect 5262 and cect 5264, obtained in spain from olive knots. rep-pcr dna fingerprinting of the five strains from olive knots with box, eric and rep primers revealed three groups of profiles that were highly similar to each other. multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa) based on concatenated partial atpd, gyrb, infb and rpob gene sequences indicated that the  strains constituted a single novel species in the genus erwinia. the strains showed general phenotypic characteristics typical of the genus erwinia and whole  genome dna-dna hybridization data confirmed that they represented a single novel  species of the genus erwinia. the strains showed dna g+c contents ranging from 54.7 to 54.9 mol%. they could be discriminated from phylogenetically related species of the genus erwinia by their ability to utilize potassium gluconate, l-rhamnose and d-arabitol, but not glycerol, inositol or d-sorbitol. the name erwinia oleae sp. nov. (type strain dapp-pg 531(t)= lmg 25322(t) = dsm 23398(t))  is proposed for this novel taxon.

TI  == the bacterial community in 'taberna' a traditional beverage of southern mexico.
AB  == aims: to characterize the bacterial community of taberna, an alcoholic traditional beverage from the southern part of mexico produced by the fermentation of the coyol palm sap (acrocomia aculeate). methods and results: bacterial 16s rdna libraries were constructed from metagenomic dna extracted during the fermentation process at 0, 60 and 108 h. a total of 154 clones were sequenced, and 13, 10 and nine unique sequences were found at each sampling time. at the onset of the fermentation, zymomonas mobilis, fructobacillus spp., pantoea agglomerans and other gammaproteobacteria were detected. after 60 h, lactic acid  bacteria were found and 30% of clones in the library were related to lactobacillus nagelii, l. sucicola and l. sp. by the end of the experiment, i.e.  after 108 h, the bacterial community included z. mobilis, lact. nagelii and acetobacter pasteurianus. conclusions: our results suggest that z. mobilis population represented an important proportion of the bacterial community (60-80%), as well as the lactobacilli during the fermentation process. the bacterial diversity was low and decreased as the fermentation progressed. significance and impact of the study: this culture-independent study suggests that z. mobilis and lactobacilli play an important role in the alcoholic fermentation of the taberna beverage.

TI  == isolation of phosphate solubilizing bacteria and their potential for lead immobilization in soil.
AB  == lead (pb), a highly toxic heavy metal forms stable compounds with phosphate (p).  the potential of phosphate solubilizing bacteria (psb) to immobilize pb by enhancing solubilization of insoluble p compounds was tested in this research. eighteen different psb strains isolated from p amended and pb contaminated soils  were screened for their efficiency in p solubilization. the psb isolated from p amended soils solubilized 217-479 mg/l of p while the psb from pb contaminated soil solubilized 31-293 mg/l of p. stepwise multiple regression analysis and p solubility kinetics indicated that the major mechanism of p solubilization by psb is the ph reduction through the release of organic acids. from the isolated bacteria, two psb were chosen for pb immobilization and these bacteria were identified as pantoea sp. and enterobacter sp., respectively. the psb significantly increased p solubilization by 25.0% and 49.9% in the case of pantoea sp., and 63.3% and 88.6% in the case of enterobacter sp. for 200 and 800  mg/kg of rock phosphate (rp) addition, respectively, thereby enhancing the immobilization of pb by 8.25-13.7% in the case of pantoea sp. and 14.7-26.4% in the case of enterobacter sp. the ability of psb to solubilize p, promote plant growth, and immobilize pb can be used for phytostabilization of pb contaminated soils.

TI  == production of folate by bacteria isolated from oat bran.
AB  == twenty bacteria isolated from three commercial oat bran products were tested for  their folate production capability. the bacteria as well as some reference organisms were grown until early stationary phase on a rich medium (ypd), and the amount of total folate in the separated cell mass and the culture medium (supernatant) was determined by microbiological assay. folate vitamer distribution was determined for eight bacteria including one isolated from rye flakes. for seven bacteria the effect of temperature and ph on folate production  was studied in more detail. relatively large amount of folate was both produced in the cell biomass (up to 20.8microg/g) and released to the culture medium (up to 0.38microg/g) by studied bacteria. the best producers were characterized as bacillus subtilis on4, chryseobacterium sp. nr7, janthinobacterium sp. rb4, pantoea agglomerans on2, and pseudomonas sp on8. the level of folate released in  culture medium was the highest for b. subtilis on5, chryseobacterium sp. nr7, curtobacterium sp. on7, enterococcus durans on9, janthinobacterium sp. rb4, paenibacillus sp. on10, propionibacterium sp. rb9, and staphylococcus kloosii rb7. marked differences in the distribution of folate vitamers among the bacterial strains were revealed by the hplc analysis. the main vitamers were tetrahydrofolate, 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate. increase in the folate content during bacterial growth  was accompanied by proportional increase in the 5-methyltetrahydrofolate content  and decrease of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate. 10-formylfolic acid dominated in the culture media of four bacteria, and janthinobacterium sp. rb4 was also found to excrete 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. intracellular folate content was higher when the bacteria were grown at 28 degrees c than at 18 degrees c or 37 degrees c and  also higher at ph 7 than at ph 5.5.

TI  == gene expression profile of the plant pathogen fusarium graminearum under the antagonistic effect of pantoea agglomerans.
AB  == the pathogenic fungus fusarium graminearum is an ongoing threat to agriculture, causing losses in grain yield and quality in diverse crops. substantial progress  has been made in the identification of genes involved in the suppression of phytopathogens by antagonistic microorganisms; however, limited information regarding responses of plant pathogens to these biocontrol agents is available. gene expression analysis was used to identify differentially expressed transcripts of the fungal plant pathogen f. graminearum under antagonistic effect of the bacterium pantoea agglomerans. a macroarray was constructed, using 1014 transcripts from an f. graminearum cdna library. probes consisted of the cdna of  f. graminearum grown in the presence and in the absence of p. agglomerans. twenty-nine genes were either up (19) or down (10) regulated during interaction with the antagonist bacterium. genes encoding proteins associated with fungal defense and/or virulence or with nutritional and oxidative stress responses were  induced. the repressed genes coded for a zinc finger protein associated with cell division, proteins containing cellular signaling domains, respiratory chain proteins, and chaperone-type proteins. these data give molecular and biochemical  evidence of response of f. graminearum to an antagonist and could help develop effective biocontrol procedures for pathogenic plant fungi.

(48.7% and 50% for 24 and 48h abf, respectively). light microscopy showed that bacteria were located preferentially in the posterior midgut, around the blood meal and associated with peritrophic matrix. scanning electron microscopy images  showed a high number of bacteria in midgut during blood digestion and the peak of bacterial enumeration was reached 48h abf, stage in which lumen was almost totally occupied by bacteria that were also interacting with epithelial microvilli. our results show the dynamics of microbial colonization and their distribution in midgut during blood digestion.

(type strain a18/07(t) =lmg 25382(t) =dsm 22758(t)) and pantoea calida sp. nov. (type strain 1400/07(t) =lmg  25383(t) =dsm 22759(t)) are proposed.

AB  == objective: to explore population dynamics of endophytic bacteria and obtain antagonistic endophytic bacteria toward verticillium dahliae kleb (vd), fusarium  oxysporium f. sp. vasinfectum (fov) from cotton. methods: root, stem and leaf samples were surface-disinfested, and subsequently used to isolate endophytic bacteria by diluting plate counting method. we assayed antagonism of the isolated endophytic bacteria toward three pathogens: vd (v107, which is a highly virulent  defoliating isolate and v396, which is a mildly virulent non-defoliating isolate), fov (f108) using a dual culture method, and analyzed the 16s rdna sequence of doubly antagonistic endophytic bacteria (daeb) isolates toward both vd and fov. results: the population size of endophytic bacteria in root was significantly larger than that in leaf and stem. the populations at seedling stage were generally lower than those at the flowering/maturing stage in root, the populations in stem and leaf were fluctuant at different development stages,  but variation law was not observed obviously. furthermore, although no significant differences of the population densities in root were found among 6 cotton cultivars, the population densities in stem and leaf showed cultivar differences. the proportion of endophytic bacteria antagonizing vd (v107, v396) and fov (f108) in root was higher than that in stem/leaf, moreover, the amount of endophytic bacteria antagonizing toward v107 was less than that toward v396/f108. based on 16s rdna sequence analysis, all 44 daeb isolates consisted of two phyla, i.e., bacteroidetes (1 out of 44) and proteobacteria (43 out of 44), and fell into 8 genera. the genus enterobacter (18 out of 44) and pantoea (15 out of 44) were predominant. notably, ten daeb isolates demonstrated <97% sequence similarity with the most similar sequences of strain deposited in the ribosomal database, these daeb isolates might be potential novel species. conclusion: this  article suggested that plant genotype, development stage, and tissue influenced the population of endophytic bacteria. we discovered that daeb with predominant and various genus existed in cotton. endophytic bacteria in cotton could serve as a pool for discovering biocontrol agent toward cotton pathogens.

TI  == emended description of the genus pantoea, description of four species from human  clinical samples, pantoea septica sp. nov., pantoea eucrina sp. nov., pantoea brenneri sp. nov. and pantoea conspicua sp. nov., and transfer of pectobacterium  cypripedii (hori 1911) brenner et al. 1973 emend. hauben et al. 1998 to the genus as pantoea cypripedii comb. nov.
AB  == bacterial strains belonging to dna hybridization groups (hg) ii, iv and v, in the erwinia herbicola-enterobacter agglomerans complex, of brenner et al. [int j syst bacteriol 34 (1984), 45-55] were suggested previously to belong to the genus pantoea, but have never been formally described and classified. additionally, it  has been shown in several studies that pectobacterium cypripedii is more closely  related to species of pantoea than to those of pectobacterium. in this study, the phylogenetic positions of brenner's dna hg ii, iv and v and pectobacterium cypripedii were re-examined by both 16s rrna gene sequencing and multilocus sequence analyses (mlsa) based on the gyrb, rpob, atpd and infb genes. the analyses revealed that dna hg ii, iv and v and pectobacterium cypripedii form five separate branches within the genus pantoea (strains from hg v were split into two branches). dna-dna hybridization data further confirmed that dna hg ii,  iv and v constitute four separate species. pectobacterium cypripedii was shown to be a close phylogenetic relative of pantoea dispersa and dna hg iv by both 16s rrna gene sequence and mlsa analyses. biochemical analyses performed on strains from dna hg ii, iv and v and pectobacterium cypripedii confirmed their taxonomic  position within the genus pantoea and revealed phenotypic characteristics that allow the differentiation of these species from each other and from their closest phylogenetic neighbours. it is proposed to emend the description of the genus pantoea and to describe pantoea septica sp. nov. for dna hg ii (type strain lmg 5345(t) =bd 874(t) =cdc 3123-70(t)), pantoea eucrina sp. nov. for dna hg iv (type strain lmg 2781(t) =bd 872(t) =cdc 1741-71(t) =lmg 5346(t)), pantoea brenneri sp. nov. for strains of dna hg v excluding lmg 24534 (type strain lmg 5343(t) =bd 873(t) =cdc 3482-71(t)) and pantoea conspicua sp. nov. for the remaining strain of dna hg v (type strain lmg 24534(t) =bd 805(t) =cdc 3527-71(t)) and to transfer pectobacterium cypripedii to the genus as pantoea cypripedii comb. nov. (type strain lmg 2657(t) =atcc 29267(t) =dsm 3873(t) =lmg 2655(t)).

TI  == characterization of an endophytic bacterial community associated with eucalyptus  spp.
AB  == endophytic bacteria were isolated from stems of eucalyptus spp (eucalyptus citriodora, e. grandis, e. urophylla, e. camaldulensis, e. torelliana, e. pellita, and a hybrid of e. grandis and e. urophylla) cultivated at two sites; they were characterized by rapd and amplified rdna restriction analysis (ardra).  endophytic bacteria were more frequently isolated from e. grandis and e. pellita. the 76 isolates were identified by 16s rdna sequencing as erwinia/pantoea (45%),  agrobacterium sp (21%), curtobacterium sp (9%), brevibacillus sp (8%), pseudomonas sp (8%), acinetobacter sp (4%), burkholderia cepacia (2.6%), and lactococcus lactis (2.6%). genetic characterization of these endophytic bacteria  isolates showed at least eight ardra haplotypes. the genetic diversity of 32 erwinia/pantoea and 16 agrobacterium sp isolates was assessed with the rapd technique. there was a high level of genetic polymorphism among all the isolates  and there was positive correlation between the clusters and the geographic origin of the strains. these endophytic bacteria were further analyzed for in vitro interaction with endophytic fungi from eucalyptus spp. we found that metabolites  secreted by erwinia/pantoea and b. cepacia isolates had an inhibitory growth effect on some endophytic fungi, suggesting that these metabolites play a role in bacterial-fungal interactions inside the host plant. apparently, these bacteria could have an important role in plant development; in the future they may be useful for biological control of diseases and plant growth promotion, as well as  for the production of new metabolites and enzymes.

TI  == robustness of the bacterial community in the cabbage white butterfly larval midgut.
AB  == microbial communities typically vary in composition and structure over space and  time. little is known about the inherent characteristics of communities that govern various drivers of these changes, such as random variation, changes in response to perturbation, or susceptibility to invasion. in this study, we use 16s ribosomal rna gene sequences to describe variation among bacterial communities in the midguts of cabbage white butterfly (pieris rapae) larvae and examine the influence of community structure on susceptibility to invasion. we compared communities in larvae experiencing the same conditions at different times (temporal variation) or fed different diets (perturbation). the most highly represented phylum was proteobacteria, which was present in all midgut communities. the observed species richness ranged from six to 15, and the most abundant members affiliated with the genera methylobacteria, asaia, acinetobacter, enterobacter, and pantoea. individual larvae subjected to the same conditions at the same time harbored communities that were highly similar in structure and membership, whereas the communities observed within larval populations changed with diet and over time. in addition, structural changes due  to perturbation coincided with enhanced susceptibility to invasion by enterobacter sp. nab3r and pantoea stewartii cwb600, suggesting that resistance to invasion is in part governed by community structure. these findings along with the observed conservation of membership at the phylum level, variation in structure and membership at lower taxonomic levels, and its relative simplicity make the cabbage white butterfly larval community an attractive model for studying community dynamics and robustness.

TI  == uranium(vi) reduction and removal by high performing purified anaerobic cultures  from mine soil.
AB  == biological uranium reduction was investigated using bacteria isolated from a uranium mine in limpopo, south africa. background uranium concentration in soil from the mine was determined to be 168 mgkg(-1) much higher than the typical background uranium concentration in natural soils (0.30-11.7 mgkg(-1)). therefore it was expected that the bacteria isolated from the site were resistant to u(vi)  toxicity. preliminary studies using a non-purified consortium from the mine soil  showed that u(vi) [uranyl(vi) dioxide, uo(2)(2+)] was reduced and re-oxidized intermittently due to the coexistence of u(vi) reducers and u(vi) oxidisers in the soil. results from u(vi) reduction by individual species showed that the purified cultures of pantoea sp., pseudomonas sp. and enterobacter sp. reduced u(vi) to u(iv) [u(oh)(4)(aq)] under ph 5-6. klebsiella sp. had to be eliminated from the cultures since these contributed to the remobilisation of uranium to the hexavelant form. the initial reduction rate determined at 50% point in 30 mgl(-1) batches was highest in pseudomonas sp. at 30 mgl(-1), followed by pantoea sp. rapid reduction was observed in all cultures during the first 6h of incubation with equilibrium conditions obtained only after incubation for 24h. complete u(vi) reduction was observed at concentrations as high as 200mgl(-1) and up to 88% removal after 24h in batches with an initial added u(vi) concentration of 400 mgl(-1).

TI  == characterization of a broad-host-range flagellum-dependent phage that mediates high-efficiency generalized transduction in, and between, serratia and pantoea.
AB  == a phage (phiot8) isolated on serratia sp. atcc 39006 was shown to be flagellum-dependent, and to mediate generalized transduction with high efficiency (up to 10(-4) transductants per p.f.u.). phiot8 was shown to have a broad host range because it also infected a strain of pantoea agglomerans isolated from the  rhizosphere. transduction of plasmid-borne antibiotic resistance between the two  bacterial genera was demonstrated, consistent with purported ecological roles of  phages in dissemination of genes between bacterial genera. serratia sp. atcc 39006 and p. agglomerans produce a number of interesting secondary metabolites that have potential applications in cancer therapy and biocontrol of fungal infections. phiot8 has utility as a powerful functional genomics tool in these bacteria.

TI  == comparison of the bacterial community and characterization of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria from different genotypes of chrysopogon zizanioides (l.) roberty (vetiver) rhizospheres.
AB  == molecular approaches [pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge)] were used to determine whether three different vetiver (chrysopogon zizanioides) genotypes, commercially used in brazil and considered economically important over the world, select specific bacterial populations to coexist in their rhizospheres. dgge profiles revealed that the predominant rhizospheric bacterial  community hardly varies regarding the vetiver genotype. moreover, using traditional cultivation methods, bacterial strains were isolated from the different rhizospheres. colonies presenting different morphologies (83) were selected for determining their potential for plant growth promotion. more than half of the strains tested (57.8%) were amplified by pcr using nifh-based primers, specific for the enzyme nitrogenase reductase. the production of siderophores was observed in 88% of the strains, while the production of antimicrobial substances was detected in only 14.5% of the isolates when micrococcus sp. was used as the indicator strain. production of indole-3-acetic acid and the solubilization of phosphate were observed in 55.4% and 59% of the isolates, respectively. in total, 44 strains (53%) presented at least three characteristics of plant growth promotion and were submitted to amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. twenty-four genetic groups were formed at 100% similarity and one representative of each group was selected for their identification by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. they were affiliated with the genera acinetobacter, comamonas, chryseobacterium, klebsiella, enterobacter, pantoea, dyella, burkholderia, or pseudomonas. these strains can be considered of great importance as possible biofertilizers in vetiver.

TI  == population dynamics and identification of endophytic bacteria antagonistic toward plant-pathogenic fungi in cotton root.
AB  == the antagonistic potentials of endophytic bacteria isolated from the roots of six cotton cultivars at different developmental stages were determined in vitro toward three pathogens: verticillium dahliae kleb v107 and v396 and fusarium oxysporum f.sp. vasinfectum (f108). the populations of antagonistic endophytic bacteria (aeb) toward v107, v396, and f108 at the flowering and maturation stages were significantly higher than those at the seedling stage were. more aeb were found to be antagonistic toward pathogens v396 and f108 than v107. results from the multivariate analysis of variance showed that the populations of aeb were significantly different for the main factors of cultivars, stages, and their interactions. based on 16s rdna sequence analysis, the 39 aeb isolates that antagonized v107, v396, and f108 (baeb) consisted of seven genera, in which the genus of enterobacter (17 out of 39) and pantoea (14 out of 39) were predominant  among the baeb isolates. characterized by box-pcr fingerprints, these 39 baeb isolates represented 35 different cluster types. to explore the antagonistic mechanisms, the agar diffusion method was used to detect cell-wall-degrading enzyme activity and siderophore secretion. nearly half of these baeb isolates showed protease and chitinase activity, while all 39 baeb isolates excreted siderophores. however, pectinase, cellulase, and xylanase activity were hardly detected. a germination experiment revealed that nine of the 39 baeb isolates significantly improved the vigor index of the cotton seedlings.

AB  == pantoea citrea, pantoea punctata and pantoea terrea were described for strains isolated from fruit and soil originating in japan. these three 'japanese' species have been shown to be phylogenetically distant from other species of the genus pantoea. it has been observed previously that, using multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa), the 'japanese' species consistently formed a distinct clade with an extended branch length, casting doubt on the inclusion of these species within the genus pantoea. furthermore, the 'japanese' species are closely related to tatumella ptyseos, strains of which originate from human clinical specimens. dna-dna hybridization and phenotypic tests confirmed the observed phylogenetic distance of p. citrea, p. punctata and p. terrea from the genus pantoea and the affiliation of these species with tatumella. in addition, strains causing pink disease of pineapple, identified previously as p. citrea , were shown to represent a separate species by using 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, and mlsa and dna-dna hybridization data. the name tatumella morbirosei sp. nov. with the type strain lmg 23360(t) (=bd 878(t)=ncppb 4036(t)=cmc6(t)) is proposed to accommodate these strains. the new combinations tatumella citrea (kageyama et al. 1992) comb. nov.

AB  == bacteria isolated from eucalyptus leaves and shoots showing symptoms of blight and die-back collected in uganda, uruguay and argentina and from maize displaying brown stalk rot symptoms in south africa were tentatively placed in the genus pantoea on the basis of phenotypic and biochemical tests. these isolates, together with two strains (lmg 2558 and lmg 2560) previously assigned to pantoea  agglomerans based on protein electrophoregrams but later excluded from this species, were further investigated using molecular techniques. 16s rrna gene sequencing and multilocus sequence analyses (mlsa) revealed that the strains were phylogenetically closely related to pantoea agglomerans, pantoea stewartii and pantoea ananatis. mlsa and amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis placed the strains into four separate clusters, not containing any of the type strains of species of the genus pantoea. dna-dna hybridization confirmed the classification of the isolates into four novel species, for which the names pantoea vagans sp. nov. (type strain r-21566t=lmg 24199t=bcc 105t=bd 765t), pantoea eucalypti sp. nov. (type strain r-25678t=lmg 24197t=bcc 076t=bd 769t), pantoea deleyi sp. nov.

TI  == arsenic detoxification potential of aox genes in arsenite-oxidizing bacteria isolated from natural and constructed wetlands in the republic of korea.
AB  == arsenic is subject to microbial interactions, which support a wide range of biogeochemical transformations of elements in natural environments such as wetlands. the arsenic detoxification potential of the bacterial strains was investigated with the arsenite oxidation gene, aox genotype, which were isolated  from the natural and constructed wetlands. the isolates were able to grow in the  presence of 10 mm of sodium arsenite (as(iii) as naaso(2)) and 1 mm of d: +glucose. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequencing indicated that  these isolated strains resembled members of the genus that have arsenic-resistant systems (acinetobacter sp., aeromonas sp., agrobacterium sp., comamonas sp., enterobacter sp., pantoea sp., and pseudomonas sp.) with sequence similarities of 81-98%. one bacterial isolate identified as pseudomonas stutzeri strain gist-bdan2 (ef429003) showed the activity of arsenite oxidation and existence of  aoxb and aoxr gene, which could play an important role in arsenite oxidation to arsenate. this reaction may be considered as arsenic detoxification process. the  results of a batch test showed that p. stutzeri gist-bdan2 (ef429003) completely  oxidized in 1 mm of as(iii) to as(v) within 25-30 h. in this study, microbial activity was evaluated to provide a better understanding of arsenic biogeochemical cycle in both natural and constructed wetlands, where ecological niches for microorganisms could be different, with a specific focus on arsenic oxidation/reduction and detoxification.

AB  == the genetic diversity of siderophore-producing bacteria of tobacco rhizosphere was studied by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra), 16s rrna sequence homology and phylogenetics analysis methods. studies demonstrated that 85% of the total 354 isolates produced siderophores in iron limited liquid medium. a total of 28 ardra patterns were identified among the 299 siderophore-producing bacterial isolates. the 28 ardra patterns represented bacteria of 14 different genera belonging to six bacterial divisions, namely beta-, gamma-, alpha-proteobacteria, sphingobacteria, bacilli, and actinobacteria. especially, gamma-proteobacteria consisting of pseudomonas, enterobacter, serratia, pantoea, erwinia and stenotrophomonas genus encountered 18 different ardra groups. results also showed a greater siderophore-producing bacterial diversity than previous researches. for example, sphingobacterium (isolates g-2-21-1 and g-2-27-2), pseudomonas poae (isolate g-2-1-1), enterobacter endosymbiont (isolates g-2-10-2 and n-5-10), delftia acidovorans (isolate g-1-15), and achromobacter xylosoxidans (isolates n-46-11hh and n-5-20)  were reported to be able to produce siderophores under low-iron conditions for the first time. gram-negative isolates were more frequently encountered, with more than 95% total frequency. for gram-positive bacteria, the bacillus and rhodococcus were the only two genera, with 1.7% total frequency. furthermore, the pseudomonas and enterobacter were dominant in this environment, with 44.5% and 24.7% total frequency, respectively. it was also found that 75 percent of the isolates that had the high percentages of siderophore units (% between 40 and 60) belonged to pseudomonas. pseudomonas sp. g-229-21 screened out in this study may  have potential to apply to low-iron soil to prevent plant soil-borne fungal pathogen diseases.

TI  == inoculation of sugarcane with pantoea sp. increases amino acid contents in shoot  tissues; serine, alanine, glutamine and asparagine permit concomitantly ammonium  excretion and nitrogenase activity of the bacterium.
AB  == pantoea sp. is an endophytic nitrogen-fixing bacterium isolated from sugarcane tissues. the aim of the present study was to determine the contents of amino acids in sugarcane as a result of inoculation of nodes and nodal roots with pantoea sp. strain 9c and to evaluate the effects of amino acids on growth, nitrogenase activity and ammonium excretion of the bacterium. content of almost all amino acids increased in 30-day-old plantlets by root inoculation. the most abundant amino acids in shoot tissues were asparagine and proline, and those in nodal roots were asparagine, proline, aspartic acid, glutamic acid and serine. the bacterium was able to grow on all tested amino acids except histidine, isoleucine and leucine. nitrogenase pantoea sp. was partially inhibited by 1, 2 or 5mmoll(-1) and completely inhibited by 10mmoll(-1) of nh(4)(+) in the media. pantoea sp. showed nitrogenase activity in 5mmoll(-1) of serine, asparagine, threonine, alanine, proline, tyrosine, valine, methionine, lysine, phenylalanine, cysteine, tryptophan, citrulline and ornithine. pantoea sp. did not excrete ammonium when it grew in vivo conditions favoring nitrogen fixation; however, ammonium was detected in the supernatant when 5mmoll(-1) asparagine, aspartic acid, alanine, serine or glutamine was added to the medium. the highest ammonium  concentration in the supernatant was detected, when pantoea grew on serine. ammonium in the supernatant and nitrogenase activity were only detectable concomitantly when the medium was supplemented with serine, alanine, glutamine or asparagine. we discuss roles of amino acids on plant-bacteria interaction during  the colonization of sugarcane plants.

TI  == pathway engineering of brassica napus seeds using multiple key enzyme genes involved in ketocarotenoid formation.
AB  == brassica napus (canola) plants were genetically manipulated to increase the amount and composition of carotenoids in seeds by using seven key enzyme genes involved in ketocarotenoid formation, which originated from a soil bacterium pantoea ananatis (formerly called erwinia uredovora 20d3), and marine bacteria brevundimonas sp. strain sd212 and paracoccus sp. strain n81106 (formerly called  agrobacterium aurantiacum). the seven key gene cassettes, in which each gene was  surrounded by an appropriate promoter and terminator, were connected in a tandem  manner, and the resulting constructs (17 kb) were inserted into a binary vector and used for transformation of b. napus. surprisingly, 73-85% of the regenerated  plants retained all seven genes, and formed orange- or pinkish orange-coloured seeds (embryos), while untransformed controls had light yellow-coloured seeds with predominant accumulation of lutein. three of the transgenic lines were analysed further. the total amount of carotenoids in these seeds was 412-657 microg g(-1) fresh weight, which was a 19- to 30-fold increase compared with that of untransformed controls. the total amount of ketocarotenoids was 60-190 microg  g(-1) fresh weight. beta-carotene was the predominant carotenoid, with significant amounts of alpha-carotene, echinenone, phytoene, lutein, and canthaxanthin also detected in the transgenic seeds. the ratio of hydroxylated carotenoids to overall carotenoids was quite small relative to the ratio of ketocarotenoids to overall carotenoids. interestingly, expression of many endogenous carotenogenic genes was also altered in the transgenic seeds, suggesting that their expression was affected by an increase in carotenoid biosynthesis.

TI  == biosynthesis of the vitamin e compound delta-tocotrienol in recombinant escherichia coli cells.
AB  == the biosynthesis of natural products in a fast growing and easy to manipulate heterologous host system, such as escherichia coli, is of increasing interest in  biotechnology. this procedure allows the investigation of complex natural product biosynthesis and facilitates the engineering of pathways. here we describe the cloning and the heterologous expression of tocochromanol (vitamin e) biosynthesis genes in e. coli. tocochromanols are synthesized solely in photosynthetic organisms (cyanobacteria, algae, and higher green plants). for recombinant tocochromanol biosynthesis, the genes encoding hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase  (hpd), geranylgeranylpyrophosphate synthase (crte), geranylgeranylpyrophosphate reductase (ggh), homogentisate phytyltransferase (hpt), and tocopherol-cyclase (cyc) were cloned in a stepwise fashion and expressed in e. coli. recombinant e.  coli cells were cultivated and analyzed for tocochromanol compounds and their biosynthesis precursors. the expression of only hpd from pseudomonas putida or crte from pantoea ananatis resulted in the accumulation of 336 mg l(-1) homogentisate and 84 microg l(-1) geranylgeranylpyrophosphate in e. coli cultures. simultaneous expression of hpd, crte, and hpt from synechocystis sp. under the control of single tac-promoter resulted in the production of methyl-6-geranylgeranyl-benzoquinol (67.9 microg g(-1)). additional expression of the tocopherol cyclase gene vte1 from arabidopsis thaliana resulted in the novel  formation of a vitamin e compound-delta-tocotrienol (15 microg g(-1))-in e. coli.

TI  == diversity of endophytic enterobacteria associated with different host plants.
AB  == fifty-three endophytic enterobacteria isolates from citrus, cocoa, eucalyptus, soybean, and sugar cane were evaluated for susceptibility to the antibiotics ampicillin and kanamycin, and cellulase production. susceptibility was found on both tested antibiotics. however, in the case of ampicillin susceptibility changed according to the host plant, while all isolates were susceptible to kanamycin. cellulase production also changed according to host plants. the diversity of these isolates was estimated by employing box-pcr genomic fingerprints and 16s rdna sequencing. in total, twenty-three distinct operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified by employing a criterion of 60% fingerprint similarity as a surrogate for an otu. the 23 otus belong to the pantoea and enterobacter genera, while their high diversity could be an indication of paraphyletic classification. isolates representing nine different otus belong to pantoea agglomerans, p. ananatis, p. stewartii, enterobacter sp.,  and e. homaechei. the results of this study suggest that plant species may select endophytic bacterial genotypes. it has also become apparent that a review of the  pantoea/enterobacter genera may be necessary.

AB  == the diversity and beneficial characteristics of endophytic microorganisms have been studied in several host plants. however, information regarding naturally occurring seed-associated endophytes and vertical transmission among different life-history stages of hosts is limited. endophytic bacteria were isolated from seeds and seedlings of 10 eucalyptus species and two hybrids. the results showed  that endophytic bacteria, such as bacillus, enterococcus, paenibacillus and methylobacterium, are vertically transferred from seeds to seedlings. in addition, the endophytic bacterium pantoea agglomerans was tagged with the gfp gene, inoculated into seeds and further reisolated from seedlings. these results  suggested a novel approach to change the profile of the plants, where the bacterium is a delivery vehicle for desired traits. this is the first report of an endophytic bacterial community residing in eucalyptus seeds and the transmission of these bacteria from seeds to seedlings. the bacterial species reported in this work have been described as providing benefits to host plants. therefore, we suggest that endophytic bacteria can be transmitted vertically from seeds to seedlings, assuring the support of the bacterial community in the host plant.

AB  == dynamics of enterobacteria of normal intestinal microflora was studied in apis mellifera mellifera l. bees hibernating under snow in the western urals. the cell numbers (n) of the predominant species klebsiella oxytoca increased from 10-10(6) cfu/bee in november 2004 to 10(4)-10(7) cfu/bee in march 2005; its frequency of occurrence (p) increased from 92 to 100%. increase of providencia rettgeri (11.2004: n up to 10(6), p 25%; 03.2005: n 10(2)-10(6), p 80%) was accompanied by the substitution of morganella morganii (11.2004: n up to 10(6), p 25%) with proteus vulgaris (03.2005: n up to 10(5), p 8%). by spring, hafnia alvei and citrobacter sp., which are pathogenic to bees, disappeared (11.2004: n up to 10(5), p 13 and 10%, respectively). endophytic species pantoea agglomerans, leclecria sp., and other representatives of the "enterobacter agglomerans" group  were present in november and after the first emergence in spring (n up to 10(5);  november: p 15%; april: p 23%). in april, the number of enterobacteria decreased  to 10(5), and p. rettgeri became the predominant species (p 54%) instead of k. oxytoca (p 43%).

TI  == arsenite oxidation by alcaligenes sp. strain rs-19 isolated from arsenic-contaminated mines in the republic of korea.
AB  == arsenite [as(iii)]-oxidizing bacteria play important roles in reducing arsenic [as] toxicity and mobility in as-contaminated areas. as-resistant bacteria were isolated from the soils of two abandoned mines in the republic of korea. the isolated bacteria showed relatively high resistances to as(iii) up to 26 mm. the  pcr-based 16s rrna analysis revealed that the isolated as-resistant bacteria were close relatives to serratia marcescensa, pseudomonas putida, pantoea agglomerans, and alcaligenes sp. among the five as-resistant bacterial isolates, alcaligenes sp. strain rs-19 showed the highest as(iii)-oxidizing activity in batch tests, completely oxidizing 1 mm of as(iii) to as(v) within 40 h during heterotrophic growth. this study suggests that the indigenous bacteria have evolved to retain the ability to resist toxic as in the as-contaminated environments and moreover to convert the species to a less toxic form [e.g., from as(iii) to as(v)] and also contribute the biogeochemical cycling of as by being involved in speciation  of as.

TI  == quorum-sensing system affects gall development incited by pantoea agglomerans pv. gypsophilae.
AB  == the quorum-sensing (qs) regulatory system of the gall-forming pantoea agglomerans pv. gypsophilae was identified. mass spectral analysis, together with signal-specific biosensors, demonstrated that p. agglomerans pv. gypsophilae produced n-butanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (c4-hsl) as a major and n-hexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (c6-hsl) as a minor qs signal. homologs of luxi and luxr regulatory genes, pagi and pagr, were characterized in strain p. agglomerans pv. gypsophilae pag824-1 and shown to be convergently transcribed and separated by 14 bp. the deduced pagi (23.8 kda) and pagr (26.9 kda) show high similarity with smai (41% identity) and smar (43% identity), respectively, of serratia sp. american type culture collection 39006. pagr possesses characteristic autoinducer binding and a helix-turn-helix dna-binding domain. gall formation by p. agglomerans pv. gypsophilae depends on a plasmid-borne hrp/hrc gene cluster, type iii effectors, and phytohormones. disruption of pagi,  pagr, or both genes simultaneously in pag824-1 reduced gall size in gypsophila cuttings by 50 to 55% when plants were inoculated with 10(6) cfu/ml. higher reductions in gall size (70 to 90%) were achieved by overexpression of pagi or addition of exogenous c4-hsl. expression of the hrp/hrc regulatory gene hrpl and  the type iii effector pthg in the pagi mutant, as measured with quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, was reduced by 5.8 and 6.6, respectively, compared with the wild type, suggesting an effect of the qs system  on the hrp regulon.

TI  == short peptide induces an "uncultivable" microorganism to grow in vitro.
AB  == microorganisms comprise the bulk of biodiversity, but only a small fraction of this diversity grows on artificial media. this phenomenon was noticed almost a century ago, repeatedly confirmed, and termed the "great plate count anomaly." advances in microbial cultivation improved microbial recovery but failed to explain why most microbial species do not grow in vitro. here we show that at least some of such species can form domesticated variants capable of growth on artificial media. we also present evidence that small signaling molecules, such as short peptides, may be essential factors in initiating growth of nongrowing cells. we identified one 5-amino-acid peptide, lqpev, that at 3.5 nm induces the  otherwise "uncultivable" strain psychrobacter sp. strain msc33 to grow on standard media. this demonstrates that the restriction preventing microbial in vitro growth may be different from those offered to date to explain the "great plate count anomaly," such as deficiencies in nutrient composition and concentrations in standard media, medium toxicity, and inappropriate incubation time. growth induction of msc33 illustrates that some microorganisms do not grow  in vitro because they are removed from their native communities and the signals produced therein. "uncultivable" species represent the largest source of unexplored biodiversity, and provide remarkable opportunities for both basic and  applied research. access to cultures of some of these species should be possible  through identification of the signaling compounds necessary for growth, their addition to standard medium formulations, and eventual domestication.

TI  == response of endophytic bacterial communities in banana tissue culture plantlets to fusarium wilt pathogen infection.
AB  == endophytic bacteria reside within plant hosts without having pathogenic effects,  and various endophytes have been found to functionally benefit plant disease suppressive ability. in this study, the influence of banana plant stress on the endophytic bacterial communities, which was achieved by infection with the wilt pathogen fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense, was examined by cultivation-independent denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of 16s ribosomal dna directly amplified from plant tissue dna. community analysis clearly demonstrated increased bacterial diversity in pathogen-infected plantlets compared to that in control plantlets. by sequencing, bands most similar to species of bacillus and pseudomonas showed high density in the pathogen-treated pattern. in vitro screening of the isolates for antagonistic activity against fusarium wilt pathogen acquired three strains of endophytic bacteria which were found to match those species that obviously increased in the pathogen infection process; moreover, the most inhibitive strain could also interiorly colonize plantlets and perform antagonism. the evidence obtained from this work showed that antagonistic endophytic bacteria could be induced by the appearance of a host fungal pathogen and further be an ideal biological control agent to use in banana fusarium wilt disease protection.

TI  == bacteria associated with ectomycorrhizas of slash pine (pinus elliottii) in south-eastern queensland, australia.
AB  == bacterial communities associated with ectomycorrhizal and uncolonized roots of pinus elliottii (slash pine) collected from a plantation in south-east queensland, australia, were investigated, using cultivation-dependent and -independent methods. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis of  16s rrna gene pcr products obtained using a cultivation-independent approach revealed that bacterial communities associated with ectomycorrhizal root tips differed significantly from those associated with roots uncolonized by ectomycorrhizal fungi. dgge analysis of cultivable bacterial communities revealed no significant difference between ectomycorrhizal and uncolonized roots. neither  analytical approach revealed significant differences between the bacterial communities associated with ectomycorrhizal roots colonized by a suillus sp. or an atheliaceae taxon. cloned bacterial 16s rrna genes revealed sequence types closely related with that of burkholderia phenazinium, common in both ectomycorrhizal-colonized and -uncolonized roots, while sequence types most similar to the potentially phyopathogenic bacteria burkholderia andropogonis and  pantoea ananatis were only detected in ectomycorrhizal roots. these results highlight the possibility of global movement of microorganisms, including putative pathogens, as a result of the introduction of exotic pine plantations.

TI  == taxonomic structure and stability of the bacterial community in belgian sourdough ecosystems as assessed by culture and population fingerprinting.
AB  == a total of 39 traditional sourdoughs were sampled at 11 bakeries located throughout belgium which were visited twice with a 1-year interval. the taxonomic structure and stability of the bacterial communities occurring in these traditional sourdoughs were assessed using both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. a total of 1,194 potential lactic acid bacterium (lab) isolates were tentatively grouped and identified by repetitive element sequence-based pcr, followed by sequence-based identification using 16s rrna and  phes genes from a selection of genotypically unique lab isolates. in parallel, all samples were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of v3-16s rrna gene amplicons. in addition, extensive metabolite target analysis of  more than 100 different compounds was performed. both culturing and dgge analysis showed that the species lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, lactobacillus paralimentarius, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus pontis dominated the  lab population of belgian type i sourdoughs. in addition, dgge band sequence analysis demonstrated the presence of acetobacter sp. and a member of the erwinia/enterobacter/pantoea group in some samples. overall, the culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches each exhibited intrinsic limitations in assessing bacterial lab diversity in belgian sourdoughs. irrespective of the lab biodiversity, a large majority of the sugar and amino acid metabolites were detected in all sourdough samples. principal component-based analysis of biodiversity and metabolic data revealed only little  variation among the two samples of the sourdoughs produced at the same bakery. the rare cases of instability observed could generally be linked with variations  in technological parameters or differences in detection capacity between culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches. within a sampling interval  of 1 year, this study reinforces previous observations that the bakery environment rather than the type or batch of flour largely determines the development of a stable lab population in sourdoughs.

TI  == extracellular polysaccharides produced by cooling water tower biofilm bacteria and their possible degradation.
AB  == the extracellular polymers (eps) of biofilm bacteria that can cause heat and mass transfer problems in cooling water towers in the petrochemical industry were investigated. in addition, these microorganisms were screened for their ability to grow and degrade their own eps and the eps of other species. twelve bacteria producing the most eps were isolated from cooling water towers and characterized  biochemically by classic and commercial systems. these were species of pseudomonas, burkholderia, aeromonas, pasteurella, pantoea, alcaligenes and sphingomonas. eps of these species were obtained by propan-2-ol precipitation and centrifugation from bacterial cultures in media enriched with glucose, sucrose or galactose. eps yields were of 1.68-4.95 g l(-1). these eps materials were characterized for total sugar and protein contents. their total sugar content ranged from 24 to 56% (g sugar g(-1) eps), and their total protein content ranged from 10 to 28% (g protein g(-1) eps). the monosaccharide compositions of eps were determined by hplc. generally, these compositions were enriched in galactose and  glucose, with lesser amounts of mannose, rhamnose, fructose and arabinose. all bacteria were investigated in terms of eps degradation. eight of the bacteria were able to utilize eps from burkholderia cepacia, seven of the bacteria were able to utilize eps from pseudomonas sp. and sphingomonas paucimobilis. the greatest viscosity reduction of b. cepacia was obtained with pseudomonas sp. the  results show that the bacteria in this study are able to degrade eps from biofilms in cooling towers.

TI  == diversity of cultivated endophytic bacteria from sugarcane: genetic and biochemical characterization of burkholderia cepacia complex isolates.
AB  == bacteria were isolated from the rhizosphere and from inside the roots and stems of sugarcane plants grown in the field in brazil. endophytic bacteria were found  in both the roots and the stems of sugarcane plants, with a significantly higher  density in the roots. many of the cultivated endophytic bacteria were shown to produce the plant growth hormone indoleacetic acid, and this trait was more frequently found among bacteria from the stem. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed that the selected isolates of the endophytic bacterial community of sugarcane belong to the genera of burkholderia, pantoea, pseudomonas, and microbacterium. bacterial isolates belonging to the genus burkholderia were the most predominant among the endophytic bacteria. many of the burkholderia isolates produced the antifungal metabolite pyrrolnitrin, and all were able to grow at 37  degrees c. phylogenetic analyses of the 16s rrna gene and reca gene sequences indicated that the endophytic burkholderia isolates from sugarcane are closely related to clinical isolates of the burkholderia cepacia complex and clustered with b. cenocepacia (gv. iii) isolates from cystic fibrosis patients. these results suggest that isolates of the b. cepacia complex are an integral part of the endophytic bacterial community of sugarcane in brazil and reinforce the hypothesis that plant-associated environments may act as a niche for putative opportunistic human pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == stability of microbial communities in goat milk during a lactation year: molecular approaches.
AB  == the microbial communities in milks from one herd were evaluated during 1-year of  lactation, using molecular methods to evaluate their stability and the effect of  breeding conditions on their composition. the diversity of microbial communities  was measured using two approaches: molecular identification by 16s and 18s rdna sequencing of isolates from counting media (two milks), and direct identification using 16s rdna from clone libraries (six milks). the stability of these communities was evaluated by counting on selective media and by single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis of variable region v3 of the 16s rrna gene and variable region v4 of the 18s rrna gene. one hundred and eighteen milk samples taken throughout the year were analyzed. wide diversity among bacteria and yeasts in the milk was revealed. in addition to species commonly encountered  in milk, such as lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus caprae, staphylococcus equorum, micrococcus sp., kocuria sp., pantoea agglomerans and pseudomonas putida, sequences were affiliated to other species only described in cheeses, such as corynebacterium variabile, arthrobacter sp., brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, clostridium sp. and rothia sp. several halophilic species atypical in milk were found, belonging to jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, salinicoccus sp., dietza maris, exiguobacterium, ornithinicoccus sp. and hahella chejuensis. the yeast community  was composed of debaryomyces hansenii, kluyveromyces lactis, trichosporon beigelii, rhodotorula glutinis, rhodotorula minuta, candida pararugosa, candida intermedia, candida inconspicua, cryptococcus curvatus and cryptococcus magnus. the analyses of microbial counts and microbial sscp profiles both distinguished four groups of milks corresponding to four periods defined by season and feeding  regime. the microbial community was stable within each period. milks from winter  were characterized by lactococcus and pseudomonas, those from summer by p. agglomerans and klebsiella and those from autumn by chryseobacterium indologenes, acinetobacter baumanii, staphylococcus, corynebacteria and yeasts. however, the composition of the community can vary according to factors other than feeding. this study opens new investigation fields in the field of raw milk microbial ecology.

AB  == the facultative anaerobe pantoea sp. strain a-13, isolated from ornithogenic soil of dewart island (frazier islands), antarctica, produced glycolipid biosurfactants when grown on n-paraffins or kerosene as the sole source of carbon and energy. hemolysis of erythrocytes, growth inhibition of bacillus subtilis, and thin-layer chromatography studies have suggested that the secreted glycolipids are rhamnolipids. glycolipids produced by kerosene-grown cells decreased the surface tension at the air-water interface to 30 mn/m and possessed a low critical micelle concentration value of 40 mg/l, which indicated high surface activity. they efficiently emulsified aromatic hydrocarbons, kerosene, and n-paraffins. biosurfactant production contributed to an increase in cell hydrophobicity, which correlated with increased growth of the strain on tested hydrocarbons. according to the results, the antarctic biosurfactant-producing strain pantoea sp. a-13 appears to be valuable source for application in accelerated environmental bioremediation.

(n=2, 3.3%), chryseobacterium sp. (n=2, 3.3%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1, 1.6%). although all the serratia, enterobacter, klebsiella and pantoea species isolates showed varying degrees of resistance to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime and cefotaxime, all were resistant to ampicillin. chryseobacterium and stenotrophomonas species isolates were resistant to amikacin, imipenem, gentamicin and ceftazidime, to which only three isolates of pseudomonas species were resistant. all the staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to methicillin. although there has been no major outbreak of a nosocomial infection in the hospital, it is strongly recommended that effective control measures (e.g., sampling the hospital water supply, disinfecting children's toys, use of appropriate hand washing and checking some of the disinfectants for presence of bacteria) are needed. these measures are necessary  to ensure that the antibiotic-resistant strains identified in this study are not  allowed to spread in the hospital.

TI  == confirmation of e. coli among other thermotolerant coliform bacteria in paper mill effluents, wood chips screening rejects and paper sludges.
AB  == paper sludges are solid wastes material generated from the paper production, which have been characterized for their chemical contents. some are rich in wood  fiber and are a good carbon source, for example the primary and de-inking paper sludges. others are made rich in nitrogen and phosphorus by pressing the activated sludge, resulting from the biological water treatments, with the primary sludge, yielding the combined paper sludge. still, in the absence of sanitary effluents very few studies have addressed the characterization of their  coliform microflora. therefore, this study investigated the thermotolerant coliform population of one paper mill effluent and two paper mill sludges and wood chips screening rejects using chromogenic media. for the first series of analyses, the medium used was colilert broth and positive tubes were selected to  isolate bacteria in pure culture on macconkey agar. in a second series of analyses, double selective media, based on ss-galactosidase and ss-glucuronidase  activities, were used to isolate bacteria. first, the presence of thermotolerant  coliforms was detected in low numbers in most water effluents, but showed that the entrance of the thermotolerant coliforms was early in the industrial process. also, large numbers of thermotolerant coliforms, i.e., 7,000,000 mpn/g sludge (dry weight; d.w.), were found in combined sludges. from this first series of isolations, bacteria were purified on macconkey medium and identified as citrobacter freundii, enterobacter sp, e. sakazakii, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, k. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis, k. pneumoniae subsp.  ozaenae, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, pantoea sp, raoultella terrigena, r. planticola. second, the presence of thermotolerant coliforms was measured at more than 3,700-6,000 mpn/g (d.w) sludge, whereas e. coli was detected from 730 to more than 3,300 mpn/g (d.w.) sludge. the presence of thermotolerant coliform bacteria and e. coli was sometimes detected from wood chips screening rejects in  large quantities. also, indigenous e. coli were able to multiply into the combined sludge, and inoculated e. coli isolates were often able to multiply in wood chips and combined sludge media. in this second series of isolations, api20e and biolog identified most isolates as e. coli, but others remained unidentified. the sequences of the 16s rdna confirmed that most isolates were likely e. coli, few burkholderia spp, but 10% of the isolates remained unidentified. this study points out that the coliform bacteria are introduced by the wood chips in the water effluents, where they can survive throught the primary clarifier and regrow in combined sludges.

TI  == characterization of bacterial beta-carotene 3,3'-hydroxylases, crtz, and p450 in  astaxanthin biosynthetic pathway and adonirubin production by gene combination in escherichia coli.
AB  == beta-carotene hydroxylase (crtz) is one of rate-limiting enzymes for astaxanthin  production. a complementation analysis was conducted using escherichia coli transformants to compare the catalytic efficiency of bacterial crtz from brevundimonas sp. sd212, paracoccus sp. pc1 (formerly known as alcaligenes sp. pc-1), paracoccus sp. n81106 (agrobacterium aurantiacum), pantoea ananatis (erwinia uredovora 20d3), marine bacterium p99-3, and p450 monooxygenase (cyp175a1) from thermus thermophilus hb27. each crtz or cyp175a1 gene was expressed in e. coli transformants synthesizing canthaxanthin and beta-carotene due to the respective presence of plasmids pac-cantha and paccar16deltacrtx. the  carotenoids that accumulated in the resulting recombinant e. coli cells were examined by chromatographic and spectroscopic analyses. e. coli carrying brevundimonas sp. sd212 crtz showed the highest astaxanthin production efficiency among the transformants examined, while there was no significant difference in the catalytic efficiency for conversion from beta-carotene to zeaxanthin. recombinant e. coli expressing the cyp175a1 gene, in addition to the genes for canthaxanthin synthesis, surprisingly accumulated adonirubin (phoenicoxanthin) as the main product, although the other recombinant e. coli did not accumulate any adonirubin. the present results suggest that the brevundimonas sp. sd212 crtz and t. thermophilus hb27 cyp175a1 genes could, respectively, be used for the efficient production of astaxanthin and adonirubin in heterologous hosts.

TI  == characterization of microbial contamination in united states air force aviation fuel tanks.
AB  == bacteria and fungi, isolated from united states air force (usaf) aviation fuel samples, were identified by gas chromatograph fatty acid methyl ester (gc-fame) profiling and 16s or 18s rrna gene sequencing. thirty-six samples from 11 geographically separated usaf bases were collected. at each base, an above-ground storage tank, a refueling truck, and an aircraft wing tank were sampled at the lowest sample point, or sump, to investigate microbial diversity and dispersion within the fuel distribution chain. twelve genera, including four bacillus species and two staphylococcus species, were isolated and identified. bacillus licheniformis, the most prevalent organism isolated, was found at seven of the 11 bases. of the organisms identified, bacillus sp., micrococcus luteus, sphinogmonas sp., staphylococcus sp., and the fungus aureobasidium pullulans have previously been isolated from aviation fuel samples. the bacteria pantoea ananatis, arthrobacter sp., alcaligenes sp., kocuria rhizophilia, leucobacter komagatae, dietza sp., and the fungus discophaerina fagi have not been previously reported in usaf aviation fuel. only at two bases were the same organisms isolated from all three sample points in the fuel supply distribution chain. isolation of previously undocumented organisms suggests either, changes in aviation fuel microbial community in response to changes in aviation fuel composition, additives and biocide use, or simply, improvements in isolation and  identification techniques.

TI  == rapid, specific and quantitative assays for the detection of the endophytic bacterium methylobacterium mesophilicum in plants.
AB  == xylella fastidiosa is a xylem-limited bacterium that causes citrus variegated chlorosis disease in sweet orange. there is evidence that x. fastidiosa interacts with endophytic bacteria present in the xylem of sweet orange, and that these interactions, particularly with methylobacterium mesophilicum, may affect disease progress. however, these interactions cannot be evaluated in detail until efficient methods for detection and enumeration of these bacteria in planta are developed. we have previously developed standard and quantitative pcr-based assays specific for x. fastidiosa using the lightcycler system [li, w.b., pria jr., l.p.m.w.d., x. qin, and j.s. hartung, 2003. presence of xylella fastidiosa in sweet orange fruit and seeds and its transmission to seedlings. phytopathology 93:953-958.], and now report the development of both standard and quantitative pcr assays for m. mesophilicum. the assays are specific for m. mesophilicum and do not amplify dna from other species of methylobacterium or other bacteria commonly associated with citrus or plant tissue. other bacteria tested included curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, pantoea agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, bacillus sp., x. fastidiosa, xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri, and candidatus liberibacter asiaticus. we have demonstrated that with these methods we can quantitatively monitor the colonization of xylem by m. mesophilicum during the course of disease development in plants artificially inoculated with both bacteria.

TI  == effect of plants and filter materials on bacteria removal in pilot-scale constructed wetlands.
AB  == due to the lack of testing units or appropriate experimental approaches, only little is known about the removal of bacteria in constructed wetlands. however, improved performance in terms of water sanitation requires a detailed understanding of the ongoing processes. therefore, we analyzed the microbial diversity and the survival of enterobacteriaceae in six pilot-scale constructed wetland systems treating domestic wastewater: two vertical sand filters, two vertical expanded clay filters and two horizontal sand filters (each planted and  unplanted). samples were taken from the in- and outflow, from the rhizosphere, and from the bulk soil at various depths. colony-forming units of heterotrophic bacteria and coliforms were analyzed and the removal of bacteria between the in-  and outflow was determined to within 1.5-2.5 orders of magnitude. to access the taxon-specific biodiversity of potential pathogens in the filters and to reduce the complexity of the analysis, specific primers for enterobacteriaceae were developed. while performing pcr-sscp analyses, a pronounced decrease in diversity from the inflow to the outflow of treated wastewater was observed. no differences were observed between the bulk soil of planted and unplanted vertical filters. some bands appeared in the rhizosphere that were not present in the bulk soil, indicating the development of specific communities stimulated by the plants. the  fingerprinting of the rhizosphere of plants grown on sand or expanded clay exhibited many differences, which show that different microbial communities exist depending on the soil type of the filters. the use of the taxon-specific primers  enabled us to evaluate the fate of the enterobacteriaceae entering the wetlands and to localize harboring in the rhizosphere. the most abundant bands of the profiles were sequenced: pantoea agglomerans was found in nearly all samples from the soil but not in the effluent, whereas citrobacter sp. could not be removed by the horizontal unplanted sand and vertical planted expanded clay filters. these results show that the community in wetland system is strongly influenced by the filtration process, the filter material and the plants.

TI  == a predictive model for heat inactivation of listeria monocytogenes biofilm on stainless steel.
AB  == heat treatment of potential biofilm-forming sites is sometimes used for control of listeria monocytogenes in food processing plants. however, little information  is available on the heat treatment required to kill l. monocytogenes present in biofilms. the purpose of this study was to develop a predictive model for the heat inactivation of l. monocytogenes in monoculture biofilms (strains scott a and 3990) and in biofilms with competing bacteria (pseudomonas sp. and pantoea agglomerans) formed on stainless steel in the presence of food-derived soil. biofilms were produced on stainless steel coupons with diluted tryptic soy broth  incubated for 48 h at 25 degrees c. duplicate biofilm samples were heat treated for 1, 3, 5, and 15 min at 70, 72, 75, 77, and 80 degrees c and tested for survivors using enrichment culture. the experiment was repeated six times. a predictive model was developed using logistic regression analysis of the fraction negative data. plots showing the probability of l. monocytogenes inactivation in  biofilms after heat treatment were generated from the predictive equation. the predictive model revealed that hot water sanitation of stainless steel can be effective for inactivating l. monocytogenes in a biofilm on stainless steel if time and temperature are controlled. for example, to obtain a 75% probability of  total inactivation of l. monocytogenes 3990 biofilm, a heat treatment of 80 degrees c for 11.7 min is required. the model provides processors with a risk management tool that provides predicted probabilities of l. monocytogenes inactivation and allows a choice of three heat resistance assumptions. the predictive model was validated using a five-strain cocktail of l. monocytogenes in the presence of food soil.

TI  == gamma proteobacteria can nodulate legumes of the genus hedysarum.
AB  == the bacteria hosted in the root nodules of the three mediterranean wild legume species hedysarum carnosum, hedysarum spinosissimum subsp. capitatum, and hedysarum pallidum, growing in native stands in different habitats in algeria were isolated. bacteria were recovered on yeast-mannitol-agar or on minimal media from a total of 52 nodules. isolates were analyzed by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra) using the enzyme cfoi, and further sorted by rapd fingerprinting. a total of ten different types were found and their amplified 16s rdna was sequenced and compared to databases. the blast alignment indicates that  all the species whose sequences share 98 to 100% identity to the bacteria found in these nodules belong to the class gammaproteobacteria and include pantoea agglomerans, enterobacter kobei, enterobacter cloacae, leclercia adecarboxylata,  escherichia vulneris, and pseudomonas sp. no evidence of any rhizobial-like sequence was found even upon amplifying from the bulk of microbial cells obtained from the squashed nodules, suggesting that the exclusive occupants of the nodules formed by the three plants tested are members of the orders enterobacteriales or  pseudomonadales. this is the first report of gammaproteobacteria associated with  legume nodules. despite the presence of the related crop plant hedysarum coronarium, specifically nodulated by rhizobium sullae, these three hedysarum species demonstrate to have undergone a separate path in terms of endophytic interactions with bacteria. an hypothesis to account for differences between the  symbiotic relationships engaged by man-managed legumes, and those found in plants whose ecology is independent from human action, is discussed.

TI  == a putative new endophytic nitrogen-fixing bacterium pantoea sp. from sugarcane.
AB  == aims: to isolate and identify endophytic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in sugarcane growing in cuba without chemical fertilizers. methods and results: two n2-fixing  isolates, 9c and t2, were obtained from surface-sterilized stems and roots, respectively, of sugarcane variety ml3-18. both isolates showed acetylene reduction and h2 production in nitrogen-free media. nitrogenase activity measured by h2 production was about 15 times higher for isolate 9c than for t2 or for gluconoacetobacter diazotrophicus (pal-5 standard strain, atcc 49037). the nifh gene segment was amplified from both isolates using specific primers. classification of both t2 and 9c was made on the basis of morphological, biochemical, pcr tests and 16s rdna sequence analysis. conclusions: isolate 9c was identified as a pantoea species from its 16s rdna, but showed considerable differences in physiological properties from previously reported species of this  genus. for example, 9c can be cultured over a wide range of temperature, ph and salt concentration, and showed high h2 production (up to 67.7 nmol h2 h(-1) 10(10) cell(-1)). isolate t2 was a strain of gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus. significance and impact of the study: a new n2-fixing endophyte, i.e. pantoea, able to produce h2 and to grow in a wide range of conditions, was isolated from sugarcane stem tissue and characterized. the strain with these attributes may well be valuable for agriculture.

TI  == microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  == aim: the present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. methods: we identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp). results: nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. a single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per ml of bile (> 105 cfu/ml). the predominant gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). the predominant gram-positive bacteria were enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. all gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (cim90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/ml. gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. although all five isolates of e. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) e. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. conclusion: e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. faecalis and streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.

TI  == diversity of endophytic bacterial populations and their interaction with xylella  fastidiosa in citrus plants.
AB  == citrus variegated chlorosis (cvc) is caused by xylella fastidiosa, a phytopathogenic bacterium that can infect all citrus sinensis cultivars. the endophytic bacterial communities of healthy, resistant, and cvc-affected citrus plants were studied by using cultivation as well as cultivation-independent techniques. the endophytic communities were assessed in surface-disinfected citrus branches by plating and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). dominant isolates were characterized by fatty-acid methyl ester analysis as bacillus pumilus, curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, enterobacter cloacae, methylobacterium spp. (including methylobacterium extorquens, m. fujisawaense, m. mesophilicum, m. radiotolerans, and m. zatmanii), nocardia sp., pantoea agglomerans, and xanthomonas campestris. we observed a relationship between cvc symptoms and the frequency of isolation of species of methylobacterium, the genus that we most frequently isolated from symptomatic plants. in contrast, we isolated c. flaccumfaciens significantly more frequently from asymptomatic plants than from those with symptoms of cvc while p. agglomerans was frequently isolated from tangerine (citrus reticulata) and sweet-orange (c. sinensis) plants, irrespective of whether the plants were symptomatic or asymptomatic or showed symptoms of cvc. dgge analysis of 16s rrna gene fragments amplified from total plant dna resulted in several bands that matched those from the bacterial isolates, indicating that dgge profiles can be used to detect some endophytic bacteria of citrus plants. however, some bands had no match with any isolate, suggesting the occurrence of other, nonculturable or as yet uncultured, endophytic bacteria. a specific band with a high g+c ratio was observed only in asymptomatic plants. the higher frequency of c. flaccumfaciens in asymptomatic plants suggests a role for this organism in the resistance of plants to cvc.

TI  == samsonia erythrinae gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from bark necrotic lesions of erythrina sp., and discrimination of plant-pathogenic enterobacteriaceae by phenotypic features.
AB  == bacterial strains isolated from diseased erythrina (erythrina sp.) trees in martinique (french west indies) were studied using phenotypic tests, 16s rdna sequence analysis and dna-dna hybridization. numerical analysis of phenotypic characteristics showed that these strains formed an homogeneous phenon among plant-pathogenic enterobacteriaceae, and gave useful and updated information for  the identification of these bacteria. results of dna-dna hybridization indicated  that strains from erythrina belonged to a discrete genomospecies (89-100% hybridization) and had low levels of dna relatedness (2-33% hybridization) with reference strains of phytopathogenic erwinia, brenneria, pectobacterium, pantoea  and enterobacter species. 16s rdna sequence analysis using three different methods revealed that the position of strain cfbp 5236t isolated from erythrina was variable in the different trees, so that strains from erythrina could not be  assigned to any recognized genus. it is proposed that these strains are included  in a new genus, samsonia. the name samsonia erythrinae is proposed for the new species. the g+c content of the dna of the type strain, cfbp 5236t (= icmp 13937t), is 57.0 mol%.

AB  == purpose: establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. methods: from 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and dna was extracted. fragments of 200 bp, spanning the v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rdna, were amplified by polymerase  chain reaction (pcr) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). for phylogenetic identification, dgge bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16s rdna clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened  by dgge. sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the embl database. furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from  conventional cultivation. results: 16s rdna could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. the following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: staphylococcus (n = 8),  corynebacterium (n = 7), propionibacterium (n = 7), streptococcus (n = 6), bacillus (n = 2), acinetobacter (n = 3), pseudomonas (n = 3), proteus (n = 1), and brevundimonas (n = 1). four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. they had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of pantoea and enterobacter (n = 1), kingella and neisseria (n = 1), serratia and aranicola (n = 1), and leuconostoc and weissella (n = 2), respectively. culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), corynebacteria (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), streptococcus sp. (n = 1), proteus sp. (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). in total, 45% of  the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were pcr positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. no sample positive by culture gave negative results by pcr. conclusions: 16s rdna sequence analyses and dgge fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.

AB  == a novel pathogen from asian pears (pyrus pyrifolia nakai) was analysed by sequencing the 16s rdna and the adjacent intergenic region, and the data were compared to related enterobacteriaceae. the 16s rdna of the asian pear pathogen was almost identical with the sequence of erwinia amylovora, in contrast to the 16s-23s rrna intergenic transcribed spacer region of both species. a dendrogram was deduced from determined sequences of the spacer regions including those of several related species such as erwinia amylovora, enterobacter pyrinus, pantoea  stewartii subsp. stewartii and escherichia coli. dendrograms derived from 121 biochemical characteristics including biotype 100 data placed the asian pear pathogen close to erwinia amylovora and more distantly to other members of the species erwinia and to the species pantoea and enterobacter. another dna relatedness study was performed by dna hybridizations and estimation of delta tm  values. the asian pear strains constituted a tight dna hybridization group (89-100%) and were barely related to strains of erwinia amylovora (40-50%) with a delta tm in the range of 5.2-6.8. the g + c content of dna from the novel pathogen is 52 mol%. therefore, it is proposed that strains isolated from asian pears constitute a new species and the name erwinia pyrifoliae is suggested; the  type strain is strain ep 16/96t (= cfbp 4172t = dsm 12163t).

AB  == abstract the dinitrogen fixation activity of azospirillum sp., and pantoea agglomerans strains was determined by (15)n(2) incorporation after incubation with (15)n(2) labeled air or/and by acetylene reduction. these bacterial strains  were able to fix n(2) both in pure culture and in association with wheat plants in hydroponics. nitrogenase activity of azospirillum sp., in pure culture was more rapidly inhibited by the addition of nh(4) (+) than no(3) (-). the n(2) fixation of p. agglomerans decreased only by nh(4) (+) -addition, but was stimulated by no(3) (-). nitrogen fixation in association with wheat plants remained unaffected by both n compounds. however, nitrogen derived from the atmosphere (n(dfa)) contributed only very little to the overall nitrogen nutrition of the plants.

TI  == pantoea punctata sp. nov., pantoea citrea sp. nov., and pantoea terrea sp. nov. isolated from fruit and soil samples.
AB  == a total of 37 bacterial strains with the general characteristics of the family enterobacteriaceae were isolated from fruit and soil samples in japan as producers of 2,5-diketo-d-gluconic acid from d-glucose. these organisms were phenotypically most closely related to the genus pantoea (f. gavini, j. mergaert, a. beji, c. mielearek, d. izard, k. kersters, and j. de ley, int. j. syst. bacteriol. 39:337-345, 1989) and were divided into three phenotypic groups. we selected nine representative strains from the three groups for an examination of  dna relatedness, as determined by the s1 nuclease method at 60 degrees c. strain  shs 2003t (t = type strain) exhibited 30 to 41 and 28 to 33% dna relatedness to the strains belonging to the strain shs 2006t group (strains shs 2004, shs 2005,  shs 2006t, and shs 2007) and to the strains belonging to the strain shs 2008t group (strains shs 2008t, shs 2009, shs 2010, and shs 2011), respectively. strain shs 2006t exhibited 38 to 46% dna relatedness to the strains belonging to the strain shs 2008t group. the levels of dna relatedness within the strain shs 2006t group and within the strain shs 2008t group were more than 85 and 71%, respectively. strain shs 2003t, shs 2006t, and shs 2008t dnas exhibited less than 18% binding to pantoea dispersa atcc 14589t and pantoea agglomerans atcc 27155t dnas.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
