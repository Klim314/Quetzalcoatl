TI  == comparison of the gut microbiota profile in breast-fed and formula-fed korean infants using pyrosequencing.
AB  == background/objectives: feeding in infancy is the most significant determinant of  the intestinal microbiota in early life. the aim of this study was to determine the gut microbiota of korean infants and compare the microbiota obtained between  breast-fed and formula-fed korean infants. subjects/methods: we analyzed the microbial communities in fecal samples collected from twenty 4-week old korean (ten samples in each breast-fed or formula-fed) infants using pyrosequencing. results: the fecal microbiota of the 4-week-old korean infants consisted of the three phyla actinobacteria, firmicutes, and proteobacteria. in addition, five species, including bifidocbacterium longum, streptococcus salivarius, strepotococcus lactarius, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and lactobacillus gasseri were common commensal intestinal microbiota in all infants. the predominant intestinal microbiota in the breast-fed infants (bfi) included the phylum actinobacteria (average 70.55%), family bifidobacteriacea (70.12%), genus  bifidobacterium (70.03%) and species bifidobacterium longum (69.96%). in the microbiota from the formula-fed infants (ffi), the proportion of the phylum actinobacteria (40.68%) was less, whereas the proportions of firmicutes (45.38%)  and proteobacteria (13.85%) as well as the diversity of each taxonomic level were greater, compared to those of the bfi. the probiotic species found in the 4-week-old korean infants were bifidobacterium longum, streptococcus salivarius,  and lactobacillus gasseri. these probiotic species accounted for 93.81% of the microbiota from the bfi, while only 63.80% of the microbiota from the ffi. in particular, b. longum was more abundant in bfi (69.96%) than in ffi (34.17%). conclusions: breast milk supports the growth of b. longum and inhibits others. to the best of our knowledge, this study was the first attempt to analyze the gut microbiota of healthy korean infants according to the feeding type using pyrosequencing. our data can be used as a basis for further studies to investigate the development of intestinal microbiota with aging and disease status.

TI  == full-length structure of the major autolysin lyta.
AB  == lyta is responsible for the autolysis of many streptococcus species, including pathogens such as s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae and s. mitis. however, how this major autolysin achieves full activity remains unknown. here, the full-length structure of the s. pneumoniae lyta dimer is reported at 2.1 a resolution. each subunit has an n-terminal amidase domain and a c-terminal choline-binding domain consisting of six choline-binding repeats, which form five canonical and one single-layered choline-binding sites. site-directed mutageneses combined with enzymatic activity assays indicate that dimerization and binding to choline are two independent requirements for the autolytic activity of lyta in vivo. altogether, it is suggested that dimerization and full occupancy of all choline-binding sites through binding to choline-containing ta chains enable lyta to adopt a fully active conformation which allows the amidase domain to cleave two lactyl-amide bonds located about 103 a apart on the peptidoglycan.

TI  == antibacterial effects of traditional chinese medicine monomers against streptococcus pneumoniae via inhibiting pneumococcal histidine kinase (vick).
AB  == two-component systems (tcss) have the potential to be an effective target of the  antimicrobials, and thus received much attention in recent years. vick/vicr is one of tcss in streptococcus pneumoniae (s. pneumoniae), which is essential for pneumococcal survival. we have previously obtained several traditional chinese medicine monomers using a computer-based screening. in this study, either alone or in combination with penicillin, their antimicrobial activities were evaluated  based on in vivo and in vitro assays. the results showed that the mics of 5'-(methylthio)-5'-deoxyadenosine, octanal 2, 4-dinitrophenylhydrazone, deoxyshikonin, kavahin, and dodecyl gallate against s. pneumoniae were 37.1, 38.5, 17, 68.5, and 21 mug/ml, respectively. time-killing assays showed that these compounds elicited bactericidal effects against s. pneumoniae d39 strain, which led to a 6-log reduction in cfu after exposure to compounds at four times of the mic for 24 h. the five compounds inhibited the growth of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans or streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, meanwhile, deoxyshikonin and dodecyl gallate displayed strong inhibitory activities against staphylococcus aureus. these compounds showed no obvious cytotoxicity effects on vero cells. survival time of the mice infected by s. pneumoniae strains was prolonged by the treatment with the compounds. importantly, all of the five compounds exerted antimicrobial effects against multidrug-resistant clinical strains of s. pneumoniae. moreover, even at sub-mic  concentration, they inhibited cell division and biofilm formation. the five compounds all have enhancement effect on penicillin. deoxyshikonin and dodecyl gallate showed significantly synergic antimicrobial activity with penicillin in vivo and in vitro, and effectively reduced nasopharyngeal and lung colonization caused by different penicillin-resistant pneumococcal serotypes. in addition, the two compounds also showed synergic antimicrobial activity with erythromycin and tetracycline. taken together, our results suggest that these novel vick inhibitors may be promising compounds against the pneumococcus, including penicillin-resistant strains.

TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of subgingival microbiota in distinct periodontal conditions.
AB  == subgingival microorganisms are potentially associated with periodontal diseases.  however, changes in the subgingival microbiota during the progress of periodontal diseases are poorly understood. in this study, we analyzed bacterial communities  in the subgingival paper point samples from 32 korean individuals with no sign of disease, gingivitis, or periodontitis using 454 flx titanium pyrosequencing. a total of 256,113 reads representing 26 phyla, 433 genera, and 1,016 species were  detected. bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, synergistetes, and spirochaetes were the abundant phyla in periodontitis subjects, whereas firmicutes and proteobacteria were identified as the dominant phyla in the gingivitis and healthy subjects, respectively. although high levels of porphyromonas, fusobacterium, fretibacterium, rothia, filifactor, and treponema genera were observed in the periodontitis subjects, streptococcus, capnocytophaga, leptotrichia, and haemophilus genera were found at high frequency in the gingivitis subjects. species including porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and fretibacterium fastidiosum were significantly increased in periodontitis subjects. on the other hand, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and leptotrichia hongkongensis were preferentially observed in the gingivitis subjects. intriguingly, the halophile halomonas hamiltonii was revealed as a predominant species in the healthy subjects. based on fast unifrac  analysis, distinctive bacterial clusters were classified for the healthy, gingivitis, and periodontitis state. the current findings might be useful for understanding the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == characterization and comparison of bacterial communities in benign vocal fold lesions.
AB  == background: benign vocal fold lesions, including cysts, nodules, polyps, and reinke's edema, are common causes of hoarseness and subsequent voice disorders. given the prevalence of these lesions, disease etiology and pathophysiology remain unclear and their microbiota has not been studied to date secondary to the paucity of available biopsies for investigation. we sought to characterize and compare the bacterial communities in biopsies of cysts, nodules, polyps, and reinke's edema collected from patients in germany and wisconsin. these samples were then compared to the communities found in healthy saliva and throat samples  from the human microbiome project (hmp). results: 454 pyrosequencing of the v3-v5 regions of the 16s rrna gene revealed five phyla that explained most of the bacterial diversity, including firmicutes (73.8%), proteobacteria (12.7%), bacteroidetes (9.2%), actinobacteria (2.1%), and fusobacteria (1.9%). every lesion sample, regardless of diagnosis, had operational taxonomic units (otus) identified as streptococcus, with a mean abundance of 68.7%. most of the lesions, 31 out of 44, were indistinguishable in a principal coordinates analysis (pcoa) due to dominance by otus phylogenetically similar to streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. thirteen lesions not dominated by s. pseudopneumoniae were more similar to hmp throat and saliva samples, though 12 of them contained pseudomonas, which was not present in any of the hmp samples. community structure and abundance could not be correlated with lesion diagnosis or any other documented patient factor, including age, sex, or country of origin. conclusions: dominance by s. pseudopneumoniae could be a factor in disease etiology, as could  the presence of pseudomonas in some samples. likewise, decreased diversity, as compared to healthy saliva and throat samples, may be associated with disease, similar to disease models in other mucosal sites.

TI  == streptococcus pseudopneumoniae: prospective detection among community lower respiratory isolates in eastern saudi arabia.
AB  == streptococcus pseudopneumoniae is a distinct pathogen and the available evidence  suggests its significance in lower respiratory tract infections. the purpose of this study is to investigate the occurrence of this new species in patients presenting with community-acquired pneumonia in a university hospital setting using routine laboratory tests. sputum samples (n = 213) submitted to the microbiology laboratory for culture from cases clinically diagnosed as community-acquired pneumonia are studied. optochin variability in ambient air and 5% co2 was the criterion used to identify s. pseudopneumoniae. disc-diffusion and e-test on muller hinton blood-based agar were used for antibiotic susceptibility  testing following clinical laboratory standard institute breakpoints. out of the  screened isolates, only six (3%) were identified as s. pseudopneumoniae. none of  the commercial tests differentiated the pathogens from viridans streptococci so diagnostic laboratories need to provide an alternative identification algorithm.  the six isolates showed susceptibility to penicillin, and five isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, but one exhibited low-level resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]: 1 mug/ml). all isolates showed high-level resistance to macrolides (mic: 24- > 256 mug/ml). although s. pseudopneumoniae strains were not sufficiently frequent to justify routine additional incubation of sputum samples in ambient air, the high resistance pattern is alarming. further surveillance is needed in diagnostic laboratories to understand the epidemiology and clinical significance of the newly described pathogen.

TI  == the novel species streptococcus tigurinus and its association with oral infection.
AB  == streptococcus tigurinus is a novel species of viridans streptococci, shown to cause severe invasive infections such as infective endocarditis, spondylodiscitis and meningitis. s. tigurinus belongs to the streptococcus mitis group and is most closely related to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and streptococcus infantis. the presence of s. tigurinus in the human oral cavity has been documented, including  in patients with periodontal disease. this review addresses the available scientific knowledge on s. tigurinus and its association with closely related streptococci, and discusses its putative involvement in common oral infections. while there is as yet no strong evidence on the involvement of s. tigurinus with  oral infections, its presence in the oral cavity and its association with endocarditis warrants special attention for a link between oral and systemic infection.

TI  == identification of proteins in streptococcus pneumoniae by reverse vaccinology and genetic diversity of these proteins in clinical isolates.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. virulence-associated proteins common and conserved among all capsular types now represent the best strategy to combat pneumococcal infections. our aim was to identify conserved targets in pneumococci that showed positive prediction for lipoprotein and extracellular subcellular location using bioinformatics programs  and verify the distribution and the degree of conservation of these targets in pneumococci. these targets can be considered potential vaccine candidate to be evaluated in the future. a set of 13 targets were analyzed and confirmed the presence in all pneumococci tested. these 13 genes were highly conserved showing  around >96 % of amino acid and nucleotide identity, but they were also present and show high identity in the closely related species streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. s. oralis clusters away from s. pneumoniae, while s. pseudopneumoniae and s. mitis cluster closer. the divergence between the selected targets was too small to be observed consistently in phylogenetic groups between the analyzed genomes of s. pneumoniae. the proteins analyzed fulfill two of the initial criteria of a vaccine candidate: targets are present in a variety of different pneumococci strains including different serotypes and are conserved among the samples evaluated.

TI  == isolation of streptococcus tigurinus - a novel member of streptococcus mitis group from a case of periodontitis.
AB  == streptococcus tigurinus is a new member of the streptococcus viridians group and  is closely related to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus infantis. the type strain az_3a(t) of s. tigurinus was originally isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis. accurate identification of s. tigurinus is facilitated only by newer molecular methods like 16s rrna gene analysis. during the course of study on bacteraemia and infective endocarditis with reference to periodontitis and viridians group of streptococci, a strain of s. tigurinus isolated from subgingival plaque of a patient with periodontitis identified by 16s rrna gene analysis, which was originally identified as streptococcus pluranimalium by vitek 2. confirmation by 16s rrna gene analysis showed 99.39% similarity (1476/1485 bp) with s. tigurinus az_3a(t) (aoru01000002). to the best  of our knowledge, this is the first report of isolation of s. tigurinus from the  oral cavity of a periodontitis patient.

TI  == [a novel typing method and scheme for streptococcus pneumoniae].
AB  == study aim: to introduce a novel molecular pcr method for the typing of streptococcus pneumonia in the national reference laboratory (nrl) for streptococcal infections. material and methods: strains of streptococcus pneumoniae are referred to the nrl from different regions of the czech republic.  generally, the identification and typing are based on strain morphology, optochin susceptibility, bile solubility, latex agglutination, and the quellung reaction.  since 2012, a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mpcr) assay has been introduced. the novel assay was tested on 210 s. pneumoniae isolates and 8 isolates of the related species s. pseudopneumoniae, s. sanguinis, and s. oralis. results: the nrl for streptococcal infections has included a novel mpcr assay in  the algorithm of s. pneumoniae identification and typing. the mpcr assay was able to identify and type any pneumococcal strain from the study collection, with the  isolates of the related species remaining negative. the mpcr assay showed 100% sensitivity and specificity in this study. the pcr appeared to be an excellent tool for s. pneumoniae typing. conclusion: until recently, s. pneumoniae serotypes and serogroups were differentiated using a serological approach (quellung reaction), but the nrl for streptococcal infections has switched to a novel mpcr assay. this molecular tool improves s. pneumoniae typing, making it more accurate.

TI  == late-onset bleb-related endophthalmitis caused by streptococcus pseudopneumoniae.
AB  == we report our findings in a 63-year-old male who developed late-onset bleb-related endophthalmitis. the patient had undergone glaucoma surgery 46 years earlier, and had a thin-walled cystic bleb prior to the endophthalmitis in his right eye. he underwent immediate vitrectomy with intravitreal injections of ceftazidime and vancomycin. after surgery, he was given topical 0.5 % moxifloxacin and 1 % vancomycin, intravenous doripenem, and oral minocycline. culture of the vitreous specimen identified streptococcus pseudopneumoniae by 16s rrna sequence analysis, by optochin susceptibility test, and by bile solubility test. our findings indicate that s. pseudopneumoniae can be isolated from a late-onset bleb-related endophthalmitis and that molecular analysis and phenotypic testing can be accurate methods to identify s. pseudopneumoniae.

TI  == comparative genomic analyses of provide insight into virulence and commensalism dynamics.
AB  == streptococcus pseudopneumoniae (sppn) is a recently described species of the viridans group streptococci (vgs). although the pathogenic potential of s. pseudopneumoniae remains uncertain, it is most commonly isolated from patients with underlying medical conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. s. pseudopneumoniae can be distinguished from the closely related species, s. pneumoniae and s. mitis, by phenotypic characteristics, including optochin resistance in the presence of 5% co2, bile insolubility, and the lack of the pneumococcal capsule. previously, we reported the draft genome sequence of s. pseudopneumoniae is7493, a clinical isolate obtained from an immunocompromised patient with documented pneumonia. here, we use comparative genomics approaches to identify similarities and key differences between s. pseudopneumoniae is7493,  s. pneumoniae and s. mitis. the genome structure of s. pseudopneumoniae is7493 is most closely related to that of s. pneumoniae r6, but several recombination events are evident. analysis of gene content reveals numerous unique features that distinguish s. pseudopneumoniae from other streptococci. the presence of loci for competence, iron transport, pneumolysin production and antimicrobial resistance reinforce the phylogenetic position of s. pseudopneumoniae as an intermediate species between s. pneumoniae and s. mitis. additionally, the presence of several virulence factors and antibiotic resistance mechanisms suggest the potential of this commensal species to become pathogenic or to contribute to increasing antibiotic resistance levels seen among the vgs.

TI  == identification of clinical streptococcus pneumoniae isolates among other alpha and nonhemolytic streptococci by use of the vitek ms matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry system.
AB  == discrimination between streptococcus pneumoniae and its close relatives of the viridans group is a common difficulty in matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry-based identification. in  the present study, the performances of the vitek ms maldi-tof mass spectrometry system were assessed using 334 pneumococci, 166 other s. mitis group streptococci, 184 non-s. mitis group streptococci, and 19 related alpha- and nonhemolytic aerobic gram-positive catalase-negative coccal isolates. pneumococci had been identified by means of optochin susceptibility and bile solubility or serotyping, and other isolates mainly by use of rapidid32 strep strips. in case of discordant or low-discrimination results, genotypic methods were used. the sensitivity of the vitek ms for the identification of s. pneumoniae was 99.1%, since only three bile-insoluble isolates were misidentified as streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis. conversely, two optochin-resistant pneumococci were correctly identified (specificity, 100%). three streptococcus pseudopneumoniae isolates were also correctly identified. among nonpneumococcal isolates, 90.8% (n = 335) were correctly identified to the species or subspecies level and 2.4% (n = 9) at the group level. for the remaining 25 isolates, the vitek ms proposed a bacterial species included in the list of possible species suggested by genotypic methods, except for 4 isolates which were not identified due to the absence of the species in the database. according to our study, the vitek ms displays performance similar to that of the optochin susceptibility test for routine identification of pneumococcal isolates. moreover, the vitek ms is efficient for  the identification of other viridans group streptococci and related isolates, provided that the species are included in the database.

TI  == disease isolates of streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and non-typeable s. pneumoniae presumptively identified as atypical s. pneumoniae in spain.
AB  == we aimed to obtain insights on the nature of a collection of isolates presumptively identified as atypical streptococcus pneumoniae recovered from invasive and non-invasive infections in spain. one-hundred and thirty-two isolates were characterized by: optochin susceptibility in ambient and co(2)-enriched atmosphere; bile solubility; pcr-based assays targeting pneumococcal genes lyta, ply, pspa, cpsa, spn9802, alib-like orf2, and a specific 16s rrna region; multilocus sequence analysis; and antimicrobial susceptibility.  by multilocus sequence analysis, 61 isolates were s. pseudopneumoniae, 34 were pneumococci, 13 were s. mitis, and 24 remained unclassified as non-pneumococci. among s. pseudopneumoniae isolates, 51 (83.6%) were collected from respiratory tract samples; eight isolates were obtained from sterile sources. high frequency  of non-susceptibility to penicillin (60.7%) and erythromycin (42.6%) was found. only 50.8% of the s. pseudopneumoniae isolates displayed the typical optochin phenotype originally described for this species. none harbored the cpsa gene or the pneumococcal typical lyta restriction fragment length polymorphism. the spn9802 and the specific 16s rrna regions were detected among the majority of the s. pseudopneumoniae isolates (n = 59 and n = 49, respectively). the ply and pspa  genes were rarely found. a high genetic diversity was found and 59 profiles were  identified. among the s. pneumoniae, 23 were capsulated and 11 were non-typeable. three non-typeable isolates, associated to international non-capsulated lineages, were recovered from invasive disease sources. in conclusion, half of the atypical pneumococcal clinical isolates were, in fact, s. pseudopneumoniae and one-fourth  were other streptococci. we identified s. pseudopneumoniae and non-typeable pneumococci as cause of disease in spain including invasive disease.

TI  == molecular mapping to species level of the tonsillar crypt microbiota associated with health and recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == the human palatine tonsils, which belong to the central antigen handling sites of the mucosal immune system, are frequently affected by acute and recurrent infections. this study compared the microbiota of the tonsillar crypts in children and adults affected by recurrent tonsillitis with that of healthy adults and children with tonsillar hyperplasia. an in-depth 16s rrna gene based pyrosequencing approach combined with a novel strategy that included phylogenetic analysis and detection of species-specific sequence signatures enabled identification of the major part of the microbiota to species level. a complex microbiota consisting of between 42 and 110 taxa was demonstrated in both children and adults. this included a core microbiome of 12 abundant genera found  in all samples regardless of age and health status. yet, haemophilus influenzae,  neisseria species, and streptococcus pneumoniae were almost exclusively detected  in children. in contrast, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae was present in all samples. obligate anaerobes like porphyromonas, prevotella, and fusobacterium were abundantly present in children, but the species diversity of porphyromonas and prevotella was larger in adults and included species that are considered putative pathogens in periodontal diseases, i.e. porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, and tannerella forsythia. unifrac analysis showed that recurrent tonsillitis is associated with a shift in the microbiota of the tonsillar crypts. fusobacterium necrophorum, streptococcus intermedius and prevotella melaninogenica/histicola were associated with recurrent tonsillitis in adults, whereas species traditionally associated with acute tonsillitis like pyogenic streptococci and staphylococcus aureus were scarce. the findings suggest that recurrent tonsillitis is a polymicrobial infection in which interactions within consortia of taxa play an etiologic role. the study contributes to the human microbiome data, to the understanding of the etiology of infections affecting the tonsils, and forms a basis for further insight into the consequences of the intense microbe-host interactions that take place in the tonsils.

TI  == discrimination between streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis based on  sorting of their maldi mass spectra.
AB  == accurate species-level identification of alpha-hemolytic (viridans) streptococci  (vgs) is very important for understanding their pathogenicity and virulence. however, an extremely high level of similarity between vgs within the mitis group (s. pneumoniae, s. mitis, s. oralis and s. pseudopneumoniae) often results in misidentification of these organisms. earlier, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) has been suggested as  a tool for the rapid identification of s. pneumoniae. however, by using biotyper  3.0 (bruker) or vitek ms (biomerieux) databases, streptococcus mitis/oralis species can be erroneously identified as s. pneumoniae. clinprotools 2.1 software was used for the discrimination of maldi-tof mass spectra of 25 s. pneumoniae isolates, 34 s. mitis and three s. oralis. phenotypical tests and multilocus gene typing schemes for the s. pneumoniae (http://spneumoniae.mlst.net/) and viridans  streptococci (http://viridans.emlsa.net/) were used for the identification of isolates included in the study. the classifying model was generated based on different algorithms (genetic algorithm, supervised neural network and quickclassifier). in all cases, values of sensitivity and specificity were found  to be equal or close to 100%, allowing discrimination of mass spectra of different species. three peaks (6949, 9876 and 9975 m/z) were determined conferring the maximal statistical weight onto each model built. we find this approach to be promising for viridans streptococci discrimination.

TI  == streptococcus pseudopneumoniae: an emerging respiratory tract pathogen.
AB  == background & objectives: streptococcus pseudopneumoniae a member of the viridans  streptococci, is known to be associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and respiratory tract infections (rti). very scanty information is available on the isolation of s. pseudopneumoniae from india. hence, the present  study was an attempt to isolate s. pseudopneumoniae from clinical samples and to  study their drug resistance pattern. methods: sputum samples (n=150) submitted to the microbiology laboratory for routine culture from patients clinically suspected to have lower respiratory tract infection were inoculated onto sheep blood agar and chocolate agar plates. alpha haemolytic colonies were identified as s. pseudopneumoniae based on absence of capsule, bile solubility and optochin  susceptibility in 5 per cent co(2) and ambient air. disk diffusion method was used for antibiotic susceptibilily testing. results: among the samples screened,  4 per cent showed the growth of only s. pseudopneumoniae. other pathogens isolated were streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, klebsiella spp., enterococcus spp., pseudomonas spp., haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans. all the s. pseudopneumoniae isolates were resistant to  erythromycin. interpretation & conclusions: our preliminary results showed presence of s. pseudopneumoniae in this part of the country and these were associated with rti. currently, most clinical laboratories report optochin susceptible isolates in 5 per cent co(2) as s. pneumoniae and the resistant ones  are not further tested for susceptibility in ambient air. as a result, s. pseudopneumoniae may be missed out. hence, performance of at least two tests, viz. optochin susceptibility with incubation in 5 per cent co(2) and ambient air  along with bile solubility is necessary to differentiate s. pneumoniae from s. pseudopneumoniae.

TI  == identifying divergent streptococcal strains using pherotype: implications for pathogen emergence and epidemiology.
AB  == since the late 1980s, new and existing species of oral streptococci have been identified by complex and protracted dna-based methods that are unsuitable for high-throughput testing in clinical laboratories. developments of simpler dna-based tests for routine diagnosis have been thwarted by the similarities of their genomes and their high recombination rates. thus, phenotypic tests to differentiate oral streptococci, such as hemolysis and optochin sensitivity, remain in use. however, these tests are variable and can lead to misidentification, particularly in closely related species such as streptococcus  pneumoniae and the recently identified streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. this report highlights recent dna-based developments in differentiating oral streptococci. reference will be made to the methods 'sequetyping' for identifying and serotyping the pneumococcus, and 'pherotyping' for distinguishing them from pseudopneumococcus strains. these tests are yet to be evaluated in the clinical setting; nevertheless, the identification of the pseudopneumococcus by pherotyping will enable its epidemiology and pathogenesis to be studied.

TI  == characterization of recombinant fluoroquinolone-resistant pneumococcus-like isolates.
AB  == fourteen fluoroquinolone-resistant streptococcal isolates with recombinant dna topoisomerase genes, preliminarily identified as pneumococci, were further characterized using phenotypic and genotypic approaches. phenotypic tests classified them as atypical pneumococci. phylogenetic relationships were analyzed by using the sequences of seven housekeeping alleles from these isolates and from isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis,  and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. four isolates grouped with s. pneumoniae, seven grouped with s. pseudopneumoniae, and three grouped with s. mitis. these results generally agreed with those obtained with an optochin susceptibility test and with the organization of the atp operon chromosomal region, encoding the f(o)f(1) h(+)-atpase (the target of optochin). all seven isolates grouping with s. pseudopneumoniae share the same spr1368-atpc-atpa gene order; all four grouping with s. pneumoniae share the spr1368-is1239-atpc-atpa order, and two out of the three grouping with s. mitis share the spr1284-atpc-atpa order. in addition, evidence for recombination within the seven housekeeping alleles of the s. pseudopneumoniae population was provided by several methods: the index of association (0.4598, p < 0.001), the pairwise homoplasy index, and the split-decomposition method. this study confirms the existence of pneumococci among the alpha-hemolytic streptococci with dna topoisomerase genes showing a mosaic structure and reveals a close relationship between atypical pneumococci and s. pseudopneumoniae.

TI  == occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

AB  == we recently described the novel species streptococcus tigurinus sp. nov. belonging to the streptococcus mitis group. the type strain az_3a(t) of s. tigurinus was originally isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis. according to its phenotypic and molecular characteristics, s. tigurinus is most closely related to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus infantis. accurate identification of s. tigurinus is facilitated by 16s rrna gene analysis. we retrospectively analyzed our 16s rrna gene molecular database, which contains sequences of all clinical samples obtained in our institute since 2003. we detected 17 16s rrna gene sequences which were assigned to s. tigurinus, including sequences from the 3 s. tigurinus strains described previously. s. tigurinus originated from normally sterile body sites, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or heart valves, of 14 patients and was initially detected by culture or broad-range 16s rrna gene pcr, followed by sequencing. the 14 patients had serious invasive infections, i.e., infective endocarditis (n = 6), spondylodiscitis (n = 3), bacteremia (n = 2), meningitis (n = 1), prosthetic joint infection (n = 1), and thoracic empyema (n = 1). to evaluate the presence of streptococcus tigurinus in the endogenous oral microbial flora, we screened saliva specimens of 31 volunteers. after selective growth, alpha-hemolytic growing colonies were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) and subsequent molecular methods. s. tigurinus was not identified among 608 strains analyzed. these data indicate that s. tigurinus is not widely distributed in the oral cavity. in conclusion, s. tigurinus is a novel agent of invasive infections, particularly infective endocarditis.

TI  == immune reactivity of four monoclonal and two polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant pneumococcal surface adhesin a.
AB  == in this study four monoclonal antibodies (mabs) and two polyclonal antisera were  raised against pneumococcal surface adhesion a (psaa), a 37 kda cell wall protein, and were characterized. the mabs were purified, isotyped, and epitope mapped with peptide microarrays. all monoclonals and polyclonals underwent testing in immunodot blot, western blot, and elisa assays to assess their specificity. all monoclonal antibodies belonged to isotype igg1 kappa. peptide microarray mapping identified two likely epitopes, which could not be confirmed using synthetic peptides of the identified amino acid sequence. all four mabs detected the 53 pneumococcal serotypes tested in the immunodot blot and only reacted with streptococcus pseudopneumoniae in cross-reactivity studies by western blot. the polyclonal antisera also recognized all tested pneumococcal serotypes and cross-reacted with s. pseudopneumoniae and streptococcus oralis by  western blot. the mabs cross-reacted with s. pseudopneumoniae in the elisa. both  polyclonal antisera cross-reacted with all isolates tested in the elisa. these antisera should be suitable to establish a diagnostic elisa platform for pneumococcal antigen detection with polyclonal antisera as the capture antibody.  the specificity of the four mabs appears to be high as they only recognized s. pneumoniae and s. pseudopneumoniae. however, further testing of closely related streptococcal species is necessary to confirm this finding.

TI  == comparative transcriptomic analysis of streptococcus pseudopneumoniae with viridans group streptococci.
AB  == background: streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, is a novel member of the genus streptococcus, falling close to related members like s. pneumoniae, s. mitis, and s. oralis. its recent appearance has shed light on streptococcal infections, which has been unclear till recently. in this study, the transcriptome of s. pseudopneumoniae ccug 49455t was analyzed using the s. pneumoniae r6 microarray platform and compared with those of s. pneumoniae kctc 5080t, s. mitis kctc 3556t, and s. oralis kctc 13048t strains. results: comparative transcriptome analysis revealed the extent of genetic relatedness among the species, and implies that s. pseudopneumoniae is the most closely related to s. pneumoniae. a  total of 489, 444 and 470 genes were upregulated while 347, 484 and 443 were downregulated relative to s. pneumoniae in s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis and s.  mitis respectively. important findings were the up-regulation of tcs (two component systems) and transposase which were found to be specific to s. pseudopneumoniae. conclusions: this study provides insight to the current understanding of the genomic content of s. pseudopneumoniae. the comparative transcriptome analysis showed hierarchical clustering of expression data of s. pseudopneumoniae with s. pneumoniae and s. mitis with s. oralis. this proves that transcriptional profiling can facilitate in elucidating the genetic distance between closely related strains.

TI  == sequetyping: serotyping streptococcus pneumoniae by a single pcr sequencing strategy.
AB  == the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines necessitates continued monitoring of circulating strains to assess vaccine efficacy and replacement serotypes. conventional serological methods are costly, labor-intensive, and prone to misidentification, while current dna-based methods have limited serotype coverage requiring multiple pcr primers. in this study, a computer algorithm was  developed to interrogate the capsulation locus (cps) of vaccine serotypes to locate primer pairs in conserved regions that border variable regions and could differentiate between serotypes. in silico analysis of cps from 92 serotypes indicated that a primer pair spanning the regulatory gene cpsb could putatively amplify 84 serotypes and differentiate 46. this primer set was specific to streptococcus pneumoniae, with no amplification observed for other species, including s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. pseudopneumoniae. one hundred thirty-eight  pneumococcal strains covering 48 serotypes were tested. of 23 vaccine serotypes included in the study, most (19/22, 86%) were identified correctly at least to the serogroup level, including all of the 13-valent conjugate vaccine and other replacement serotypes. reproducibility was demonstrated by the correct sequetyping of different strains of a serotype. this novel sequence-based method  employing a single pcr primer pair is cost-effective and simple. furthermore, it  has the potential to identify new serotypes that may evolve in the future.

TI  == novel molecular method for identification of streptococcus pneumoniae applicable  to clinical microbiology and 16s rrna sequence-based microbiome studies.
AB  == the close phylogenetic relationship of the important pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae and several species of commensal streptococci, particularly streptococcus mitis and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and the recently demonstrated sharing of genes and phenotypic traits previously considered specific for s. pneumoniae hamper the exact identification of s. pneumoniae. based on sequence analysis of 16s rrna genes of a collection of 634 streptococcal strains, identified by multilocus sequence analysis, we detected a cytosine at position 203 present in all 440 strains of s. pneumoniae but replaced by an adenosine residue in all strains representing other species of mitis group streptococci. the s. pneumoniae-specific sequence signature could be demonstrated by sequence analysis or indirectly by restriction endonuclease digestion of a pcr amplicon covering the site. the s. pneumoniae-specific signature offers an inexpensive means for validation of the identity of clinical isolates and should  be used as an integrated marker in the annotation procedure employed in 16s rrna-based molecular studies of complex human microbiotas. this may avoid frequent misidentifications such as those we demonstrate to have occurred in previous reports and in reference sequence databases.

TI  == streptococcus pseudopneumoniae identification by pherotype: a method to assist understanding of a potentially emerging or overlooked pathogen.
AB  == the recent identification of streptococcus pseudopneumoniae (pseudopneumococcus)  has complicated classification schemes within members of the "mitis" streptococcal group. accurate differentiation of this species is necessary for understanding its disease potential and identification in clinical settings. this work described the use of the competence-stimulatory peptide comc sequence for identification of s. pseudopneumoniae. comc sequences from clinical sources were  determined for 17 strains of s. pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus oralis. an additional 58 comc sequences from a range of sources were included to understand the diversity and suitability of this protein as a diagnostic marker for species identification. we identified three pherotypes for  this species, delineated csp6.1 (10/14, 79%), csp6.3 (3/14, 21%), and sk674 (1/14, 7%). pseudopneumococcal comc sequences formed a discrete cluster within those of other oral streptococci. this suggests that the comc sequence could be used to identify s. pseudopneumoniae, thus simplifying the study of the pathogenic potential of this organism. to avoid confusion between pneumococcal and pseudopneumococcal pherotypes, we have renamed the competence pherotype csp6.1, formerly reported as an "atypical" pneumococcus, cspps1 to reflect its occurrence in s. pseudopneumoniae.

TI  == evaluation of several biochemical and molecular techniques for identification of  streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and their detection in respiratory samples.
AB  == the identification and detection of mitis group streptococci, which contain streptococcus pneumoniae, have been hampered by the lack of sensitive and specific assays. in this study, we evaluated several biochemical and molecular assays for the identification of s. pneumoniae and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and their distinction from other mitis group streptococci using a collection of 54 isolates obtained by the routine culturing of 53 respiratory specimens from patients with community-acquired pneumonia. the combined results of the biochemical and molecular assays indicated the presence of 23 s. pneumoniae, 2 s. pseudopneumoniae, and 29 other mitis group streptococcal isolates. the tube bile  solubility test that is considered gold standard for the identification of s. pneumoniae showed concordant results with optochin susceptibility testing (co(2)  atmosphere) and a real-time multiplex pcr assay targeting the spn9802 fragment and the autolysin gene. optochin susceptibility testing upon incubation in an o(2) atmosphere, bile solubility testing by oxgall disk, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, and sequence analysis of  the tuf and rpob genes resulted in several false-positive, false-negative, or inconclusive results. the s. pseudopneumoniae isolates could be identified only by molecular assays, and the multiplex real-time pcr assay was concluded to be most convenient for the identification of s. pneumoniae and s. pseudopneumoniae isolates. using this method, s. pneumoniae and s. pseudopneumoniae dna could be detected in the respiratory samples from which they were isolated and in an additional 11 samples from which only other streptococci were isolated.

TI  == accuracy of using the lyta gene to distinguish streptococcus pneumoniae from related species.
AB  == the need for a microbial identification of streptococcus pneumoniae independent of culture methods has resulted in the introduction of other laboratory principles. the verification of a proper and exclusive gene for the detection of  the pneumococcus by nucleic acid-based tests is, however, still unresolved. a previously published lyta-gene-specific real-time pcr method was applied to a panel of bacterial strains to clarify the analytical sensitivity and specificity  of a pcr assay targeting this gene. furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis of published lyta gene sequences was performed to look at gene sequence differences  and the theoretical match with the primers and probes. the lyta-gene-specific pcr detected 46/46 s. pneumoniae isolates. all 49 of the non-pneumococcal isolates tested negative, including 22 isolates from the mitis group streptococci. phylogenetic analysis of 94 sequences of the lyta gene from different strains of  s. pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae showed that 70/87 s. pneumoniae sequences constituted one cluster and a further six sequences were outside but adjacent to this cluster, all with a complete match with primers and probes. the remaining 11 s. pneumoniae strains could be placed in a different cluster, which also contained the five s. mitis and two s. pseudopneumoniae strains. all strains had no match with primers and probes. the s. pneumoniae strains in the second cluster were all characterized by being bile-insoluble, an  infrequent pneumococcal phenotype. routine laboratories can utilize the additional observation that pneumococci that were negative by the specific pcr also carried the phenotype of bile insolubility, thereby observing the incidence  of false-negative results produced by the pcr assay. the real-time pcr targeting  the lyta gene thus constitutes a sensitive and specific assay that distinguishes  s. pneumoniae from its close relatives in the mitis group.

TI  == development of a real-time pcr assay for the specific detection and identification of streptococcus pseudopneumoniae using the reca gene.
AB  == we sequenced the evolutionarily conserved genes 16s rrna, atpd, tuf, and reca from streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis. phylogenetic analysis revealed that reca provided good resolution between these species, including discrimination of the novel species s. pseudopneumoniae. by contrast, the more conserved 16s rrna, tuf  and atpd are not sufficiently discriminatory. therefore, reca sequences were used to develop a real-time pcr assay with a locked nucleic acid-mediated taqman probe for the specific detection and identification of s. pseudopneumoniae. the pcr assay showed excellent specificity and a detection limit of <10 genome copies for the detection and identification of s. pseudopneumoniae strains, which makes it a promising tool for molecular identification and epidemiological studies. in conclusion, this article describes for the first time a pcr assay for the specific identification of s. pseudopneumoniae.

TI  == rapid identification of noncapsulated streptococcus pneumoniae in nasopharyngeal  samples allowing detection of co-colonization and reevaluation of prevalence.
AB  == noncapsulated pneumococci are atypical streptococcus pneumoniae that lack a capsule and therefore do not react with any available antisera. these isolates, which are often referred as nontypeable pneumococci (ntpn), are difficult to identify as their differentiation from closely related species such as streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and other streptococcus of the mitis group is not  always straightforward. we developed a low-cost and easy assay to detect and quantify ntpn in primary samples (which may contain multiple species) obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs. the strategy is based on a multiplex polymerase chain  reaction targeting lyta, cpsa, alib-like orf2, and 16s rdna genes, plus a restriction fragment length polymorphism assay to differentiate typical from atypical lyta. the application of the proposed methodology to over 500 nasopharyngeal samples found that the prevalence of ntpn in colonization was 3-fold higher than that estimated by routine methods (from 2.9% to 8.6% in the study collection). the international clone norway(nt)st344 was the major clone identified.

TI  == misidentification of alpha-hemolytic streptococci by routine tests in clinical practice.
AB  == accurate species-level identification of viridans group streptococci (vgs) is very important for understanding of their pathogenicity and virulence. however, an extremely high level of the similarity between vgs, especially streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, often results in misidentification of these organisms, so there is an urgent need of novel approaches to species identification. a set of 50 randomly selected clinical isolates of alpha-hemolytic streptococci from upper respiratory tract were characterized by the routine phenotypic methods (alpha-hemolysis, colony morphology, gram stain and optochin susceptibility). modern proteomic and genetic approaches - the direct bacterial profiling (dbp) by means of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) technique and multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa) scheme (http://viridans.emlsa.net/) - were applied for the accurate species identification. after that all isolates were stored at -70 degrees c. later they  were re-inoculated, and a number of additional tests (bile solubility, latex agglutination by commercial "slidex(r) pneumo-kit" and repeated optochin test) were performed. a considerable discrepancy was discovered in the results of the different approaches. looking in the future, one could say that mlsa-like schemes based on the analysis of the nucleotide sequences of seven or more loci of the bacterial genome, appeared to be the most useful instrument in the vgs discrimination, in contrast to the numerous one-target identification schemes, which have been introduced into practice by now.

AB  == host- and phage-coded cell wall hydrolases have been used to fight streptococcus  pneumoniae growing as planktonic cells in vitro as well as in animal models. until now, however, the usefulness of these enzymes in biofilm-grown pneumococci  has gone untested. the antipneumococcal activity of different cell wall hydrolases produced by s. pneumoniae and a number of its phages was examined in an in vitro biofilm model. the major pneumococcal autolysin lyta, an n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, showed the greatest efficiency in disintegrating s. pneumoniae biofilms. the phage-encoded lysozymes cpl-1 and cpl-7 were also very efficient. biofilms formed by the close pneumococcal relatives streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and streptococcus oralis were also destroyed by the phage endolysins but not by the s. pneumoniae autolysin lyta. a  cooperative effect of lyta and cpl-1 in the disintegration of s. pneumoniae biofilms was recorded.

TI  == a specific polymerase chain reaction test for the identification of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == using an approach based on the comparison of arbitrary primer polymerase chain reaction (pcr) genomic profiles from oral streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae strains, we identified a 434-bp genomic fragment apparently specific for s. pneumoniae. from the nucleotidic sequence of this common fragment, a pair  of primers was designed and tested on a set of strains comprising the major streptococcus species. one species, s. anginosus, gave an amplification product of the same length as s. pneumoniae. sequence comparison of the s. anginosus and  s. pneumoniae amplicons revealed several variations which were used to define a new set of primers giving a 181-bp s. pneumoniae-specific fragment. the amplified fragment contains the 5' terminal part of a gene encoding a putative sugar-specific permease and an intergenic sequence. the pcr test was evaluated on 257 strains of invasive s. pneumoniae corresponding to clinical isolates and on 153 non-pneumoniae oral streptococci strains; in addition, 3 s. pseudopneumoniae  strains were tested. with these primers, an amplification product was only obtained with the s. pneumoniae strains. moreover, the test was successfully evaluated on 10 atypical s. pneumoniae strains related to pneumococcal diseases.  in this study, we therefore established the capacity of a simple pcr test to discriminate s. pneumoniae from other streptococci (including s. pseudopneumoniae), thus allowing rapid and accurate diagnosis.

TI  == development of amperometric magnetogenosensors coupled to asymmetric pcr for the  specific detection of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a disposable magnetogenosensor for the rapid, specific and sensitive detection of streptococcus pneumoniae is reported. the developed procedure involves the use of streptavidin-modified magnetic beads, a specific biotinylated capture probe that  hybridizes with a specific region of lyta, the gene encoding the pneumococcal major autolysin, and appropriate primers for asymmetric polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification. capture probes and amplicons specific for s. pneumoniae were selected by a careful analysis of all lyta alleles available. the selected primers amplify a 235-bp fragment of pneumococcal lyta. a detection limit (lod) of 5.1 nm was obtained for a 20-mer synthetic target dna without any amplification protocol, while the lod for the asymmetric pcr amplicon was 1.1 nm. a rsd value of 6.9% was obtained for measurements carried out with seven different genosensors for 1.1-nm apcr product. the strict specificity of the designed primers was demonstrated by apcr amplification of genomic dna prepared from different bacteria, including some closely related streptococci. direct asymmetric pcr (dapcr), using cells directly from broth cultures of s. pneumoniae, showed that dapcr products could be prepared with as few as 2 colony-forming units (cfu). furthermore, this methodology did not show any cross-reaction with closely related streptococci such as streptococcus mitis (or  streptococcus pseudopneumoniae) even when present in the culture at concentrations up to 10(5) times higher than that of s. pneumoniae. preliminary data for rapid detection of pneumococcus directly in clinical samples has shown that it is possible to discriminate between non-inoculated blood and urine samples and samples inoculated with only 10(3) cfu ml(-1) s. pneumoniae.

TI  == real-time pcr assays for the detection and quantification of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is the main etiologic agent of pneumonia worldwide. because the members of the viridans group streptococci share a high degree of dna sequence homologies, phenotypic and genotypic discriminations of s. pneumoniae from the viridans group are difficult. a quantitative real-time pcr assay targeting the capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis gene (cpsa) was developed as a species-specific detection tool for s. pneumoniae. the specificity was evaluated  using genomic dnas extracted from 135 oral cocci strains. twenty-seven s. pneumoniae strains tested positive, whereas 108 other strains including streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis did not show a specific signal. the linear regression of standard curves indicated high correlations between the log numbers of s. pneumoniae cells and the c(t) values (r(2)=0.99). the minimal limit of detection was 32 fg of purified genomic  dna, equivalent to 14 genomes of s. pneumoniae. this new real-time pcr method may be very useful as a rapid and specific tool for detecting and quantifying s. pneumoniae.

TI  == phenotypic and genomic characterization of pneumococcus-like streptococci isolated from hiv-seropositive patients.
AB  == accurate differentiation between pneumococci and other viridans streptococci is essential given their differences in clinical significance. however, classical phenotypic tests are often inconclusive, and many examples of atypical reactions  have been reported. in this study, we applied various phenotypic and genotypic methods to discriminate between a collection of 12 streptococci isolated from the upper respiratory tract of hiv-seropositive individuals in 1998 and 1999. conventional phenotypic characterization initially classified these streptococci  as streptococcus pneumoniae, as they were all sensitive to optochin and were all  bile soluble. however, they did not agglutinate with anti-pneumococcal capsular antibodies and were also far more resistant to antimicrobial agents than typeable pneumococci isolated in the same period. genotypic characterization of these isolates and control isolates by both multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa) and comparative genomic hybridization (cgh) showed that only a single isolate was genetically considered to be a true s. pneumoniae isolate, and that the remaining 11 non-typable isolates were indeed distinct from true pneumococci. of these, 10  most closely resembled a subgroup of streptococcus mitis isolates genetically, while one strain was identified as a streptococcus pseudopneumoniae isolate. cgh  also showed that a considerable part of the proposed pneumococcal core genome, including many of the known pneumococcal virulence factors, was conserved in the  non-typable isolates. sequencing of part of the 16s rrna gene and investigation for the presence of ply by pcr corroborated these results. in conclusion, our findings confirm the close relationship between streptococci of the mitis group,  and show that both mlsa and cgh enable pneumococci to be distinguished from other mitis group streptococci.

TI  == highly penicillin-resistant multidrug-resistant pneumococcus-like strains colonizing children in oeiras, portugal: genomic characteristics and implications for surveillance.
AB  == while performing surveillance studies in oeiras, portugal, designed to describe the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on colonization, we observed an increase from 0.7% in 2003 to 5% in 2006 in the prevalence of penicillin resistance (mic of 2 to 6 mg/liter) among presumptively identified pneumococcal isolates. although 15 of the 22 penicillin-resistant isolates obtained in 2006 were optochin resistant, they were bile soluble and thus considered to be bona fide pneumococci. this study aimed to clarify the nature of these isolates by using a combination of phenotypic and genotypic approaches that included routine  strategies for pneumococcal identification, multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa),  and comparative genomic hybridization (cgh). by mlsa, all isolates were classified as "streptococci of the mitis group" that, however, were distinct from typical streptococcus pneumoniae or streptococcus mitis. a single isolate was identified as streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. cgh confirmed these findings and further indicated that a considerable part of the proposed pneumococcal core genome is conserved in these isolates, including several pneumococcal virulence genes (e.g., pava, spxb, cbpe, and cbpd). these results suggest that among pneumococci and closely related streptococci, universal unique phenotypic and genetic properties that could aid species identification are virtually impossible to define. in pneumococcal colonization studies, when atypical strains are found, mlsa and cgh are informative tools that can be used to complement routine tests.  in our study, after correct identification of the penicillin-resistant true pneumococci, we found that penicillin resistance levels among pneumococci remained stable from 2003 to 2006.

AB  == streptococcus oralis is a member of the normal human oral microbiota, capable of  opportunistic pathogenicity; like related oral streptococci, it exhibits appreciable phenotypic and genetic variation. a multilocus sequence typing (mlst) scheme for s. oralis was developed and the resultant data analysed to examine the population structure of the species. analysis of 113 isolates, confirmed as belonging to the s. oralis/mitis group by 16s rrna gene sequencing, characterized the population as highly diverse and undergoing inter- and intra-species recombination with a probable clonal complex structure. clonalframe analysis of these s. oralis isolates along with examples of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae grouped the named species  into distinct, coherent populations and did not support the clustering of s. pseudopneumoniae with s. mitis as reported previously using distance-based methods. analysis of the individual loci suggested that this discrepancy was due  to the possible hybrid nature of s. pseudopneumoniae. the data are available on the public mlst website (http://pubmlst.org/soralis/).

TI  == differentiation of streptococcus pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus [pnc]) is a causative agent of many infectious diseases, including pneumonia, septicemia, otitis media, and conjunctivitis. there have been documented conjunctivitis outbreaks in which nontypeable (nt), nonencapsulated pnc has been identified as the etiological agent. the use of mass spectrometry to comparatively and differentially analyze protein and peptide profiles of whole-cell microorganisms remains somewhat uncharted. in this report, we discuss a comparative proteomic analysis between nt s. pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak strains (cpnc) and other known typeable or  nt pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates (including pnc tigr4 and r6, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes) and nonstreptococcal isolates (including escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus) as controls. cpnc cells and controls were grown to mid-log phase, harvested, and subsequently treated with a 10% trifluoroacetic acid-sinapinic acid matrix mixture. protein and peptide fragments of the whole-cell bacterial isolate-matrix combinations ranging in size from 2 to 14 kda were evaluated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. additionally random forest analytical tools and dendrogramic representations (genesis) suggested similarities and clustered the isolates into distinct clonal groups, respectively. also, a peak list of protein and peptide masses was obtained and compared to a known pnc protein mass library, in which a peptide common and unique to cpnc isolates was tentatively identified. information gained from this  study will lead to the identification and validation of proteins that are commonly and exclusively expressed in cpnc strains which could potentially be used as a biomarker in the rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal conjunctivitis.

TI  == evolution of streptococcus pneumoniae and its close commensal relatives.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the mitis group of streptococci which, according to 16s rrna-sequence based phylogenetic reconstruction, includes 12 species. while other species of this group are considered prototypes of commensal bacteria, s. pneumoniae is among the most frequent microbial killers worldwide. population genetic analysis of 118 strains, supported by demonstration of a distinct cell wall carbohydrate structure and competence pheromone sequence signature, shows that s. pneumoniae is one of several hundred evolutionary lineages forming a cluster separate from streptococcus oralis and streptococcus infantis. the remaining lineages of this distinct cluster are commensals previously collectively referred to as streptococcus mitis and each represent separate species by traditional taxonomic standard. virulence genes including the operon for capsule polysaccharide synthesis and genes encoding iga1 protease, pneumolysin, and autolysin were randomly distributed among s. mitis lineages. estimates of the evolutionary age of the lineages, the identical location of remnants of virulence genes in the genomes of commensal strains, the pattern of genome reductions, and the proportion of unique genes and their origin support the model that the entire cluster of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, and s. mitis lineages evolved from pneumococcus-like bacteria presumably pathogenic to the common immediate ancestor of hominoids. during their adaptation to a commensal life style, most of the lineages gradually lost the majority of genes determining virulence and became genetically distinct due to sexual isolation in  their respective hosts.

TI  == characterization of a streptococcal cholesterol-dependent cytolysin with a lewis  y and b specific lectin domain.
AB  == the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs) are a large family of pore-forming toxins that often exhibit distinct structural changes that modify their pore-forming activity. a soluble platelet aggregation factor from streptococcus mitis (sm-hpaf) was characterized and shown to be a functional cdc with an amino-terminal fucose-binding lectin domain. sm-hpaf, or lectinolysin (lly) as renamed herein, is most closely related to cdcs from streptococcus intermedius (ily) and streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumolysin or ply). the lly gene was identified in strains of s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. lly induces pore-dependent changes in the light scattering properties of the platelets that mimic those induced by platelet aggregation but  does not induce platelet aggregation. lly monomers form the typical large homooligomeric membrane pore complex observed for the cdcs. the pore-forming activity of lly on platelets is modulated by the amino-terminal lectin domain, a  structure that is not present in other cdcs. glycan microarray analysis showed the lectin domain is specific for difucosylated glycans within lewis b (le (b)) and lewis y (le (y)) antigens. the glycan-binding site is occluded in the soluble monomer of lly but is apparently exposed after cell binding, since it significantly increases lly pore-forming activity in a glycan-dependent manner. hence, lly represents a new class of cdc whose pore-forming mechanism is modulated by a glycan-binding domain.

TI  == toward a quantitative dna-based definition of pneumococcal pneumonia: a comparison of streptococcus pneumoniae target genes, with special reference to the spn9802 fragment.
AB  == the current shift from phenotypically toward genotypically based microbial diagnosis is not unproblematic. a novel quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay based on the spn9802 dna fragment was therefore developed for detection of streptococcus pneumoniae. out of 44 bacterial species, only s. pneumoniae and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae were positive in spn9802 pcr. in an evaluation on nasopharyngeal aspirates from 166 patients with community-acquired  pneumonia, the assay was positive in 49 of 50 culture-positive cases. of 19 culture-negative but spn9802 pcr-positive cases, 12 were confirmed as s. pneumoniae by rnpb sequence analysis. with an expanded reference standard, including culture and rnpb sequencing, spn9802 had a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 98%. a cutoff for clinically significant positivity was 10(4) dna  copies/ml, giving 71% sensitivity and 100% specificity. in conclusion, spn9802 real-time pcr is highly sensitive and specific. the quantification it provides enables differentiation between pneumococcal pathogenicity and commensalism.

TI  == evaluation and improvement of real-time pcr assays targeting lyta, ply, and psaa  genes for detection of pneumococcal dna.
AB  == the accurate diagnosis of pneumococcal disease has frequently been hampered not only by the difficulties in obtaining isolates of the organism from patient specimens but also by the misidentification of pneumococcus-like viridans group streptococci (p-lvs) as streptococcus pneumoniae. this is especially critical when the specimen comes from the respiratory tract. in this study, three novel real-time pcr assays designed for the detection of specific sequence regions of the lyta, ply, and psaa genes were developed (lyta-cdc, ply-cdc, and psaa, respectively). these assays showed high sensitivity (<10 copies for lyta-cdc and  ply-cdc and an approximately twofold less sensitivity for psaa). two additional real-time pcr assays for lyta and ply described previously for pneumococcal dna detection were also evaluated. a panel of isolates consisting of 67 s. pneumoniae isolates (44 different serotypes and 3 nonencapsulated s. pneumoniae isolates from conjunctivitis outbreaks) and 104 nonpneumococcal isolates was used. the 67  s. pneumoniae isolates were reactive in all five assays. the new real-time detection assays targeting the lyta and psaa genes were the most specific for the detection of isolates confirmed to be s. pneumoniae, with lyta-cdc showing the greatest specificity. both ply pcrs were positive for all isolates of s. pseudopneumoniae, along with 13 other isolates of other p-lvs isolates confirmed  to be non-s. pneumoniae by dna-dna reassociation. thus, the use of the ply gene for the detection of pneumococci can lead to false-positive reactions in the presence of p-lvs. the five assays were applied to 15 culture-positive cerebrospinal fluid specimens with 100% sensitivity; and serum and ear fluid specimens were also evaluated. both the lyta-cdc and psaa assays, particularly the lyta-cdc assay, have improved specificities compared with those of currently  available assays and should therefore be considered the assays of choice for the  detection of pneumococcal dna, particularly when upper respiratory p-lvs might be present in the clinical specimen.

TI  == molecular characterization of disease-associated streptococci of the mitis group  that are optochin susceptible.
AB  == eight optochin-susceptible (opt(s)) alpha-hemolytic (viridans) streptococcus isolates were characterized at the molecular level. these isolates showed phenotypic characteristics typical of both viridans streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae. comparison of the sequence of housekeeping genes from these isolates with those of s. pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae suggested that the opt(s) isolates corresponded to streptococci of the mitis group. besides, the opt(s) streptococci were negative by a gen-probe accuprobe pneumococcus test and hybridized with specific pneumococcal probes (lyta and ply) but also with ant, a gene not present in most s. pneumoniae strains. moreover, the isolates were insoluble in 1% sodium deoxycholate but completely dissolved in 0.1% deoxycholate. sequence analysis of  the lyta gene revealed that the opt(s) streptococci carried lyta alleles characteristic of those present in nonpneumococcal streptococci of the mitis group. the determination of the partial nucleotide sequence embracing the atp operon encoding the f(o)f(1) h(+)-atpase indicated that the optochin susceptibility of the isolates was due to the acquisition of atpc, atpa, and part of atpb from s. pneumoniae by horizontal gene transfer.

TI  == incidence and pathogenic effect of streptococcus pseudopneumoniae.
AB  == we evaluated the incidence of streptococcus pseudopneumoniae in clinical isolates by phenotypic methods and dna-dna hybridization. the pathogenic role of this organism was investigated with the mouse peritonitis/sepsis model. our results show a low incidence (1/120 pneumococcal isolates) and a potential pathogenic effect for s. pseudopneumoniae.

TI  == characteristic signatures of the lyta gene provide a basis for rapid and reliable diagnosis of streptococcus pneumoniae infections.
AB  == the nucleotide sequences of the lyta gene from 29 pneumococcal isolates of various serotypes and 22 additional streptococci of the mitis group (including two streptococcus pseudopneumoniae strains) have been compared and found to correspond to 19 typical (927-bp-long) and 20 atypical (921-bp-long) alleles. all the streptococcus pneumoniae strains harbored typical lyta alleles, whereas nonpneumococcal isolates belonging to the mitis group always carried atypical alleles. a sequence alignment showed that the main difference between typical and atypical lyta alleles resided in 102 nucleotide positions (including the 6 bp absent from atypical alleles). these nucleotides were perfectly conserved in all  the typical alleles studied, and the corresponding nucleotides of the atypical alleles were also perfectly conserved. the presence in these signatures of distinctive restriction sites (namely, snabi, xmni, and bsaai) allowed the development of a simple, reliable, and fast method that combines pcr amplification of the lyta gene, digestion with bsaai, and separation of the products by agarose gel electrophoresis. this assay allows the rapid and consistent identification of true s. pneumoniae strains and represents an improved diagnostic tool for the study of pneumococcal carriage.

TI  == characteristics of streptococcus pseudopneumoniae isolated from purulent sputum samples.
AB  == streptococcus pseudopneumoniae is a recently described streptococcus that is phenotypically and genetically distinct from streptococcus pneumoniae and other viridans streptococci. key characteristics of s. pseudopneumoniae are the absence of a pneumococcal capsule, insolubility in bile, resistance or indeterminate susceptibility to optochin when incubated in 5% co2 but susceptibility to optochin when incubated in ambient air, and a positive reaction with the accuprobe dna probe hybridization test. the clinical importance of this bacterium is currently unknown. we report the characteristics and associated clinical data  of 35 strains of s. pseudopneumoniae isolated from sputum samples from 33 patients. all isolates produced a positive result with the now s. pneumoniae antigen test (binax, inc.). no isolate was resistant to penicillin, but 60% were  resistant to erythromycin and 77% were resistant to tetracycline. all patients had lower respiratory tract symptoms, 79% had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), and 33% had chest radiographic infiltrates. compared with matched control patients who had streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from sputum, patients  with s. pseudopneumoniae infection were more likely to have a history of copd (odds ratio [or], 5.0; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.67 to 20.11) or exacerbation of copd (or, 6.5; 95% ci, 2.61 to 16.20). further research is needed to better characterize the epidemiology of s. pseudopneumoniae colonization and the role of s. pseudopneumoniae in copd and other diseases.

TI  == molecular characterization of pneumococci with efflux-mediated erythromycin resistance and identification of a novel mef gene subclass, mef(i).
AB  == the molecular genetics of macrolide resistance were analyzed in 49 clinical pneumococci (including an "atypical" bile-insoluble strain currently assigned to  the new species streptococcus pseudopneumoniae) with efflux-mediated erythromycin resistance (m phenotype). all test strains had the mef gene, identified as mef(a) in 30 isolates and mef(e) in 19 isolates (including the s. pseudopneumoniae strain) on the basis of pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. twenty-eight of the 30 mef(a) isolates shared a pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  (pfge) type corresponding to the england14-9 clone. of those isolates, 27 (20 belonging to serotype 14) yielded multilocus sequence type st9, and one isolate yielded a new sequence type. the remaining two mef(a) isolates had different pfge types and yielded an st9 type and a new sequence type. far greater heterogeneity  was displayed by the 19 mef(e) isolates, which fell into 11 pfge types, 12 serotypes (though not serotype 14), and 12 sequence types (including two new ones and an undetermined type for the s. pseudopneumoniae strain). in all mef(a) pneumococci, the mef element was a regular tn1207.1 transposon, whereas of the mef(e) isolates, 17 carried the mega element and 2 exhibited a previously unreported organization, with no pcr evidence of the other open reading frames of mega. the mef gene of these two isolates, which did not match with the mef(e) gene of the mega element (93.6% homology) and which exhibited comparable homology (91.4%) to the mef(a) gene of the tn1207.1 transposon, was identified as a novel  mef gene variant and was designated mef(i). while penicillin-nonsusceptible isolates (three resistant isolates and one intermediate isolate) were all mef(e)  strains, tetracycline resistance was also detected in three mef(a) isolates, due  to the tet(m) gene carried by a tn916-like transposon. a similar mechanism accounted for resistance in four of the five tetracycline-resistant isolates carrying mef(e), in three of which mega was inserted in the tn916-like transposon, giving rise to the composite element tn2009. in the fifth mef(e)-positive tetracycline-resistant isolate (the s. pseudopneumoniae strain),  tetracycline resistance was due to the presence of the tet(o) gene, apparently unlinked to mef(e).

TI  == accuracy of phenotypic and genotypic testing for identification of streptococcus  pneumoniae and description of streptococcus pseudopneumoniae sp. nov.
AB  == we have identified an unusual group of viridans group streptococci that resemble  streptococcus pneumoniae. dna-dna homology studies suggested that a subset of these isolates represent a novel species that may be included in the s. oralis-s. mitis group of viridans group streptococci. we suggest that this novel species be termed streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. a combination of phenotypic and genetic reactions allows its identification. s. pseudopneumoniae strains do not have pneumococcal capsules, are resistant to optochin (inhibition zones, less than 14  mm) when they are incubated under an atmosphere of increased co2 but are susceptible to optochin (inhibition zones, >14 mm) when they are incubated in ambient atmospheres, are not soluble in bile, and are positive by the genprobe accuprobe pneumococcus test. the bile solubility test is more specific than the optochin test for identification of s. pneumoniae. genetic tests for pneumolysin  (ply) and manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (soda) and identification tests with a commercial probe, accuprobe pneumococcus, do not discriminate between the new species and s. pneumoniae.
