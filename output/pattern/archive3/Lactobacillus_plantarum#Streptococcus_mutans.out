probiotic lactobacilli interfere with streptococcus mutans biofilm formation in vitro.
in clinical studies, probiotic bacteria have decreased the counts of salivary mutans streptococci (ms). we compared the effects of probiotic lactobacillus strains on the biofilm formation of streptococcus mutans. the bacterial strains used included four s. mutans strains (reference strains nctc 10449 and ingbritt and clinical isolates 2366 and 195) and probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum 299v, and l. reuteri strains pta 5289 and sd2112. the ability of ms to adhere and grow on a glass surface, reflecting biofilm formation, was studied in the presence of the lactobacilli (lb). the effect of lb culture supernatants on the viability of the ms was studied as well. all of the lb inhibited the biofilm formation of the clinical isolates of ms (p < 0.001). the biofilm formation of the reference strains of ms was also inhibited by the lb, but l. plantarum and l. reuteri pta 5289 showed a weaker inhibition when compared to l. reuteri sd2112 and l. rhamnosus gg. viable s. mutans cells could be detected in the biofilms and culture media only when the experiments were performed with the l. reuteri strains. the l. reuteri strains were less efficient in killing the ms also in the tests performed with the culture supernatants. the phs of the supernatants of l. reuteri were higher compared to those of l. rhamnosus gg and l. plantarum; p < 0.001. in conclusion, our results demonstrated that four commonly used probiotics interfered with s. mutans biofilm formation in vitro, and that the antimicrobial activity against s. mutans was ph-dependent.
growth inhibition of oral mutans streptococci and candida by commercial probiotic lactobacilli--an in vitro study.
background: probiotic bacteria are suggested to play a role in the maintenance of oral health. such health promoting bacteria are added to different commercial probiotic products. the aim of the study was to investigate the ability of a selection of lactobacilli strains, used in commercially available probiotic products, to inhibit growth of oral mutans streptococci and c. albicans in vitro. methods: eight probiotic lactobacilli strains were tested for growth inhibition on three reference strains and two clinical isolates of mutans streptococci as well as two reference strains and three clinical isolates of candida albicans with an agar overlay method. results: at concentrations ranging from 109 to 105 cfu/ml, all lactobacilli strains inhibited the growth of the mutans streptococci completely with the exception of l. acidophilus la5 that executed only a slight inhibition of some strains at concentrations corresponding to 107 and 105 cfu/ml. at the lowest cell concentration (103 cfu/ml), only l. plantarum 299v and l. plantarum 931 displayed a total growth inhibition while a slight inhibition was seen for all five mutans streptococci strains by l. rhamnosus lb21, l. paracasei f19, l. reuteri pta 5289 and l. reuteri atcc 55730. all the tested lactobacilli strains reduced candida growth but the effect was generally weaker than for mutans streptococci. the two l. plantarum strains and l. reuteri atcc 55730 displayed the strongest inhibition on candida albicans. no significant differences were observed between the reference strains and the clinical isolates. conclusion: the selected probiotic strains showed a significant but somewhat varying ability to inhibit growth of oral mutans streptococci and candida albicans in vitro.
characterization of oral lactobacilli as potential probiotics for oral health.
introduction: intestinal lactobacilli have been successfully used as probiotics to treat gastrointestinal disorders, but only limited data are available for the probiotic properties of oral lactobacilli to combat oral diseases. we aimed to characterize oral lactobacilli for their potential probiotic properties according to the international guidelines for the evaluation of probiotics, and to select potential probiotic strains for oral health. methods: the study included 67 salivary and subgingival lactobacilli of 10 species, isolated from healthy humans. all strains were identified using amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis, tested for antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens, tolerance of low ph and bile content. thereafter, the lysozyme tolerance and antibiotic susceptibility of 22 potential probiotic strains were assessed. results: the majority of strains suppressed the growth of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and streptococcus mutans, but none inhibited candida albicans. the lowest ph tolerated by lactobacilli following 4 h of incubation was ph 2.5, but none of the strains grew at this ph. all strains tolerated a high concentration of lysozyme (10 mg/ml) and half of the strains tolerated a high concentration of human bile [5% volume/volume (v/v)]. four lactobacillus plantarum and two lactobacillus oris strains expressed resistance to tetracycline and/or doxycycline. conclusions: strains of l. plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus rhamnosus expressed both high antimicrobial activity and high tolerance of environmental stress. the absence of transferable antibiotic-resistance genes in l. plantarum strains remains to be confirmed. these results suggest a potential for oral lactobacilli to be used as probiotics for oral health.
in vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.
lysozyme-protease-inorganic monovalent anion lysis of oral bacterial strains in buffers and stimulated whole saliva.
similar to streptococcus mutans, buffer suspensions of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, and fusobacterium nucleatum all undergo cell lysis when treated with the lysozyme-protease-inorganic monovalent anion antibacterial system. for lactobacillus species treated with lysozyme and proteases at phs of 4 and 5.3, lysis resulted when a lytic activating concentration of bicarbonate anion followed enzyme treatment. furthermore, synergistic lysis of these bacteria was noted when lysozyme-protease treatment was followed by bicarbonate anion used in combination with chloride or fluoride anions. noteworthy, the halides were not active in promoting lysis when used by themselves in the absence of bicarbonate. for f. nucleatum suspended at ph 6.9, lysis was dependent upon the ionic strength of the buffer and resulted when lysozyme-protease treatment of the organism was followed by 100 mmol/l bicarbonate activation. when lysozyme and proteases were omitted from the incubation mixtures and replaced by stimulated whole saliva, ph 5.3, lysis was observed only with l. plantarum and s. mutans, but not with l. casei. the latter could be lysed, however, if suspended in saliva which was diluted several-fold with distilled water. in experiments where lysozyme was selectively depleted from whole saliva by immunoadsorption affinity chromatography, the great majority of the lysis capability of the saliva for l. plantarum was lost, although a significant degree of lysis appeared to be due to salivary factors other than lysozyme. f. nucleatum was also found to lyse in saliva at neutral ph, suggesting that both gram-positive and gram-negative oral bacteria may be susceptible to this antibacterial system in vivo.
purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
