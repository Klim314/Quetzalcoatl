TI  == in vitro spectrum of pexiganan activity when tested against pathogens from diabetic foot infections and with selected resistance mechanisms.
AB  == pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid synthetic cationic peptide, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials as a topical antimicrobial agent for the treatment of mild infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers. bacterial isolates from the 2013 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program designated as pathogens from diabetic foot infections (dfi) and gram-negative and -positive pathogens from various infection types that harbored selected resistance mechanisms/phenotypes were tested against pexiganan in reference cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth. the mic50 and mic90 against all organisms tested from dfi were 16 and 32 mug/ml, respectively. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa mic values ranged from 8 to 16 mug/ml. pexiganan mic values among staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa] and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus [mssa]), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and enterococcus faecium ranged from 8 to 32 mug/ml. pexiganan activity was not adversely affected for members of the  family enterobacteriaceae or p. aeruginosa that produced beta-lactamases or resistance mechanisms to other commonly used antimicrobial agents. decreased susceptibility to vancomycin did not affect pexiganan activity against s. aureus  or e. faecium. enterococcus faecalis appears to be intrinsically less susceptible to pexiganan (mic, 32 to 256 mug/ml). the "all organism" mic90 of 32 mug/ml for pexiganan in this study was >250-fold below the pexiganan concentration in the cream/delivery vehicle being developed for topical use.

TI  == supporting the ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam enterobacteriaceae breakpoint determination using humanised in vivo exposures in a thigh model.
AB  == previous in vivo studies using a human-simulated regimen of ceftaroline/avibactam 600/600mg every 8h (q8h) showed activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-, ampc- and kpc-producing enterobacteriaceae with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) </= 1 mug/ml. here we sought to determine the efficacy of this human-simulated regimen against organisms with mics >/= 1 mug/ml to help determine a breakpoint value that would reliability predict efficacy in humans. in total, 31 isolates (1 escherichia coli, 9 klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 enterobacter cloacae, 1 citrobacter koseri, 2 serratia marcescens, 1 klebsiella oxytoca and 8 pseudomonas aeruginosa) with ceftaroline/avibactam mics of 1 to 16  mug/ml were tested in a murine immunocompromised thigh infection model; 15 isolates were also tested in an immunocompetent model. doses were given to simulate human free drug exposures of ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam 600/600 mg q8h over 24h as a 1-h infusion by targeting the ft>mic profile. efficacy was evaluated as the change in log10 cfu compared with 0-h controls after 24h. reductions in bacterial cfu in the neutropenic model were seen against a majority of isolates tested with mics </= 4 mug/ml, where ft>mic was >55%. more variable efficacy was seen in isolates with mics >/= 8 mug/ml, where ft>mic drops below 40%. overall activity was enhanced in the immunocompetent model. the humanised regimen of ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam 600/600 mg q8h as a 1-h infusion showed  predictable efficacy against isolates with various genotypic and phenotypic profiles and mics </= 4 mug/ml. these data provide valuable information to help determine a ceftaroline/avibactam breakpoint for enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == evaluation of the betalacta test, a rapid test detecting resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in clinical strains of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == for decades, third-generation cephalosporins (3gc) have been major drugs used to  treat infections due to enterobacteriaceae; growing resistance to these antibiotics makes the rapid detection of such resistance important. the betalacta test is a chromogenic test developed for detecting 3gc-resistant isolates from cultures on solid media within 15 min. a multicenter prospective study conducted  in 5 french and belgian hospitals evaluated the performance of this test on clinical isolates. based on antibiotic susceptibility testing, strains resistant  or intermediate to cefotaxime or ceftazidime were classified as 3gc resistant, and molecular characterization of this resistance was performed. the rates of 3gc resistance were 13.9% (332/2,387) globally, 9.4% in escherichia coli (132/1,403), 25.6% in klebsiella pneumoniae (84/328), 30.3% in species naturally producing inducible ampc beta-lactamases (109/360), and 5.6% in klebsiella oxytoca and citrobacter koseri (7/124). the sensitivities and specificities of the betalacta  test were, respectively, 87.7% and 99.6% overall, 96% and 100% for e. coli and k. pneumoniae, and 67.4% and 99.6% for species naturally producing inducible ampc beta-lactamase. false-negative results were mainly related to 3gc-resistant strains producing ampc beta-lactamase. interestingly, the test was positive for all 3gc-resistant extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolates (n = 241).  the positive predictive value was 97% and remained at >/=96% for prevalences of 3gc resistance ranging between 10 and 30%. the negative predictive values were 99% for e. coli and k. pneumoniae and 89% for the species producing inducible ampc beta-lactamase. in conclusion, the betalacta test was found to be easy to use and efficient for the prediction of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, particularly in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains.

TI  == iron induces bimodal population development by escherichia coli.
AB  == bacterial biofilm formation is a complex developmental process involving cellular differentiation and the formation of intricate 3d structures. here we demonstrate that exposure to ferric chloride triggers rugose biofilm formation by the uropathogenic escherichia coli strain uti89 and by enteric bacteria citrobacter koseri and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. two unique and separable cellular populations emerge in iron-triggered, rugose biofilms. bacteria at the air-biofilm interface express high levels of the biofilm regulator csgd, the cellulose activator adra, and the curli subunit operon csgbac. bacteria in the interior of rugose biofilms express low levels of csgd and undetectable levels of matrix components curli and cellulose. iron activation of rugose biofilms is linked to oxidative stress. superoxide generation, either through addition of phenazine methosulfate or by deletion of soda and sodb, stimulates rugose biofilm formation in the absence of high iron. additionally, overexpression of mn-superoxide dismutase, which can mitigate iron-derived reactive oxygen stress,  decreases biofilm formation in a wt strain upon iron exposure. not only does reactive oxygen stress promote rugose biofilm formation, but bacteria in the rugose biofilms display increased resistance to h(2)o(2) toxicity. altogether, we demonstrate that iron and superoxide stress trigger rugose biofilm formation in uti89. rugose biofilm development involves the elaboration of two distinct bacterial populations and increased resistance to oxidative stress.

TI  == mass spectrometry sequencing of transfer ribonucleic acids by the comparative analysis of rna digests (card) approach.
AB  == the comparative analysis of ribonucleic acid digests (card) approach for sequencing of transfer ribonucleic acids (trnas) is described. this method is enabled by the differential labeling of two trna populations. a set of reference  trnas, whose complete sequences including modifications are known, are labeled with (16)o during enzymatic digestion. the second (candidate) set of trnas, whose sequence information is desired, is labeled with (18)o. by combining the two digests, digestion products that share the same sequence between the reference and candidate will appear as doublets separated by 2 da. sequence or modification differences between the two will generate singlets that can be further characterized to identify how the candidate sequence differs from the reference.  using card, ca. 80% of the trnas from the bacterium citrobacter koseri can be sequenced using ribonuclease t1 with escherichia coli trnas as the reference. during these studies, we also discovered a sequence error for escherichia coli trna-thr1, and use this method to confirm the correct sequence for that trna.

TI  == intestinal enterobacteriaceae and escherichia coli populations in japanese adults demonstrated by the reverse transcription-quantitative pcr and the clone library  analyses.
AB  == a primer set specific for escherichia coli/shigella 16s rrna was developed and used for rt-qpcr analysis of fecal samples from 35 healthy adult volunteers in combination with the previously reported primer set specific for enterobacteriaceae. enterobacteriaceae and e. coli were present in the 29 out of  35 volunteers tested as intestinal commensals at the average population levels of 10(7.1+/-0.9) and 10(6.8+/-0.7)cellsg(-1) of stools (mean+/-standard deviation),  respectively. among the 7 volunteers, the significant deviation between the count of enterobacteriaceae and that of e. coli was observed, suggesting non-e. coli/shigella species were predominant in their enterobacteriaceae populations. the clone library analysis revealed that the non-e. coli/shigella populations included citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae/variicola and morganella morganii. these data suggested that the rt-qpcr method with the primer sets specific to both enterobacteriaceae and e. coli/shigella enabled the accurate enumeration of  intestinal e. coli populations and the other enterobacteriaceae species populations.

TI  == characterization of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in enterobacteriaceae clinical strains and characterization of the plasmids implicated in their diffusion.
AB  == a total of 788 clinical enterobacteriaceae were collected to describe the aminoglycoside-modifying genes (ame genes) and to characterize the plasmids that  carry these genes. among the 788 strains collected, 330 (41.8%) were aminoglycoside-resistant: 264 escherichia coli (80%), 33 proteus mirabilis (10%), 10 klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), six k. oxytoca (1.8%), five enterobacter cloacae (1.5%), three morganella morganii (0.9%), three providencia stuartii (0.9%), two  salmonella enterica (0.6%), and one each citrobacter freundii, c. koseri, proteus vulgaris, and shigella sonnei. the most affected aminoglycoside was streptomycin  (92.7%), followed by kanamycin (26.3%), gentamicin (18%), tobramycin (16.9%), netilmicin (3.6%), and amikacin (1.5%). the ame genes found were aph(3'')-ib (65.4%), ant(3'')-ia (37.5%), aph(3')-ia (13.9%), aac(3)-iia (12.4%), aac(6')-ib  (4.2%), ant(2'')-ia (3.6%), and aph(3')-iia (1.2%). thirty-four percent of the strains showed more than one enzyme. the most frequent association was ant(3'')-ia plus aph(3'')-ib (35 strains). from 66 selected ame genes, 24 were plasmid located: 12 aac(3)-iia, six aph(3')-ia, three ant(3'')-ia, two ant(2'')-ia, and one aac(6')-ib. these genes were located in plasmids belonging to incompatibility groups f, fia, fib, or hi2. in conclusion, the ame genes involved in aminoglycoside-clinical resistance were aac(3)-iia, aac(6')-ib, and ant(2'')-ia, genes that confer resistance to tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin.

TI  == method for comparative analysis of ribonucleic acids using isotope labeling and mass spectrometry.
AB  == here, we describe a method for the comparative analysis of ribonucleic acids (rnas). this method allows sequence or modification information from a previously uncharacterized rna to be obtained by direct comparison with a reference rna, whose sequence or modification information is known. this simple and rapid method is enabled by the differential labeling of two rna samples. one sample, the reference rna, is labeled with (16)o during enzymatic digestion. the second sample, the candidate or unknown rna, is labeled with (18)o. by combining the two digests, digestion products that share the same sequence or post-transcriptional  modification(s) between the reference and candidate will appear as doublets separated by 2 da. sequence or modification differences between the two will generate singlets that can be further characterized to identify how the candidate sequence differs from the reference. we illustrate the application of this approach for sequencing individual rnas and demonstrate how this method can be used to identify sequence-specific differences in rna modification. this comparative analysis of rna digests (card) approach is scalable to multiple candidate rnas using one or multiple reference rnas and is compatible with existing methods for quantitative analysis of rnas.

TI  == [investigation of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants in enterobacteriaceae: a multicenter study].
AB  == fluoroquinolones which are in use since 1986, are effective agents both against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. quinolones show bactericidal effect as  a result of inhibition of dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv enzymes. main quinolone resistance mechanisms are chromosomal mutations in these enzymes and decreased intracellular accumulation due to efflux pumps or decreased membrane uptake. recently a new quinolone resistance mechanism mediated by plasmids has been defined. these plasmids carry genes called as qnr. qnr genes do not cause quinolone resistance but they cause decreased quinolone susceptibility and lead to higher minimum inhibitory concentrations. currently there are qnra, qnrb, qnrc, qnrd and qnrs genes. this study was aimed to investigate the presence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants in enterobacteriaceae isolates collected from four different centers in turkey. a total of 647 isolates (387 from trabzon, black sea region; 82 from canakkale, trace region; 96 from ankara,  central anatolia region; 82 from tokat, black sea region) belonging to the enterobacteriaceae family collected between may-july 2009, were included in the study. presence of qnra, qnrb, qnrs and qnrc genes were investigated by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method and confirmed by gene sequencing. the results of the pcr amplification revealed that 2 isolates were positive for qnra, 12 isolates were positive for qnrb, 4 isolates were positive for qnrc and 10 isolates were positive for qnrs. however, the number of positive strains decreased with the use of gene sequencing, and this method led to the identification of qnra1 in two isolates [enterobacter cloacae (code. 796), salmonella group b (code. 491)], qnrb1 in two isolates [salmonella group b (code. 491), citrobacter freundii (code. 768)], qnrb6 in one isolate [escherichia coli (code. cc1800)], qnrb9 in one isolate [e.coli (code. cc1873)], qnrb24 in one isolate [citrobacter koseri (code. mp5200)], qnrb27 in one isolate [c.freundii (code. 842)], qnrs1 in two isolates [e.coli (code. cc1705), e.coli (code.159)] and qnrb2 in one isolate [e.coli (code. 843)]. one of the isolates that carried the qnr gene was ciprofloxacin-resistant and two isolates were nalidixic-acid resistant. transferable quinolone resistance due to the dissemination of qnr genes may have important impacts in terms of infection control and treatment problems. survey of plasmid mediated quinolone resistance will help to determine  the size of the issue and guide the measures that should be taken to avoid escalation of resistance and dissemination problem.

TI  == promiscuous cross-seeding between bacterial amyloids promotes interspecies biofilms.
AB  == amyloids are highly aggregated proteinaceous fibers historically associated with  neurodegenerative conditions including alzheimers, parkinsons, and prion-based encephalopathies. polymerization of amyloidogenic proteins into ordered fibers can be accelerated by preformed amyloid aggregates derived from the same protein  in a process called seeding. seeding of disease-associated amyloids and prions is highly specific and cross-seeding is usually limited or prevented. here we describe the first study on the cross-seeding potential of bacterial functional amyloids. curli are produced on the surface of many gram-negative bacteria where  they facilitate surface attachment and biofilm development. curli fibers are composed of the major subunit csga and the nucleator csgb, which templates csga into fibers. our results showed that curli subunit homologs from escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium lt2, and citrobacter koseri were able to cross-seed  in vitro. the polymerization of escherichia coli csga was also accelerated by fibers derived from a distant homolog in shewanella oneidensis that shares less than 30% identity in primary sequence. cross-seeding of curli proteins was also observed in mixed colony biofilms with e. coli and s. typhimurium. csga was secreted from e. coli csgb- mutants assembled into fibers on adjacent s. typhimurium that presented csgb on its surfaces. similarly, csga was secreted by  s. typhimurium csgb- mutants formed curli on csgb-presenting e. coli. this interspecies curli assembly enhanced bacterial attachment to agar surfaces and supported pellicle biofilm formation. collectively, this work suggests that the seeding specificity among curli homologs is relaxed and that heterogeneous curli  fibers can facilitate multispecies biofilm development.

TI  == antibiotic and heavy metal resistance in bacteria isolated from the eastern mediterranean sea coast.
AB  == in this study it aimed to determine the microbial diversity, level of antibiotic  resistance patterns and distribution of heavy metal resistance of bacterial isolates from the eastern mediterranean sea coast. the resistance of 255 gram-negative bacterial isolates to 16 different antibiotics and to 5 heavy metals was investigated. the most common strains isolated from all samples were citrobacter koseri (9.0%), escherichia coli (8.2%) and pantoea agglomerans (8.2%). our results revealed a high incidence of resistance to ampicillin (74.0%), streptomycin (70.0%) and cefazolin (48.3%). the multiple antibiotic resistance (mar) index ranged from 0.2 to 0.75. isolates showed tolerances to different concentrations of heavy metals. our results show that the eastern mediterranean sea coast has a significant proportion of antibiotic and heavy metal resistant pathogens, or opportunist gram-negative bacteria, and these bacteria may result in a potential public health hazard.

TI  == diversity of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae on hospital admission.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae have become  prevalent in both the hospital and the community. we describe the epidemiology of esbl-producing isolates and patient characteristics at hospital admission. data on clinical properties, medical history, previous hospitalizations, and previous  antibiotic treatments were collected. esbl genes (bla(ctx-m), bla(tem), and bla(shv)) were identified by polymerase chain reaction. one hundred and sixteen patients carried 122 esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae: 79 escherichia coli, 26 klebsiella pneumoniae, 16 enterobacter spp., and 1 citrobacter koseri. esbl-producing e. coli were associated with admission from home (odds ratio (or)  3.04, p = 0.02) and a history of recent urinary tract infection (or 3.38, p = 0.04), and exhibited a lower rate of antimicrobial resistance to aminoglycosides  (p </= 0.005) and co-trimoxazole (p = 0.003), whereas other esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae tended to be associated with a recent surgery (or 0.42, p = 0.057). although the ctx-m enzymes were more frequently found in e. coli (76%), they were also identified in other enterobacteriaceae (45%), suggesting penetration of ctx-m-type enzymes into both community- and hospital-acquired enterobacterial species.

TI  == molecular analysis of type 3 fimbrial genes from escherichia coli, klebsiella and citrobacter species.
AB  == background: catheter-associated urinary tract infection (cauti) is the most common nosocomial infection in the united states and is caused by a range of uropathogens. biofilm formation by uropathogens that cause cauti is often mediated by cell surface structures such as fimbriae. in this study, we characterised the genes encoding type 3 fimbriae from cauti strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter koseri and citrobacter freundii. results: phylogenetic analysis of the type 3 fimbrial genes (mrkabcd) from 39 strains revealed they clustered into five distinct clades (a-e) ranging from one to twenty-three members. the majority of sequences grouped in clade a, which was represented by the mrk gene cluster from the genome sequenced k. pneumoniae mgh78578. the e. coli and k. pneumoniae mrkabcd gene sequences clustered together in two distinct clades, supporting previous evidence for the occurrence of inter-genera lateral gene transfer. all of the strains examined caused type 3 fimbriae mediated agglutination of tannic acid treated human erythrocytes despite sequence variation in the mrkd-encoding adhesin gene.  type 3 fimbriae deletion mutants were constructed in 13 representative strains and were used to demonstrate a direct role for type 3 fimbriae in biofilm formation. conclusions: the expression of functional type 3 fimbriae is common to many gram-negative pathogens that cause cauti and is strongly associated with biofilm growth. our data provides additional evidence for the spread of type 3 fimbrial genes by lateral gene transfer. further work is now required to substantiate the clade structure reported here by examining more strains as well  as other bacterial genera that make type 3 fimbriae and cause cauti.

TI  == chromosomally encoded blacmy-2 located on a novel sxt/r391-related integrating conjugative element in a proteus mirabilis clinical isolate.
AB  == integrating conjugative elements (ices) are mobile genetic elements that can transfer from the chromosome of a host to the chromosome of a new host through the process of excision, conjugation, and integration. although sxt/r391-related  ices, originally demonstrated in vibrio cholerae o139 isolates, have become prevalent among v. cholerae isolates in asia, the prevalence of the ices among gram-negative bacteria other than vibrio spp. remains unknown. in addition, sxt/r391-related ices carrying genes conferring resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins have never been described. here we carried out a genetic analysis  of a cefoxitin-resistant proteus mirabilis clinical isolate, tum4660, which revealed the presence of a novel sxt/r391-related ice, icepmijpn1. icepmijpn1 had a core genetic structure showing high similarity to that of r391 and carried xis  and int genes completely identical to those of r391, while an is10-mediated composite transposon carrying bla(cmy-2) was integrated into the ice. a nucleotide sequence identical to the 3' part of isecp1 was located upstream of the bla(cmy-2) gene, and other genes observed around bla(cmy-2) in earlier studies were also present. furthermore, the nucleotide sequences of hot spot 2 and hot spot 4 in icepmijpn1 showed high similarity to that of hot spot 2 in sxt(mo10) and with a part of the nucleotide sequence found in p. mirabilis atcc 29906, respectively. icepmijpn1 was successfully transferred to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and citrobacter koseri in conjugation experiments. these observations suggest that ices may contribute to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes among clinically relevant enterobacteriaceae, which warrants careful observation of the prevalence of ices, including sxt/r391-related ices.

TI  == genetic structure and distribution of the colibactin genomic island among members of the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == a genomic island encoding the biosynthesis and secretion pathway of putative hybrid nonribosomal peptide-polyketide colibactin has been recently described in  escherichia coli. colibactin acts as a cyclomodulin and blocks the eukaryotic cell cycle. the origin and prevalence of the colibactin island among enterobacteria are unknown. we therefore screened 1,565 isolates of different genera and species related to the enterobacteriaceae by pcr for the presence of this dna element. the island was detected not only in e. coli but also in klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and citrobacter koseri isolates. it was highly conserved among these species and was always associated with the yersiniabactin determinant. structural variations between individual strains were only observed in an intergenic region containing variable numbers of tandem repeats. in e. coli, the colibactin island was usually restricted to isolates of  phylogenetic group b2 and inserted at the asnw trna locus. interestingly, in k. pneumoniae, e. aerogenes, c. koseri, and three e. coli strains of phylogenetic group b1, the functional colibactin determinant was associated with a genetic element similar to the integrative and conjugative elements iceec1 and icekp1 and to several enterobacterial plasmids. different asn trna genes served as chromosomal insertion sites of the ice-associated colibactin determinant: asnu in the three e. coli strains of ecor group b1, and different asn trna loci in k. pneumoniae. the detection of the colibactin genes associated with an ice-like element in several enterobacteria provides new insights into the spread of this gene cluster and its putative mode of transfer. our results shed light on the mechanisms of genetic exchange between members of the family enterobacteriaceae.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of meropenem (mepm) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 876 strains of gram-positive bacteria, 1764 strains  of gram-negative bacteria, and 198 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2006 was measured. the results were as follows; 1. mepm was more active than the other carbapenem antibiotics tested against gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and haemophilus influenzae. mepm was also active against most of the species tested in gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. 2. as for pseudomonas aeruginosa, all of the mepm-resistant strains were resistant to imipenem (ipm). mepm showed low cross-resistant rate both againt ipm-resistant p. aeruginosa (41.8%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant p. aeruginosa (33.3%). 3. the proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains was 4.3% (6 strains) in escherichia coli, 1.1% (1 strain) in citrobacter freundii, 21.7% (5 strains) in citrobacter koseri, 3.1% (4 strains) in klebsiella pneumoniae, 3.3% (3 strains) in enterobacter cloacae, 0.8% (1 strain) in serratia marcescens, and 4.9% (2 strains) in providencia spp. the proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 3.1% (10 strains) in p. aeruginosa. 4. of all species tested, there were no species, which mic90 of mepm was more than 4-fold higher than those in our previous study. therefore, there is almost no significant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. in conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that mepm retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem at present, 11 years after available for commercial use.

TI  == identification of type 3 fimbriae in uropathogenic escherichia coli reveals a role in biofilm formation.
AB  == catheter-associated urinary tract infection (cauti) is the most common nosocomial infection in the united states. uropathogenic escherichia coli (upec), the most common cause of cauti, can form biofilms on indwelling catheters. here, we identify and characterize novel factors that affect biofilm formation by upec strains that cause cauti. sixty-five cauti upec isolates were characterized for phenotypic markers of urovirulence, including agglutination and biofilm formation. one isolate, e. coli ms2027, was uniquely proficient at biofilm growth despite the absence of adhesins known to promote this phenotype. mini-tn5 mutagenesis of e. coli ms2027 identified several mutants with altered biofilm growth. mutants containing insertions in genes involved in o antigen synthesis (rmlc and manb) and capsule synthesis (kpsm) possessed enhanced biofilm phenotypes. three independent mutants deficient in biofilm growth contained an insertion in a gene locus homologous to the type 3 chaperone-usher class fimbrial genes of klebsiella pneumoniae. these type 3 fimbrial genes (mrkabcdf), which were located on a conjugative plasmid, were cloned from e. coli ms2027 and could  complement the biofilm-deficient transconjugants when reintroduced on a plasmid.  primers targeting the mrkb chaperone-encoding gene revealed its presence in cauti strains of citrobacter koseri, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca. all of these mrkb-positive strains caused type 3 fimbria-specific agglutination of tannic acid-treated red blood cells. this is the first description of type 3 fimbriae in e. coli, c. koseri, and c. freundii.  our data suggest that type 3 fimbriae may contribute to biofilm formation by different gram-negative nosocomial pathogens.

TI  == dry stress and survival time of enterobacter sakazakii and other enterobacteriaceae in dehydrated powdered infant formula.
AB  == powdered infant formula is not a sterile product, and opportunistic pathogens could multiply in the reconstituted product, resulting in neonatal infections. in this study, the generation of sublethally injured enterobacteriaceae during desiccation and their persistence in dehydrated powdered infant formula was assessed during a 2.5-year period. the study included 27 strains of enterobacter  sakazakii, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella enteritidis, citrobacter koseri, citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, escherichia vulneris, pantoea spp., klebsiella oxytoca, and klebsiella pneumoniae. the number of sublethally injured  cells generated during desiccation was lower for k. oxytoca, pantoea spp., salmonella enteritidis, and capsulated strains of e. sakazakii than for the other enterobacteriaceae. the enterobacteriaceae could be divided into three groups with respect to their long-term survival in the desiccated state. c. freundii, c. koseri, and e. cloacae were no longer recoverable after 6 months, and salmonella  enteritidis, k. pneumoniae, and e. coli could not be recovered after 15 months. pantoea spp., k. oxytoca, and e. vulneris persisted over 2 years, and some capsulated strains of e. sakazakii were still recoverable after 2.5 years.

TI  == biochemical analysis of tem-134, a new tem-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase  variant produced in a citrobacter koseri clinical isolate from an italian hospital.
AB  == objectives: kinetic characterization of tem-134, a new tem-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase variant isolated from citrobacter koseri during an italian nationwide survey. tem-134 is a natural derivative of tem-2 with the following substitutions: e104k, r164h and g238s. methods: recombinant tem-134 was purified  from escherichia coli hb101 (pmgp-134) by three chromatographic steps (cation-exchange chromatography, gel permeation and fast chromatofocusing). steady-state kinetic parameters (k(m) and k(cat)) were determined by measuring substrate hydrolysis under initial rate conditions using the hanes linearization  of the michaelis-menten equation. modelling was carried out using the software modeller (version 9.1). results: tem-134 hydrolysed with variable efficiency (k(cat)/k(m) ranging from 5 x 10(3) to 8.0 x 10(5) m(-1) . s(-1)) penicillins, narrow-spectrum cephalosporins, cefepime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam,  which appeared to be the best substrate. molecular modelling of the enzyme indicated that the r164h substitution may result in a compromised omega loop in tem-134 and this may be responsible for its narrower spectrum of activity. conclusions: kinetic data and molecular modelling suggested that r164h has a mild detrimental effect on the global activity of the enzyme.

TI  == chromosome-encoded narrow-spectrum ambler class a beta-lactamase gil-1 from citrobacter gillenii.
AB  == a novel beta-lactamase gene was cloned from the whole-cell dna of an enterobacterial citrobacter gillenii reference strain that displayed a weak narrow-spectrum beta-lactam-resistant phenotype and was expressed in escherichia  coli. it encoded a clavulanic acid-inhibited ambler class a beta-lactamase, gil-1, with a pi value of 7.5 and a molecular mass of ca. 29 kda. gil-1 had the highest percent amino acid sequence identity with tem-1 and shv-1, 77%, and 67%,  respectively, and only 46%, 31%, and 32% amino acid sequence identity with cko-1  (c. koseri), cdia1 (c. diversus), and sed-1 (c. sedlaki), respectively. the substrate profile of the purified gil-1 was similar to that of beta-lactamases tem-1 and shv-1. the blagil-1 gene was chromosomally located, as revealed by i-ceui experiments, and was constitutively expressed at a low level in c. gillenii. no gene homologous to the regulatory ampr genes of chromosomal class c  beta-lactamases was found upstream of the blagil-1 gene, which fits the noninducibility of beta-lactamase expression in c. gillenii. rapid amplification  of dna 5' ends analysis of the promoter region revealed putative promoter sequences that diverge from what has been identified as the consensus sequence in e. coli. the blagil-1 gene was part of a 5.5-kb dna fragment bracketed by a 9-bp  duplication and inserted between the d-lactate dehydrogenase gene and the ydbh genes; this dna fragment was absent in other citrobacter species. this work further illustrates the heterogeneity of beta-lactamases in citrobacter spp., which may indicate that the variability of citrobacter species is greater than expected.

TI  == flip influences citrobacter koseri macrophage uptake, cytokine expression and brain abscess formation in the neonatal rat.
AB  == citrobacter koseri causes neonatal meningitis frequently complicated with multiple brain abscesses. during c. koseri central nervous system infection in the neonatal rat model, previous studies have documented many bacteria-filled macrophages within the neonatal rat brain and abscesses. previous studies have also shown that c. koseri is taken up by, survives phagolysosomal fusion and replicates in macrophages in vitro and in vivo. in this study, in order to elucidate genetic and cellular factors contributing to c. koseri persistence, a combinatory technique of differential fluorescence induction and transposon mutagenesis was employed to isolate c. koseri genes induced while inside macrophages. several banks of mutants were subjected to a series of enrichments to select for gfp : : transposon fusion into genes that are turned off in vitro but expressed when intracellular within macrophages. further screening identified several mutants attenuated in their recovery from macrophages compared with the wild-type. a mutation within an escherichia coli flip homologue caused significant attenuation in uptake and hypervirulence in vivo, resulting in death  within 24 h. furthermore, analysis of the immunoregulatory interleukin (il)-10/il-12 cytokine response during infection suggested that c. koseri flip expression may alter this response. a better understanding of the bacteria-macrophage interaction at the molecular level and its contribution to brain abscess formation will assist in developing preventative and therapeutic strategies.

AB  == aims: to investigate the potentials and limitations of fourier transform-infrared (ft-ir) microspectroscopy as a tool to identify, at the level of microcolonies, pathogenic bacteria frequently isolated in the clinical environment. methods and  results: a total of 1570 ft-ir spectra from 164 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients were recorded from 6 to 10-h old microcolonies of 50-150 microm size. a classification of 100% was obtained for the most frequent gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium at the species level. an average accuracy of about 80% was reached with gram negative bacteria from the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae families; enterobacter aerogenes,  enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella spp., and citrobacter koseri; and proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. results were comparable with ft-ir measurements on dried suspensions from 18-h cultures. conclusions: early identification of young microcolonies is feasible with ft-ir microscopy with a very high accuracy for gram-positive bacteria. some improvement in the transfer of microcolonies is  necessary to increase the accuracy for gram-negative bacteria. significance and impact of the study: combination of ft-ir microscopy and multivariate data analysis could be a complementary, rapid, and reliable tool for screening and discriminating, at species and subspecies level, micro-organisms of clinical, food-borne, or environmental origins.

AB  == a novel plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance gene, qnrb, has been discovered in  a plasmid encoding the ctx-m-15 beta-lactamase from a klebsiella pneumoniae strain isolated in south india. it has less than 40% amino acid identity with the original qnr (now qnra) gene or with the recently described qnrs but, like them,  codes for a protein belonging to the pentapeptide repeat family. strains with qnrb demonstrated low-level resistance to all quinolones tested. the gene has been cloned in an expression vector attaching a polyhistidine tag, which facilitated purification to >or=95% homogeneity. as little as 5 pm of qnrb-his6 protected purified dna gyrase against inhibition by 2 microg/ml (6 microm) ciprofloxacin. with a pcr assay qnrb has been detected in citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, and escherichia coli isolates from the united states, linked to shv-12 beta-lactamase and coding for a product differing in five amino  acids from the indian (now qnrb1) variety. the qnrb gene has been found near orf1005 in some, but not all, plasmids and in association with open reading frames matching known chromosomal genes, suggesting that it too was acquired by plasmids from an as-yet-unknown bacterial source.

(b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == indole can act as an extracellular signal to regulate biofilm formation of escherichia coli and other indole-producing bacteria.
AB  == we demonstrated previously that genetic inactivation of tryptophanase is responsible for a dramatic decrease in biofilm formation in the laboratory strain escherichia coli s17-1. in the present study, we tested whether the biochemical inhibition of tryptophanase, with the competitive inhibitor oxindolyl-l-alanine,  could affect polystyrene colonization by e. coli and other indole-producing bacteria. oxindolyl-l-alanine inhibits, in a dose-dependent manner, indole production and biofilm formation by strain s17-1 grown in luria-bertani (lb) medium. supplementation with indole at physiologically relevant concentrations restores biofilm formation by strain s17-1 in the presence of oxindolyl-l-alanine and by mutant strain e. coli 3714 (s17-1 tnaa::tn5) in lb medium. oxindolyl-l-alanine also inhibits the adherence of s17-1 cells to polystyrene for a 3-h incubation time, but mutant strain 3714 cells are unaffected. at 0.5 mg/ml, oxindolyl-l-alanine exhibits inhibitory activity against biofilm formation in lb  medium and in synthetic urine for several clinical isolates of e. coli, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter koseri, providencia stuartii, and morganella morganii but has no affect on indole-negative klebsiella pneumoniae strains. in conclusion, these data suggest that indole, produced by the action of tryptophanase, is involved in polystyrene colonization by several indole-producing bacterial species. indole may act as a signalling molecule to regulate the expression of adhesion and biofilm-promoting factors.

AB  == production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in enterobacteriaceae: identification of esbls based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. the phoenix esbl test (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of esbl-producing gram-negative bacteria. an algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid,  cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical  isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus  mirabilis, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, and citrobacter  koseri. of these isolates, 319 were identified as esbl producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-esbl producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. combined use of isoelectric focusing, pcr, and/or dna sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(tem-1)- and/or bla(shv-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(ctx-m) gene. among the 191 non-esbl-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an ampc-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed tem-1, tem-2, or shv-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all k. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced k1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. the phoenix esbl test system gave positive results for all the 319 esbl-producing isolates and also for two of the four k1-hyperproducing isolates of k. oxytoca. compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. these findings suggest that the phoenix esbl test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of  esbl resistance in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == identification of a chromosome-borne expanded-spectrum class a beta-lactamase from erwinia persicina.
AB  == from whole-cell dna of an enterobacterial erwinia persicina reference strain that displayed a penicillinase-related antibiotic-resistant phenotype, a beta-lactamase gene was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. it encoded a clavulanic-acid-inhibited ambler class a beta-lactamase, erp-1, with a pi value of 8.1 and a relative molecular mass of ca. 28 kda. erp-1 shared 45 to 50% amino  acid identity with the most closely related enzymes, the chromosomally encoded enzymes from citrobacter koseri, kluyvera ascorbata, kluyvera cryocrescens, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus vulgaris, proteus penneri, rahnella aquatilis, serratia fonticola, yersinia enterocolitica, and the plasmid-mediated enzymes ctx-m-8 and ctx-m-9. the substrate profile of the noninducible erp-1 was similar  to that of these beta-lactamases. erp-1 is the first extended-spectrum beta-lactamase from an enterobacterial species that is plant associated and plant pathogenic.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems.  thirty-two species 2,697 strains of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of  moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), escherichia coli (n = 250), citrobacter freundii (n = 153), citrobacter koseri (n = 97), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), serratia marcescens (n = 153), proteus mirabillis (n = 103), proteus vulgaris (n = 77), morganella morganii (n = 141), providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii; n = 154), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), pseudomonas putida (n = 49), burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), acinetobactor iwoffii (n = 30), bacteroides fragilis group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola; n = 124). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lowffii throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae  yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained  the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however,  the decrease in the antibacterial activity of czop against h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI  == betalasen: microdilution panel for identifying beta-lactamases present in isolates of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == a dried investigational use-only microdilution panel named betalasen (a short named derived from the panel's purpose, to identify beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae) containing 10 beta-lactam drugs with and without beta-lactamase inhibitors was developed to identify beta-lactamases among clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter koseri, citrobacter freundii group, enterobacter spp., and serratia marcescens. the mics obtained with a collection of 383 organisms containing well-characterized beta-lactamases were used to develop numeric codes and logic pathways for computerized analysis of results. the resultant logic pathways and betalasen panel were then used to test and identify beta-lactamases among 885 isolates of enterobacteriaceae recovered in cultures obtained at six different hospital laboratories across the united states. beta-lactamases present in 801 (90.5%) of the 885 isolates were identified by betalasen by using the existing logic pathways and codes or after minor modifications were made to the existing codes. the 84 strains that gave codes that betalasen could not identify were collected, reidentified, and retested by using betalasen. three strains had been  misidentified, 54 strains gave different codes upon repeat testing that could be  identified by betalasen, and 27 strains repeated new codes. the beta-lactamases in these strains were identified, and the new codes were added to the betalasen logic pathways. these results indicate that betalasen can identify clinically important beta-lactamases among most isolates of enterobacteriaceae. the results  also show that good quality control and attention to proper performance of the tests are essential to the correct performance of betalasen.

TI  == [antibiotic sensitivity of enterobacteria in intensive care units].
AB  == antibiotic therapy of intensive care patients is usually undocumented. the treatment is chosen according to epidemiologic and susceptibility data from microbiological laboratories. the aim of our study is to determine antibiotic susceptibility of enterobacteria isolated from intensive care patients during a five-month multicenter study in 18 french hospitals. numerous (n = 1,113) strains were studied: 447 enterobacteria isolated from urine (n = 229), blood cultures (n = 106), respiratory tract specimens (n = 72), peritoneal fluids (n = 22), pus (n  = 15) and catheters (n = 2). mics of group 2 and group 3 enterobacteria were determined using the dilution agar method and were interpreted according to the casfm (comite de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiology) recommendations. group 1 enterobacteria were most frequently isolated (67%). only one escherichia coli strain produced esbl (0.3%). among group 2 enterobacteria, one citrobacter koseri strain produced esbl. we did not isolate klebsiella pneumoniae esbl. isolation of group 3 enterobacteria was frequent (24%). thirty-five percent of group 3 enterobacteria were resistant to cefotaxime, 26% to ceftazidime and 16% to cefepime and cefpirome. fourteen strains of this group  produced esbl: 13 enterobacter aerogenes and one e. amnigenus.

TI  == enhancement of neonatal innate defense: effects of adding an n-terminal recombinant fragment of bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein on growth and tumor necrosis factor-inducing activity of gram-negative bacteria tested in neonatal cord blood ex vivo.
AB  == innate defense against microbial infection requires the action of neutrophils, which have cytoplasmic granules replete with antibiotic proteins and peptides. bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (bpi) is found in the primary granules of adult neutrophils, has a high affinity for lipopolysaccharides (or "endotoxins"), and exerts selective cytotoxic, antiendotoxic, and opsonic activity against gram-negative bacteria. we have previously reported that neutrophils derived from newborn cord blood are deficient in bpi (o. levy et al., pediatrics 104:1327-1333, 1999). the relative deficiency in bpi of newborns raised the possibility that supplementing the levels of bpi in plasma might enhance newborn antibacterial defense. here we determined the effects of addition of recombinant 21-kda n-terminal bpi fragment (rbpi(21)) on the growth and tumor  necrosis factor (tnf)-inducing activity of representative gram-negative clinical  isolates. bacteria were tested in citrated newborn cord blood or adult peripheral blood. bacterial viability was assessed by plating assay, and tnf-alpha release was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. whereas adult blood limited the growth of all isolates except klebsiella pneumoniae, cord blood also allowed  logarithmic growth of escherichia coli k1/r and citrobacter koseri. bacteria varied in their susceptibility to rbpi(21)'s bactericidal action: e. coli k1/r was relatively susceptible (50% inhibitory concentration [ic(50)], approximately  10 nm), c. koseri was intermediate (ic(50), approximately 1,000 nm), klebsiella pneumoniae was resistant (ic(50), approximately 10,000 nm), and enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens were highly resistant (ic(50), >10,000 nm). all isolates were potent inducers of tnf-alpha activity in both adult and newborn cord blood. in contrast to its variable antibacterial activity, rbpi(21) consistently inhibited the tnf-inducing activity of all strains tested (ic(50), 1 to 1,000 nm). the antibacterial effects of rbpi(21) were additive with those of a combination of conventional antibiotics typically used to treat bacteremic newborns (ampicillin and gentamicin). whereas ampicillin and gentamicin demonstrated little inhibition of bacterially induced tnf release, addition of rbpi(21) either alone or together with ampicillin and gentamicin profoundly inhibited release of this cytokine. thus, supplementing newborn cord blood with rbpi(21) potently inhibited the tnf-inducing activity of a variety of gram-negative bacterial clinical pathogens and, in some cases, enhanced bactericidal activity. these results suggest that administration of rbpi(21) may  be of clinical benefit to neonates suffering from gram-negative bacterial infection and/or endotoxemia.

TI  == the effects of plant phenolics, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and ferulic acid on arylamine n-acetyltransferase activities in human gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  == the possible effects of naturally occurring plant phenolics, caffeic acid (ca), chlorogenic acid (cga) and ferulic acid (fa) on arylamine n-acetyltransferase (nat) activities on human gastrointestinal microflora, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter koseri and pseudomonas aeruginosa, were examined. the bacterial nat activities were determined by hplc measuring the acetylation of 2-aminofluorene (2-af). among all examined bacteria, p. aeruginosa exerted the highest nat activity while c. koseri possessed the lowest nat activity. ca, cga and fa could suppress the bacterial nat activities dose-dependently both in the intact cell and cytosolic fraction analysis. according to the analysis of kinetic parameters in e. coli and p. aeruginosa, ca, cga and fa were shown to be potent noncompetitive inhibitors of bacterial nat activities. for the time course experiment, 4 mm of ca and fa could inhibit bacterial nat activities for at least 4 hour but 4 mm of cga could only significantly suppress nat activity in e. coli for the same reaction time. these  results strongly demonstrated that ca, cga and fa inhibited nat activities in human gastrointestinal bacteria.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against clinical isolates].
AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefodizime (cdzm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cdzm and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates collected from nation-wide medical institutions and in  our laboratory from september to december of 1992 and from september to december  of 1995. the results are summarized as follows: 1. bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cdzm included streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the  range of mic values of cdzm against klebsiella pneumoniae was spread. other strains, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., peptostreptococcus spp.  and bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to cephems including cdzm. 2. the mic90's of cdzm were 0.05 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against streptococcus  spp., h. influenzae, m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis, n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently  found in daily treatment of infections. it appears that the effectiveness of cdzm was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. among h. influenzae isolates included imipenem (ipm)-resistant and norfloxacin (nflx)-resistant strains. the mic-range of cdzm against strains collected in 1995 including ipm-resistant and nflx-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and mic90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. cdzm showed strong antimicrobial activities against h. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.

TI  == population analysis of susceptibility to cefotaxime in enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == population analysis of susceptibility to cefotaxime (ctx) in eight species of enterobacteriaceae was carried out. one strain of each species was examined. the  strains represented their individual species as regards natural susceptibility to ampicillin (a) and carbenicillin (ca). cephalothinase activity of the parental strains and strains selected on the plates with the highest concentration that allowed growth was determined by an ultraviolet assay. the populations of the a-susceptible/ca-susceptible (a-s/ca-s) species, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis were homogeneous as regards susceptibility to ctx. the a-resistant/ca-resistant (a-r/ca-r) species, klebsiella oxytoca and citrobacter koseri, were less homogeneous, but in all four mentioned species no increase in cephalothinase activity was observed between the parental strains and the strains selected in the population analysis. the four a-r/ca-s species, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii, were heterogeneous. the frequency of ctx-r mutants was approx. 10(-6.5). the ic50 for  ctx was 2(7.5)-2(8.5) times higher for the mutants than for the parental strains. the ctx resistance was maintained in subcultures of the strains. all four species had a very high increase in cephalothinase activity from parental strains to the  strains selected in the population analysis. only the enzyme of proteus vulgaris  was able to hydrolyze ctx.
