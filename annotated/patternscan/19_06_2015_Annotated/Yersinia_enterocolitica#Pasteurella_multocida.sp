TI  == microbiological identification and analysis of swine tonsils collected from carcasses at slaughter.
AB  == the primary objective of this 7-month study was to determine the prevalence of porcine pathogens of the tonsil of the soft palate of swine at slaughter. additional objectives were to determine if sampling the carcasses of normal or abnormal hogs provided different microbiological profiles and if the slaughter plant provides a feasible sampling frame and environment for detecting and monitoring important pathogens in tonsils that have health implications for both  swine and humans. a total of 395 samples were collected from 264 farms. of these, 180 tonsils were collected from normal carcasses and 215 tonsils were collected from carcasses that were diverted to the hold rail. laboratory testing included bacteriological culture and identification as well as real time-polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) testing for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (pprsv) and immunohistochemistry (ihc) for porcine circovirus-2 (pcv-2). the most commonly isolated bacteria included: streptococcus suis (53.7%), arcanobacterium  pyogenes (29.9%), pasteurella multocida (27.3%), and streptococcus porcinus (19.5%). virus screening revealed evidence of prrsv and pcv-2 in 22.0% and 11.9%  of the samples, respectively. salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica  were isolated in 0.5% and 1.8% of the samples, respectively. tonsils collected from the hold rail were more likely to be positive for staphylococcus hyicus [odds ratio (or) = 7.51, confidence interval (ci) = 2.89 to 19.54], streptococcus porcinus (or = 9.93, ci = 4.27 to 23.10), and streptococcus suis (or = 2.16, ci = 1.45 to 3.24). tonsils collected from abnormal carcasses were less likely to be positive for staphylococcus aureus (or = 0.05, ci = 0.005 to 0.482).

TI  == pasteurella, yersinia, and francisella
AB  == the genus pasteurella was originally proposed and described by trevisan in 1887.  it consisted of a group of nonmotile, small (0. 7 mum by 0. 5 mum), gram-negative coccobacilli often exhibiting a characteristic type of bipolar staining (fig. 29-1). most members of this genus are associated with severe, life-threatening systemic diseases involving both hemorrhagic pneumonia and septicemia. the first  pathogen to be studied (called at that time pasteurella septica) was shown to be  responsible for hemorrhagic septicemia in cattle and sheep, and fowl cholera in chickens. this organism, used by pasteur for his milestone vaccination studies in 1880, is now called pasteurella multocida. adult animals may carry this organism  as part of their normal nasopharyngeal or gingival microflora and may infect young, susceptible animals which develop a fulminating, rapidly lethal hemorrhagic pneumonia. the incubation period for this disease may be as short as  12 hours with very high mortality rates (80 to 100 percent). the disease can spread explosively through an apparently normal herd or flock. two other important pathogens were initially included in this genus. the first was pasteurella pestis (the plague bacillus), which was isolated and described almost simultaneously by kitasato and by yersin in 1894. this organism is primarily a pathogen of the rat (one of a select group of acute bacterial pathogens for this  host). for taxonomic reasons, it was decided in 1971 to place the plague bacillus in a new genus as yersinia pestis, together with y pseudotuberculosis and y enterocolitica. the latter infect a variety of rodent species but can cause severe intestinal disease in humans. finally, a third genus was created for an organism originally grouped with p pestis, but now known as francisella tularensis, the agent of tularemia in rodents and humans. the various diseases caused by these three genera, together with the vectors responsible for their spread to humans, are summarized in table 29-1. metabolically, these organisms are facultative anaerobes which grow best on nutrient media enriched with blood,  hematin, or catalase. most members show a restricted fermentative capacity. although they grow well when incubated at 37 degrees c, they can also multiply at room temperature, when some species produce putative virulence factors that help  to establish the pathogen within the tissues. vaccines are of limited value and aggressive treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is required to control human infections.

TI  == nucleoside analogues are activated by bacterial deoxyribonucleoside kinases in a  species-specific manner.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the bactericidal activity of antiviral and anticancer  nucleoside analogues against a variety of pathogenic bacteria and characterize the activating enzymes, deoxyribonucleoside kinases (dnks). methods: several fda-approved nucleoside analogue drugs were screened for their potential bactericidal activity against several clinical bacterial isolates and type strains. we identified and subcloned the genes coding for putative deoxyribonucleoside kinases in escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, salmonella enterica, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and listeria monocytogenes. these genes were tested for their ability to increase the susceptibility of a dnk-deficient e. coli strain to various analogues. we overexpressed, purified and characterized the substrate specificity and kinetic properties of the recombinant enzymes from s. enterica and b. cereus. results: the tested gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (azt) in the concentration range 0.032-31.6 microm except for a single e. coli isolate and two pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates which were resistant to the tested azt concentrations. purified recombinant s. enterica thymidine kinase phosphorylated azt efficiently with a km of 73.3 microm and k(cat)/km of 6.6 x 10(4) s(-1) m(-1) and is the activator of this drug in vivo. 2',2'-difluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (gemcitabine) was a potent antibiotic against gram-positive bacteria in the concentration range between 0.001 and 1.0 microm. the b. cereus deoxyadenosine kinase had a km for gemcitabine of 33.5 microm and k(cat)/km of 5.1 x 10(3) s(-1) m(-1) and activates gemcitabine in vivo. s. enterica and b. cereus are now amongst the first bacteria with a completely characterized set of dnk enzymes. conclusions: bacterial dnks efficiently activate nucleoside analogues in a species-specific manner. therefore, nucleoside analogues have a potential to be employed as antibiotics in the fight against emerging multiresistant bacteria.

TI  == use of polymerase chain reaction to identify brucella abortus strain rb51 among brucella field isolates from cattle in italy.
AB  == brucella abortus strain rb51, a rough mutant of the b. abortus 2308 virulent strain, was recently approved in the united states as the official vaccine for brucellosis in cattle. following recent evidence of unauthorized use of rb51 vaccine in italy, where the use of vaccines for brucellosis is no longer allowed, the suitability of an rb51-specific polymerase chain reaction assay for identifying the rb51 strain among brucella field isolates from cattle in italy was investigated. the oligonucleotide primers used in this study, belonging to a  six-primer cocktail for brucella species previously described by other authors, allowed the amplification of a 364-base pair (bp) fragment specific for rb51 and  its parent strain 2308, and a 498-bp product specific for b. abortus. in addition, unresolved bands ranging from 600 to 700 bp were observed from rb51 strain. brucella abortus biovars 1, 2 and 4 have only one specific sensitive 498-bp band. the b. abortus biovars 3, 5 and 6 did not give any signal. the 498-bp product from a reference brucella strain was sequenced and submitted to embl with the accession number aj271969 while the 364-bp fragment from rb51 strain was submitted to embl database with accession number aj271968. the sequence studies confirmed the specificity of the detected fragments. no amplification was obtained by testing dna from strains antigenically related to brucella, such as yersinia enterocolitica o:9, escherichia coli o:157, salmonella urbana and pasteurella multocida. the results of this study indicate that this technique, in combination with specific serological tests, could be a useful diagnostic method to verify the use of rb51 vaccine and can contribute to the creation of a databank of circulating strains.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of the new oral macrolide azithromycin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the new oral macrolide azithromycin was compared with that of erythromycin against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. ninety percent of hemolytic streptococci groups a and b, and  streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml. activity of azithromycin was similar to that of erythromycin; erythromycin-resistant staphylococci and streptococci were not inhibited. azithromycin was more active than erythromycin against haemophilus influenzae (mic90 1 microgram/ml) and neisseria gonorrhoeae. it inhibited campylobacter spp. and pasteurella multocida, and had an mic50 of 8 micrograms/ml for escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella spp. and yersinia enterocolitica compared to an erythromycin value of greater than 64 micrograms/ml.

TI  == [a personal view of the history of the genus yersinia].
AB  == the first recorded experience australia had of the genus yersinia was the arrival in 1889 of a french expedition led by pasteur's nephew, dr. adrien loir. at that  time australia was in the grips of an epidemic of rabbits, and loir's purpose was to eradicate the rabbits by means of fowl plague (pasteurella multocida). sadly,  bureaucratic and political obstacles prevailed, and loir was never granted permission to release his biological control agent. alexander yersin had been tempted to join loir's expedition, but elected in the end to travel to hong kong, where he discovered the plague bacillus. had he gone to australia, we might not now be speaking of the genus yersinia... historically, yersinia pestis has affected not only world history but literature as well. in shakespeare's romeo and juliet, the tragic denouement can be attributed directly to the consequences  of the great plague. in times of plague, cities closed their gates to travellers, and houses their doors and windows. thus laurence's explanatory letter was prevented from reaching romeo, who returned to take his life beside the drugged (but living) body of his beloved. not only was the contemporary literature from which shakespeare drew inspiration full of references to the plague, but he himself had experienced the social effects of the plague at first hand. the recent rejection of the name y. pseudotuberculosis var. pestis in favour of y. pestis is fitting, not simply on the grounds of preventing confusion - after all, y. pseudotuberculosis can be an equally lethal pathogen. however, a review of the epidemiology for y. pestis since the first pandemic in the 6th century ad lends support to devignat's hypothesis that y. pseudotuberculosis evolved from y. pestis, rather than vice versa. this probably occurred in europe shortly before the second pandemic, and the new mutant spread slowly through the european rodent population, immunising the carriers against plague. in other parts of the world which continued to be affected by plague, the rodent populations remained susceptible because they had not been immunised by exposure to y. pseudotuberculosis. in some areas which have not been affected by plague, it is also possible that the native rodent populations have been immunised by y. enterocolitica and its relatives. the plague, the first biological weapon, has killed more people than man's wars. it is our duty, as bacteriologists handling this pathogen, to refuse to allow our work to be used in modern warfare, to refuse to participate in any further warfare against humanity itself.

TI  == a numerical taxonomic study of actinobacillus, pasteurella and yersinia.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of actinobacillus, pasteurella and yersinia, with some allied bacteria, showed 23 reasonably distinct groups. these  fell into three major areas. area a contained species of actinobacillus and pasteurella: a. suis, a. equuli, a. lignieresii, p. haemolytica biovar a, p. haemolytica biovar t, p. multocida, a. actinomycetemcomitans, 'p. bettii', 'a. seminis', p. ureae and p. aerogenes. also included in a was a composite group of  pasteurella pneumotropica and p. gallinarum, together with unnamed groups referred to as 'blg', 'mair', 'ross' and 'aer-2'. area b contained species of yersinia: y. enterocolitica, y. pseudotuberculosis, y. pestis and a group 'ent-b' similar to y. enterocolitica. area c contained non-fermenting strains: y. philomiragia, moraxella anatipestifer and a miscellaneous group 'past-b'. there were also a small number of unnamed single strains.

TI  == effect of chlorination on antibiotic resistance profiles of sewage-related bacteria.
AB  == a total of 1,900 lactose-fermenting bacteria were isolated from raw sewage influent and chlorinated sewage effluent from a sewage treatment plant, as well as from chlorinated and neutralized dilute sewage, before and after a 24-h regrowth period in the laboratory. of these isolates, 84% were resistant to one or more antibiotics. chlorination of influent resulted in an increase in the proportion of bacteria resistant to ampicillin and cephalothin, the increase being most marked after regrowth occurred following chlorination. of the other nine antibiotics tested, chlorination resulted in an increased proportion of bacteria resistant to some, but a decrease in the proportion resistant to the remainder. multiple resistance was found for up to nine antibiotics, especially in regrowth populations. identification of about 5% of the isolates showed that the highest proportion of escherichia coli fell in untreated sewage. some rare and potentially pathogenic species were isolated from chlorinated and regrowth samples, including yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pestis, pasteurella multocida, and hafnia alvei. our results indicate that chlorination, while initially lowering the total number of bacteria in sewage, may substantially increase the proportions of antibiotic-resistant, potentially pathogenic organisms.

TI  == introduction and reisolation of selected gram-negative bacteria from fermented edible wastes.
AB  == a lactobacillus fermentation process, using edible food wastes, was tested for its ability to eliminate selected bacterial pathogens. this fermentation process  converts food wastes into a feed ingredient for animal consumption. six gram-negative bacterial pathogens of potential zoonotic importance were tested. these experimental organisms were: salmonella enteritidis serovar typhimurium, s  enteritidis serovar anatum, s cholerae-suis, yersinia enterocolitica, y pseudotuberculosis, and pasteurella multocida. each organism was introduced into  ground waste that had been previously inoculated with l acidophilus, and was mixed. this mixture was divided among 8 containers, and was incubated in duplicate at 5 c, 10 c, 20 c, and 30 c for 96 hours. the temperature of the reactant containers, reduction-oxidation potential, and ph were monitored. waste  samples were obtained initially and subsequently at 24-hour periods for 96 hours. qualitative and quantitative recovery attempts from each sample were made for the introduced gram-negative bacteria. pasteurella multocida and the s enteritidis serovars typhimurium and anatum survived the fermentation at 5 c and 10 c, but were killed after 48 hours at 20 c and 30 c. salmonella cholerae-suis survived at 5 c, but was destroyed by 72 hours at the remaining temperatures. yersinia enterocolitica was viable through 70 hours, but was killed by 96 hours. yersinia  pseudotuberculosis was not reisolated at any temperature.

TI  == common enterobacterial antigen in yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == production of the common enterobacterial antigen (ca) by strains of yersinia enterocolitica (y.e.) serotypes 3 and 9 (winblad), by strains of 5 different y.e. serogroups (wauters) and various other bacteria was examined. antibody against ca was raised by immunization of rabbits with e. coli o 14. extract prepared from s. typhimurium was used for the sensitization of sheep erythrocytes with ca. absorption and haemagglutination inhibition experiments showed that ca could be detected in heat extracts from all y.e. strains examined, and in that from yersinia pseudotuberculosis. ca was not detected in extracts from pasteurella multocida, francisella tularensis, brucella abortus, acinetobacter calcoaceticus  or pseudomonas aeruginosa. anti-ca antibodies could not be demonstrated in serum  from rabbits immunized with y.e. bacteria, but were demonstrated in serum from rabbits immunized with a ca-containing fraction of the y.e. extract. the possibility of participation of anti-ca antibody in indirect haemagglutination tests for detection of antibody to y.e. o antigens is emphasized.

TI  == [nitrofurantoin-test for the differentiation of bordetella bronchiseptica (author's transl)].
AB  == bordetella bronchiseptica is primarily resistant against nitrofurantoin (mic greater than 200 mug/ml), and this feature can be used for the differentiation of the organism from other gram-negative coccobacteria. nitrofurantoin paper disks (300 mug) failed to affect the growth of 150 strains of b. bronchiseptica isolated from different animal hosts, but they produced marked inhibition zones in the cultures of the followingspecies: pasteurella multocida, pasteurella pneumotropica, pasteurella haemolytica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, yersinia enterocolitica, francisella tularensis, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, brucella abortus, brucella melitensis, brucella suis and brucella neotomae.
