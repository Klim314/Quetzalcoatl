TI  - Antibiotic-resistant bacteria: prevalence in food and inactivation by food-compatible compounds and plant extracts.
AB  - Foodborne antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria such as Campylobacter jejuni,  Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, and Vibrio parahemolyticus can adversely affect animal and human health, but a better understanding of the factors involved in their pathogenesis is needed. To help meet this need, this overview surveys and interprets much of our current knowledge of antibiotic (multidrug)-resistant bacteria in the food chain and the implications for microbial food safety and animal and human health. Topics covered include the origin and prevalence of resistant bacteria in the food chain (dairy, meat, poultry, seafood, and herbal products, produce, and eggs), their inactivation by different classes of compounds and plant extracts and by the use of chlorine and physicochemical methods (heat, UV light, pulsed electric fields, and high pressure), the synergistic antimicrobial effects of combinations of natural antimicrobials with medicinal antibiotics, and mechanisms of antimicrobial activities and resistant effects. Possible areas for future research are suggested. Plant-derived and other safe natural antimicrobial compounds have the potential to control the prevalence of both susceptible and resistant pathogens in various environments. The collated information and suggested research will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of approaches that could be used to minimize the presence of resistant pathogens in animal feed and human food, thus reducing adverse effects, improving microbial food safety, and helping to prevent or treat animal and human infections.
TI  - Microbiological diversity and prevalence of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria in commercial fermented alcoholic beverages (beer, fruit wine, refined rice wine, and yakju).
AB  - The present study examined 469 commercially available fermented alcoholic beverages (FABs), including beer (draft, microbrewed, and pasteurized), fruit wine (grape and others), refined rice wine, and yakju (raw and pasteurized). Samples were screened for Escherichia coli and eight foodborne pathogens (Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Yersinia enterocolitica), and the aerobic plate count, lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria, fungi, and total coliforms were also enumerated. Microbrewed beer contained the highest number of microorganisms (average aerobic plate count, 3.5; lactic acid bacteria, 2.1; acetic acid bacteria, 2.0; and fungi, 3.6 log CFU/ml), followed by draft beer and yakju (P < 0.05), whereas the other FABs contained , 25 CFU/25 ml microorganisms. Unexpectedly, neither microbial diversity nor microbial count correlated with the alcohol content (4.7 to 14.1%) or pH (3.4 to 4.2) of the product. Despite the harsh conditions, coliforms (detected in 23.8% of microbrewed beer samples) and B. cereus (detected in all FABs) were present in some products. B. cereus was detected most frequently in microbrewed beer (54.8% of samples) and nonpasteurized yakju (50.0%), followed by pasteurized yakju (28.8%), refined rice wine (25.0%), other fruit wines (12.3%), grape wine (8.6%), draft beer (5.6%), and pasteurized beer (2.2%) (P < 0.05). The finding that spore-forming B. cereus and coliform bacteria can survive the harsh conditions present in alcoholic beverages should be taken into account (alongside traditional quality indicators such as the presence of lactic acid-producing bacteria, acetic acid-producing bacteria, or both) when developing manufacturing systems and methods to prolong the shelf life of high-quality FAB products. New strategic quality management plans for various FABs are needed.
TI  - Expert elicitation as a means to attribute 28 enteric pathogens to foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, and person-to-person transmission routes in Canada.
AB  - Enteric illness contributes to a significant burden of illness in Canada and globally. Understanding its sources is a critical step in identifying and preventing health risks. Expert elicitation is a powerful tool, used previously, to obtain information about enteric illness source attribution where information is difficult or expensive to obtain. Thirty-one experts estimated transmission of 28 pathogens via major transmission routes (foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, person-to-person, and other) at the point of consumption. The elicitation consisted of a (snowball) recruitment phase; administration of a pre-survey to collect background information, an introductory webinar, an elicitation survey, a 1-day discussion, survey readministration, and a feedback exercise, and surveys were administered online. Experts were prompted to quantify changes in contamination at the point of entry into the kitchen versus point of consumption. Estimates were combined via triangular probability distributions, and medians and 90% credible-interval estimates were produced. Transmission was attributed primarily to food for Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Trichinella spp., all three Vibrio spp. categories explored, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Multisource pathogens (e.g., transmitted commonly through both water and food) such as Campylobacter spp., four Escherichia coli categories, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., and Staphylococcus aureus were also estimated as mostly foodborne. Water was the primary pathway for Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp., and person-to-person transmission dominated for six enteric viruses and Shigella spp. Consideration of the point of attribution highlighted the importance of food handling and cross-contamination in the transmission pathway. This study provides source attribution estimates of enteric illness for Canada, considering all possible transmission routes. Further research is necessary to improve our understanding of poorly characterized pathogens such as sapovirus and E. coli subgroups in Canada.
TI  - Phenolic acids profile, antioxidant and antibacterial activity of chamomile, common yarrow and immortelle (Asteraceae).
AB  - Chamomile, common yarrow and immortelle ethanolic extracts were chemically analysed with respect to phenolics. Twelve phenolic acids were separated and identified by HPLC-DAD and the presence of rosmarinic acid was additionally confirmed by LC-MS. Five methods were applied for the evaluation of extracts' antioxidant properties (FRAP, DPPH, ABTS, chelating activity, Briggs-Rauscher reaction), while the antibacterial activity was tested against some of the major food-borne pathogens (Campylobacter coli, Escherichia coli, Salmonella Infantis, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus). Immortelle extract was the richest in phenolics with a dominant flavonoid fraction, while the other two extracts contained higher amount of non-flavonoids. The phenolic acid profile also varied; high concentration of rosmarinic acid was found in chamomile and common yarrow, while caffeic acid was dominant in immortelle. The best antioxidant properties were obtained for chamomile extract, while good antimicrobial activity, especially against Gram-positive bacterial species, was detected for immortelle. The obtained results could be used as a tool for chemotaxonomic classification of the investigated plants or for their potential application as natural antioxidants/antimicrobials.
TI  - Effects of climate change on the persistence and dispersal of foodborne bacterial pathogens in the outdoor environment: A review.
AB  - Abstract According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), warming of the climate system is unequivocal. Over the coming century, warming trends such as increased duration and frequency of heat waves and hot extremes are expected in some areas, as well as increased intensity of some storm systems. Climate-induced trends will impact the persistence and dispersal of foodborne pathogens in myriad ways, especially for environmentally ubiquitous and/or zoonotic microorganisms. Animal hosts of foodborne pathogens are also expected to be impacted by climate change through the introduction of increased physiological stress and, in some cases, altered geographic ranges and seasonality. This review article examines the effects of climatic factors, such as temperature, rainfall, drought and wind, on the environmental dispersal and persistence of bacterial foodborne pathogens, namely, Bacillus cereus, Brucella, Campylobacter, Clostridium, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio and Yersinia enterocolitica. These relationships are then used to predict how future climatic changes will impact the activity of these microorganisms in the outdoor environment and associated food safety issues. The development of predictive models that quantify these complex relationships will also be discussed, as well as the potential impacts of climate change on transmission of foodborne disease from animal hosts.
TI  - Prevalence and characterization of foodborne pathogens from Australian dairy farm environments.
AB  - The ability of foodborne pathogens to gain entry into food supply systems remains an ongoing concern. In dairy products, raw milk acts as a major vehicle for this transfer; however, the sources of pathogenic bacteria that contaminate raw milk are often not clear, and environmental sources of contamination or the animals themselves may contribute to the transfer. This survey examined the occurrence of 9 foodborne pathogens in raw milk and environments of 7 dairy farms (3 bovine, 3 caprine, and 1 ovine farm) in summer and autumn, in Victoria, Australia. A total of 120 samples were taken from sampling points common to dairy farms, including pasture, soil, feed, water sources, animal feces, raw milk, and milk filters. The prevalence of the Bacillus cereus group, Campylobacter, Clostridium perfringens, Cronobacter, Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli, Listeria, Salmonella, coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS), and Yersinia enterocolitica across the farms was investigated. The 2 most prevalent bacteria, which were detected on all farms, were the B. cereus group, isolated from 41% of samples, followed by Cl. perfringens, which was isolated from 38% of samples. The highest occurrence of any pathogen was the B. cereus group in soil, present in 93% of samples tested. Fecal samples showed the highest diversity of pathogens, containing 7 of the 9 pathogens tested. Salmonella was isolated from 1 bovine farm, although it was found in multiple samples on both visits. Out of the 14 occurrences where any pathogen was detected in milk filters, only 5 (36%) of the corresponding raw milk samples collected at the same time were positive for the same pathogen. All of the CPS were Staphylococcus aureus, and were found in raw milk or milk filter samples from 6 of the 7 farms, but not in other sample types. Pathogenic Listeria species were detected on 3 of the 7 farms, and included 4 L. ivanovii-positive samples, and 1 L. monocytogenes-positive water sample. Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli were identified in fecal samples from 3 of the 7 farms and in a single raw milk sample. Cronobacter species were identified on 4 of the 7 farms, predominantly in feed samples. No Y. enterocolitica was detected. Results of this study demonstrate high standards of pathogen safety across the 7 farms, with a low incidence of pathogens detected in raw milk samples. Monitoring feed contamination levels may help control the spread of bacterial species such as Cl. perfringens and B. cereus through the farm environment, which is a natural reservoir for these organisms.
TI  - Antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties of wines and winery byproducts in relation to their flavonoid content.
AB  - Grapes produce organic compounds that may be involved in the defense of the plants against invading phytopathogens. These metabolites include numerous phenolic compounds that are also active against human pathogens. Grapes are used to produce a variety of wines, grape juices, and raisins. Grape pomace, seeds, and skins, the remains of the grapes that are a byproduct of winemaking, also contain numerous bioactive compounds that differ from those found in grapes and wines. This overview surveys and interprets our present knowledge of the activities of wines and winery byproducts and some of their bioactive components against foodborne (Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus), medical (Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumoniae), and oral pathogenic bacteria, viruses (adeno, cytomegalo, hepatitis, noro, rota), fungi (Candida albicans, Botrytis cinerea), parasites (Eimeria tenella, Trichomonas vaginalis), and microbial toxins (ochratoxin A, Shiga toxin) in culture, in vivo, and in/on food (beef, chicken, frankfurters, hot dogs, lettuce, oysters, peppers, pork, sausages, soup, spinach) in relation to composition and sensory properties. Also covered are antimicrobial wine marinades, antioxidative and immunostimulating aspects, and adverse effects associated with wine consumption. The collated information and suggested research needs might facilitate and guide further studies needed to optimize the use of wines and byproducts to help improve microbial food safety and prevent or treat animal and human infections.
TI  - Development of 23 individual TaqMan(R) real-time PCR assays for identifying common foodborne pathogens using a single set of amplification conditions.
AB  - Most of the acute intestinal diseases are caused by foodborne pathogens with infants and elderly people being at major risk. The aim of this study was to develop a procedure to simultaneously detect 20 foodborne pathogens in complex alimentary matrices such as milk, cheese and meat. The list of targets include, among the others, Listeria spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Escherichia coli spp., Campylobacter spp., Clostridium spp. and Staphylococcus aureus. The accuracy of detection was determined by using ATCC strains as positive and negative controls. The achieved sensitivity of each of assays was 1 pg of genomic DNA, which was equivalent to approximately 1 cfu. The working ranges of the TaqMan((R)) Real-time PCR assays, when used quantitatively on cheese and meat samples inoculated with serial dilution of Listeria spp., Listeria monocytogenes, S. aureus, Salmonella enterica, Shigella boydii, E. coli O157:H7, Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Enterobacter sakazakii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 10(8) cfu/g to 10(4) cfu/g. No matrix interferences were observed.
TI  - Food-borne pathogens of animal origin-diagnosis, prevention, control and their zoonotic significance: a review.
AB  - The term food borne diseases or food-borne illnesses or more commonly food poisoning are used to denote gastrointestinal complications that occur following recent consumption of a particular food or drink. Millions of people suffer worldwide every year and the situation is quiet grave in developing nations creating social and economic strain. The food borne pathogens include various bacteria viz., Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus, Arcobacter, Clostridium perfringens, Cl. botulinum and Bacillus cereus and helminths viz., Taenia. They also include protozoa viz., Trichinella, Sarcocystis, Toxoplasma gondii and Cryptosporidium parvum. The zoonotic potential and the ability to elaborate toxins by many of the microbes causing fatal intoxication are sufficient to understand the seriousness of the situation. The viral agents being host specific their transmission to humans through food of animal origin is not yet confirmed although these animal viruses are similar to that of viruses infecting human. Food-borne bacteria; protozoa and helminthes have complex distribution pattern in the environment and inside the host system. This along with complexity of the maintenance chain and life cycle (of parasites) has made it difficult for epidemiologist and diagnostician to undertake any immediate safety measures against them. Serological and molecular diagnostic tests viz. ELISA, Latex agglutination test, Lateral flow assays, Immunomagnetic separation assays, molecular assays viz. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), multiplex PCR, immuno-PCR, Realtime PCR, Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR, DNA microarrays and probes are widely used. Along with these LAMP assays, Capillary Electrophoresis-Single Strand Confirmation polymorphism (CE-SSCP); Flow cytometry, FISH, Biosensors, Direct epifluorescent filter technique, nanotechnology based methods and sophisticated tools (ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging and chlonangio-pancreatography) have aided in the diagnosis greatly. Most of the food-borne illnesses are self-limiting but in many instances antibiotics are recommended. With the increased drug resistance however use of chicken immunoglobulin, bacteriophage therapy, probiotics and herbs are gaining much importance these days. Adoption of proper prevention and control measures (including cooking procedures; hygiene, strict adherence to HACCP principles, public awareness and disease surveillance and monitoring) are the need of hour. All these have been discussed vividly in this review to help epidemiologists, diagnosticians, clinicians and above all common people so as to enable them avoid negligence regarding such serious issue.
TI  - [Diagnosis and control of human food poisoning outbreaks].
AB  - Medical microbiology laboratories play a key role in the investigation of foodborne disease outbreaks. Bacterial pathogens (Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, etc) have historically been implicated in foodborne illness, while the role of viruses (especially Norovirus) appears to have been underestimated. Culture-based diagnosis has gradually been complemented, or replaced, by rapid molecular methods applied directly to biological samples. These new tools should help to reduce the number of outbreaks in which the etiological agent goes unidentified, and to improve the exhaustiveness of notifications.
TI  - Pathogenic bacteria in Finnish bulk tank milk.
AB  - While the quality of raw cow milk in Finland is known for its high hygienic standard, with the national average total bacterial count being below 10(4) CFU/mL annually, the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria in Finnish raw milk is underreported. The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of Listeria monocytogenes, thermophilic Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., stx-positive Escherichia coli (STEC), coagulase-positive staphylococci, Yersinia spp., and Bacillus cereus group in raw cow milk samples collected from bulk tanks at 183 Finnish farms. Additionally, the hygienic quality of the milk was studied by determining the total bacterial and E. coli counts. L. monocytogenes was detected in 5.5% of the milk samples, with concentrations varying from <1 to 30 CFU/mL. Thermophilic Campylobacter spp. or Salmonella spp. were not detected in any of the samples. STEC with Shiga toxin-encoding stx2 was detected in 2.7% of the samples. Yersinia enterocolitica was detected in 7.7% of the samples; however, all isolates were negative for ail, suggesting that they were non-pathogenic. Coagulase-positive staphylococci were detected in 34.4% of the samples, with an average concentration of 25 CFU/mL in the positive samples. Members of the B. cereus group were detected in 20.8% of the samples, with an average concentration of 1 CFU/mL in the positive samples. No relationship was detected between E. coli or the total bacterial count and the presence of pathogenic bacteria, which suggests that pathogens can be present also in farms with excellent production hygiene. Although the concentration of pathogenic bacteria in fresh raw milk was mainly relatively low, it should be borne in mind that some of the pathogenic bacteria can survive and multiply at refrigeration temperatures and may cause a disease with a very low infectious dose. Thus, consumption of raw milk and related products poses a potential risk for food poisoning.
TI  - Rapid detection and respirometric profiling of aerobic bacteria on panels of selective media.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate high-throughput optical oxygen microrespirometry for selective  detection and predictive identification of aerobic bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using GreenLight probe, standard 384-well plates and time-resolved fluorescence reader, a representative panel of 16 partially selective media and 9 aerobic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella typhimurium and Listeria innocua) were analysed. For each medium, bacterial strain and dilution, growth profiles were recorded, from which calibrations, doubling/generation times and growth patterns in different media were determined. Analytical performance, selectivity and general usability of the method were assessed, and mixed bacterial cultures were analysed. CONCLUSION: The microrespirometry platform facilitates simple, real-time detection and predictive identification of aerobic bacteria by looking at the patterns of their growth and respiration in several media and determining their growth and doubling times. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The new screening method can be used for routine microbiological analysis and testing of aerobic bacterial cultures as well as complex food, environmental and clinical samples.
TI  - Prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in food samples associated with foodborne illness in Alberta, Canada from 2007 to 2010.
AB  - Consumption of foods containing Staphylococcus aureus can cause severe gastro-intestinal illness. Given the fact that over the past decade, Canada has seen increasing rates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) carriage and infection, the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and MRSA on foodborne illness in Alberta, Canada. Between January 2007 and December 2010, there were 693 food samples associated with foodborne investigations submitted to the Alberta Provincial Laboratory for Public Health (ProvLab). These foods were screened for: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, S. aureus, Aeromonas spp., Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella, Shigella spp., and Yersinia spp. S. aureus was identified in 10.5% (73/693) of samples, and of these, 59% (43/73) were co-contaminated with at least one other organism on the screening panel. The S. aureus positive samples included 29 meat, 20 prepared foods containing meat, 11 prepared foods not containing meat, 10 dairy, and three produce. Methicillin-resistance was not detected in any isolates tested. These findings indicate that the presence of S. aureus in food associated with foodborne investigations is a cause for concern, and although MRSA was not found, the potential for outbreaks exists, and ongoing surveillance should be sustained.
TI  - Hygienic quality and antibiotic resistance profile of sliced butchery.
AB  - In order to investigate the microbiological quality of different meat products on the Greek market, 200 samples were collected from the following preparations: boiled turkey (n=50), boiled pork ham (n=50), smoked turkey (n=50) and smoked pork ham (n=50). In all cold meat preparations Clostridium perfringens vegetative and spore forms, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and other Clostridium sp lec(-), as well as Lactobacillus, Bacillus sp. and Salmonella sp. were recovered. For instance Bacillus cereus was present in 6% of the samples. L. monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli were rarely present (1-4%) while Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter lari were absent. Differences in the occurrence of S. aureus, Salmonella sp., E. coli and spore forms of C. perfringens in boiled and smoked samples, reflects either the differences in the processing of the foods or could be associated to the extensive handling by the personnel during the purchasing (storage, slicing, wrapping). Antibiotic resistance on specific antibiotics for each pathogen was also studied. A multiresistance antibiotic profile was effective for most bacterial strains, and pronounced resistance profiles were observed for the commonly used antibiotics as ampicillin, penicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin followed by ceftriaxone and gentamycin. Albeit this high observed resistance profile, the tested strains generally conserved their susceptibility to amikacin, aztreonam, chloramphenicol and tylosin conserved an almost absent resistance. Antibiotics commonly used for therapeutic purposes, as well as antibiotics added to feed stuff of animals for increasing animal flesh production should contribute to the extensive spreading of antibiotic resistance in food and the environment. Systematically monitoring of the microbiological quality of cold butchery preparations must be done, in order to preserve food quality, optimizing the processing and elaboration methods of the product and safeguard the public health.
TI  - Screening of Australian plants for antimicrobial activity against Campylobacter jejuni.
AB  - Campylobacter jejuni is the most common cause of acute enteritis in humans, with  symptoms such as diarrhoea, fever and abdominal cramps. In this study, 115 extracts from 109 Australian plant species were investigated for their antimicrobial activities against two C. jejuni strains using an in vitro broth microdilution assay. Among the plants tested, 107 (93%) extracts showed activity at a concentration between 32 and 1024 microg/mL against at least one C. jejuni strain. Seventeen plant extracts were selected for further testing against another six C. jejuni strains, as well as Campylobacter coli, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus cereus, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis. The extract from Eucalyptus occidentalis demonstrated the highest antimicrobial activity, with an inhibitory concentration of 32 microg/mL against C. jejuni and B. cereus. This study has shown that extracts of selected Australian plants possess antimicrobial activity against C. jejuni and thus may have application in the control of this organism in live poultry and retail poultry products.
TI  - Inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (Mangifera indica L.).
AB  - This study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-O-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. The MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. Gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were Gram-negative bacteria. The MICs of gallotannins against Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium botulinum, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. The use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of S. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. Supplementation of LB medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against Staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of S. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. Hepta-O-galloylglucose sensitized Lactobacillus plantarum TMW1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter HorA. Carbohydrate metabolism of Lactococcus lactis MG1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-O-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. In conclusion, the inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.
TI  - Evaluation of diffusion and dilution methods to determine the antibacterial activity of plant extracts.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate diffusion and dilution methods for determining the antibacterial activity of plant extracts and their mixtures. Several methods for measurement of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of a plant extract are available, but there is no standard procedure as there is for antibiotics. We tested different plant extracts, their mixtures and phenolic acids on selected gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Listeria monocytogenes) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Infantis, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli) with the disk diffusion, agar dilution, broth microdilution and macrodilution methods. The disk diffusion method was appropriate only as a preliminary screening test prior to quantitative MIC determination with dilution methods. A comparison of the results for MIC obtained by agar dilution and broth microdilution was possible only for gram-positive bacteria, and indicated the latter as the most accurate way of assessing the antimicrobial effect. The microdilution method with TTC (2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride) or INT (2-p-iodophenyl-3-p-nitrophenyl-5-phenyl tetrazolium chloride) to indicate the viability of aerobic bacteria was found to be the best alternative approach, while only ATP determination was appropriate for microaerophilic Campylobacter spp. Using survival curves the kinetics of bacterial inactivation on plant extract exposure was followed for 24h and in this way the MIC values determined by the microdilution method were confirmed as the concentrations of extracts that inhibited bacterial growth. We suggest evaluation of the antibacterial activity of plant extracts using the broth microdilution method as a fast screening method for MIC determination and the macrodilution method at selected MIC values to confirm bacterial inactivation. Campylobacter spp. showed a similar sensitivity to plant extracts as the tested gram-positive bacteria, but S. Infantis and E. coli O157:H7 were more resistant.
TI  - Simultaneous identification of seven foodborne pathogens and Escherichia coli (pathogenic and nonpathogenic) using capillary electrophoresis-based single-strand conformation polymorphism coupled with multiplex PCR.
AB  - The objective of this study was to develop a novel technique for parallel analysis of eight important foodborne microbes using capillary electrophoresis-based single-strand conformation polymorphism (CE-SSCP) coupled with multiplex PCR. Specific primers for multiplex PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene were designed, corresponding to eight species of bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica, Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus, for the species-specific identification and optimal separation of their PCR products in subsequent analysis by CE-SSCP. Multiplex PCR conditions including annealing temperature, extension time, the number of PCR cycles, and primer concentrations were then optimized for simultaneous detection of all target foodborne bacteria. The diagnostic system using CE-SSCP combined with multiplex PCR developed here can be used for rapid investigation of causative agents of foodborne illness. The simplicity and high sensitivity of the method may lead to improved management of safety and illness related to food.
TI  - Effects of pulsed electric fields on pathogenic microorganisms of major concern in fluid foods: a review.
AB  - Pathogenic microorganisms such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni have been implicated in foodborne diseases and outbreaks worldwide. These bacteria have been associated with the consumption of fresh fruit juices, milk, and dairy products, which are foodstuff, highly demanded by consumers in retails and supermarkets. Nowadays, consumers require high quality, fresh-like, and safe foods. Pulsed electric field (PEF) is a non-thermal preservation method, able to inactivate pathogenic microorganisms without significant loss of the organoleptic and nutritional properties of food. The PEF treatment effectiveness to destroy bacteria such as Listeria innocua, E. coli, Salmonella Typhimurium, E. coli O157:H7 and E. coli 8739 at pasteurization levels (> or = 5.0 log(10) cycles) in some fluid foods was reported. However, data on the inactivation of some microorganisms such as Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni in fluid foods by PEF processing is very limited. Therefore, future works should be focused toward the inactivation of these pathogenic bacteria in real foods.
TI  - Towards on-site pathogen detection using antibody-based sensors.
AB  - In this paper, the recent progress within biosensors for plant pathogen detection will be reviewed. Bio-recognition layers on sensors can be designed in various ways, however the most popular approach is to immobilise antibodies for specific capture of analytes. Focus will be put on antibody surface-immobilisation strategies as well as the use of antibodies in the widely used sensors, quartz crystal microbalance, surface plasmon resonance and cantilevers. We will describe the available data on antibody-based plant pathogen detection and furthermore use examples from detection of the pathogens Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus anthracis, Campylobacter and Escherichia coli. We will touch upon optimal assay design and further discuss the strengths and limitations of current sensor technologies for detection of viruses, bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Enteric bacteria isolated from acute diarrheal patients in the Republic of Korea  between the year 2004 and 2006.
AB  - In an epidemiological survey of human enterobacterial infections in the Republic  of Korea during three years from 2004 to 2006, we isolated 1,784 (6.2%, isolation rate of enteropathogens from stool samples) in 2004, 2,547 (9.5%) in 2005 and 3,506 bacteria (12.3%) from people who visited clinics. Among the isolated bacteria, pathogenic Escherichia coli, especially, EAEC was the most frequently identified pathogen in both urban and rural regions followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella species, Bacillus cereus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, and Shigella species. Distinct seasonality was found in V. parahaemolyticus species, while this pathogen showed no age-specific patterns. However, other bacteria, i.e., pathogenic E. coli, S. aureus, Salmonella spp., and B. cereus showed similar seasonality throughout the year, showing a slight increase in the infection rate during the summer months and high prevalence among children under 10 years of age and elder-age people. The antibiotic susceptibility patterns of pathogenic E. coli, Salmonella spp., and S. aureus showed high resistance to penicillins. However, both pathogenic E. coli and Salmonella spp. were susceptible to several cephems, imipenem, and amikacin. Moreover, S. aureus strains resistant to vancomycin were not found. In conclusion, these surveillances can play an important role for the control and prevention to the diseases originated by enteritis bacteria.
TI  - Risk profiles of pork and poultry meat and risk ratings of various pathogen/product combinations.
AB  - Risk profiles of pork and poultry meat were carried out using an Excel-based software program, Risk Ranger. It is a semi-quantitative risk estimator answering various questions relating to the probability of exposure to a hazard, susceptibility of the population of interest, severity of the illness caused by the hazard if present and probability of food containing an infectious dose. Therefore, qualitative and quantitative inputs were used to estimate and rank the risk of various hazards/food combinations. Risk scores provided by the tool were characterized as low, medium and high. Also, health risk was estimated separately, where needed, for low and high risk populations. Low risk scores were obtained for Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) for low risk population. High risk scores were obtained for hepatitis E virus (HEV) in raw pork products (both low and high risk populations). Moderate risk scores for Salmonella spp. and L. monocytogenes in processed pork or poultry-meat products (ready-to-eat or to be reheated) and partially cooked pork products were also obtained (low risk population). Scores for Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus and various product types were mostly in the "medium" risk category, except for S. aureus/ready-to-eat pork products able to support growth of the organism, which fell into the high risk category. Campylobacter spp. gave moderate risk scores with one exception (raw poultry products), whereas Y. enterocolitica showed combinations of low risk and few of medium risk. High risk pathogen/product combinations identified were: 1) temperature abused, ready-to-eat pork and/or poultry-meat products with extended shelf life and cross-contaminated by L. monocytogenes (high risk population), EHEC (high risk population) or S. aureus (all population), 2) partially cooked or processed intended to be reheated pork products cross-contaminated by L. monocytogenes, served undercooked and receiving improper cooling or reheating (high risk population), and 3) all people consuming undercooked meals cross-contaminated with Campylobacter spp. (e.g. from raw poultry and raw poultry-meat products) and HEV (e.g. from raw pork and raw pork-meat products). Salmonellae gave high risk scores in all food categories (except preserved meat products) for high risk population. Preserved meats (mainly pork) such as dry fermented sausages gave low risk scores. Only Salmonella spp., L. monocytogenes and E. coli EHEC gave moderate risk ratings in case of ingredients likely to be contaminated at an early stage of processing (e.g. animal at slaughter) and inadequate fermentation process. These results may constitute a source of information for hazard assessment during application of a Food Safety Management System.
TI  - A systematic review of the clinical, public health and cost-effectiveness of rapid diagnostic tests for the detection and identification of bacterial intestinal pathogens in faeces and food.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of tests for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial food poisoning in clinical and public health practice and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of these assays in a hypothetical population in order to inform policy on the use of these tests. DATA SOURCES: Studies evaluating diagnostic accuracy of rapid tests were retrieved using electronic databases and handsearching reference lists and key journals. Hospital laboratories and test manufacturers were contacted for cost data, and clinicians involved in the care of patients with food poisoning were invited to discuss the conclusions of this review using the nominal group technique. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review of the current medical literature on assays used for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial food poisoning was carried out. Specific organisms under review were Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli O157, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus. Data extraction was undertaken using standardised data extraction forms. Where a sufficient number of studies evaluating comparable tests were identified, meta-analysis was performed. A decision analytic model was developed, using effectiveness data from the review and cost data from hospitals and manufacturers, which contributed to an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of rapid tests in a hypothetical UK population. Finally, diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness results were presented to a focus group of GPs, microbiologists and consultants in communicable disease control, to assess professional opinion on the use of rapid tests in the diagnosis of food poisoning. RESULTS: Good test performance levels were observed with rapid test methods, especially for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. The estimated levels of diagnostic accuracy using the area under the curve of the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was very high. Indeed, although traditional culture is the natural reference test to use for comparative statistical analysis, on many occasions the rapid test outperforms culture, detecting additional 'truly' positive cases of food-borne illness. The significance of these additional positives requires further investigation. Economic modelling suggests that adoption of rapid tests in combination with routine culture is unlikely to be cost-effective, however, as the cost of rapid technologies decreases; total replacement with rapid technologies may be feasible. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relatively poor quality of reporting of studies evaluating rapid detection methods, the reviewed evidence shows that PCR for Campylobacter, Salmonella and E. coli O157 is potentially very successful in identifying pathogens, possibly detecting more than the number currently reported using culture. Less is known about the benefits of testing for B. cereus, C. perfringens and S. aureus. Further investigation is needed on how clinical outcomes may be altered if test results are available more quickly and at a greater precision than in the current practice of bacterial culture.
TI  - The effect of lemon, orange and bergamot essential oils and their components on the survival of Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli O157, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus in vitro and in food systems.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effectiveness of oils and vapours of lemon (Citrus limon), sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) and bergamot (Citrus bergamia) and their components against a number of common foodborne pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: The disc diffusion method was used to screen the oils and vapours against Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157 and Campylobacter jejuni. The survival of each species, demonstrated to be susceptible in the in vitro studies, was tested on cabbage leaf for 60 s by direct contact and on chicken skin for 10 min by direct contact and 24 h by vapour. The results indicate that bergamot was the most inhibitory essential oil (EO) and citral and linalool mimicked its effect (P > 0.001). Citral and linalool vapours produced 6 log reductions in L. monocytogenes, Staph. aureus and B. cereus populations on cabbage leaf after 8-10 h exposure but bergamot vapour exposure, while producing a similar reduction in L. monocytogenes and B. cereus populations, had no effect on Staph. aureus. CONCLUSIONS: Bergamot was the most effective of the oils tested and linalool the most effective anti-bacterial component. Gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible than Gram-negative bacteria in vitro, although Camp. jejuni and E. coli O157 were inhibited by bergamot and linalool oils and by linalool vapour. All bacteria tested were less susceptible in food systems than in vitro. Of the Gram-positive bacteria tested Staph. aureus was the least susceptible to both the oils and the components tested. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Results suggest the possibility that citrus EOs, particularly bergamot, could be used as a way of combating the growth of common causes of food poisoning.
TI  - Rapid separation and concentration of food-borne pathogens in food samples prior  to quantification by viable-cell counting and real-time PCR.
AB  - Buoyant density gradient centrifugation has been used to separate bacteria from complex food matrices, as well as to remove compounds that inhibit rapid detection methods, such as PCR, and to prevent false-positive results due to DNA originating from dead cells. Applying a principle of buoyant density gradient centrifugation, we developed a method for rapid separation and concentration following filtration and low- and high-speed centrifugation, as well as flotation and sedimentation buoyant density centrifugation, for 12 food-borne pathogens (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio cholerae O139, Vibrio parahaemolyticus O3K6, Vibrio vulnificus, Providencia alcalifaciens, Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium perfringens) in 13 different food homogenates. This method can be used prior to real-time quantitative PCR (RTi-qPCR) and viable-cell counting. Using this combined method, the target organisms in the food samples theoretically could be concentrated 250-fold and detected at cell concentrations as low as 10(1) to 10(3) CFU/g using the RTi-qPCR assay, and amounts as small as 10(0) to 10(1) CFU/g could be isolated using plate counting. The combined separation and concentration methods and RTi-qPCR confirmed within 3 h the presence of 10(1) to 10(2) CFU/g of Salmonella and C. jejuni directly in naturally contaminated chicken and the presence of S. aureus directly in remaining food items in a poisoning outbreak. These results illustrated the feasibility of using these assays for rapid inspection of bacterial food contamination during a real-world outbreak.
TI  - Berry phenolics: antimicrobial properties and mechanisms of action against severe human pathogens.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity and mechanisms of phenolic extracts of 12 Nordic berries were studied against selected human pathogenic microbes. The most sensitive bacteria on berry phenolics were Helicobacter pylori and Bacillus cereus. Campylobacter jejuni and Candida albicans were inhibited only with phenolic extracts of cloudberry, raspberry, and strawberry, which all were rich in ellagitannins. Cloudberry extract gave strong microbicidic effects on the basis of plate count with all studied strains. However, fluorescence staining of liquid cultures of virulent Salmonella showed viable cells not detectable by plate count adhering to cloudberry extract, whereas Staphylococcus aureus cells adhered to berry extracts were dead on the basis of their fluorescence and plate count. Phenolic extracts of cloudberry and raspberry disintegrated the outer membrane of examined Salmonella strains as indicated by 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine (NPN) uptake increase and analysis of liberation of [14C]galactose- lipopolysaccharide. Gallic acid effectively permeabilized the tested Salmonella strains, and significant increase in the NPN uptake was recorded. The stability of berry phenolics and their antimicrobial activity in berries stored frozen for a year were examined using Escherichia coli and nonvirulent Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium. The amount of phenolic compounds decreased in all berries, but their antimicrobial activity was not influenced accordingly. Cloudberry, in particular, showed constantly strong antimicrobial activity during the storage.
TI  - Detection and identification of intestinal pathogenic bacteria by hybridization to oligonucleotide microarrays.
AB  - AIM: To detect the common intestinal pathogenic bacteria quickly and accurately.  METHODS: A rapid (<3 h) experimental procedure was set up based upon the gene chip technology. Target genes were amplified and hybridized by oligonucleotide microarrays. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy strains of bacteria in pure culture belonging to 11 genera were successfully discriminated under comparatively same conditions, and a series of specific hybridization maps corresponding to each kind of bacteria were obtained. When this method was applied to 26 divided cultures, 25 (96.2%) were identified. CONCLUSION: Salmonella sp., Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus sp., Bacillus cereus, Vibrio cholerae, Enterococcus faecalis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni can be detected and identified by our microarrays. The accuracy, range, and discrimination power of this assay can be continually improved by adding further oligonucleotides to the arrays without any significant increase of complexity or cost.
TI  - [Symptoms of food-borne diseases and gastroenteritis in Kyushu, Japan].
AB  - In this study we analyzed the symptoms of gastroenteritis or food-borne disease caused by the 10 most prevalent pathogens: Norovirus, Salmonella, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), Shigella sonnei/flexneri (Shigella), Staphylococcus aureus, and emetic-type Bacillus cereus. The symptoms diarrhea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, and headache, and the incubation period in 646 cases in 10 districts of Kyushu between January 2000 and December 2004 were recorded. The pathogen with the shortest mean incubation period was B. cereus (0.8 h), and was followed by S. aureus (3.3 h), C. perfringens (10.7 h) and V. parahaemolyticus (16.4 h). All the patients infected with B. cereus and S. aureus developed symptoms within 6 hours, and those infected with V. parahaemolyticus and C. perfringens developed symptoms within 24 hours. Bloody diarrhea was associated with STEC and Shigella, but rare with other pathogens. Vomiting was associated with almost all cases of S. aureus and B. cereus infection, and occurred in 71.5% of the Norovirus cases and 56.1% of the V. parahaemolyticus cases. Vomiting was less common in the C. perfringens (22.0%) and the ETEC and STEC (both about 5%). Bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting were statistically significantly more common with STEC 0157 infection than with STEC non-0157 infection. Since the cases analyzed in this study included all degrees of illness, mild to severe, and a wide range of ages, the information obtained will serve as a good reference material for administrative and laboratory work when an outbreak takes place.
TI  - [Study of real-time PCR assays for rapid detection of food-borne pathogens].
AB  - A duplex real-time SYBR Green LightCycler PCR (LC-PCR) assay with DNA extraction  using QIAamp DNA Stool Minikit was evaluated for detection of 8 of 19 species of food-borne pathogens, including Plesiomonas shigelloides, Providencia alcalifaciens, in five stool specimens. The time frame was within 2h or less. The protocol used the same LC-PCR with 22 pairs of specific primers. The rapid amplification and reliable detection of specific genes were determined by this LC-PCR assay from 10 cases of food-borne outbreaks in Shimane Prefecture from 2002 to 2005. These cases included Campylobacter jejuni (4), Clostridium perfringens (2), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and astA positive E. coli (1), and astA positive E. coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli 026, and Bacillus cereus (1 each). Rapid amplification and reliable detection of specific genes of food-or water-borne pathogenic bacteria in fecal samples should facilitate the diagnosis and management of food-borne outbreaks.
TI  - Microbiological quality of ready-to-eat foods: results from a long-term surveillance program (1995 through 2003).
AB  - The coordination of food sampling activities across Wales, a part of the United Kingdom with a population of approximately 3 million, led to the establishment in 1995 of a coordinated food-sampling program designed to monitor on a long-term basis the microbiological quality and safety of specific ready-to-eat products. This surveillance system has been ongoing for 9 years and has generated a database of microbiological and associated demographic results for 15,228 ready-to-eat food samples. The food types that had the poorest overall results were sliced meats, unsliced poultry, sandwiches made without salad, and cakes made without dairy cream. For all food types, the overall unsatisfactory rate was 17% for aerobic colony counts, 1.6% for Escherichia coli, and 0.5% for Listeria spp. Overall unsatisfactory or unacceptable rates for pathogens such as Clostridium perfringens, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus were all below 0.5%. No Campylobacter-positive samples and only one Salmonella-positive sample were found. The analysis of the results show that the ready-to-eat food types sampled over the 9 years of the program were generally of good microbiological quality when compared with current United Kingdom guidelines. The information contained in the database provides a baseline measurement of the microbial quality of a variety of ready-to-eat foods and allows environmental health officers and food microbiologists to generate hypotheses for targeted surveys or research work.
TI  - Application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  - A rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. Nylon membrane was used as the array support. A mutation region of the 23S rRNA gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. A pair of universal primers was designed for PCR amplification of the 23S rRNA gene. Twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. The 23S rRNA gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. Hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. Results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella dysenteriae, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. Two other species (Salmonella enterica and Yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with E. coli, but the reaction did not affect their detection. After redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with Staphylococcus aureus, but not with Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus pyogenes. The oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne infections. The superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.
TI  - Duplex real-time SYBR green PCR assays for detection of 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens in stools.
AB  - A duplex real-time SYBR Green LightCycler PCR (LC-PCR) assay with DNA extraction  using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini kit was evaluated with regard to detection of 8 of 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens in five stool specimens in 2 h or less. The protocol used the same LC-PCR with 20 pairs of specific primers. The products formed were identified based on a melting point temperature (T(m)) curve analysis. The 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens examined were enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, enterotoxigenic E. coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio vulnificus, Aeromonas spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, and Bacillus cereus. No interference with the LC-PCR assay was observed when stool specimens were artificially inoculated with each bacterial species. The detection levels were approximately 10(5) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g of stool. The protocol for processing stool specimens for less than 10(4) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g of stool requires an overnight enrichment step to achieve adequate sensitivity. However, the rapid amplification and reliable detection of specific genes of greater than 10(5) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g in samples should facilitate the diagnosis and management of food- or waterborne outbreaks.
TI  - Consumer food-handling behaviors associated with prevention of 13 foodborne illnesses.
AB  - To be effective in reducing the incidence of foodborne illness, consumers and food safety educators need information about behaviors that will decrease exposure to foodborne pathogens. A four-round Delphi technique was used to survey nationally recognized experts in food microbiology, epidemiology, food safety education, and food safety policy with the aim of identifying and ranking food-handling and consumption behaviors associated with 13 major foodborne pathogens. The food safety experts ranked behaviors related to keeping foods at safe temperatures as of primary importance in preventing illness caused by Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens and of secondary importance in preventing illness caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The use of a thermometer to cook foods adequately was ranked as of primary importance for the prevention of illness caused by Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella species, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Toxoplasma gondii, and Yersinia enterocolitica, with the avoidance of cross-contamination being ranked as of secondary importance for most of these pathogens. Hand washing was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of shigellosis. The avoidance of certain foods that are likely to be contaminated was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of illnesses caused by Listeria monocytogenes, Noroviruses, and Vibrio species. The expert panel's ranking of behaviors for the reduction of the risk of illness caused by major foodborne pathogens can enable consumers to make informed choices about food consumption and handling behaviors and can guide food safety educators in prioritizing their educational efforts.
TI  - Diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on Helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  - Among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (AA) is one of the most important. AA has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on Helicobacter pylori. However, there are limited studies on the possible role of AA and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (PA) on the growth and survival of H. pylori. In the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that AA in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mM) inhibited H. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. In contrast, under aerobic conditions AA in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mM) significantly increased the survival of H. pylori presumably eliminating the toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. The hydrophobic derivative of AA, PA (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mM). This effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Clostridium sporogenes and Campylobacter jejuni. Among these bacterial strains, PA showed a similar inhibitory effect on B. cereus and B. subtilis as observed with H. pylori. The results suggest that PA may be considered an important AA derivative in eradication of H. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.
TI  - Bacteriological safety issues in red meat and ready-to-eat meat products, as well as control measures.
AB  - The importance of Eschericha coli O157, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium DT104 as meat-borne pathogens is well established. Pathogenic bacteria such as Aeromonas spp., Arcobacter spp., psychrotrophic Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter spp., Clostridium botulinum and non-invasive Listeria monocytogenes can be regarded as rookies, but not yet firmly associated with today's production of red meat and meat products. The development of PCR and other DNA-based techniques will shed new light on so called emerging pathogens. Important safety issues in meat production, such as insufficient cleaning and disinfection (including the stable/lairage, processing environment), carcass decontamination and chilling, and cross contamination are discussed. Furthermore, probability modelling of survival and growth is identified as an important way to achieve a better understanding of how to deal with the complexity of further processing, including heat treatment and storage.
TI  - Microbiological status of commercially available medicinal herbal drugs--a screening study.
AB  - One hundred and thirty-eight medicinal herbal drugs obtained from different suppliers were examined for microbial contaminants and for the detectability of pathogenic microorganisms. For this purpose, several microbiological standard parameters (total aerobic mesophilic count, enterobacteria, coliforms, aerobic sporeformers, yeasts and moulds, enterococci, lactobacilli, pseudomonades and aeromades) and selective methods for the detection of indicator microorganisms and pathogens (E. coli, enterohaemorrhagic E. coli [EHEC], Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Listeria, coagulase-positive staphylococci, Candida albicans, potentially aflatoxigenic moulds) were applied. The microbial load of the samples varied considerably. While none of the samples contained EHEC, Salmonellae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeriae, Staphylococcus aureus or Candida albicans, four samples were E. coli positive, two samples were presumptively Campylobacter jejuni positive and nine herbal drugs contained a potentially aflatoxigenic mould flora. Further details regarding different viable count classes as well as preparation techniques are discussed.
TI  - Foodborne diseases in Kenya.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the occurrence of foodborne disease outbreaks in Kenya and the efforts employed to combat them. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Forty two districts in Kenya between 1970 and 1993. STUDY SUBJECTS: Foodborne disease outbreak episodes due to Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Listera monocytogenes, chemicals, aflatoxin, plant and animal poisons. OUTCOME MEASURES: Number and aetiological causes of foodborne disease outbreaks reported in the study period. RESULTS: Thirty seven food poisoning outbreaks were reported to the Ministry of Health from various parts of the country in the study period 1970 to 1993, and only 13 of these involving a total of 926 people were confirmed to be due to particular aetiological agents. Foods that were involved included milk and milk products, meat and meat products, maize flour, bread, scones and other wheat products, vegetables and lemon pie pudding. A high number of food poisoning cases were treated as outpatients in various health facilities. CONCLUSION: Under-reporting, inadequate investigation of outbreaks and inadequate diagnostic facilities suggest that foodborne disease outbreaks are more than is recorded by the Ministry of Health.
TI  - Microbiological hazard identification and exposure assessment of street food vending in Johannesburg, South Africa.
AB  - One hundred and thirty-two samples of beef, chicken, salad and gravy were collected from two street vendors over eleven replicate surveys to assess microbiological safety and quality. For each food type samples were collected during preparation and holding. Dish water was also collected and food preparation surfaces swabbed during preparation and display. Standard methods were used to determine aerobic plate counts, Enterobacteriaceae counts, coliform counts and spore counts. Six hundred and seventy-five predominant colonies were isolated from aerobic plate counts of all samples and characterised. The incidence of selected foodborne bacterial pathogens and non-pathogenic E. coli 1 was also determined. In most cases mean bacterial counts of the raw materials were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of corresponding cooked foods. No significant differences (P > 0.05) in all count types were observed between food samples collected during cooking and those collected during holding. In addition, no significant differences (P > 0.05) in all count types were observed between prepared salads and their raw materials. Mean bacterial counts of water and swab samples collected from vendor 1 were lower than those of water and swab samples collected from vendor 2.The predominant populations isolated from the aerobic plate counts were Bacillus spp., Staphylococcus spp., Enterobacteriaceae and Alcaligenes spp. Bacillus cereus was detected in 17%, Clostridium perfringens in 1%, Staphylococcus aureus in 3% and Vibrio metchnikovii in 2% of the food samples. Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 were not detected. Non-pathogenic E. coli 1 was detected in 13% of food samples, in 86 and 36% of dish water samples collected from vendors 1 and 2, respectively, and in 36% of surface swab samples from vendor 2.
TI  - Kombucha fermentation and its antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Kombucha was prepared in a tea broth (0.5% w/v) supplemented with sucrose (10% w/v) by using a commercially available starter culture. The pH decreased steadily from 5 to 2.5 during the fermentation while the weight of the "tea fungus" and the OD of the tea broth increased through 4 days of the fermentation and remained fairly constant thereafter. The counts of acetic acid-producing bacteria and yeasts in the broth increased up to 4 days of fermentation and decreased afterward. The antimicrobial activity of Kombucha was investigated against a number of pathogenic microorganisms. Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella sonnei, Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, Yersinia enterolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus epidermis, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus cereus, Helicobacterpylori, and Listeria monocytogenes were found to be sensitive to Kombucha. According to the literature on Kombucha, acetic acid is considered to be responsible for the inhibitory effect toward a number of microbes tested, and this is also valid in the present study. However, in this study, Kombucha proved to exert antimicrobial activities against E. coli, Sh. sonnei, Sal. typhimurium, Sal. enteritidis, and Cm. jejuni, even at neutral pH and after thermal denaturation. This finding suggests the presence of antimicrobial compounds other than acetic acid and large proteins in Kombucha.
TI  - Microbiological quality and safety of ready-to-eat street-vended foods in Johannesburg, South Africa.
AB  - Fifty-one ready-to-eat street foods, 18 dishwater, and 18 surface swab samples were collected from six vendors in Johannesburg, South Africa. Food temperatures were recorded at the time of sampling. Standard methods were used to determine aerobic plate counts (APCs), spore counts (SCs), and Enterobacteriaceae counts (ECs) for food samples as well as coliform counts (CCs) for water and swab samples. In addition, Petrifilm Escherichia coli count (PC) plates were used for the enumeration of coliforms in food, water, and swab samples. The presence of selected foodborne pathogens in the food samples as well as the presence of nonpathogenic E. coli 1 (in food and water samples) was also tested for. Predominant colonies isolated from APC plates were characterized to the genus level. Holding temperatures for cooked meats and gravies ranged from 42.0 to 94.0 degrees C, and those for uncooked salads ranged from 29.0 to 39.0 degrees C. Mean APC values of 3.4 (+/-0.4) log CFU/g, 4.0 (+/-1.2) log CFU/ml, and 2.1 (+/-0.4) log CFU/25 cm2 were obtained for food, water, and swab samples, respectively. Mean SC values of 1.6 (+/-0.2) log CFU/g and 1.5 (+/-0.3) log CFU/25 cm2 were obtained for food and swab samples, respectively. A mean EC value of 2.0 (+/-0.4) log CFU/g for food samples and mean CC values of 2.5 (+/-0.3) log CFU/ml and 1.3 (+/-0.3) log CFU/25 cm2 for water and swab samples, respectively, were determined. Mean PC values of 1.6 (+/-0.1) log CFU/g, 1.9 (+/-0.6) log CFU/ml, and 1.4 (+/-0.4) log CFU/25 cm2 were determined for food, water, and swab samples, respectively. Bacillus cereus was detected in 22%, Clostridium perfringens in 16%, Salmonella spp. in 2%, and E. coli (non-O157:H+) in 2% of the 51 food samples. E. coli was found in 14 water samples (78%) and in 3 food samples (6%). Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, and Yersinia enterocolitica were also tested for in the food samples, but they were not detected. The 340 isolates obtained from APC plates for food, water, and swab samples were predominantly Bacillus spp., Micrococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. for all three sample types. It was concluded that the foods analyzed in this study were of acceptable quality and safety.
TI  - Bacterial populations associated with a sorghum-based fermented weaning cereal.
AB  - Microbiological surveys, to determine the quality and safety, were conducted on 45 sorghum samples comprising dry powders (n = 15) and corresponding fermented (n = 15) and cooked fermented porridge (n = 15) samples collected from households in an informal settlement of the Gauteng Province of South Africa. Mean aerobic plate counts, Gram-negative counts and bacterial spore counts of sorghum powder samples decreased in fermented and cooked fermented porridge samples. However, mean lactic acid bacteria counts increased in fermented porridge samples, but decreased slightly in cooked fermented porridge samples. The mean pH value of sorghum powder samples decreased in fermented and cooked fermented porridge, respectively. Bacillus (B.) cereus was detected in all 15 sorghum powder samples, while Escherichia (E.) coli was detected in 53%, Clostridium perfringens in 27%, Listeria monocytogenes in 13% and Aeromonas spp., Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella spp. and Yersinia spp., each in 7% of sorghum powder samples. Of the fermented porridge samples, 40% contained B. cereus and 7% contained E. coli. None of the pathogens tested for were detected in cooked fermented porridge samples. B. cereus (53%), B. subtilis (21%), B. thuringiensis (13%), B. licheniformis (10%) and B. coagulans (3%) were identified from 120 isolates randomly selected from spore count plates of the highest dilution showing growth.
TI  - Evaluation of accuracy and repeatability of identification of food-borne pathogens by automated bacterial identification systems.
AB  - The performances of five automated microbial identification systems, relative to  that of a reference identification system, for their ability to accurately and repeatedly identify six common food-borne pathogens were assessed. The systems assessed were the MicroLog system (Biolog Inc., Hayward, Calif.), the Microbial Identification System (MIS; MIDI Inc., Newark, Del.), the VITEK system (bioMerieux Vitek, Hazelwood, Mo.), the MicroScan WalkAway 40 system (Dade-MicroScan International, West Sacramento, Calif.), and the Replianalyzer system (Oxoid Inc., Nepean, Ontario, Canada). The sensitivities and specificities of these systems for the identification of food-borne isolates of Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., and verotoxigenic Escherichia coli were determined with 40 reference positive isolates and 40 reference negative isolates for each pathogen. The sensitivities of these systems for the identification of these pathogens ranged from 42.5 to 100%, and the specificities of these systems for the identification of these pathogens ranged from 32.5 to 100%. Some of the systems had difficulty correctly identifying the reference isolates when the results were compared to those from the reference identification tests. The sensitivity of MIS for the identification of S. aureus, B. cereus, E. coli, and C. jejuni, for example, ranged from 47.5 to 72. 5%. The sensitivity of the Microlog system for the identification of E. coli was 72.5%, and the sensitivity of the VITEK system for the identification of B. cereus was 42.5%. The specificities of four of the five systems for the identification of all of the species tested with the available databases were greater than or equal to 97.5%; the exception was MIS for the identification of C. jejuni, which displayed a specificity of 32.5% when it was tested with reference negative isolates including Campylobacter coli and other Campylobacter species. All systems had >80% sensitivities for the identification of Salmonella species and Listeria species at the genus level. The repeatability of these systems for the identification of test isolates ranged from 30 to 100%. Not all systems included all six pathogens in their databases; thus, some species could not be tested with all systems. The choice of automated microbial identification system for the identification of a food-borne pathogen would depend on the availability of identification libraries within the systems and the performance of the systems for the identification of the pathogen.
TI  - Produce handling and processing practices.
AB  - In the past decade, outbreaks of human illness associated with the consumption of raw vegetables and fruits (or unpasteurized products produced from them) have increased in the United States. Changes in agronomic, harvesting, distribution, processing, and consumption patterns and practices have undoubtedly contributed to this increase. Pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium botulinum, and Bacillus cereus are naturally present in some soil, and their presence on fresh produce is not rare. Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio cholerae, parasites, and viruses are more likely to contaminate fresh produce through vehicles such as raw or improperly composted manure, irrigation water containing untreated sewage, or contaminated wash water. Contact with mammals, reptiles, fowl, insects, and unpasteurized products of animal origin offers another avenue through which pathogens can access produce. Surfaces, including human hands, which come in contact with whole or cut produce represent potential points of contamination throughout the total system of growing, harvesting, packing, processing, shipping, and preparing produce for consumption. Treatment of produce with chlorinated water reduces populations of pathogenic and other microorganisms on fresh produce but cannot eliminate them. Reduction of risk for human illness associated with raw produce can be better achieved through controlling points of potential contamination in the field; during harvesting; during processing or distribution; or in retail markets, food-service facilities, or the home.
TI  - Meat from dairy cows: possible microbiological hazards and risks.
AB  - The authors provide an overview of the circumstances associated with culling of dairy cattle in the United States of America (USA) and focus on the possible significant microbiological hazards associated with meat from cull dairy cows. Cull dairy cows are an important source of food in the USA, accounting for at least approximately 17% of ground beef. The potential microbiological hazards for foodborne illness from cull dairy cows discussed here include Salmonella (with special attention to S. Typhimurium DT104), Escherichia coli O157:H7, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus. Possible sources and means of contamination are pointed out, as are the potential foodborne risks from Bacillus cereus and Aeromonas spp. In conclusion, widespread microbiological studies are needed to determine the prevalence and risk of foodborne pathogens in cull dairy cattle.
TI  - Risk factors for outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease linked to domestic catering.
AB  - The epidemiology of general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering for large numbers is described and compared with foodborne outbreaks in other settings. From 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1994, the PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre identified 101 foodborne general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering in England and Wales (16% of all foodborne outbreaks). Salmonella species were associated with 77 of the 101 outbreaks and S. enteriditis phage type 4 accounted for 57. Small round structured viruses were implicated in five outbreaks, Clostridium perfringens in four, Bacillus cereus in two, and Campylobacter sp and Escherichia coli in one each. No pathogen was identified in 11 outbreaks. Outbreaks occurred most commonly in summer. The commonest vehicles implicated were poultry/eggs in 44 outbreaks, desserts in 13, and meat/meat products in nine. Salad/vegetables, sauces, and fish/shellfish were each implicated in eight outbreaks. Raw shell eggs were implicated in a fifth of outbreaks. Inappropriate storage was the commonest fault, reported in association with 50 outbreaks (ambient temperature for long periods before serving in 29), inadequate heat treatment was reported in 35, cross contamination in 28, an infected food handler in 11, and other faults in 14. Outbreaks associated with catering on domestic premises were independently more likely than outbreaks in other settings to be associated with salmonellas, inappropriate storage of food, and consumption of poultry, eggs, or sauces. Public health services need to direct messages about the use, preparation, and storage of food to those who cater on domestic premises.
TI  - Incidence of diarrhea with antibiotics and the increase of clostridia in rabbits.
AB  - Rabbits were treated with a single intravenous injection of various antibiotics.  More than 40 per cent of the animals showed diarrhea after being treated with sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefmetazole, clindamycin, piperacillin or aspoxicillin. Clostridium difficile was isolated from sulbactam/cefoperazone-treated diarrheic rabbits, with their cecal contents showing positive reaction in a latex agglutination test for C. difficile enterotoxin. However, 27 cefmetazole-induced diarrheic cases were not associated with C. difficile. Other enteropathogenic bacteria, such as Campylobacter spp., Bacillus cereus, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., Vibrio spp., Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium spiroforme, were not isolated from either of diarrheic rabbit. However, the counts of clostridia remarkably increased in the intestine of cefmetazole-associated diarrheic rabbits. This was ascribed to the overgrowth of Clostridium innocuum and Clostridium sporogenes. There were no remarkable differences in changes in other bacterial population between diarrheic and non-diarrheic rabbits.
TI  - Probes and polymerase chain reaction for detection of food-borne bacterial pathogens.
AB  - DNA-hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are techniques commonly used to detect pathogenic bacteria. In this paper, the use of these techniques for detection of Salmonella, E. coli, V. cholerae, non-O1 Vibrio, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and C. botulinum is reviewed with emphasis on application in food microbiology. In food control, DNA-techniques have most often been used in a 'culture confirmation' fashion, i.e. bacteria are enriched and sometimes even purified by traditional culture procedures and thereafter identified by the use of DNA-based methods. The most desirable approach is, however, to detect organisms directly in the food, but major problems remain to be solved before this can be routinely performed.
TI  - A survey of enteropathogens among United States military personnel during Operation Bright Star '94, in Cairo, Egypt.
AB  - Acute gastroenteritis is a potential cause of substantial morbidity in U.S. military personnel during deployment. This study was conducted to evaluate enteric pathogens associated with diarrhea in a U.S. military population on deployment in Cairo, Egypt, during November 1993. Enteric pathogens found to be associated with cases of diarrhea included: enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), 27% (22% heat-stable [ST], 3% heat-labile [LT], and 2% ST/LT producers); Campylobacter spp., 3%; and Salmonella spp. 3%. Other enteric pathogens, namely Shigella, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, Vibrio spp., Bacillus cereus, and enteric parasites, were not found in any of the 36 patients. Of the 8 patients who were ETEC-positive, three expressed colonization factor antigens (CFA)/II, and two expressed putative colonization factor antigen (PCF) 0159. All of the latter isolates produced ST. ETEC with different surface protein antigens were found to have surface hydrophobicity in the range of 0.2 M to greater than 2.0 M. Plasmid profiles of the ETEC strains showed no correlation with toxin production. In vitro susceptibility testing of the ETEC strain showed that 32% of the strains were resistant to three or more antimicrobial agents, whereas 24% showed 100% susceptibility. The enteropathogens tested were susceptible to norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and nalidixic acid, suggesting that the quinolones might be useful for the treatment of diarrheic patients.
TI  - pH and acidity in lactic-fermenting cereal gruels: effects on viability of enteropathogenic microorganisms.
AB  - Survival of Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella flexneri during lactic acid fermentation of cereal gruels prepared from low-tannin (white) and high-tannin (red) sorghum varieties was studied. A previously fermented gruel (starter culture, SC) recycled daily or stored for 7, 14 or 28 days, germinated cereal flour (power flour, PF), or a combination of PF and SC (PF+SC) were used as starters. At 24 h, the pH of all gruels with added starter was </=4; the pH in control gruels without starter was >/=5.2. pH decrease was significantly faster in gruels made with PF+SC than with either PF or SC alone (P<0.05). A daily recycled SC resulted in a significantly faster decrease in pH (P<0.05) than SC stored for more than 7 days. Acid production was correlated with pH decrease (r=-0.94; P<0.01). In control gruels, the enteropathogens remained at the inoculation level or increased in number. Their growth was inhibited within 24 to 48 h in the fermented gruels, in the order: Bacillus > Campylobacter > Escherichia coli > Salmonella > Shigella. The inhibition rate was significantly faster in fermenting gruel with PF+SC (P<0.05) than in gruel with PF or SC alone and correlated with pH development (r=0.71; P<0.01). Both white and red sorghum gruels gave similar results. Using PF+SC as a starter resulted in a faster decrease in pH as well as a more rapid inhibition of enteropathogenic microorganisms. The effect is optimal if the SC is transferred daily.
TI  - Inhibited growth of common enteropathogenic bacteria in lactic-fermented cereal gruels.
AB  - A natural lactic fermentation of mixtures of water and whole flour of either maize or high-tannin sorghum was obtained either before or after cooking to a weaning gruel: The preparations had a final pH of about 3.8 (range 3.67 to 4.00) and a ratio of lactic acid to acetic acid of 9ratio1 (w/w). The growth of added (about 10(7) c.f.u./g gruel) Gram-negative intestinal pathogenic bacteria, enterotoxigenicEscherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella flexneri andSalmonella typhimurium, was strongly inhibited in the sour gruels, and the effect could primarily be explained by the low pH caused by the formation of lactic and acetic acids during the fermentation process. Of the added Gram-positive bacteria,Bacillus cereus andStaphylococcus aureus showed similar inhibited growth up to 7h after inoculation in the sour gruels. The strain ofStaphylococcus, however, showed only a continued reduction in growth in the fermented gruel samples, which had a viable lactic bacteria culture indicating the presence of a bacteriocin. This implies that a low pH (< 4.0) alone is not sufficient to sustain the inhibition of the growth ofStaphylococcus aureus. The survival studies were carried out at optimal temperatures for each respective enteropathogen.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Microgard against food spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  - Microgard, a commercially available fermented milk product containing antimicrobial metabolites, was a potent inhibitor for Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas, Salmonella, and Yersinia when 1% concentration was incorporated into agar media. Gram-positive Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes were insensitive to Microgard. Kluyveromyces marxianus, an unidentified black yeast, and Penicillium expansum were partially suppressed, whereas Aspergillus niger and a yogurt spoilage yeast were tolerant to 5% Microgard. Optimum activity of Microgard was at pH 5.3 and below; the concentration that gave complete inhibition depended upon the number of bacteria present as well as the genus tested. Blood agar base reversed the antagonistic activity of Microgard against Pseudomonas putida compared with plate count agar.
TI  - Effects of high hydrostatic pressure on characteristics of pork slurries and inactivation of microorganisms associated with meat and meat products.
AB  - Pork slurries inoculated with various test microorganisms were prepared and subjected to high hydrostatic pressure at 1000 to 6000 atm for 10 min at 25 degrees C to examine for the pressure effects on characteristics of the slurries and the inactivation of the microorganisms associated with meat and meat products. Pressure treatment at higher than 3000 atm caused coagulation and discoloration of the pork slurries. Harder and more white coagulants were obtained by increasing the pressure. Pressure treatment at 3000 to 6000 atm killed all the microorganisms tested by more than 6-log colony-forming units (cfu)/g except Bacillus cereus spores. Gram-negative microorganisms were more labile to pressure than Gram-positive ones. Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica were inactivated at pressures higher than 3000 atm; Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida utilis at pressures higher than 4000 atm; Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis at 6000 atm. Only less than one-log cfu/g of B. cereus spores were inactivated at 6000 atm. Ultraviolet absorption spectra and acridine orange staining suggested that E. coli became permeable and leaked cytoplasmic RNA at lower pressure than S. aureus. From the present findings, the authors propose high hydrostatic pressure treatment as a promising means of preparing wholesome meat and meat products.
TI  - Travelers' diarrhea among United States military personnel during joint American-Egyptian armed forces exercises in Cairo, Egypt.
AB  - A study was conducted of travelers' diarrhea in a United States military population on deployment in Cairo, Egypt, during July and August 1987. Acute diarrhea requiring medical attention developed in 183 (4%) of 4,500 troops. A possible etiologic agent was identified in 49% of all diarrhea cases. Enteric pathogens associated with cases of diarrhea included: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (17% ST-producers, 13% LT-producers, and 3% LT/ST-producers); Shigella (9%); Campylobacter spp. (2%); Salmonella (2%); and Vibrio cholerae non-01 serogroup (2%). Other enteric pathogens isolated from one episode each of diarrhea included Aeromonas hydrophila group, Plesiomonas shigelloides, and Bacillus cereus. Yersinia enterocolitica, enteroinvasive E. coli, intoxications by Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile, and pathogenic enteric parasites were not found in any of the 183 patients with diarrhea. A survey of military personnel not requesting medical care indicated that up to 40% of troops may have had diarrhea during this deployment. Acute gastroenteritis is a potential cause of substantial morbidity in U.S. military personnel deployed to Egypt.
TI  - Bacterial aetiology of infantile diarrhoea in Papua New Guinea.
AB  - Bacterial examination of stools of children with diarrhoea was carried out at Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, where little information is available concerning the causative bacteria of diarrhoea. Shigellae, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter jejuni, and Aeromonas hydrophila were isolated with the decreasing frequency in that order. Among these, enterotoxigenic E. coli and C. jejuni were isolated for the first time in this country. Although Vibrio parahaemolyticus was recovered from sea water, no cases suffering from this organism were found.

TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lysozyme against bacteria involved in food spoilage and food-borne disease.
AB  - Egg white lysozyme was demonstrated to have antibacterial activity against organisms of concern in food safety, including Listeria monocytogenes and certain strains of Clostridium botulinum. We also found that the food spoilage thermophile Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum was highly susceptible to lysozyme and confirmed that the spoilage organisms Bacillus stearothermophilus and Clostridium tyrobutyricum were also extremely sensitive. Several gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from food poisoning outbreaks, including Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, and Yersinia enterocolitica, were all resistant. The results of this study suggest that lysozyme may have selected applications in food preservation, especially when thermophilic sporeformers are problems, and as a safeguard against food poisoning caused by C. botulinum and L. monocytogenes.
TI  - Microbiological aspects of goat's milk. A Public Health Laboratory Service survey.
AB  - In a 12-month survey (June 1982-May 1983) 41 laboratories examined 2493 samples of goat's milk for colony counts and the presence of pathogens. The statutory tests for cow's milk were also applied. Surface counts of less than 10(5) organisms per ml of raw milk were given by 79% of samples at 37 degrees C and by 76% at 22 degrees C. There were less than 100 coliforms per ml in 71% of samples, less than 10 Escherichia coli per ml in 91%. Staphylococcus aureus was not detected in countable numbers in 96% of samples. Only one isolation of campylobacter was made and two of Yersinia enterocolitica. Salmonella was not detected in 2462 samples. The methylene blue test was carried out on 2368 samples and 86.7% were deemed satisfactory. No sample was Brucella ring-test-positive. Experiments on the survival and growth of six food poisoning organisms in stored goat's milk showed that Bacillus cereus, Staph. aureus, Salmonella typhimurium and Y. enterocolitica survived quite well and multiplied at the higher storage temperature of 30 degrees C. Clostridium perfringens only increased 10- to 100-fold while Campylobacter jejuni did not grow. The results of the survey indicate that any problems with goat's milk relate to poor hygiene during production rather than transmission of organisms from the goat herself.
TI  - Bacterial enteritis.
AB  
TI  - Recent advances in management of bacterial diarrhea.
AB  - The number of recognized infectious causes of diarrhea potentially treatable with specific antibiotics has markedly increased within the past ten years. Laboratories are developing and expanding their abilities to deal with these new pathogens. Neither prophylaxis nor specific treatment of diarrhea in travelers is simple, practical, and safe. Although enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli is the most important cause of diarrhea in U.S. travelers to tropical areas, Campylobacter jejuni causes acute diarrhea in persons in the United States about as often as do Salmonella and Shigella. Vibrio parahemolyticus is an important cause of outbreaks of gastroenteritis following ingestion of improperly cooked shellfish; Bacillus cereus is important in outbreaks of diarrhea after ingestion of improperly cooked and stored rice in Chinese restaurants. Although Yersinia enterocolitica is probably an important cause of severe enteritis in the United States, imperfect techniques for its isolation and lack of good serologic tests have hampered recognition of its importance. Practical means for diagnosing antibiotic-associated colitis and the role of Clostridium difficile toxins in this disease are now available. Vancomycin, metronidazole, bacitracin, and cholestyramine are useful in treatment of antibiotic-associated colitis.
