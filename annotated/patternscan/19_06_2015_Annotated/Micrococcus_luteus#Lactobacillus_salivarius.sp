TI  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from canine faeces.
AB  == aims: lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated and sequenced from the faeces of healthy dogs. five of these strains were selected and further characterized to clarify the potential of these strains as probiotics for canine. methods and results: lab were found in 67% (14/21) of the canine faeces samples when plated on lactobacilli selective media without acetic acid. out of 13 species identified with partial 16s rrna gene sequencing, lactobacillus fermentum lab8, l. mucosae lab12, l. rhamnosus lab11, l. salivarius lab9 and weissella confusa lab10 were selected as candidate probiotic strains based on their frequency, quantity in faeces, growth density, acid tolerance and antimicrobial activity. the minimal inhibitory concentration values of these isolates were determined for 14 antibiotics. l. salivarius lab9, w. confusa lab10 and l. mucosae lab12 were viable in ph 2 for 4 h (mlbs), indicating tolerance to acidity and thus the potential to survive in gastrointestinal tract of the canine. the lab8-lab12 strains showed antimicrobial activity against micrococcus luteus a1 ncimb86166. conclusions: thirteen different lab species were found from the faecal microbiota of the healthy canines. five acid tolerant and antimicrobially active lab strains with the capacity to grow to high densities both aerobically and anaerobically were chosen to serve as candidate probiotics. significance and impact of the study: the selected lab strains are among the first host-specific lab with antimicrobial activity isolated from canines that could serve as potential probiotics for canine use.

TI  == cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  == cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (cis). when chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of  cis using various microbes such as escherichia coli, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, saccharomyces cerevisiae, saccharomyces ludwigii, and schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. in particular, recovery was improved when l-cysteine was added. a mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto cis could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. most of the desorbed cells were alive. thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by  employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.

TI  == [the capacity of anaerobically grown bacteria to exchange the 2h+ of the cell for the k+ of the medium and to maintain a high k+ distribution between cell and medium].
AB  == the n,n'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide sensitive exchange of 2h+ of a cell for k+ of medium stable to ph, k+ activity and temperature changes has been discovered in anaerobically grown gram-negative escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium. s. enteritidis, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, anaerobic gram-positive bacteria streptococcus faecalis, lactobacillus salivarius, l. lactis in the presence of exogenic energy source. this exchange in gram-negative bacteria is operating only at increase of medium osmolarity. the high k+ distribution between cell and medium has been reached during the exchange of 2h+ for one k+ and the corresponding potassium equilibrium potential is much more than the measured delta psi. in aerobically grown e. coli, s. typhimurium, brevibacterium flavum and aerobic micrococcus luteus exchange of 2h+ for k+ does not take place, the k+ distribution is lower and in good conformity with the measured delta psi. it is assumed that exchange of 2h+ for k+ in anaerobic bacteria is carried out by the h+-atpase complex and the trk (or trk-like) system of k+ absorption united into the same membrane supercomplex which functions as the h+-k+-pump and supports the high k+ distribution between cell and medium.
