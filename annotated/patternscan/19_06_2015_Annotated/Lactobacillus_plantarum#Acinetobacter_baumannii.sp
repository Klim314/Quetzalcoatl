TI  == antibiosis of vineyard ecosystem fungi against food-borne microorganisms.
AB  == fermentation extracts from fungi isolated from vineyard ecosystems were tested for antimicrobial activities against a set of test microorganisms, including five food-borne pathogens (staphylococcus aureus ep167, acinetobacter baumannii (clinically isolated), pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, escherichia coli o157:h7 (cect 5947) and candida albicans my1055) and two probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus plantarum lch17 and lactobacillus brevis lch23). a total of 182 fungi was grown in eight different media, and the fermentation extracts were screened for antimicrobial activity. a total of 71 fungi produced extracts active against at least one pathogenic microorganism, but not against any probiotic bacteria. the gram-positive bacterium s. aureus ep167 was more susceptible to antimicrobial fungi broth extracts than gram-negative bacteria and pathogenic fungi. identification of active fungi based on internal transcribed spacer rrna sequence analysis revealed that species in the orders pleosporales, hypocreales and xylariales dominated. differences in antimicrobial selectivity were observed  among isolates from the same species. some compounds present in the active extracts were tentatively identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.  antimicrobial metabolites produced by vineyard ecosystem fungi may potentially limit colonization and spoilage of food products by food-borne pathogens, with minimal effect on probiotic bacteria.
