TI  - Natural antimicrobials subtilosin and lauramide arginine ethyl ester synergize with conventional antibiotics clindamycin and metronidazole against biofilms of Gardnerella vaginalis but not against biofilms of healthy vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of clindamycin and metronidazole to synergize with natural antimicrobials against biofilms of bacterial vaginosis (BV)-associated Gardnerella vaginalis. Minimum bactericidal concentrations for biofilm cells (MBCs-B) were determined for each antimicrobial. The MBCs-B of lauramide arginine ethyl ester (LAE), subtilosin, clindamycin and metronidazole were 50, 69.5, 20 and 500 mug mL(-1), respectively. A checkerboard assay and isobologram were used to analyze the type of interactions between these antimicrobials. The combination of metronidazole with natural antimicrobials did not inhibit planktonic lactobacilli. Clindamycin with either LAE or with subtilosin was inhibitory for planktonic but not for biofilm-associated lactobacilli. All tested antimicrobial combinations were inhibitory for BV-associated Mobiluncus curtisii and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. LAE and subtilosin synergized with clindamycin and metronidazole against biofilms of G. vaginalis but not biofilm-associated vaginal lactobacilli. The biofilms of BV-associated pathogens can be controlled by synergistically acting combinations of conventional antibiotics and natural antimicrobials which will help better management of current antibiotics, especially considering robust bacterial resistance. Our findings create a foundation for a new strategy in the effective control of vaginal infections.
TI  - Establishment of a sensitive system for analysis of human vaginal microbiota on the basis of rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative PCR.
AB  - Ten specific primer sets, for Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus crispatus, Atopobium vaginae, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus curtisii, Chlamydia trachomatis/muridarum, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and Bifidobacterium angulatum, were developed for quantitative analysis of vaginal microbiota. rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of the vaginal samples from 12 healthy Japanese volunteers using the new primer sets together with 25 existing primer sets revealed the diversity of their vaginal microbiota: Lactobacilli such as L. crispatus, L. gasseri, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus iners, and Lactobacillus vaginalis, as the major populations at 10(7) cells/ml vaginal fluid, were followed by facultative anaerobes such as Streptococcus and strict anaerobes at lower population levels of 10(4) cells/ml or less. Certain bacterial vaginosis (BV)-related bacteria, such as G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, M. curtisii, and Prevotella, were also detected in some subjects. Especially in one subject, both G. vaginalis and A. vaginae were detected at high population levels of 10(8.8) and 10(8.9) cells/ml vaginal fluid, suggesting that she is an asymptomatic BV patient. These results suggest that the RT-qPCR system is effective for accurate analysis of major vaginal commensals and diagnosis of several vaginal infections.
TI  - Quantification of Atopobium vaginae loads may be a new method for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Traditional methods for the diagnosis of BV is either with poor sensitivity or poor specificity. Thus, establishing a new method based on the vaginal flora is vital for the diagnosis of BV. METHODS: This article is a retrospective research. Based on the Amsel criteria and Nugent score, 230 BV-positive patients and 360 healthy women were enrolled, specific PCR and quantitative PCR were applied to quantify 5 BV-associated bacteria, including Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Leptotrichia/Sneathia species, Megasphaera species and Mobiluncus mulieris. ROC curve was facilitated to screen a bacterial panel with optimal sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: Specific PCR showed that the area under ROC curve of A.vag, G.vag + A.vag, G.vag + A.vag + Lepto, G.vag + A.vag + Mega and G.vag + A.vag + M.mul were 0.845, 0.862, 0.865, 0.869 and 0.867, the sensitivity and specificity were higher than 80%, which were practicable methods for the diagnosis of BV. Quantitative PCR showed the area under ROC curve of Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Leptotrichia/Sneathia species, Megasphaera species and Mobiluncus mulieris were 0.959, 0.996, 0.933, 0.748 and 0.639, when the cutoff value of Atopobium vaginae loads was 247,800 copies/mL, the optimal sensitivity and specificity were 0.979 and 0.952, which was distinctly better than specific PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Quantification ofAtopobium vaginae loads may be a new method of excellent sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of BV.
TI  - The composition and stability of the vaginal microbiota of normal pregnant women  is different from that of non-pregnant women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to characterize the vaginal microbiota throughout normal human pregnancy using sequence-based techniques. We compared the vaginal microbial composition of non-pregnant patients with a group of pregnant women who delivered at term. RESULTS: A retrospective case-control longitudinal study was designed and included non-pregnant women (n = 32) and pregnant women who delivered at term (38 to 42 weeks) without complications (n = 22). Serial samples of vaginal fluid were collected from both non-pregnant and pregnant patients. A 16S rRNA gene sequence-based survey was conducted using pyrosequencing to characterize the structure and stability of the vaginal microbiota. Linear mixed effects models and generalized estimating equations were used to identify the phylotypes whose relative abundance was different between the two study groups. The vaginal microbiota of normal pregnant women was different from that of non-pregnant women (higher abundance of Lactobacillus vaginalis, L. crispatus, L. gasseri and L. jensenii and lower abundance of 22 other phylotypes in pregnant women). Bacterial community state type (CST) IV-B or CST IV-A characterized by high relative abundance of species of genus Atopobium as well as the presence of Prevotella, Sneathia, Gardnerella, Ruminococcaceae, Parvimonas, Mobiluncus and other taxa previously shown to be associated with bacterial vaginosis were less frequent in normal pregnancy. The stability of the vaginal microbiota of pregnant women was higher than that of non-pregnant women; however, during normal pregnancy, bacterial communities shift almost exclusively from one CST dominated by Lactobacillus spp. to another CST dominated by Lactobacillus spp. CONCLUSION: We report the first longitudinal study of the vaginal microbiota in normal pregnancy. Differences in the composition and stability of the microbial community between pregnant and non-pregnant women were observed. Lactobacillus spp. were the predominant members of the microbial community in normal pregnancy. These results can serve as the basis to study the relationship between the vaginal microbiome and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
TI  - More than meets the eye: associations of vaginal bacteria with gram stain morphotypes using molecular phylogenetic analysis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a highly prevalent condition associated with adverse  health outcomes. Gram stain analysis of vaginal fluid is the standard for confirming the diagnosis of BV, wherein abundances of key bacterial morphotypes are assessed. These Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, Bacteroides, and Mobiluncus morphotypes were originally linked to particular bacterial species through cultivation studies, but no studies have systematically investigated associations between uncultivated bacteria detected by molecular methods and Gram stain findings. In this study, 16S-rRNA PCR/pyrosequencing was used to examine associations between vaginal bacteria and bacterial morphotypes in 220 women with and without BV. Species-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) and fluorescence in Situ hybridization (FISH) methods were used to document concentrations of two bacteria with curved rod morphologies: Mobiluncus and the fastidious BV-associated bacterium-1 (BVAB1). Rank abundance of vaginal bacteria in samples with evidence of curved gram-negative rods showed that BVAB1 was dominant (26.1%), while Mobiluncus was rare (0.2% of sequence reads). BVAB1 sequence reads were associated with Mobiluncus morphotypes (p<0.001). Among women with curved rods, mean concentration of BVAB1 DNA was 2 log units greater than Mobiluncus (p<0.001) using species-specific quantitative PCR. FISH analyses revealed that mean number of BVAB1 cells was 2 log units greater than Mobiluncus cells in women with highest Nugent score (p<0.001). Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. were significantly associated with the "Bacteroides morphotype," whereas Bacteroides species were rare. Gram-negative rods designated Mobiluncus morphotypes on Gram stain are more likely BVAB1. These findings provide a clearer picture of the bacteria associated with morphotypes on vaginal Gram stain.
TI  - Fast and effective paper based sensor for self-diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - In this contribution we present a sensitive colorimetric bioactive paper fabricated to determine sialidase-related diseases like bacterial vaginosis (BV) in a one-step and dry format spot assay with fast response and good storage stability. The paper was prepared by three simple steps. The first step involves preparation of poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) microcapsules, the second step is to incubate positively charged microcapsules in negatively charged 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-a-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (BCIN) solution, a color enhancer nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT), and in the third step, paper was fabricated by incorporating incubated microcapsules into paper pulp. This paper changes color from white to dark purple in the presence of sialidase in as little as 6min, and color could be enhanced with increased length of reaction time. In this reaction system, BCIN was the substrate for sialidase, NBT was the color enhancer, and PEI microcapsules acted as catalyst. The loading efficiency of BCIN was about 22.2%, and filtered BCIN solution could be reused for the next fabrication.
TI  - [Diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is a common, complex clinical syndrome characterized by alterations in the normal vaginal flora. When symptomatic, it is associated with a malodorous vaginal discharge and on occasion vaginal burning or itching. Under normal conditions, lactobacilli constitute 95% of the bacteria in the vagina. Bacterial vaginosis is associated with severe reduction or absence of the normal H2O2-producing lactobacilli and overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria and Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Mycoplasma hominis and Mobiluncus species. Most types of infectious disease are diagnosed by culture, by isolating an antigen or RNA/DNA from the microbe, or by serodiagnosis to determine the presence of antibodies to the microbe. Therefore, demonstration of the presence of an infectious agent is often a necessary criterion for the diagnosis of the disease. This is not the case for bacterial vaginosis, since the ultimate cause of the disease is not yet known. There are a variety of methods for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis but no method can at present be regarded as the best. Diagnosing bacterial vaginosis has long been based on the clinical criteria of Amsel, whereby three of four defined criteria must be satisfied. Nugent's scoring system has been further developed and includes validation of the categories of observable bacteria structures. Up-to-date molecular tests are introduced, and better understanding of vaginal microbiome, a clear definition for bacterial vaginosis, and short-term and long-term fluctuations in vaginal microflora will help to better define molecular tests within the broader clinical context.
TI  - Biomedical applications of fermenticin HV6b isolated from Lactobacillus fermentum HV6b MTCC10770.
AB  - Fermenticin HV6b is a class IIa antimicrobial peptide produced by Lactobacillus fermentum HV6b MTCC 10770 isolated from human vaginal ecosystem. It shows growth inhibition of a wide range of opportunistic pathogens of humans, for example, Bacteroides, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus, Staphylococci, and Streptococci, associated with bacterial vaginosis in humans. It does possess an impressive sperm immobilization and spermicidal activity tested against human sperms which makes it an attractive proposition for formulating antibacterial vaginosis and contraceptive products. Apart from this, in vitro studies conducted against four different tissue models have indicated its potential to be used as a component of anticancerous drug therapy as it is reported to induce apoptosis in cancerous cells. This information could be integrated in future studies focusing on in vivo assessment of anticancerous activity of lactic acid bacterial toxins or bacteriocins.
TI  - [Vaginal infections in pregnant women at the Regional Hospital of Sokode (Togo) in 2010 and 2011].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of the major microorganisms causing vaginal infections in pregnant women consulting at the Regional Hospital of Sokode and to assess their sensitivity to antibiotics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study took place from June 2010 through August 2011 and included 302 pregnant women from whom a sample was taken by a vaginal swab. Samples were processed for parasitic, bacterial, and fungal agents, by microscopic examination and culture. RESULTS: We isolated 273 germs, alone or in association in 221 women. These germs were distributed as follows: Gardnerella vaginalis (55.31%), Candida spp (30.77%), Staphylococcus aureus (5.49%), Enterobacteriaceae (4.40%), Trichomonas vaginalis (3.66%) and Mobiluncus spp (0.37%). No Streptococcus strain was isolated during the study. Over 40% of women had bacterial vaginosis and 23.08% of them were coinfected. The occurrence of coinfection was statistically influenced by the stage of pregnancy (P = 0.05). The susceptibility tests revealed that S. aureus developed a strong resistance to aminopenicillins (66.67%) and cephalosporins (>44.44%), while Enterobacteriaceae was resistant to cephalosporins and quinolones. (16.67%). CONCLUSION: This study showed that pregnant women in Sokode are still exposed to vaginal infection, caused mostly by G. vaginalis and Candida species. These results underline the need for at least one vaginal swab culture for each woman during pregnancy.
TI  - [Bacterial vaginosis. Treatment of the relapse].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal infection in women of reproductive age. Bacterial vaginosis is an ecological disorder that ensues when normal lactobacilli are replaced by large numbers of Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella sp., Bacteroides sp., Mobiluncus sp. and M. hominis. Numerous studies have consistently shown that BV at 12-24 weeks are associated with increased risks of preterm birth (PTB), preterm rupture of the membranes, chorioamnionitis, fetal infection and cerebral palsy. Deficiencies in local immunity may predispose women to BV.
TI  - [Microscopic examination of vaginal discharge specimens for Trichomonas vaginalis and other micro-organisms in 18-45 age group women].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Trichomonas vaginalis is a protozoon that causes trichomoniasis which  is characterised by a foamy yellowish odorous discharge and superficial defects and necrotic ulcers in vaginal mucosa. Trichomoniasis is transmitted from human to human by sexual contact and can be seen in almost every part of the world. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of Trichomonas vaginalis in 18-45 years age group women with vaginal discharge complaints who applied to the Gynaecology Outpatient Clinic of Konya Social Insurance Instution Hospital during September 1-December 15 2003. METHODS: Samples were taken from posterior fornix of the vagina with the aid of a speculum and sterile cotton swabs. All the samples were examined by wet mount preparations, Gram and Giemsa staining method under the light microscope. RESULTS: Of seventy samples 6 (9%) were positive for Trichomonas vaginalis, 9 (13%) for Gardnerella vaginalis, one for Mobiluncus spp. and 11 (16%) for Candida spp. CONCLUSION: It is possible to say that, in spite of a definite diagnosis of trichomoniasis made by cultivation method, examining the vaginal smear by direct microscope also has an important role in the diagnosis of infection. Direct microscopic examination will help in deciding whether to begin the treatment of trichomoniasis.
TI  - The anti-HIV microbicide candidate RC-101 inhibits pathogenic vaginal bacteria without harming endogenous flora or mucosa.
AB  - PROBLEM: Vaginal microbicides represent a promising approach for preventing heterosexual HIV transmission. However, preclinical evaluation should be conducted to ensure that microbicides will be safe for human cells and healthy microflora of the female reproductive tract. One microbicide candidate, RC-101, has been effective and well tolerated in preliminary cell culture and macaque models. However, the effect of RC-101 on primary vaginal tissues and resident vaginal microflora requires further evaluation. METHOD OF STUDY: We treated primary vaginal tissues and vaginal bacteria, both pathogenic and commensal, with RC-101 to investigate effects of this microbicide. RESULTS: RC-101 was well tolerated by host tissues, and also by commensal vaginal bacteria. Simultaneously, pathogenic vaginal bacteria, which are known to increase susceptibility to HIV acquisition, were inhibited by RC-101. CONCLUSIONS: By establishing vaginal microflora, the specific antibacterial activity of RC-101 may provide a dual mechanism of HIV protection. These findings support advancement of RC-101 to clinical trials.
TI  - Association between Trichomonas vaginalis and vaginal bacterial community composition among reproductive-age women.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Some vaginal bacterial communities are thought to prevent infection by sexually transmitted organisms. Prior work demonstrated that the vaginal microbiota of reproductive-age women cluster into 5 types of bacterial communities; 4 dominated by Lactobacillus species (L. iners, L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. jensenii) and 1 (termed community state type (CST) IV) lacking significant numbers of lactobacilli and characterized by higher proportions of Atopobium, Prevotella, Parvimonas, Sneathia, Gardnerella, Mobiluncus, and other taxa. We sought to evaluate the relationship between vaginal bacterial composition and Trichomonas vaginalis. METHODS: Self-collected vaginal swabs were obtained cross-sectionally from 394 women equally representing 4 ethnic/racial groups. T. vaginalis screening was performed using PCR targeting the 18S rRNA and beta-tubulin genes. Vaginal bacterial composition was characterized by pyrosequencing of barcoded 16S rRNA genes. A panel of 11 microsatellite markers was used to genotype T. vaginalis. The association between vaginal microbiota and T. vaginalis was evaluated by exact logistic regression. RESULTS: T. vaginalis was detected in 2.8% of participants (11/394). Of the 11 T. vaginalis-positive cases, 8 (72%) were categorized as CST-IV, 2 (18%) as communities dominated by L. iners, and 1 (9%) as L. crispatus-dominated (P = 0.05). CST-IV microbiota were associated with an 8-fold increased odds of detecting T. vaginalis compared with women in the L. crispatus-dominated state (OR: 8.26, 95% CI: 1.07-372.65). Seven of the 11 T. vaginalis isolates were assigned to 2 genotypes. CONCLUSION: T. vaginalis was associated with vaginal microbiota consisting of low proportions of lactobacilli and high proportions of Mycoplasma, Parvimonas, Sneathia, and other anaerobes.
TI  - Presence of high-grade intraepithelial lesions among women deprived of their liberty: a documental study.
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the results of the Pap smears of women deprived of their liberty. It is a retrospective, documental study, with a quantitative approach, performed in a female prison of Ceara, Brazil, with a sample of 672 patient records. Regarding the microbiological findings, it was verified that the main cervical-vaginal colonization was by bacilli suggestive of Gardnerella/Mobiluncus (21.8%), followed by Trichomonas vaginalis (12%), and Candida sp (5.8%). The frequencies of samples with atypical cells presented rates of 4.1% for Atypical Cells of Undetermined Significance; 3.2% for Low-grade Intraepithelial Lesions; and 2.5% for High-grade Intraepithelial Lesions. The importance of screening for cervical cancer in female prisons was highlighted, as well as the inclusion of the nurse in this environment, ensuring individualized, quality care for women deprived of their liberty.
TI  - [Possible role of enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis in the etiology of infectious vaginitis].
AB  - Vaginitis is a common gynecologic disorder. It is due to several causes, some even unknown. Bacteroides fragilis is the most important anaerobe in clinical bacteriology, some strains of this group are notable for being enterotoxigenic and they have been associated with intestinal and extraintestinal syndromes. They have recently been isolated from patients with vaginitis. The purpose of this study was to investigate a possible association of enterotoxigenic B. fragilis with infectious vaginitis. 265 samples of vaginal exudate were processed, 202 from symptomatic patients and 63 healthy women. The identification of the microorganisms was carried out by conventional methods. In 31.2% of symptomatic patients were identified: Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus, Candida albicans, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum and Streptococcus agalactiae. B. fragilis was identified in 27 symptomatic patients and 5 healthy women. These strains were cultivated in liquid medium and incubated during 48 h at 36 degrees C in anaerobe chambers. Supernatant activity was assayed in HT-29 cells. Eighteen B. fragilis strains isolated from symptomatic patients were enterotoxigenic, because induced alterations in target cell morphology. It was not identified in healthy women (P < 0.05). 77.7% of enterotoxigenic B. fragilis strains were not associated with other specific pathogens. This fact suggests that enterotoxigenic B. fragilis could be a cause for vaginitis. The effect of enterotoxin on E-cadherin of vaginal epithelium could facilitate invasion and its possible pathogenic role in the vagina. This is the first report that associates enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis as a possible cause of infectious vaginitis.
TI  - Inguinal syndrome secondary to Prevotella bivia after accidental bite in orogenital sex.
AB  - The authors report a case of an inguinal bubo in a young man caused by an anaerobe, Prevotella bivia, which was acquired during oral sexual intercourse. As far as the authors know, this is the first reported case of a sexually transmitted infection by Prevotella. Prevotella spp. inhabit the oral cavity and are highly prevalent in bacterial vaginosis, a polymicrobial syndrome resulting from replacement of the normal vaginal Lactobacillus spp. flora by high concentrations of anaerobic microorganisms such as Prevotella spp., Mobiluncus spp., Gardnerella vaginalis and other uncultivated anaerobes.
TI  - [Evaluation of efficacy of ketoconazole 800 mg-clindamycin 100 mg tablets vaginal against ketoconazole 800 mg- clindamycin 100 mg vaginal capsules in candida vaginitis and vaginosis].
AB  - BACKGROUND: pharmaceutical forms (presentations) influence treatment compliance and therefore the effectiveness. Here we present the results in the relief of vaginitis and vaginosis with two different dosage forms. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of a combination of ketoconazole 800 mg + clindamycin in soft vaginal gel capsules 100 mg (vaginal capsules) against ketoconazole 800 mg + 100 mg clindamycin vaginal tablets (TV) in the management of vaginitis by C. albicans and/or vaginosis. MATERIAL AND METHOD: In a randomized, multicenter, comparative open label study, patients between 18 and 60 years with a diagnosis of vaginitis by C. albicans and/or vaginosis were included. Patients were evaluated clinically and direct exam of genital discharge and culture were performed. Patients were randomized to one of two treatments vaginal tablets or vaginal capsules, for 3 days. RESULTS: one hundred an sitxty nine patients were included, 85 in TV Group and 84 in vaginal capsules group. We found significant statistical difference in clinical response for tablet group at day three for burning p = 0.032 and itching p = 0.043. Microbiological cure was observed in patients with vaginitis by C. albicans, 92.5% in Group TV vs. 90.47% vaginal capsules group, all patients with G. vaginalis at baseline were negative for the organism at the end of the study, cure in patients with mixed infections were 78.94% for TV group vs. 78.26% vaginal capsules; group no adverse events were reported during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of vaginitis/vaginosis with vaginal tablets is clinically better than vaginal soft gelatin capsules both treatments were well tolerated.
TI  - The complex vaginal flora of West African women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The spectrum of bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV) has recently expanded through taxonomic changes and the use of molecular methods. These methods have yet to be used in large-scale epidemiological studies in Africa where BV is highly prevalent. METHODS: An analysis of samples obtained during a clinical trial of the management of vaginal discharge in four West African countries. Samples were available from 1555 participants; 843 (54%) had BV. Nucleic acids of 13 bacterial genera or species potentially associated with BV were detected through the polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The associations between various components of the vaginal flora were complex. Excluding Lactobacillus, the other 12 micro-organisms were all associated with each other at the p</=0.001 level. The prevalence of various bacterial genera or species varied according to age, sexual activity and HIV status. In multivariate analysis, the presence of Gardnerella vaginalis, Bifidobacterium, Megasphaera elsdenii, Dialister, Mycoplasma hominis, Leptotrichia, and Prevotella were independently associated with BV as was the absence of Lactobacillus and Peptoniphilus. However, Mobiluncus, Atopobium vaginae, Anaerococcus, and Eggerthella were not independently associated with BV. Unexpectedly, after treatment with a regimen that included either metronidazole or tinidazole, the proportion of patients with a complete resolution of symptoms by day 14 increased with the number of bacterial genera or species present at enrolment. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous bacterial genera or species were strongly associated with each other in a pattern that suggested a symbiotic relationship. BV cases with a simpler flora were less likely to respond to treatment. Overall, the vaginal flora of West African women with BV was reminiscent of that of their counterparts in industrialized countries.
TI  - Vaginal flora changes on Pap smears after insertion of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) combines a uterine foreign body and the continuous release of low-dose levonorgestrel for contraception. Its influence on the rate of vulvovaginal infections and flora disturbance is insufficiently known, but important for contraceptive advice in women, especially those who develop recurrent vaginosis or Candida vulvovaginitis. STUDY DESIGN: Slides of 286 women who had a Pap smear taken before and 1 to 2 years after placement of a LNG-IUS were blindly reviewed for the presence of abnormal vaginal flora (AVF), bacterial vaginosis (BV), aerobic vaginitis (AV) and Candida vaginitis (CV). RESULTS: Prior to insertion, there were no differences in vaginal flora abnormalities between women using different kinds of contraception. LNG-IUS users did not have different rates of AVF, BV, AV or CV, but the general risk to develop any infection was increased. Uterine bleeding after insertion did not seem to predict a different flora type. CONCLUSION: We found that Pap smears suggested more vaginal infections after 1 year of LNG-IUS use than prior to insertion of the device.
TI  - Diagnosis and management of bacterial vaginosis and other types of abnormal vaginal bacterial flora: a review.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common cause of abnormal vaginal discharge. It is characterised by an overgrowth of predominantly anaerobic organisms (Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella spp., Peptostreptocci, Mobiluncus spp.) in the vagina leading to a replacement of lactobacilli and an increase in vaginal pH. BV can arise and remit spontaneously, but often presents as a chronic or recurrent disease. BV is found most often in women of childbearing age, but may also be encountered in menopausal women, and is rather rare in children. The clinical and microscopic features and diagnosis of BV are herein reviewed, and antibiotic and non-antibiotic treatment approaches discussed. TARGET AUDIENCE: Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians. LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After completion of this educational activity, the participant should be better able to analyze bacterial vaginosis clinically, formulate an oral antibiotic treatment regimen for bacterial vaginosis and use vaginal treatments for bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - [Clinical and microbiological profile of women with bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - PURPOSE: to study the clinical and microbiological profile of women with bacterial vaginosis participating in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, which compared the vaginal use of preparations from red pepper tree and metronidazole for the treatment of genital discharge. METHODS: the study was conducted on a series of 277 women with bacterial vaginosis concomitantly diagnosed by the criteria of Amsel and Nugent, selected from a total of 462 recruited patients using the information obtained before intervention. Data were analyzed with the Epi-Info 3.32 software. In order to compare the outcomes frequencies between the intervention groups, the chi2 test was used and the risk ratio and 95% confidence interval were calculated. The intention to treat analysis was performed. In addition to the determination of diagnostic parameters, the culture of vaginal content and a Papanicolaou cytology test were also performed. RESULTS: the most frequent clinical complaints were genital discharge, observed in 206 participants (74.4%) and the fish odor of the vaginal secretion, which occurred in 68.6% of the cases (190 patients). Among the diagnostic clinical criteria, the presence of clue-cells was positive in 275 women (99.3%), the Whiff test, in 266 (96.0%), followed by pH >4.5, which occurred in 92.8% of the cases, and by the presence of fluid grayish discharge reported by 206 participants (74.4%). Regarding the Nugent criterion, the median score was 8.0. Culture of the vaginal content permitted the identification of Gardnerella vaginalis in 96.8% of cases and of Mobiluncus in 53.1%. Only one third of the exams showed the presence of Lactobacillus (89 women - 32.1%). Fungal growth occurred in the cultures of 14 participants (5.1%). In most cases, culture revealed the presence of Corynebacterium (94.2%), Gram-positive cocci (98.2%), as well as Gram-positive (99.3%) and Gram-negative (91.0%) bacilli. Oncotic colposcopy revealed a very scarce presence of lactobacilli, which were present in only 8 cytological exams (2.9%) out of the total of 273 exams performed. CONCLUSIONS: the results of the present study did not differ from the literature regarding the symptoms reported by the women, the clinical criteria most frequently observed in the diagnosis, or the bacterial species detected in cultures of vaginal content. These findings indicate the need for further studies that might better elucidate the interrelations between the microbiological findings and the clinical expression of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - In vitro inhibitory activity of human vaginal lactobacilli against pathogenic bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis in Kenyan women.
AB  - Lactobacilli have been shown to inhibit in vitro growth of many pathogens and have been used as probiotics to treat a broad range of gastrointestinal and/or vaginal disorders. We sought to determine the in vitro inhibitory potential of lactobacilli of vaginal origin to some bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV), to characterize the inhibitory substances produced by these lactobacilli and to assess H2O2 production. Vaginal specimens were obtained by swabbing the lateral vaginal walls from 107 women two months following BV treatment. One hundred and fifty eight Lactobacillus spp. were isolated in 82 of the 107 women. Lactobacillus jensenii was the predominant strain isolated among these women (29/158; 18.4%). Among 158 culture supernatants tested for antibacterial activity against BV-associated bacteria, none inhibited the growth of Bacteroides fragilis while 23% (37/158), 28% (45/158) and 29% (46/158) inhibited the growth of Prevotella bivia, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus spp. respectively. The lactobacilli produced supernatants with a pH range between 2.62 and 6.71; the highly acidic (pH 2-3.99) supernatants were more inhibitory to the indicator strains. There was significant reduction in the mean zones of inhibition following chemical and physical treatment of the supernatants (p = 0.0025). Acid, bacteriocins and H2O2 demonstrated potential for antagonism of the bacterial pathogens. These substances may augment each other rather that each working independently on the pathogens.
TI  - Microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina in male-to-female transsexuals is a recently created microbial niche which thus far has been characterized only to a very limited extent. Yet the knowledge of this microflora can be considered as essential to the follow-up of transsexual women. The primary objective of this study was to map the neo-vaginal microflora in a group of 50 transsexual women for whom a neovagina was constructed by means of the inverted penile skin flap technique. Secondary objectives were to describe possible correlations of this microflora with multiple patients' characteristics, such as sexual orientation, the incidence of vaginal irritation and malodorous vaginal discharge. RESULTS: Based on Gram stain the majority of smears revealed a mixed microflora that had some similarity with bacterial vaginosis (BV) microflora and that contained various amounts of cocci, polymorphous Gram-negative and Gram-positive rods, often with fusiform and comma-shaped rods, and sometimes even with spirochetes. Candida cells were not seen in any of the smears. On average 8.6 species were cultured per woman. The species most often found were: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus anginosus group spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium sp., Mobiluncus curtisii and Bacteroides ureolyticus. Lactobacilli were found in only one of 30 women. There was no correlation between dilatation habits, having coitus, rinsing habits and malodorous vaginal discharge on the one hand and the presence of a particular species on the other. There was however a highly significant correlation between the presence of E. faecalis on the one hand and sexual orientation and coitus on the other (p = 0.003 and p = 0.027 respectively). Respectively 82%, 58% and 30% of the samples showed an amplicon after amplification with M. curtisii, Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis primer sets. CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to describe the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women. It reveals a mixed microflora of aerobe and anaerobe species usually found either on the skin, in the intestinal microflora or in a BV microflora.
TI  - Longitudinal trajectory of bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to characterize the course of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy and to discern the bacterial morphotypes responsible for infection. STUDY DESIGN: Vaginal secretions were obtained in each trimester of pregnancy and were evaluated for bacterial vaginosis by Gram stain, categorized as normal or any of the following: Lactobacillus deficient, Gardnerella, Bacteroides, or Mobiluncus positive and by Nugent score. Results were evaluated for trends of bacterial vaginosis and Gram stain over pregnancy. RESULTS: One hundred forty-eight women were evaluated. Seventy-one women (48%) were bacterial vaginosis negative in all trimesters, compared with 14 (9.4%) who were positive throughout pregnancy. Among the 14 women who remained bacterial vaginosis positive, Gram stain findings were Gardnerella+Bacteroides+Lactobacillus, with approximately 50% harboring Mobiluncus. Few women become bacterial vaginosis positive as pregnancy progressed (6.1%). With each increasing week of pregnancy, the risk of becoming bacterial vaginosis positive decreased (0.93: 0.91-0.95; P < .001). CONCLUSION: In this population, the majority of pregnant women trend toward bacterial vaginosis negative status. Few women are bacterial vaginosis positive across their pregnancy.
TI  - Quantitative survival of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in Port-A-Cul and Copan transport systems.
AB  - Transport media should preserve the viability and stability of microorganisms in  clinical specimens. In this study, the Port-A-Cul transport system and the Copan transport system without charcoal, both designed to preserve anaerobes, were evaluated. Dacron swabs were inoculated with two combinations of facultative and anaerobic organisms typically found in vaginal swab samples. Combination I contained Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., group B streptococci, Lactobacillus crispatus, and Staphylococcus aureus. Combination II contained Lactobacillus iners, Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, Mycoplasma hominis, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella corporis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Mobiluncus curtisii, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Gardnerella vaginalis. Duplicate swabs were placed into the two transporters and held for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 4 and 24 degrees C. Both transporters maintained the viability of organisms better at 4 degrees C than at 24 degrees C. Prevotella bivia and Prevotella corporis had a loss of viability in both transporters at both temperatures. However, at 24 degrees C, there was a significantly greater loss of viability for Mycoplasma hominis, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella corporis, and Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus when the organisms were stored in Copan transport medium than when they were stored in Port-A-Cul transport medium for 96 h (P < 0.002). Some organisms proliferated in the transport media, but when transporters were held at 24 degrees C for 96 h, a significantly greater increase in the concentrations of group B streptococci and Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus spp. organisms in Copan medium than in Port-A-Cul medium was observed (P < 0.002). At room temperature, the Port-A-Cul system is superior to the Copan system with respect to the preservation of fastidious microorganisms and the prevention of the proliferation of facultative organisms.
TI  - Molecular quantification of Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae loads to  predict bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a poorly detected public health problem that is associated with preterm delivery and for which no reliable diagnostic tool exists. METHODS: Molecular analysis of 231 vaginal samples, classified by Gram stain-based Nugent score, was used to propose molecular criteria for BV; these criteria were prospectively applied to 56 new samples. A quantitative molecular tool targeting 8 BV-related microorganisms and a human gene was developed using a specific real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and serial dilutions of a plasmid suspension. The targeted microorganisms were Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus species, Mobiluncus curtisii, Mobiluncus mulieris, and Candida albicans (which can be identified by Gram staining), as well as Atopobium vaginae, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum (which cannot be detected by Gram staining). RESULTS: With use of the Nugent score, 167 samples were classified as normal, 20 were classified as BV, and 44 were classified as intermediate. Except for U. urealyticum, M. mulieris, and Lactobacillus species, DNA of the tested bacteria was detected more frequently in samples demonstrating BV, but the predictive value of such detection was low. The molecular quantification of A. vaginae (DNA level, > or = 10(8) copies/mL) and G. vaginalis (DNA level, > or = 10(9) copies/mL) had the highest predictive value for the diagnosis of BV, with excellent sensitivity (95%), specificity (99%), and positive (95%) and negative (99%) predictive values; 25 (57%) of the samples demonstrating intermediate flora had a BV profile. When applied prospectively, our molecular criteria had total positive and negative predictive values of 96% and 99%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We report a highly reproducible, quantitative tool to objectively analyze vaginal flora that uses cutoff values for the concentrations of A. vaginae and G. vaginalis to establish the molecular diagnosis of BV.
TI  - The lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, SLPI- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (CDH).
AB  - In the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. Also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique (CDH) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (Bacteroides ureolyticus, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella disiens, Prevotella melaninogenica, Atopobium vaginae, Lactobacillus iners, Staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, and Streptococcus agalactiae). The bacterial species found by either culture or CDH were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. Grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (BV) as based on Gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable counts of lactobacilli (L. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. In BV, particularly the high concentrations of Actinomyces urogenitalis, Atopobium vaginae, and Peptoniphilus harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). The total viable counts correlated with both cervical IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. A strong negative correlation was observed between L. iners and total viable counts, G. vaginalis, or cervical IL-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with SLPI. Analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by CDH showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by CDH compared to culture. By this method, A. vaginae correlated with G. vaginalis, and L. iners with S. aureus. With regard to cytokines, B. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal IL-1 alpha as well as with cervical IL-8, while F. nucleatum, S. agalactiae, S. anginosus, or S. aureus correlated with vaginal IL-1 alpha. Furthermore, all Gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by CDH, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal SLPI. The significance of the results is discussed. In summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. CDH appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.
TI  - [The bacterial vaginosis--treatment problems].
AB  - The changes in vaginal ecosystem (decreasing number of H2O2 producing Lactobacillus spp. and increasing number of Mobiluncus spp., Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella spp., Mycoplasma hominis, Peptostreptococcus spp.) appears to be a major cause of bacterial vaginosis (BV). Bacterial vaginosis is associated with infectious complications in pregnant and non-pregnant women and increasing risk of STI. The preventive role of natural vaginal microflora and problems of BV treatment are discussed in the light of the recent publications.
TI  - The International Infections in Pregnancy (IIP) study: variations in the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis and distribution of morphotypes in vaginal smears among pregnant women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis and the distribution of associated morphotypes among asymptomatic pregnant women in different countries. STUDY DESIGN: In 8 institutions participating in the Global Network for Perinatal and Reproductive Health (www.gnprh.org) from July 1999 to September 2001, 1466 women were enrolled. Vaginal smears were Gram stained and scored with Nugent's method at a reference laboratory. The prevalence of bacterial vaginosis and bacterial morphotype distributions were compared. RESULTS: Overall, 12.3% of women had bacterial vaginosis according to Nugent's criteria. Zimbabwe had the highest prevalence (24.4%) when compared with all other sites, except Myanmar (P < .05). Among bacterial vaginosis cases, 98.9% of vaginal smears had more than 30 Gardnerella/Bacteroides morphotypes present per oil immersion field. Individual centers showed significant differences in the number of Mobiluncus and lactobacillus morphotypes (P < .01). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of bacterial vaginosis and distribution of bacterial morphotypes in vaginal smears among asymptomatic pregnant women vary significantly in populations from different countries.
TI  - [Vaginosis in patients with antenatal foetus death].
AB  - Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of bacterial vaginosis as well as of vaginal anaerobe flora (Mycoplasma Hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides spp. and Mobiluncus curtisii) was performed in women with antenatal foetus death. Specimens from forty women with this pathology were studied. Control group consisted of 100 pregnant women of the adequate age groups and gestation periods, but with live foetus. Vaginal smears treated by the use of polymerase chain reaction method showed that in the cases of antenatal foetus death in 70% of women Lactobacillus spp. was completely absent. This bacterium was observed only in 30% of these women. In 75% of women with live foetus Lactobacillus spp. was observed, while in 25% it was not present. Increase of quantity of anaerobic vaginal flora was observed in women, where the antenatal death of foetus was diagnosed. Percentage significance of these indices in women with live foetus was comparatively lower.
TI  - Variation in vaginal immune parameters and microbial hydrolytic enzymes in bacterial vaginosis positive pregnant women with and without Mobiluncus species.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to assess if levels of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-8, sialidase, prolidase and immunoglobulin A against Gardenerella vaginalis hemolysin (anti-Gvh IgA) in vaginal secretions differ between BV+ women with (M+) and without (M-) Mobiluncus spp. STUDY DESIGN: Vaginal secretions were obtained from 265 women at their first prenatal care visit and assessed for all study parameters. Gram stain evaluation using Nugent criteria was performed and coinfection with sexually transmitted infections determined. Differences between BV+/M+ and BV+/M- women were evaluated using the chi2 statistic or Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Of the 265 BV+ women, 43% (n = 113) were M+ of which 97% (n = 110) had Nugent scores of 9 or 10 . BV+/M+ women had elevated levels of sialidase (median value: 4.11 nmol vs 1.91 nmol of converted substrate; P = .003) but no difference in prolidase, anti-Gvh IgA, IL-1beta, IL-8, levels were found between the two groups. BV+/M- women had significantly higher rates of coinfection with Trichomonas vaginalis. CONCLUSION: BV+/M+ women have higher vaginal concentrations of sialidase and lower rates of T. vaginalis compared with BV+/M- women. Further research is needed to assess the association of this, and other, microbiologic profiles to risk of adverse pregnancy outcome.
TI  - Treatment and management of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy: current and future  perspectives.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis accounts for the majority of cases of vaginal discharge and has been consistently linked to an increased risk of preterm delivery. Bacterial vaginosis is characterized by the reduced number or absence of hydrogen peroxide-producing Lactobacillus spp., which promotes the overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria, including Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Bacteroides spp., and Mobiluncus spp. Black race, higher-risk sexual activity, frequent vaginal douching and the substantial reduction of hydrogen peroxide-producing Lactobacillus spp. are the main predictors of bacterial vaginosis development. Clinical- and laboratory-based bacterial vaginosis diagnostic tests are widely used to screen for bacterial vaginosis but, more recently, office-based bacterial vaginosis screening tools have been developed. Although systemic treatment for bacterial vaginosis with metronidazole or clindamycin has been demonstrated to be effective in the short-term cure of bacterial vaginosis, recurrence of bacterial vaginosis within 3 months of treatment is common, and treatment for bacterial vaginosis using these strategies has not been effective in reducing the risk of preterm delivery.
TI  - A preliminary survey of Atopobium vaginae in women attending the Dunedin gynaecology out-patients clinic: is the contribution of the hard-to-culture microbiota overlooked in gynaecological disorders?
AB  - Preliminary studies have indicated that the recently described bacterium Atopobium vaginae may have an association with bacterial vaginosis (BV). Fifty-five women attending the gynaecology out-patient's clinic were tested for the presence of this micro-organism, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus and Bacteroides species by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays. The frequency of detection was 40%. PCR detection of Gardnerella vaginalis with A. vaginae, occurred in 50% of A. vaginae-positive cases. Due to the high detection rate of A. vaginae we believe that it is important to determine whether this and other hard-to-culture microorganisms have a role in gynaecological disorders.
TI  - Use of DNA hybridization to detect vaginal pathogens associated with bacterial vaginosis among asymptomatic pregnant women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether microbial DNA hybridization is a useful method to study bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant women. STUDY DESIGN: Vaginal specimens were collected at <26 weeks' gestation from 230 women, and analyzed for bacterial vaginosis by both Gram stain using Nugent criteria and DNA hybridization for Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, Bacteroides ureolyticus, and Mobiluncus curtisii. Results were analyzed using McNemar's paired test and chi-square test for trend, with significance set at P < .05. RESULTS: By Gram stain, 60 (26.1%) of 230 were positive for bacterial vaginosis, and 134 (58.3%) were negative. By DNA hybridization, 99 (43%) were positive for at least 1 pathogen, and DNA results were significantly associated with Gram-stain results (P < .01). As the Nugent score progressed from normal to abnormal flora, the proportion with >1 pathogen detected by DNA hybridization increased significantly (P < .001). CONCLUSION: DNA hybridization may be a useful method to study shifts in vaginal flora during pregnancy.
TI  - Variation in microbiologic profiles among pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine if clinical findings and sociodemographic variables among bacterial vaginosis (BV)-positive pregnant women are associated with different microbiologic profiles. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant women were assessed for BV by Nugent criteria. BV+ women were separated into 6 mutually exclusive microbiologic groups. In unadjusted analyses, we compared (1) sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics, and (2) 3 clinical characteristics among BV+ women with and without Mobiluncus (M+ vs M-). Unadjusted data were analyzed using the chi-square test. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the likelihood of having clinical signs of BV in women with and without Mobiluncus spp while controlling for confounders. RESULTS: A total of 1756 BV+ pregnant women were followed. The M+ group (n=702) was significantly more likely than the M- group (n=1054) to be non-Hispanic black (80.9% vs 66.2%; P < .0001), older than 21 years (61.7% vs 48.7%; P < .0001), and to have had more than 3 lifetime sexual partners (66.4% vs 54.9%; P < .0001). The M+ group was also more likely to have clue cells on wet mount (63.9% vs 47.2%; P < .0001) and a positive amine odor after addition of KOH (57.2% vs 45.0%; P=.001). There was no difference in other demographic variables or physician diagnosis of abnormal vaginal discharge. In the adjusted analyses for each clinical outcome, all findings were consistent with the unadjusted analyses. CONCLUSION: BV+ pregnant women with Mobiluncus spp are more likely to have clue cells present on wet mount, a positive amine odor after KOH preparation, and to be older, non-Hispanic black, and have had more lifetime sexual partners compared to BV+ women without any Mobiluncus species.
TI  - Vaginal flora morphotypic profiles and assessment of bacterial vaginosis in women at risk for HIV infection.
AB  - Specific morphotypic profiles of normal and abnormal vaginal flora, including bacterial vaginosis (BV), were characterized. A prospective study of 350 women yielded concurrent Gram-stain data and clinical assessment (n = 3455 visits). Microbiological profiles were constructed by Gram stain. Eight profile definitions were based on dichotomizing the levels of Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, and curved, Gram-negative bacillus (Mobiluncus) morphotypes. Of these, two were rare, and the other six demonstrated a graded association with the clinical components of BV. The proposed profiles from the Gram stain reflect the morphotypic categories describing vaginal flora that may enable clearer elucidation of gynecologic and obstetric outcomes in various populations.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis, vaginal flora patterns and vaginal hygiene practices in patients presenting with vaginal discharge syndrome in The Gambia, West Africa.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) - a syndrome characterised by a shift in vaginal flora - appears to be particularly common in sub-Saharan Africa, but little is known of the pattern of vaginal flora associated with BV in Africa. We conducted a study aimed at determining the prevalence of BV and patterns of BV-associated vaginal micro-flora among women with vaginal discharge syndrome (VDS) in The Gambia, West Africa. METHODS: We enrolled 227 women with VDS from a large genito-urinary medicine clinic in Fajara, The Gambia. BV was diagnosed by the Nugent's score and Amsel's clinical criteria. Vaginal swabs were collected for T vaginalis and vaginal flora microscopy, and for Lactobacillus spp, aerobic organisms, Candida spp and BV-associated bacteria (Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria, and Mycoplasma spp) cultures; and cervical swabs were collected for N gonorrhoeae culture and C trachomatis PCR. Sera were tested for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies. Sexual health history including details on sexual hygiene were obtained by standardised questionnaire. RESULTS: BV prevalence was 47.6% by Nugent's score and 30.8% by Amsel's clinical criteria. Lactobacillus spp were isolated in 37.8% of women, and 70% of the isolates were hydrogen-peroxide (H202)-producing strains. Prevalence of BV-associated bacteria were: G vaginalis 44.4%; Bacteroides 16.7%; Prevotella 15.2%; Peptostretococcus 1.5%; Mobiluncus 0%; other anaerobes 3.1%; and Mycoplasma hominis 21.4%. BV was positively associated with isolation of G vaginalis (odds-ratio [OR] 19.42, 95%CI 7.91 - 47.6) and anaerobes (P = 0.001 [OR] could not be calculated), but not with M hominis. BV was negatively associated with presence of Lactobacillus (OR 0.07, 95%CI 0.03 - 0.15), and H2O2-producing lactobacilli (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.05 - 0.28). Presence of H2O2-producing lactobacilli was associated with significantly lower prevalence of G vaginalis, anaerobes and C trachomatis. HIV prevalence was 12.8%. Overall, there was no association between BV and HIV, and among micro-organisms associated with BV, only Bacteroides spp. and Prevotella spp. were associated with HIV. BV or vaginal flora patterns were not associated with any of the factors relating to sexual hygiene practices (vaginal douching, menstrual hygiene, female genital cutting). CONCLUSION: In this population, BV prevalence was higher than in corresponding populations in industrialised countries, but the pattern of vaginal micro-flora associated with BV was similar. BV or vaginal flora patterns were not associated with HIV nor with any of the vaginal hygiene characteristics.
TI  - [Frequency, diagnostic criteria and consequences of bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women].
AB  - Vaginal discharge based on changes in a vaginal ecosystem (decreasing number of Lactobacillus and increasing number of Mobiluncus spp., Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella spp., Mycoplasma hominis, Peptostreptococcus spp) appears to be a major cause of bacterial vaginosis. Bacterial vaginosis is associated with: preterm delivery, premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, amniotic fluid infection, endometritis, low-weight neonates. The role of natural microflora of vagina, the most important diagnostic criteria, epidemiology and immunological changes in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis are discussed in the light of the recent publications.
TI  - Evolving issues in understanding and treating bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is a synergistic polymicrobial syndrome characterized by depletion of Lactobacillus spp., especially those that produce hydrogen peroxide, and an intense increase in the quantity of commensal vaginal anaerobic bacteria to 100- to 1000-fold above normal levels. While the bacterial spectrum of these organisms has long been known to include Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella spp., anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, Mobiluncus spp. and Mycoplasma hominis, innovative use of molecular diagnostics has identified novel species apparently associated with this syndrome, including Atopobium vaginalis. Effecting resolution of bacterial vaginosis is important, in particular for the 8 to 23% of women afflicted with symptomatic disease during their reproductive years. Bacterial vaginosis has been consistently associated with numerous adverse sequelae related to the upper genital tract, including pelvic inflammatory disease and postsurgical infection in the setting of invasive gynecologic procedures, and may increase women's risk of acquiring HIV infection. Pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis experience a higher rate of preterm delivery and low-birth-weight infants. While antibiotics with activity against anaerobes--typically, metronidazole and clindamycin applied vaginally or taken orally--are the mainstays of therapy, bacterial vaginosis frequently recurs. For these reasons, innovative approaches to therapy are urgently required.
TI  - Nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic Gram-negative pathogens. Diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a Gram stain of a vaginal smear. Treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. A study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of BV by the Gram stain-based Nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that Bacteroides or Prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. In one case, only Gardnerella vaginalis was found. These findings illustrate that BV remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either Gardnerella or Mobiluncus. Use of a FemExam system (Cooper Surgical, Shelton, CT), based upon elevated pH and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the Gram stain method. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with BV but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14. These studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for BV. If such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. fermentum RC-14.
TI  - [Bacterial vaginitis: general overview].
AB  - Bacteria are the most frequently detected agents in women, clinically complaining of vaginal discharge. The studies have shown that the vaginal microflora of women with bacterial vaginitis have altered from Lactobacillus spp. to various anaerobic bacteria. Gardnerella vaginalis is found in vaginal flora of women with bacterial vaginitis as well as in healthy women, while anaerobic bacteria such as Mobiluncus and Prevotella are the causative agents for bacterial vaginosis. For the laboratory diagnosis of bacterial vaginitis, direct microscopy is one of the most commonly used methods, and for this purpose cervicovaginal smears are examined by staining Papanicolaou and Gram stains. Because of the demonstration of bacterial vaginitis in association with the obstetric diseases such as preterm labor and postpartum endometritis, is a risk factor, its importance has increased recently. In this review article, the microorganisms that cause bacterial vaginitis, their biological characteristics, and the diagnostic laboratory methods of infection, have been discussed.
TI  - Can known risk factors explain racial differences in the occurrence of bacterial  vaginosis?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Black women are more likely to have bacterial vaginosis (BV) than are non-Hispanic white women. We examined whether this disparity can be explained by racial differences in known BV risk factors. METHODS: Nine hundred black and 235 white women were enrolled from five US sites. At baseline, structured interviews were conducted and vaginal swabs self-collected for Gram-stain and culture. RESULTS: Black women were more likely than white women to have BV/intermediate vaginal flora. They also were more likely to be older, have lower educational attainment and family incomes, have a history of a sexually transmitted disease, and douche. After adjustment for demographic and lifestyle factors, blacks remained at elevated risk for BV/intermediate flora (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.5-3.1). Blacks also were more likely to have specific BV-related vaginal microflora, as well as gonococcal or chlamydial cervicitis (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-3.8) after adjustment for known BV risk factors. CONCLUSION: Risk factor differences did not explain the observed racial disparity in the occurrence of BV, BV-related microflora, or gonococcal or chlamydial cervicitis. These findings highlight our limited understanding of the factors accounting for the occurrence of bacterial vaginosis and cervicitis among black and white women.
TI  - Activity of Novispirin G-10, a novel antimicrobial peptide against Chlamydia trachomatis and vaginosis-associated bacteria.
AB  - We tested the activity of Novispirin G-10, a novel antimicrobial alpha-helical octadecapeptide structurally related to cathelicidins and other innate immunity peptides, against Chlamydia trachomatis serovars L2, D, and E and three organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV). The peptide's activity against C. trachomatis was measured in 48-h shell vial assays with McCoy cell targets. Exposure to 100 micro g/ml of Novispirin G-10 reduced the infectivity of serovars D and E by 99.4-100% and serovar L2 by 91.7-99.1%. At the same concentration of 100 micro g/ml, Novispirin G-10 rapidly killed >99% of Mobiluncus curtisii, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Prevotella bivia, in standard colony-forming unit (CFU) assays. Given its simple structure and relative lack of cytotoxic and hemolytic activity, Novispirin G-10 may be a useful component of microbicide preparations designed to prevent chlamydial infection and/or remediate the abnormal vaginal flora associated with BV.
TI  - A multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based diagnostic method for bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic method for bacterial vaginosis using bacterial vaginosis-associated anaerobes. METHODS: A multiple PCR assay was developed using primers specific to 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (Mobiluncus mulieris and Mobiluncus curtisii), nanH (Bacteroides fragilis), and an internal spacer region of ribosomal DNA (Gardnerella vaginalis). The vaginal swabs from pregnant and nonpregnant women were examined by Gram stain-based Nugent scoring system. One hundred seventy-two samples of 853 Gram stain-interpretable samples were randomly selected and subjected to multiplex PCR assay. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the PCR assay ranged from 10 to 10 colony-forming units per vaginal swab. The prevalence of the bacterial vaginosis, intermediate, and normal categories was found by Nugent scoring system to be 21.6% (184/853), 26.0% (222/853), and 52.4% (447/853), respectively. By the multiplex PCR-based diagnostic method, 20.3% (35/172) of the samples were identified as bacterial vaginosis. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of multiplex PCR in comparison with Gram stain examination were 78.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 65.1%, 91.6%), 95.6% (95% CI 92.1%, 99.0%), 82.9% (95% CI 70.4%, 95.4%), and 94.2% (95% CI 90.3%, 98.1%), respectively. CONCLUSION: This multiplex PCR can be used as a diagnostic or screening test for bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Improving Gram-stained reproducible result by further adding clue cells in diagnosing bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - The reproducibility of interpretation in diagnosing bacterial vaginosis may be enhanced by adding pus cells and clue cells into two different criteria, developed by Spiegel et al. and Nugent et al. The purpose of study was designed to find out which parameter was more reproducible. 100 patients were collected with the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis as an experimental group, while the other 100 patients who were with routine Papanicolaou smears in gynecologic clinic the collected as a control group. Two slides, including the original and reproducible ones, were obtained from vaginal smears for each patient. Three technicians read the slides randomly by using two different criteria, plus pus cells and clue cells. This showed the agreement for clue cells is the best method regardless of experimental group or control group (Kappa values between 0.708 and 1.000). The intra-observer agreement for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis by the method of Nugent et al. is superior to the method of Spiegel et al. Our data show the comparison of Amsel criteria versus Nugent criteria for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis with sensitivity of 88.9%, specificity of 55.4%, negative positive value of 62.1%, and positive predictive value of 85.8%. Moreover, our data also demonstrate the comparison of Amsel criteria versus the diagnosis either based on Nugent criteria or the presence of clue cells with sensitivity of 95.7%, specificity of 56.7%, negative positive value of 81.2%, and positive predictive value of 87.1%. The results demonstrate further adding score of the clue cells can enhance the reproducible diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, which is superior to the methods of Nugent et al. and Spiegel et al.
TI  - Intravaginal bacterial flora in patients with uterine cervical cancer. High incidence of detection of Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Gynecological diseases may affect the growth of vaginal bacterial flora. We investigated the relationship between uterine cervical cancer and the vaginal bacterial flora. In 20 patients with uterine cervical cancer, we investigated the intravaginal bacterial flora, including Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus spp. In the patients with uterine cervical cancer, there was a mixed flora of aerobes and anaerobes and, of special note, G. vaginalis was detected in 50% of the patients with uterine cervical cancer (10/20). Bacterial vaginosis was present in 8 of these 10 patients (80%). The count of G. vaginalis detected was higher than that of the other coexisting species and was higher in both pre- and postmenopausal patients with uterine cervical cancer than in a control group of pre- and postmenopausal women with benign gynecological diseases. In contrast, none of Mobiluncus spp. was detected. G. vaginalis was detected at a high incidence in patients with uterine cervical cancer, suggesting that the lesions of uterine cervical cancer provide favorable conditions for the growth of G. vaginalis and anaerobes, which leads to bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis among a group of married Jordanian women: occurrence and laboratory diagnosis.
AB  - A total of 310 vaginal swabs collected from a group of married Jordanian women complaining of vaginal discharge were examined for bacterial vaginosis. The scoring system of Nugent for the interpretation of Gram staining was employed. This system revealed the presence of the condition in 29.7% of patients. Results obtained using the scoring system correlated significantly with the detection of clue cells and the scarcity of white blood cells in the vaginal discharge. An inverse relationship was found between bacterial vaginosis and Lactobacillus morphotypes determined by Gram staining. No definite relationship was detected between bacterial vaginosis and the recovery of Gardnerella vaginalis by culture as this organism was isolated from swabs which according to the Nugent criterion were negative for bacterial vaginosis. Bacterial vaginosis among the women investigated was more prevalent than vaginitis caused by Trichomonas vaginalis or yeasts.
TI  - Vaginal microflora associated with bacterial vaginosis in nonpregnant women: reliability of sialidase detection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria and Mycoplasma hominis in vaginal specimens of women with and without bacterial vaginosis (BV) as well as to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the direct sialidase assay of vaginal fluid as a rapid test for diagnosing this syndrome. METHODS: Vaginal cultures were obtained from 109 nonpregnant women (mean age 33 +/- 7.1 years), 47 of them with clinical signs of BV (BV+) and 62 of them without BV (BV-). In addition, we determined the vaginal sialidase activity in both groups, which may serve as a feature of this syndrome. RESULTS: Anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 91% and 18% of the BV+ and BV- groups, respectively (p < 0.001). Peptostreptococcus spp., Prevotella bivia and Porphyromonas spp. were strongly associated with BV. P. bivia and Prevotella spp. represented 44% of all the anaerobes isolated in the BV+ group. All the isolated P. bivia strains presented sialidase activity. G. vaginalis and M. hominis were isolated in 76% and 42% of the BV+ and 1% and 0% of the BV- women, respectively (p < 0.001). Mobiluncus morphotypes were observed in 34% of the BV+ and 0% of BV- women. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of sialidase activity were 81%, 94%, 90% and 86%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate a strong association between G. vaginalis, M. hominis, and P. bivia and BV. Sialidase activity and Gram stain of vaginal fluid represent accurate methods for diagnosing BV.
TI  - The diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and vaginal flora changes.
AB  - In a population of 956 women, attending for contraceptive advice, 131 (13.7%) were found to have BV acording to Amsel's criteria. Clue cells were detected in 200 (20.9%) women, a positive amine ('sniff') test in 191 (20.0%), a vaginal pH > or = 4.7 in 243 (25.4%) and a "characteristic" vaginal discharge in 104 (10.9%) women. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values in relation to BV were calculated for each of these four criteria. The detection of clue cells, an increased pH and a positive sniff test showed excellent sensitivity (86-100%) values, but had a less satisfactory positive predictive value (52-68%). Vaginal discharge was found to be a poor predictor of BV. The vaginal flora in women with clue cells, increased vaginal pH or a positive sniff test was very similar to that of the women with BV, every after excluding concomitant cases of BV and the three respective criteria. Thus, a positive amine test, which is easily performed, strongly suggests BV and a vaginal flora predominated by Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Mobiluncus species and anaerobic species on one hand, and lack of lactobacilli on the other. When there is a clinical suspicion of BV, the sniff test is positive and differential diagnoses are excluded, one can safely treat a woman for bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Inhibition of chemotaxis by organic acids from anaerobes may prevent a purulent response in bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - It has been postulated that certain organic acids produced by the anaerobes associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV) could prevent a purulent response in this infection. Varying concentrations of pure succinic, acetic and lactic acids were incubated in vitro with a monocytic cell line (MonoMac 6). High inhibition of chemotaxis was produced by succinic acid; lower inhibition and no inhibition was shown by acetic acid and lactic acid respectively. Succinic and acetic acids were detected in high concentrations in the vaginal fluid of women with BV and in culture supernates of Prevotella and Mobiluncus spp.; these acids impaired chemotaxis of MonoMac 6 cells in vitro. The vaginal fluids of normal women and the culture supernates of Lactobacillus spp. had no effect on chemotaxis.
TI  - [The treatment of bacterial vaginosis with Dalacin V cream].
AB  - To asses the efficiency of the 2% clindamycin phosphate creme given in 3 and 7 daily courses officially designer for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV). METHODS: The study includes 65 patients who have microbiological data for BV 11 of the women are pregnant (18.46%). The microbiological study includes there agent: Streptococcus agalactiae, E. colli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus species, Prevotella species, Mobiluncus species, Staphylococcus epidermidis et Enterococcus fecalis. The controls visit was assessed on the 7'] and 28'] day after the therapy. RESULTS: There were successful results on the 84.3% of the patients after 7 day course but in the 3-day course the good results were showed in 73.91% of the women. After the 28"] day there were only few successful results 43%. CONCLUSIONS: The clindamycin phosphate is more preferable method for the treatment of BV.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis a "broad overview".
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) was first reported in 1995 by Gardner and Dukes, who described the unique clinical signs and symptoms and the distinctive nature of the vaginal discharge associated with it. They also described a "new" causative organism, which they named "Haemophilus vaginalis", subsequently renamed Gardnerella vaginalis. BV is currently the most prevalent cause of infectious vaginitis among women attending for genitourinary diseases. BV has a complex microbiology. Lactobacillus populations, which are usually dominant in healthy women, are replaced by a polymicrobial group of organisms that includes G. vaginalis, anaerobic Gram-negative rods such as Prevotella species, Peptostreptococcus species, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and often Mobiluncus species. Anaerobic bacteria produce enzymes, aminopeptidases, that degrade protein and decarboxylases that convert amino acids and other compounds to amines. Those amines contribute to the signs and symptoms associated with the syndrome, raising the vaginal pH and producing a discharge odor. The excessive amounts of bacteria characteristic of the syndrome attach to epithelial cell surfaces, resulting in "clue cell". Nearly half the patients report no noticeable symptoms, but many develop a characteristic copious, malodorous discharge if untreated. Results from epidemiologic studies have associated BV with serious upper genital tract infections and adverse pregnancy outcome. In particular, the presence of BV in pregnant women increases the risk of preterm delivery, and evidence is now compelling that BV is a cause of preterm delivery. The interest in potential invasiveness of G. vaginalis has increased. However, virulence determinants have not been studied enough. The most important therapy includes clindamycin and metronidazole.
TI  - [Bacterial vaginosis. Epidemiology and risk factors].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a change in vaginal ecosystem where lactobacilli dominate, flora is absent or greatly reduced, and replaced with a mixed, predominantly anaerobic flora, consisting of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Mobiluncus spp, Bacteroides spp, Prevotela spp, Peptostreptococcus spp, Fusobacterium spp and Porphyromonas spp. The concentration of bacteria increases from 100 to 1000 fold in women with BV compared to healthy women. BV has been formerly known as nonspecific vaginitis, Haemophilus vaginitis, Corynebacterium vaginitis, Gardnerella vaginitis and anaerobic vaginintis. BV is the most prevalent form of vaginal disturbances in reproductive age women. The average incidence of BV varies: 10-35% in patients visiting gynaecological wards, 10-30% in patients visiting obstetric wards and 20-60% in patients visiting services of sexually transmitted diseases. A typical clinical symptom of BV is malodorous vaginal discharge. However, more than 50% of all women with BV are asymptomatic. BV has been associated with many gynaecological and obstetric complications such as cervicitis, salpingitis, endometritis, postoperative infections, urinary tract infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, mild abnormal Pap smear results and possible link with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, preterm delivery, premature rupture of the membranes, chorioamnionitis and postpartum endometritis. Factors that increase the risk of BV are multiple partners, exposure to semen, prior trichomoniasis, intrauterine device usage, smoking, indigent population and frequent use of scented soap. Diagnosis of BV is established by Amsel's criteria of which three of four are the following: presence of homogeneous discharge, vaginal fluid pH > 4.5, positive amine test and microscopic analysis of Gram stained smear of vaginal discharge where "clue" cells (epithelial vaginal cells covered with mass of adherent bacteria, mostly coccobacilli) should be detected. The treatment of patients with BV consist of metronidazole or clindamycin, per os or intravaginally. The treatment of asymptomatic women and male sex partners of women with BV is controversial. The aim of the study was to establish the occurrence rate of BV in our women and potential factors increasing the risk of BV. We examined 166 women at the Institute of Microbiology and Immunology, University School of Medicine, Belgrade. Diagnosis of BV was established by Amsel's criteria. Each woman filled in a special questionnaire. Pregnant women were excluded. BV was diagnosed in 25% (33/166) of women. BV was more common among women with multiple partners. The most prevalent clinical symptom of BV was malodorous vaginal discharge. Vaginal symptoms became more evident after intercourse. Taking into consideration the occurrence rate of BV and its connection with numerous gynaecological and obstetric sequelae, and taking into account that the diagnosis of BV is quick, simple and inexpensive, we suggest that the examination of BV in women becomes a usual procedure.
TI  - [The range of antagonistic effects of Lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, Bacteroides spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. On the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus Lactobacillus, most frequently L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the same environment. The diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. Thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this ecosystem. The aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. It was found that nearly all of the tested Lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against Gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit Gram-positive aerobic cocci as Enterococcus faecalis or Staphylococcus aureus.

TI  - Bacterial vaginosis: association with adverse pregnancy outcome.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is the most common lower genital tract infection encountered  among women of reproductive age. This condition can best be considered as a vaginal syndrome associated with an alteration of the normal vaginal flora rather than an infection specific to any one microorganism. Bacterial vaginosis is a clinical condition with a complex microbiology that is characterized by a reduced concentration of a normally abundant Lactobacillus species along with high concentrations of gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria, particularly, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus, Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Mycoplasma species. The exact make up of the microorganisms and their relative concentration vary among women who have this condition. Although it was previously regarded as a harmless condition, recent work has linked bacterial vaginosis to numerous upper genital tract complications such as preterm labor and preterm delivery, preterm premature rupture of the membranes, chorioamnionitis, and postpartum endometritis. The findings from recent prospective randomized trials suggest that treatment of bacterial vaginosis in certain women who are at high risk for preterm delivery decreases the rate of preterm birth.
TI  - Preterm birth: associations with genital and possibly oral microflora.
AB  - Opportunistic pathogenic microbes are indigenous to the female lower genital tract and etiologic in many types of pelvic infections and, apparently, a portion of preterm birth (PTB) cases. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a clinical syndrome based on an altered genital microflora in which Gardnerella vaginalis; anaerobic species primarily among Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, and Mobiluncus; Mycoplasma hominis; and Ureaplasma urealyticum become predominant in vaginal secretions. This BV complex of microbes, compared to a normal vaginal microflora dominated by facultative lactobacilli, is associated with significantly increased risks for preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of membranes, PTB, and other perinatal infectious complications. Pathogenetic mechanisms include an ascending route of infection and/or inflammatory process due to microbial products and maternal and/or fetal response(s) with production of prostaglandins and cytokines. In the presence of periodontal disease, oral opportunistic pathogens and/or their inflammatory products also may have a role in prematurity via a hematogenous route. Fusobacterium nucleatum, a common oral species, is the most frequently isolated species from amniotic fluid cultures among women with preterm labor and intact membranes. Also, the species and subspecies of fusobacteria identified from amniotic fluid most closely match those reported from healthy and diseased subgingival sites, namely F. nucleatum subspecies vincentii and F. nucleatum subspecies nucleatum, compared to strains identified from the lower genital tract. Although these fusobacteria also could be acquired through cunnilingus from a partner, new data associating maternal periodontal disease with preterm low birth weight taken with the isolation of F. nucleatum, Capnocytophaga, and other oral species from amniotic fluid support further study of a possible additional route, oral-hematogenous, to PTB.
TI  - [Prevalence of bacterial vaginosis in an obstetric population of Barcelona].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence and risk factors of bacterial vaginosis (BV) in a pregnant population of Barcelona (Spain). MATERIAL AND METHODS: 301 pregnant women controlled in the Hospital Clinic i Provincial (HCP) of Barcelona were enrolled in the study. Complete epidemiological information, and vaginal samples were available in 293 women. BV was diagnosed by Gram stain of vaginal smear (Nugent's criteria). RESULTS: BV was detected in 22 pregnant women (7.5%; 95% CI: 4.6-10.5%). There was no association between race, parity, education, marital status, smoking and drug use, and the presence of BV. Non-use of birth control method (72.3% vs 34.4%; p < 0.0001), presence of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) during pregnancy (22.7% vs 3.7%; p < 0.0001), HIV seropositivity (13.6% vs 2.9%; p = 0.041) and presence of symptoms of vaginitis (40.9% vs 13.3%; p = 0.009) were significantly associated with the presence of BV. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of BV in a pregnant population of Barcelona (Spain) is 7.5%. Further work is needed to evaluate the usefulness of BV as a prescreening marker for STD and HIV infection. The Gram stain provides an inexpensive, fast and easy method to diagnose BV, and may allow us to screen, treat and prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with it.
TI  - [Laboratory diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - Microbiological analysis of discharge from the genitals in passenger car conductors (5787 women and 1496 men aged 20 to 40) showed Gardnerella vaginalis to be the most frequent agent of urogenital infection. It was isolated in 26% cases, whereas Trichomonas were isolated in 2.5%, fungi in 1.5%, and gonococci in 0.27% cases. The diagnosis of gardnerellosis is reliable if the key cells are found. Monoinfection with G. vaginalis was diagnosed in 80% patients, the overwhelming majority (74%) of carriers of this bacterium had no inflammatory symptoms, and in only 26% the carrier state was associated with the presence of leukocytes and histiocytes, more often in the cervix. In men the carrier state was detected in 0.4% cases. The clinical picture of Gardnerella infection is similar to that of infection with Mobiluncus, which is little known. This infection occurred 10 times less frequently (2.5%) than gardnerellosis, but in 92% cases it was a component of mixed infection, most frequently in association with G. vaginalis. A little known fungus Leptothrix was found in the genital discharge of 4% examinees, mostly women, but sometimes in men as well; it is represented by 3 types of ramifying threads. The practitioners are to know these infections causing specific diseases, such as bacterial vaginosis, which are often responsible for serious complications in gynecology and obstetrics.
TI  - [Clinical and microbiological evaluation of bacterial vaginosis in women in a hospital from Rio Cuarto, Argentina].
AB  - One hundred and seventy nine women of discharge vaginal were studied. Endocervical and exocervical samples were obtained. The vaginal fluids samples were processed by the following tests: pH, fishy odor, clue cells observation was done by Gram reaction. Gardnerella vaginalis was identified through biochemical tests. G. vaginalis (23.4%), C. albicans (21.8%), T. vaginalis (14.5%), N. gonorrhoeae (5.5%) and C. trachomatis (11.7%), were found in 42 women. A 7.1% of forms compatible with Mobiluncus spp. were observed by direct Gram. The relation between isolation of G. vaginalis and the presence of clue cells was 95.2%. There was a sensitivity of 95.2%, 100% specificity and a predictive positive value of 100%.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activities of DU-6859a and other fluoroquinolones against  Japanese isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of DU-6859a, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared with those of other fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria and Gardnerella vaginalis. DU-6859a was the most active agent; it inhibited 90% of isolates of almost all species tested, including Bacteroides fragilis at < or = 0.39 micrograms/mL. Although the other quinolones tested were active against gram-positive anaerobes, inhibiting their growth at < or = 1.56 micrograms/mL, these agents were less active against the B. fragilis group and Prevotella bivia (90% of which were inhibited at > or = 6.25 micrograms/mL). Mobiluncus species and G. vaginalis, which are well associated with bacterial vaginosis, were inhibited by DU-6859a at 0.1 microgram/mL. These results suggest that DU-6859a is a promising oral agent for the treatment of bacterial infections due to anaerobic bacteria; however, further studies, including determination of vaginal levels of this compound, should be performed to study the role of DU-6859a in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Vaginal microflora associated with bacterial vaginosis in Japanese and Thai pregnant women.
AB  - The vaginal flora of 118 Japanese and 208 Thai pregnant women were investigated for the presence of bacterial vaginosis (BV), BV-associated organisms, and BV-associated enzyme. A similar prevalence of BV was found among the Japanese (13.6%) and Thai women (15.9%). The microbial flora of women with BV were complex; the mean number of isolates recovered in the BV group was approximately 2 times more than that in a group of healthy women. Prevotella species, Porphyromonas species, Peptostreptococcus species, Mobiluncus species, Gardnerella vaginalis, and H2O2-nonproducing lactobacilli were significantly associated with BV. These organisms were less associated with H2O2-producing lactobacilli, which were predominant in women with normal flora, suggesting that H2O2-producing lactobacilli have antibacterial activity against BV-associated organisms. The vaginal sialidase assay by means of a filter-paper spot test was not proved to be a useful screening aid for diagnosis of BV because of the low sensitivity (69.4%) of this test.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis: prevalence in an Italian population of asymptomatic pregnant women and diagnostic aspects.
AB  - The present study has been carried out with the main objective of determining the prevalence rate of bacterial vaginosis (BV) in a population of asymptomatic pregnant women (8th to 9th month of pregnancy). Out of a total 1,441 patients examined BV was found to be present in 70 (4.9%). The diagnosis was made when an analysis of the vaginal discharge revealed the simultaneous presence of at least three out of four of the following laboratory indices: (1) direct Gram stain positive (bacterial flora mixed with Gram-negative coccobacilli and variable-gram predominant over the lactobacillus flora); (2) pH > 4.5; (3) positive odour test with KOH 10%; (4) presence of clue cells. After a discussion of the principal laboratory and clinical signs presently used for the diagnosis of BV, the authors suggest the exclusion of the evaluation of the appearance of the vaginal discharge from the standard diagnostic criteria. Further, three diagnostic methods are hypothesized for use in different settings.
TI  - Bacteriological epidemiology and treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - One hundred symptomatic women with clinical bacterial vaginosis (BV) were enrolled in this study. The bacteriological epidemiology of BV and efficacy of oral or vaginal administration of antimicrobial agents for treatment of BV were investigated. The epidemiology of BV was investigated before antimicrobial therapy. Fifty patients were treated with oral administration of metronidazole (MTN), 500 mg twice a day, and 50 patients with 2% clindamycin (CLDM) phosphate in a vaginal cream, 5 g once a day for 7 days. The major organisms occurring were Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus species, Bacteroides species, Prevotella species, and Mobiluncus species and opportunistic pathogens such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis. The therapeutic efficacy of CLDM cream on BV appeared to be preferable to oral MTN from clinical and bacteriological aspects. The clinical and bacteriological effectiveness of MTN and CLDM in the treatment of BV suggests that anaerobes might play a major role in causing the clinical symptoms in patients with BV.
TI  - Papillomavirus in cervicovaginal smears of women infected with human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  - It has been described that women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) present more frequent cytological abnormalities in cervicovaginal smears, generally related to infection by human papillomavirus (HPV). The present work is a study of cervicovaginal smears of 147 HIV-seropositive women submitted to routine gynecological examinations. The smears were stained by the Papanicolaou method. Cytopathic effects of HPV were found in 38 (25.8%) cases. Nuclear atypias of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) were evident in 36 (24.5%) of these cases: 27 (18.4%), CIN I; 6 (4.0%), CIN II and 3 (2.0%) CIN III. Also 2 (1.4%) invasive carcinomas and one (0.7%) endocervical dysplasia were found. Other agents observed were: Candida sp, 19 (12.9%) cases, Gardnerella vaginalis, 19 (12.9%), Trichomonas vaginalis, 13 (8.4%), Chlamydia trachomatis 5 (3.4%), Mobiluncus sp 2 (1.4%) and Herpes simplex virus 1 (0.7%). This study emphasizes the high frequency of HPV/CIN cervicovaginal abnormalities in HIV-seropositive in our population. It is possible that immunological factors and sexual promiscuity are involved in this phenomenon.
TI  - [Gardnerella vaginalis infection in heterosexual couples. Ultrastructural study of desquamation cells of the stratified epithelium].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is one of the most frequent infections during the woman's reproductive age. Lactobacilli normal flora is substituted by relatively elevated Gardnerella vaginalis (GV), anaerobic bacteroids, Mobiluncus and Mycoplasma. The purpose of this study is to perform a morphological analysis of possible mechanisms for adhesion and penetration of GV in the heterosexual couple, in squamous epithelium at vaginal wall, as well as in seminal fluid. Ten couples with positive GV culture with three to four days of abstinence, were studied. The women presented with at least three of the four Amsel's criteria. Samples were obtained from vaginal lateral walls and from seminal fluid; these were divided in two parts: 1. To realize cultures for GV. Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis; and 2. For an ultrastructural analysis. Samples were processed with common techniques for electronic microscopy. In vaginal cells, bacteria similar to GV free form fixed to plasmatic membrane and inside the cellular cytoplasm. In the seminal fluid there were found numerous urethral cells of desquamation, which presented, as well as in woman, free form bacteria, fixed to plasmatic membrane and inside the cytoplasm. In four cases, bacteria similar to Mycoplasma, were found; and one case with particles suggesting cytomegalovirus. It is concluded in this study that: 1. The male presents with urethral cells similar to vaginal "guide cells". 2. GV colonizes urethral epithelium in the male. 3. Male is capable of infecting and/or re-infecting the woman.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis: drugs versus alternative treatment.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is one of the most common infectious disorders affecting women. It is caused by several microorganisms, including Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides, beta-streptococci and mobiluncus/falcivibrio sp. Bacterial vaginosis is thought to occur as a result of a change in vaginal pH mediated by the metabolic activity of anaerobic bacteria. This rise in vaginal pH interferes with the activity of vaginal lactobacilli which maintain vaginal acidity. Several types of antibiotics have been used to treat this condition. Although metronidazole was found to be the most effective, none was completely successful in either cure or prevention. Several attempts have recently been made to treat bacterial vaginosis using physiological or 'natural' substances, such as lactate gel and commercial yoghurt, which is acidic and also contains lactobacillus strains. This kind of treatment looks promising and may have a place in certain clinical conditions, including pregnancy, in cases of recurrent inflammation, or as a prophylactic treatment before invasive gynecological procedures or abdominal surgery in patients known to be affected. This issue should be additionally studied and evaluated in light of the relatively little experience with this modality of treatment for bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Evaluation of the Etest for antimicrobial spectrum and potency determinations of  anaerobes associated with bacterial vaginosis and peritonitis.
AB  - One hundred ninety-seven anaerobic organisms (24 Gardnerella vaginalis, 16 Mobiluncus spp., 19 Peptostreptococcus spp., 20 Lactobacillus spp., 20 Prevotella bivia/disiens, 81 Bacteroides fragilis group, 12 Clostridium spp., and five Fusobacterium spp.) were processed by the Etest (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) and a reference (Brucella blood agar) method against 10 antimicrobial agents. For the bacterial vaginosis-associated pathogens, the Etest was more reproducible and correlated acceptably with the reference agar test: within +/- 1 log2 dilution for 74.4% of Mobiluncus spp. to 96.0% for Peptostreptococcus spp. (all organisms, 83.4%). The quantitative correlation +/- 2 log2 dilution steps between test results was 94.3%. Results with B. fragilis group strains demonstrated 97.3% correlation (+/- 2 log2 dilution) with a trend toward slightly lower Etest minimum inhibitory concentrations for ampicillin-sulbactam, cefotaxime, imipenem, and clindamycin. The absolute qualitative interpretive agreement between Etest and the reference agar dilution method results was 94.4%, with only a 0.4% false-susceptible error rate. The Etest appears to be a very practical, quantitatively accurate, alternative procedure for clinical microbiology laboratories routinely testing the susceptibilities of anaerobes and, by these presented data, organisms associated with female tract infections.
TI  - Effects of Cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate on the adherence of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus curtisii, and Lactobacillus acidophilus to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A decreased concentration or total disappearance of Lactobacillus acidophilus in the vagina constitutes a frequent observation in bacterial vaginosis. GOAL OF THE STUDY: Cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate has been evaluated in vitro to detect antiadhesive properties at subinhibitory concentrations for Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus curtisii to vaginal epithelial cells (VEC). STUDY DESIGN: Bacterial strains 14C- and or 3H-labeled were tested for adherence and competition to binding sites in VECs before and after treatment at sub-MIC with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate. RESULTS: In control tests of adherence, G. vaginalis and M. curtisii had their maximal adhesion at pH 5.4, L. acidophilus at pH 4.4. Preincubation of G. vaginalis and M. curtisii with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate 2.5 mg/mL (subinhibitory concentration) at pH 5.4 reduced adherence to VECs respectively by 48.3% and 34.1%. The same treatment of L. acidophilus showed no statistically significant difference. Treatment of VECs alone did not modify adherence. Competition tests between L. acidophilus and G. vaginalis and between L. acidophilus and M. curtisii showed that, in small quantities, L. acidophilus could compete with G. vaginalis and M. curtisii for binding sites in VECs at pH 4.4, when pretreated with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate. At a higher pH (4.8 and 5.4), L. acidophilus in higher quantities did not compete for binding sites occupied by G. vaginalis and M. curtisii. CONCLUSIONS: Cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate at subinhibitory concentrations modifies the adhesiveness of G. vaginalis and M. curtisii to VECs, reducing it by 48.3% and 34.1%, respectively. Adhesion of L. acidophilus to VECs is not impaired by pretreatment with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate at pH 4.4, even if they are in low number and compete for binding sites against pathogens. At higher pH levels, L. acidophilus did not compete for binding sites occupied by G. vaginalis and M. curtisii.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, FK037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between January 1992 and June 1993. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis. FK037 was superior in potency to ceftazidime against all strains except E. faecalis, P. anaerobius and P. bivia. It was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and P. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. FK037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against MRSA, S. agalactiae and E. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except G. vaginalis and B. fragilis that were 4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to FK037.
TI  - [Value of the score for Gram strains in the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - The interpretation of Gram-stained slides of vaginal swab specimens is evaluated  for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and correlated with the isolation bacteria and clinical signs: thin homogeneous vaginal discharge, pH > or = 4.7, amine odor and presence of clue cells. Gram stained smears were scored following a morphotype classification: (a)-Lactobacillus morphotypes (scored 4 to 0), (b)-small Gram negative (G. vaginalis, scored 0 to 4), (c)-curved Gram variable rods (Mobiluncus morphotypes, scored 0 to 2). The scoring system (0 to 10) was a weighted combination of these morphotypes: a+b+c. The criterion for bacterial vaginosis was a score > or = 7, a score of 0 to 6 was considered as no bacterial vaginosis. Samples of 709 women, aged 18 to 84 (mean age = 39.7) were examined. The prevalence of G. vaginalis culture was 12.5%, and Mobiluncus infection occurred in 1.5%. The frequency of M. hominis was diagnosed in 2.8% of women. A score of 7 to 10 on Gram stain was observed in 9.7% in the population. Compared to G. vaginalis culture, Gram stained smear was more sensitive (0.71) than clinical signs of bacterial vaginosis (0.46). The specificity was similar with the two methods. The assessment of G. vaginalis morphotypes was highly correlated with the G. vaginalis culture (p < 0.001, OR = 248). The infection of T. vaginalis or Candida sp. was never associated with a score > or = 7. The Gram-stained smear is a cheap, fast and easy method. It provides good results for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis is associated with prematurity and vaginal fluid mucinase and sialidase: results of a controlled trial of topical clindamycin cream.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The pathogenesis of preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes linked with reproductive tract infection remains poorly understood. Mucolytic enzymes, including mucinases and sialidases (neuraminidase), are recognized virulence factors among enteropathogens and bacteria that cause periodontal infection. Perturbation of maternal cervicovaginal mucosa membrane host defenses by such enzyme-producing microorganisms may increase the risk of subclinical intrauterine infection during pregnancy and thus increase risks of preterm birth. STUDY DESIGN: We prospectively evaluated vaginal fluid mucinase and sialidase and selected cervicovaginal bacteria along with pregnancy outcomes in 271 women. Within this study, women with bacterial vaginosis (16 to 27 week' gestation) were treated with 2% clinadmycin vaginal cream or placebo. Enzyme, microbial findings, treatment effects, and pregnancy outcomes were compared among drug- and placebo-treated women and control women without bacterial vaginosis. RESULTS: Presence of bacterial vaginosis at intake was associated with increased risk of preterm birth (relative risk 3.3, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 9.1, p = 0.02), premature rupture of membranes (relative risk 3.8, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 9.0, p = 0.002), and preterm premature rupture of membranes. Mucinase and sialidase activities were more commonly identified, and they occurred in higher concentrations, if present, in women with bacterial vaginosis (mucinase: 44.3% with bacterial vaginosis vs 27.4% without, p = 0.007; sialidase: 45% with bacterial vaginosis vs 12% without p < 0.001). Sialidase activity was associated with bacterial vaginosis-linked organisms (Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus spp, and Mycoplasma hominis) and Chlamydia trachomatis and yeast species; mucinase activity was associated only with bacterial vaginosis-linked microorganisms. Clindamycin, 2% cream, was effective treatment for bacterial vaginosis and temporarily reduced mucinase and sialidase activities. Topical treatment of bacterial vaginosis did not reduce risks of perinatal morbidity. Women with persistent or recurrent sialidase 8 weeks after treatment were at increased risk of preterm birth (15.6% vs 7.4%) premature rupture of membranes (30% vs 15%), and low birth weight (20% vs 3%, relative risk 6.8, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 28.1). CONCLUSIONS: Persistence of sialidase-producing vaginal microorganisms in numbers sufficient to increase vaginal fluid sialidase activity may be a risk factor for possibly preventable subclinical intrauterine infection and preterm birth. This study confirms and further informs our understanding of the association of bacterial vaginosis and preterm birth; studies to evaluate whether systemic treatment for bacterial vaginosis can effectively reduce vaginal mucolytic enzymes and risks of prematurity and other morbid outcomes are continuing.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis and vaginal microorganisms in idiopathic premature labor and  association with pregnancy outcome.
AB  - The vaginal microflora of 49 women in idiopathic preterm labor was compared with  that of 38 term controls to determine whether the presence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and/or specific microorganisms would influence the rate of preterm delivery. Demographic factors, pregnancy outcome, and reproductive history were also studied. BV, as defined by the presence of clue cells in a vaginal wet mount and characteristic microbial findings in a stained vaginal smear and vaginal culture, was more common in women with preterm labor and delivery than in controls (P < 0.01). The condition, diagnosed in 41% of women who had both preterm labor and delivery (n = 22) and in 11% each of women who had preterm labor but term delivery (n = 27) and controls, was associated with a 2.1-fold risk (95% confidence intervals, 1.2 to 3.7) for preterm birth prior to 37 weeks of gestation. BV was associated with low birth weight. Of 49 women with preterm labor, 67% (8 of 12) of women with BV were delivered of low-birth-weight neonates (< 2,500 g) compared with 22% (8 of 37) of women without the condition (P < 0.0005). The presence of hydrogen peroxide-producing facultative Lactobacillus spp. was strongly negatively associated with both preterm delivery and BV. BV-associated microorganisms, i.e., Mobiluncus, Prevotella, and Peptostreptococcus species, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Mycoplasma hominis, and high numbers of Gardnerella vaginalis were significantly associated with preterm delivery; all species also strongly associated with BV (P = 0.0001 for each comparison). Mobiluncus curtisii and Fusobacterium nucleatum were recovered exclusively from women with preterm delivery. Our study clearly indicates that BV and its associated organisms are correlated with idiopathic premature delivery.
TI  - [Anaerobic bacteria and gynecologic infections].
AB  - The normal vaginal flora consists of a wide variety of bacteria and the composition of this microflora is influenced by hormonal, metabolic and pharmacological factors. An increased concentration of a mixed anaerobic flora (Mobiluncus, Prevotellae, Peptostreptococci and Gardnerella vaginalis) appears to be an early stage in the development of bacterial vaginosis or in the infection of the upper genital tract. Women with bacterial vaginosis are at increased risk of bartholinitis, skenitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, postpartum and postabortal endometritis, chorioamnionitis and infections following gynecologic surgery or diagnostic procedure.
TI  - Erythromycin versus metronidazole in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Of 101 women, 15-50 years of age, presenting with vaginal discharge, 34 had bacterial vaginosis and were randomly assigned to a seven-day course of oral treatment with either erythromycin (0.5 g b.i.d.) or metronidazole (0.4 g b.i.d.) in a single-blind, cross-over study. Treatment failure (> or = three clinical signs of bacterial vaginosis) occurred in 13 (81%) of 16 patients given erythromycin, as compared with three (17%) of 18 women treated with metronidazole (p < 0.001). Persistence of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus species and/or Mycoplasma hominis was found in 14 of 16 patients treated with erythromycin, and in four of 16 patients treated with metronidazole. Treatment with metronidazole was successful (< or = two clinical signs of bacterial vaginosis) in eight of 10 cases of erythromycin treatment failure. Neither of two cases of metronidazole treatment failure was cured with erythromycin. At three-month follow-up of 31 women, persistence or recurrence of bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed in 11 cases (36%).
TI  - Diagnostic microbiology of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is characterized microbiologically by replacement of the Lactobacillus-predominant vaginal flora by Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides species, Mobiluncus species, and genital mycoplasmas. A standardized, laboratory-based diagnostic test for bacterial vaginosis is desirable in those instances in which a microscope is unavailable in the clinic or when the evaluator of the wet mount examination is inexperienced at recognizing clue cells. Vaginal cultures have excellent sensitivity for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, but because the predictive value of a positive G. vaginalis culture is less than 50%, cultures are not recommended. Vaginal Gram smears are objective and reproducible, have 62% to 100% sensitivity, and have a positive predictive value of 76% to 100%. Diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis with use of Papanicolaou-stained smears has been reported, but standardized criteria have not been widely adopted. A rapid, office-based oligonucleotide probe test for high concentrations of G. vaginalis has been developed and may be useful when direct microscopy is unavailable or confidence in microscopic examination is low. Laboratory tests that detect microbial products unique to the vaginal fluid of women with bacterial vaginosis include detection of amines (putrescine, cadaverine, and trimethylamine), measurement of the relative levels of succinate and lactate in the vaginal fluid by gas chromatography, detection of proline aminopeptidase by colorimetric assay, or detection of sialidases in the vaginal fluid. Although these tests are not yet applicable to routine use, these research tests could be adapted for wider use in office laboratories. Vaginal Gram stains are more useful than culture for laboratory confirmation of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - The microbiology of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - A group of microorganisms are present concurrently in high concentrations in the  vaginas of women with bacterial vaginosis. The major members of the group are Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic gram-negative rods belonging to the genera Prevotella, Porphyromonas and Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus species, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and often Mobiluncus species. Facultative species of Lactobacillus are present in lower concentrations and are less prevalent in bacterial vaginosis than in women with a normal vaginal examination. The exact microbe(s) responsible for bacterial vaginosis is unknown whether among the organisms listed above or an unknown agent. The high concentrations of anaerobic gram-negative rods, peptostreptococci, and other opportunistic pathogens in the lower genital tract place women with bacterial vaginosis at increased risk for genital infections and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of tioconazole and its concentrations in vaginal  fluids following topical (vagistat-1 6.5%) application.
AB  - In vitro assays demonstrated that clinical yeasts were significantly more inhibited by tioconazole (MIC50, < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) than by fluconazole (MIC50, 8 micrograms/ml). Tioconazole also exhibited high potency against most molds (Alterneria spp. and Acremonium spp.). All Candida tropicalis isolates had MICs of 8 micrograms/ml, four-fold greater than any other Candida spp. Generally Gram-negative bacteria were less susceptible to tioconazole. Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml) was the most susceptible Gram-negative species. Staphylococci and enterococci were the most susceptible to tioconazole Gram-positive species (MIC50s, 1-8 micrograms/ml). Bacterial species associated with vaginosis. [Gardnerella vaginalis (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml), Mobiluncus spp. (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml) and Prevotella biviadisiens (MIC90, 64 micrograms/ml)] were inhibited by tioconazole. Isolates of Lactobacillus spp. were most resistant (MIC90, > or = 256 micrograms/ml) to tioconazole. Vaginal fluid levels of tioconazole (mean, 91.4 micrograms/ml) persisted above the MIC90 levels (1-64 micrograms/ml) for most fungal and bacterial pathogens for 72 h in 19 evaluable female human subjects receiving 300 mg tioconazole in an intravaginal ointment.
TI  - The normal vaginal flora, H2O2-producing lactobacilli, and bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women.
AB  - In this study of the vaginal flora of 171 pregnant women in labor at term, the flora was categorized as normal (Lactobacillus predominant), intermediate, or representative of bacterial vaginosis (BV) on the basis of a vaginal smear. BV was diagnosed in 39 women (23%); the vaginal flora was classified as normal in 50% of cases and as intermediate in 27%. H2O2-producing lactobacilli were recovered from 5% of women with BV, 37% of those with an intermediate flora, and 61% of those with a normal flora. H2O2-negative lactobacilli were equally frequent (57%-65%) in all three groups. The microorganisms most frequently recovered from women with BV included Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia/disiens, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Prevotella corporis/Bacteroides levii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Mobiluncus species, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Peptostreptococcus tetradius, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, viridans streptococci, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Mycoplasma hominis (P < .05 for each). The presence of all but three of these organisms was inversely related to vaginal colonization by H2O2-producing lactobacilli; the exceptions were B. ureolyticus, F. nucleatum, and P. prevotii. Other microorganisms were equally frequent among women with and without BV. We conclude that specific groups of anaerobes are associated with BV in this population and that a strong association exists between species associated with BV and those inhibited by H2O2-producing lactobacilli.
TI  - In vitro activity of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and flomoxef against 322 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. A fastidious facultative anaerobe, Gardnerella vaginalis, was also studied. FK037 inhibited 90% of isolates of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Clostridium perfringens, Mobiluncus spp., G. vaginalis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis at < or = 0.78 micrograms/ml. The MICs of FK037 for 50 and 90% of Bacteroides fragilis isolates were 25 and > 200 micrograms/ml, respectively; the activity of FK037 was comparable to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime but lower than that of flomoxef. The activity of FK037 against Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium varium, and Bilophila wadsworthia decreased when inoculum size was increased from 10(6) to 10(8) CFU/ml. Little influence of inoculum size on the activity of FK037 was observed for other isolates tested. Medium pH affected the activity of FK037 against F. varium (MICs at pHs 5 and 7, 3.13 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively) and Bacteroides gracilis (MICs at pHs 5 and 7, 12.5 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively) but not against other organisms tested. FK037 was less resistant than flomoxef to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase group 2e derived from B. fragilis GAI 0558 and GAI 10150.
TI  - Comparative susceptibility of the Bacteroides fragilis group species and other anaerobic bacteria to meropenem, imipenem, piperacillin, cefoxitin, ampicillin/sulbactam, clindamycin and metronidazole.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of meropenem, imipenem, piperacillin, cefoxitin, ampicillin/sulbactam, clindamycin and metronidazole was determined against 395 strains of strict and facultative anaerobes, including Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus spp. and Mobiluncus spp. The activities of meropenem and imipenem were within one dilution of their MIC50 and MIC90 values. One isolate of Bacteroides fragilis, two of Bacteroides distasonis, and two of Bacteroides ovatus showed resistance or diminished susceptibility to meropenem and imipenem. Metronidazole was active against almost all obligate anaerobic isolates. Some non-spore-forming Gram-positive bacilli and lactobacilli were resistant. Ampicillin/sulbactam inhibited almost all isolates at < or = 16/8 mg/L. The activity of clindamycin and cefoxitin was relatively good, but some strains of non-fragilis B. fragilis group species were resistant. Piperacillin was the least active agent tested.
TI  - [Recent bacteriologic data: from physiopathology to treatment].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is characterized by a change in the vaginal ecosystem in which Lactobacillus spp, the dominant members of the normal flora, are replaced by an association of various bacterial species including Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobes (Bacteroides spp, Prevotella spp, Porphyromonas spp, Peptostreptococcus spp and Mobiluncus spp) and Mycoplasma hominis. The reasons for this imbalance are unknown, although the loss of lactobacilli that produce hydrogen peroxide (which is toxic for G. vaginalis and numerous anaerobes) may be an essential element. The introduction of one or several of these species into the vagina (they can occasionally be isolated in small numbers even in the absence of vaginosis) following intercourse or from the intestinal tract may also play a role. G. vaginalis itself is not considered to cause vaginosis, but is almost always present and multiplies rapidly; in addition, it has a high capacity for adherence to epithelial cells both in vivo and in vitro. It is now agreed that the concomitant growth of one or several anaerobic species is required for bacterial vaginosis to develop. Our knowledge of the bacteriology of bacterial vaginosis has implications for diagnosis and treatment. It is now possible to obtain a precise bacteriologic diagnosis, not by culturing G. vaginalis (a costly and low-yield procedure), but by direct examination of the vaginal flora after Gram staining, which shows the replacement of lactobacilli by a characteristic polymorphic flora. Therapy is based on the use of antibiotics such as the imidazoles, which are active against G. vaginalis and anaerobes, but not against the commensal lactobacilli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [The bacteriologic diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis in an urban practice].
AB  - The term "bacterial vaginosis" carries both bacteriologic and clinical connotations. Indeed, it implies that the vagina is uninflamed (as shown by the absence of polymorphonuclear neutrophils), but that potential pathogens (particularly Gardnerella vaginalis) are present. Many studies conducted over the last 10 years have shown that a tentative diagnosis is simple to make, based on the sniff test, the aspect of the vaginal discharge, the presence of clue cells, and the absence of polymorphonuclear cells and lactobacilli on fresh smears. However, classical treatment with metronidazole can be insufficient given the innumerable microbial associations, and a more thorough bacteriological diagnosis is required. The presence of anaerobes is suggested by a positive sniff test. Direct examination reveals small Gram-negative rods in clue cells, but cannot differentiate between commensal atypical lactobacilli and Gram-positive anaerobes. Culture with CO2 supplementation or in anaerobic conditions yields Bacteroides and Mobiluncus spp, frequently associated with Gardnerella vaginalis and pathogenic Fusobacterium spp. Culture in appropriate conditions will detect metronidazole-resistant Propionibacteria and pathogenic anaerobic cocci. Antibiotic susceptibility testing of these organisms is costly and time-consuming, but can avoid therapeutic failures. Gardnerella vaginalis is also frequently associated in bacterial vaginosis with endogenous (mainly E. coli and group B streptococci) and Ureaplasma. Antibiotic susceptibility testing is useful if the predominant members of the flora are Gram-negative aerobes, group D streptococci or pathogenic anaerobes. Bacterial vaginosis is simple to diagnose but poses a real therapeutic problem since some cases call for a simple readjustment of the commensal flora while others require full chemotherapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical and colposcopic aspects of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is characterized by an uniform, malodorous, white-grey discharge. The presenting symptom is generally the unpleasant smell of the vaginal discharge, particularly following the menses or intercourse. Other functional signs, such as pruritus, dysuria and dyspareunia are rare. Inflammatory signs are frequent, and can be revealed by colposcopy with the Lugol test: this shows punctuate colpitis with small regular points corresponding histologically to an inflammatory focus in the connective tissue. The term "vaginitis" is avoided because of the absence of polymorphonuclear cells in the vaginal discharge, despite the presence of inflammation. Bacterial vaginosis has been held responsible for prematurity, small birthweight and post-partum infection. Nonetheless, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus spp can be recovered from the vaginal flora of women with no signs of inflammation.
TI  - [The definition and epidemiology of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is a condition with a flora change in the vaginal where a lactobacilli-dominated flora is exchanged with an abundant complex flora dominated by strict and facultative anaerobic bacteria. The condition seldom occurs in prepubertal girls and post-menopausal women, suggesting an hormonal component in its etiology. Recurrent episodes of bacterial vaginosis are frequent. Three out of four criteria should be fulfilled for establishing the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, i.e., an increased (often homogeneous) vaginal discharge, a positive amine test, the presence of a great number of clue cells, a vaginal pH > or = 4.5. There are no hard data supporting that bacterial vaginosis is a sexually transmitted disease. Cytological changes (CIN I, II, III) have been found more often in women with bacterial vaginosis than in those without this condition. It has been proposed that nitrosamines from the abundant vaginal bacterial flora may be oncogenic, a correlation which, however, needs to be proved. The reservoir for one or more of the bacterial vaginosis-associated organism, e.g., some Bacteroides and Mobiluncus spp., Gardnerella vaginalis and Mycoplasma hominis, is probably the distal intestinal tract and the mouth. Sparse or even a moderate number of clue cells are present in many women who do not have bacterial vaginosis. A vaginal pH of 4.7 seems to be a better cut-off level than 4.5. There is a statistical correlation between bacterial vaginosis and obstetrical complications.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and spectrum of rifaximin, a new topical rifamycin derivative.
AB  - Rifaximin, a rifamycin derivative, was evaluated in vitro to assess its spectrum  and potency against a wide variety of bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and parasites. High concentrations of rifaximin were often used to reflect topically achieved levels since this compound is poorly absorbed by oral route. Like rifampin, rifaximin possessed best activity against Staphylococcus spp. (MIC50 < or = 0.015 microgram/ml), Streptococcus spp. (MIC50s, < or = 0.03-0.12 microgram/ml), Enterococcus spp. (MIC50s, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml), Bacillus cereus (MIC50, 0.06 microgram/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC50, < or = 0.03 microgram/ml), and Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50, 0.25 microgram/ml). Rifaximin demonstrated potential use as a topical agent for bacterial vaginosis by inhibiting Bacteroides bivius-disiens, Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus spp., and Mobiluncus spp. strains (all MICs < or = 1 microgram/ml). Strains of Haemophilus ducreyi and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC50s, 0.25 microgram/ml) were also inhibited. However, some organisms associated with genital tract infections were rifaximin resistant, for example, Candida spp., herpes virus, mycoplasmas, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum. Clinical trials appear warranted using rifaximin topical concentrations that will minimize mutations to rifamycin resistance.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis: characteristics, clinical considerations, and controversies.
AB  - The clinical significance, Gram stain reaction, and genus affiliation of Gardnerella vaginalis have been controversial since Gardner and Dukes described the organism as the cause of "nonspecific vaginitis," a common disease of women which is now called bacterial vaginosis. The organism was named G. vaginalis when taxonomic studies showed that it was unrelated to bacteria in various genera including Haemophilus and Corynebacterium. Electron microscopy and chemical analyses have elucidated the organism's gram-variable reaction. Controversy over the etiology of bacterial vaginosis was largely resolved by (i) studies using improved media and methods for the isolation and identification of bacteria in vaginal fluids and (ii) standardization of criteria for clinical and laboratory diagnosis. Besides G. vaginalis, Mobiluncus spp., Mycoplasma hominis, and certain obligate anaerobes are now acknowledged as participants in bacterial vaginosis. The finding that G. vaginalis, Mobiluncus spp., and M. hominis inhabit the rectum indicates a potential source of autoinfection in addition to sexual transmission. Extravaginal infections with G. vaginalis are increasingly recognized, especially when the toxic anticoagulant polyanetholesulfonate is omitted from blood cultures and when urine cultures are incubated anaerobically for 48 h. The finding that mares harbor G. vaginalis suggests that an equine model can be developed for studies of Gardnerella pathogenesis.
TI  - Comparison of ofloxacin and metronidazole for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ofloxacin, 200 mg twice daily for 7 days, was compared with metronidazole, 400 mg twice daily for 7 days, for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV). Diagnosis of BV was confirmed by at least 3 of the following 4 criteria: the presence of an abnormal vaginal discharge on examination, clue cells on microscopy of vaginal specimens, vaginal pH greater than 5.0 and a positive amine test. Vaginal specimens were examined for Mobiluncus spp, analysed for the succinate/lactate (S/L) ratio and cultured for Trichomonas vaginalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides spp. and Mycoplasma hominis. Patients were reviewed on completion of treatment (visit 2) and 14 days later (visit 3). The diagnosis of BV was accepted in 119 of 149 patients recruited, 60 of whom received treatment with ofloxacin and 59 received metronidazole. Sixty-two patients, 31 in each treatment group, completed the study. Diagnostic cure at visit 2 was significantly better in the metronidazole group with cure rates of 56% (metronidazole) vs 23% (ofloxacin) (P = 0.001); this was associated with higher eradication rates for G. vaginalis (100% vs 56%) and Bacteroides spp. (97% vs 49%). There were no significant differences between the two groups in clinical cure at either visit 2 or 3 or in diagnostic cure at visit 3. Both treatments were well tolerated. We conclude that metronidazole is likely to remain the first choice of treatment for BV but ofloxacin offers a safe and effective alternative.
TI  - Diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis in a routine diagnostic laboratory.
AB  - Vaginal swabs from 299 hospital and general practitioners' patients were examined for Gardnerella vaginalis by Gram film and by culture, G. vaginalis was isolated in 12% of cultures. Comparison between the 'clue' cell and culture methods suggested that the former is a rapid, acceptable routine screening method for the detection of G. vaginalis. The value of the traditional method of identifying G. vaginalis by sensitivity testing is questioned. All specimens were also examined by Gram film and culture, for the presence of Mobiluncus spp, which was detected in 8.4% of specimens by Gram film but only 0.7% by culture. From a questionnaire returned by 84% of clinicians, metronidazole was found to be the most commonly used antimicrobial agent for the treatment of G. vaginalis, and in all but one case appeared to be clinically effective.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis associated with G vaginallis / Mobiluncus sp: ultrastructural parameters.
AB  
TI  - The susceptibility of organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis to spermicidal compounds, in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a prevalent vaginal infection that is now regarded as a risk factor in more serious pelvic and obstetric complications. Spermicides are known to have antimicrobial activity against other sexually transmitted diseases and the aim of this study was to test whether the causative organisms of BV were also susceptible to spermicides, in vitro. DESIGN: Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations of five spermicidal compounds were determined for the organisms associated with BV, in an agar dilution technique. LOCATION: The Department of Experimental and Clinical Microbiology, University of Sheffield Medical School, UK. SPERMICIDES AND ORGANISMS: Nonoxynol-9, Nonoxynol-11, Docusate sodium, Benzalkonium chloride and Menfegol were tested against 20 strains each of Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides and Mobiluncus organisms, isolated from patients with BV who attended the Department of Genitourinary Medicine, the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The susceptibility of BV-associated organisms to spermicidal compounds, in vitro. RESULTS: G vaginalis, Mobiluncus spp, Bacteroides bivius and Bacteroides disiens were all susceptible to the five spermicides tested, with MICs ranging between less than or equal to 19 and 5000 mg/l (0.0019%-0.5%). CONCLUSION: The concentrations of spermicides incorporated in contraceptive preparations are usually between 3% and 8%, which are far in excess of the MICs found for BV organisms. Their usage could exert a significant antimicrobial effect and be a useful prophylactic in preventing the infection.
TI  - Antibiosis between bacteria isolated from the vagina of women with and without signs of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Lactobacilli from women with and without bacterial vaginosis (BV) were tested for H2O2 production. Thirty-seven (79%) of the 47 strains of lactobacilli isolated from the women without BV produced H2O2, while only nine (23%) of the 39 strains of lactobacilli obtained from women with BV did so. Five of 20 H2O2-producing and two of 26 non-producing strains of Lactobacillus exhibited antibiosis against four of 12 strains of peptostreptococci and two of 10 strains of Mobiluncus spp. None of a further 41 different anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial strains were inhibited by any of the isolates of lactobacilli tested. Some strains of Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteriodes spp., Mobiluncus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. inhibited the growth of three strains of lactobacilli belonging to different species. When the pH of the culture medium was increased from 6.0 to 6.5 this led to a decrease in the number of strains inhibited and/or the size of the growth-inhibitory zones. Different concentrations of H2O2 did not inhibit any of the strains tested. The growth-inhibitory effect of lactobacilli could not be related to their bacteriocin production. Increasing the iron content of the medium by adding FeCl3 (0.01 mM-1 mM) decreased or completely abolished the antibiosis.
TI  - Microbiological, epidemiological and clinical correlates of vaginal colonisation  by Mobiluncus species.
AB  - The microbiological and epidemiological correlates of vaginal colonisation by Mobiluncus species were examined among randomly selected women attending a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic. Women positive for Trichomonas vaginalis were excluded. Mobiluncus spp. were detected by Gram stained vaginal smear in 21% of 633 STD clinic patients, including 53% of those with and 4% of those without bacterial vaginosis (BV), as diagnosed by clinical criteria. Gardnerella vaginalis and Mycoplasma hominis detected by vaginal culture and Mobiluncus detected by vaginal Gram stain were each independently associated with BV after adjusting by logistic regression for the presence of sexually transmitted disease pathogens, gravidity, parity and number of lifetime sexual partners (p less than 0.001 for each organism). Bacterial vaginosis was negatively correlated with isolation of lactobacilli, yeast and herpes simplex virus. After adjusting for presence or absence of BV, women with Mobiluncus were more likely to harbour G vaginalis (odds ratio 5.6, 95% confidence interval 1.6-19.5), M hominis (OR 3.7, 95% CI 2.0-7.0) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.4-6.0) and less likely to harbour vaginal yeast (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-1.0); were more likely to be black (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.5-4.6), and to have been pregnant (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.1); but after the adjustment for BV, vaginal colonisation by Mobiluncus was not associated with symptoms of odour, abdominal pain, menstrual irregularities, or with adnexal tenderness. In summary, Mobiluncus, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mycoplasma hominis were independently associated with a clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, and Mobiluncus was further associated with the presence of BV-associated microorganisms (M hominis and G vaginalis), N gonorrhoeae, black race, and gravidity.
TI  - [Cytology of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis seems to be one of the most frequent cause of vaginal diseases which may be ascending and separates a not aesthetical discharge. A pH greater than 4.5 is found, the presence of clue cells, and a positive sniff test referring to Mobiluncus. The main microorganisms causing bacterial vaginosis are Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus sp. These are anaerobic ones. Cytology is able to give a quick and sure diagnosis.
TI  - [Intravaginal bacterial flora in patients with uterine cervical cancer, with special reference to Gardnerella vaginalis].
AB  - In a total of 18 subjects, comprising 16 cases of uterine cervical cancer (4 cases, stage Ib; 1 case, stage IIa; 11 cases, stage IIb) and 2 cases of cervical dysplasia, the intravaginal bacterial floras, including Gardnerella vaginalis (G. vaginalis) and Mobiluncus spp., were investigated. In uterine cervical cancer, there were mixed bacterial flora of aerobes and anaerobes but what is of note is that G. vaginalis was detected in 7 out of 16 cases of uterine cervical cancer and in 1 out of 2 cases of dysplasia. The number of G. vaginalis present was far greater than that of the other coexisting species. In contrast, none of the Mobiluncus spp. was detected. Since G. vaginalis was detected at a high incidence in uterine cervical cancer and dysplasia, the possibility of a relationship between G. vaginalis and uterine cervical cancer was suggested.
TI  - Reservoir of four organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis suggests lack of  sexual transmission.
AB  - This study consisted of a search for the possible reservoir and mode of spread of the four bacterial vaginosis-associated organisms Mobiluncus mulieris, Mobiluncus curtisii, Mycoplasma hominis, and Gardnerella vaginalis. Their occurrence in rectal, oral, and pharyngeal specimens from women with and without bacterial vaginosis, their male sexual consorts, four homosexual men, and children (altogether, 374 people) was studied. Genital samples were also obtained from all adults. All four organisms were isolated from the rectums of 45 to 62% of women with bacterial vaginosis and 10 to 14% of women without bacterial vaginosis. They also occurred in the rectums of males and children. M. hominis was recovered from the oropharynxes of 12 adults whose sexual consorts had genital occurrences of the organism. Mobiluncus spp. occurred only in the vaginas of women with bacterial vaginosis (97%). The organisms were only infrequently recovered from genital samples from 135 males. Organisms were recovered from the urethras and/or coronal sulci of 10 of 44 male consorts of women with bacterial vaginosis. However, after 2 weeks of condom use during sexual intercourse, only M. hominis remained in the urethra of one man. These findings suggest that the organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis are not spread sexually but colonize the vagina from an endogenous intestinal tract site. The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to bacterial vaginosis in a subpopulation of all women are still unknown.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - In the western world, bacterial vaginosis is now being recognised as the commonest cause of vaginitis. Bacterial vaginosis represents a major disturbance in vaginal microbiology with the massive overgrowth of predominantly anaerobic bacteria normally found in the vagina. Accordingly, high population levels of non-fragilis Bacteroides sp., peptostreptococci, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus sp. are found, with a corresponding decline in Lactobacillus sp. Excessive polyamine production by anaerobes is responsible for the offensive vaginal discharge, and G. Vaginalis adherent to epithelial cells produces pathognomonic clue cells, which together with elevated vaginal pH constitute the hallmark of diagnosis. The pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis remains poorly understood and the role of sexual transmission is controversial. Bacterial vaginosis may cause symptoms but is frequently asymptomatic. It is more than a nuisance vaginal infection in that (a) many patients have recurrent episodes, and (b) it has recently been associated with post-partum and post-operative fever, upper genital tract infection, amnionitis and prematurity. Therapy for symptomatic bacterial vaginosis is currently dominated by metronidazole; however, clindamycin and a host of new agents may enjoy similar success. Women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis constitute a major therapeutic problem, as do pregnant women. The cause of frequently recurring bacterial vaginosis remains obscure. New data are presented here indicating that early recurrences are due to relapse and not reinfection. No evidence has emerged that suggests that relapse is due to antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis: diagnostic and pathogenetic findings during topical clindamycin therapy.
AB  - We examined subjective and objective correlates among 67 women with symptomatic bacterial vaginosis before and after treatment with intravaginal clindamycin or placebo. We found no preponderance of any sexual practices among these patients. Nine patients (13.4%) had had hysterectomy. Whereas odor and discharge were the most common symptoms, 30 patients (44.8%) also complained of vulvovaginal irritation. Symptoms correlated poorly with objective therapeutic outcome. On examination the diagnosis would have been missed in seven patients (10.4%) if the clinician relied on presence of an abnormal vaginal discharge to suggest bacterial vaginosis. Vaginal pH greater than 4.5 was found immediately after curative therapy in 59.6% of patients. Mobiluncus spp. morphotypes were 99.0% specific and 52.1% sensitive and proline aminopeptidase activity in vaginal fluid was 84.4% sensitive and 70.2% specific for diagnosis. Our Gram stain criteria yielded no false-negative results, 6.1% false-positive, and frequent indeterminate results after therapy. We found little evidence for sexual transmission of bacterial vaginosis. Recurrence after effective therapy was not predicted by vaginal pH elevation, positive or indeterminate Gram stain result, or positive proline aminopeptidase test.
TI  - Relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  - Bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. We obtained semen samples from 37 men attending a Special Infertility Clinic and assessed the relationship between seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. Aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. One hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. The microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), Peptostreptococcus sp (62%), Bacteroides sp (27%), Gardnerella vaginalis (19%), Lactobacillus sp (16%), Actinomyces sp (16%), Enterococcus (11%), and Veillonella (11%). Other microorganisms including group B streptococcus, Hemophilus, Escherichia coli, Mobiluncus, and Clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. When the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), Bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or Peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (P greater than .05 for each comparison). The proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis: prevalence in outpatients, association with some micro-organisms and laboratory indices.
AB  - Seven hundred and ninety three women were investigated, aged between 16 and 78 years, to evaluate the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and some associated micro-organisms, and to discuss the significance of laboratory indices correlated to this pathology. BV was diagnosed on the basis of four distinct criteria: a positive result of the test for amines with 10% KOH (odour-test), the presence of clue cells on fresh microscopic examination, a pH greater than 4.5 and direct Gram stain positive (the presence of more than 40 Gram negative or Gram variable coccobacilli per microscopic field by 1000 magnifications under oil immersion). The total prevalence of BV was 20.5% (163); similar percentages were found in both fertile and pregnant women, whereas a lower percentage (12.7%) was found in menopausal women. Gardnerella vaginalis was present in 235 (29.6%) of the 793 women, in 144 (88.3%) of the 163 with BV and in 91 (14.4%) of the 630 women without BV. Mobiluncus species was present in 8.2% (65) of the total population, in 38.6% (63) of the women with BV and only in two (0.3%) of the women without BV. In the women with BV lower percentages were found for Trichomonas vaginalis, yeasts, Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The absence of a definite relationship between BV and cultural isolation of G vaginalis is confirmed whereas the role played by Mobiluncus spp still has to be clarified. It is concluded that it is not necessary to screen with all four laboratory indices. Two positive indices from a panel of three (excluding pH greater than 4.5 and direct Gram stain positive in the same panel) allows the correct diagnosis of BV in almost all cases.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is a common, non-inflammatory infection of the vagina. It is  characterised by the presence of a thin, homogenous, greyish-white discharge. The differential diagnosis includes infection with Trichomonas vaginalis and Candida albicans. A diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis may be made by the detection of three of the following: characteristic discharge, pH of 5 or greater, clue cells and a positive KOH amine test. Culture of vaginal discharge is not necessary to effect a diagnosis. Bacterial vaginosis responds readily to treatment with metronidazole at a dosage of 400 mg twice daily for seven days, although a proportion of patients suffer a recurrence of symptoms. Treatment of sexual partners may be necessary in such cases. Bacterial vaginosis results from the synergistic interaction of Gardnerella vaginalis and obligate anaerobes, including Bacteroides and Mobiluncus species. The pathogenesis, laboratory diagnosis, treatment, and the mechanisms by which these organisms produce the symptoms of bacterial vaginosis are discussed.
TI  - Clue cells in bacterial vaginosis: immunofluorescent identification of the adherent gram-negative bacteria as Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Clue cells are epithelial cells covered by adherent gram-negative rods, observed  in vaginal smears from women with bacterial vaginosis. Immunofluorescence studies were used to identify the gram-negative bacteria adhering to clue cells. Specific antisera to four common gram-negative vaginal bacteria (Gardnerella, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and Mobiluncus) were prepared by long-term, multiple, small-inoculum immunization of rabbits. Cross-reactivity with heterologous common vaginal bacteria was removed by absorption against whole cells of heterologous bacteria and by serial dilution. Gardnerella vaginalis was most often observed adhering to the surface of clue cells and was detected on the surface of exfoliated vaginal epithelial cells significantly more frequently and in higher numbers than were Mobiluncus, Bacteroides, and Fusobacterium, suggesting that this species of gram-negative bacteria is responsible for clue cell formation.
TI  - Comparison of the in vitro activities of fenticonazole, other imidazoles, metronidazole, and tetracycline against organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis and skin infections.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of the antifungal compound fenticonazole was  compared with those of clotrimazole, miconazole, tetracycline, and metronidazole against 177 strains of bacterial species associated with either bacterial vaginosis (BV) or skin infections by agar dilution MIC determinations. BV-associated Bacteroides isolates of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus-B. oralis group, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus spp., and anaerobic, gram-positive cocci were highly susceptible to fenticonazole, clotrimazole, and miconazole; but Bacteroides spp. not associated with BV, Bacteroides ureolyticus and the Bacteroides fragilis group, were resistant. All Bacteroides strains were susceptible to metronidazole, but the susceptibility of G. vaginalis and Mobiluncus spp. varied. Among the skin bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, coryneforms, and streptococci were highly susceptible to the imidazoles; but Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were generally resistant. This antibacterial activity may give fenticonazole a useful role in the topical treatment of vaginal discharge and in mycotic skin infections that are superinfected with bacteria.
TI  - The cytologist and bacterioses of the vaginal-ectocervical area. Clues, commas and confusion.
AB  - To evaluate the role of the cytologist in the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, the predominant bacterial patterns seen in 157 Papanicolaou-stained cervical smears were assessed and classified as large bacillus, anaerobic or scanty. A large bacillus pattern was found in 73 smears (46%), an anaerobic pattern in 77 (49%) and scanty bacteria in 7 (5%). Comma-shaped (curved) bacilli were found in 34 smears. The prevalence of clue cells in smears with anaerobic patterns was 73%. Gardnerella vaginalis was cultured from 89% of the cases with anaerobic-type smears containing clue cells and from 88% of those with anaerobic-type smears lacking clue cells. Mobiluncus sp. was cultured from 83% of the cases with anaerobic-type smears showing curved bacilli and 14% of those with anaerobic-type smears lacking curved bacilli. Papanicolaou-stained smears were found to be more sensitive and more specific for identifying clue cells than were wet preparations. A positive association was found between a positive KOH "whiff" test and the presence of curved bacilli on the Papanicolaou-stained smear. The clinical significance of these findings is discussed.
TI  - Chemotaxis inhibition by Gardnerella vaginalis and succinate producing vaginal anaerobes: composition of vaginal discharge associated with G vaginalis.
AB  - The influence of six succinate producing vaginal anaerobes and Gardnerella vaginalis on the chemotactic activity of granulocytes was studied by the under agarose method. G vaginalis, Mobiluncus species, and three Gram negative anaerobes elicited hardly any response, but Peptostreptococcus productus showed clear positive chemotaxis, as did the Escherichia coli strain used as a control. Inhibition of the chemotactic response of white blood cells was found with all strains, but the high succinate producers from the genus Bacteroides showed the most pronounced effect. The inhibition of chemotaxis by succinate producing anaerobes in the pathogenesis of non-specific vaginitis (NSV) is postulated, and B ureolyticus or Mobiluncus spp, rather than G vaginalis, are suggested as possible causes of NSV.
TI  - In vitro activity of azithromycin and erythromycin against organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis and chancroid.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new macrolide azithromycin and erythromycin against  Haemophilus ducreyi, Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides spp. and Mobiluncus spp. was compared. Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus spp. and Haemophilus ducreyi were highly susceptible to both agents but azithromycin was more effective overall against all three groups of organisms. The activity of both antibiotics against Bacteroides spp. varied greatly, but azithromycin was again more active. Collectively, 62% of all Bacteroides strains were susceptible to erythromycin (MIC 1 mg/1) and 74% were susceptible to azithromycin.
TI  - [Cervico-vaginal pathogens and contraception: microbiological observations].
AB  - The authors relate the results about 172 vaginal and cervical swabs, in women with or without oral/local (IUD) contraception, with or without vaginosis/vaginitis. Gardnerella vaginalis was always prevalent; the authors observed an high correlation between cervical IUD and vaginal Gardnerella, more than IUD and cervical Chlamydia trachomatis. Bacterial associations in Gardnerella vaginalis (Mobiluncus, obligate anaerobes) are related; incidence of Candida and Trichomonas vaginalis are reported; correlation between these microbial agents and contraception are discussed.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis: microbiological and clinical findings.
AB  - A prospective study was performed involving 101 women who consecutively attended  a primary health care unit for complaints of genital malodour and/or abnormal vaginal discharge. Bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed in 34 women on the basis of four diagnostic criteria: vaginal pH greater than 4.7, homogeneous vaginal discharge, a positive amine test and clue cells. The sensitivity of these criteria was greater than 90% except for homogeneous discharge (82%). Their specificity was greater than 90% except for vaginal pH greater than 4.7 (46%); a specificity of 87% could have been achieved by using the criterion for vaginal pH greater than or equal to 5.0. There was a strong association between diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and the concomitant occurrence of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus spp. and Bacteroides spp. There was no difference between women with or without bacterial vaginosis as regards contraception methods (except for use of an intrauterine device), age at first intercourse, or earlier episodes of vaginal discharge. Sexual transmission of the predominant bacteria was not supported by data collected from the male consorts.
TI  - Incidence of motile, curved anaerobic rods (Mobiluncus species) in vaginal secretions.
AB  - Aerobic and anaerobic cultures as well as a Gram stain and wet mount preparation  were made of vaginal swabs taken from various groups of women including those with vaginal discharge. The bacteria commonly found in cultures were lactobacilli, coryneforms, Staphylococcus epidermidis and facultative streptococci. Anaerobes were isolated from 75% (475 of 632) of specimens. The incidence of Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida species, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus species in the five groups of women varied from 2.2-5.1%, 11.5-35.7%, 23.3-36.7% and 20.0-34.8% respectively. Except for Candida species, differences in the prevalence of these organisms between the groups of women were not significant. The isolation rates of Candida species in women attending the antenatal clinic and staff health clinic were significantly higher than women in the other groups. Mobiluncus species were found to occur either with T. vaginalis, Candida species or G. vaginalis alone or with any two or with all three or in the absence of these organisms. However, the incidence of Mobiluncus species was significantly higher in women colonized with G. vaginalis (112 of 185, or 60.5%) compared with women not infected (47 of 477, or 9.8%). Also, Mobiluncus species occurred in large numbers when found in the presence of G. vaginalis. When found without G. vaginalis, Mobiluncus species occurred in much smaller numbers. As with G. vaginalis, Mobiluncus species also occurred concomitantly with certain anaerobes, mainly Bacteroides species and peptostreptococci.
TI  - Susceptibility of Mobiluncus species to 23 antimicrobial agents and 15 other compounds.
AB  - The susceptibility of 12 strains of Mobiluncus curtisii and 10 strains of M. mulieris to 23 antimicrobial agents and 15 other compounds was determined. All strains were susceptible to chloramphenicol, clindamycin, rifampin, tobramycin, vancomycin, virginiamycin, and all beta-lactam antibiotics tested, including imipenem. One strain of M. mulieris was resistant to erythromycin and josamycin. All were resistant to colistin, cycloserine, nalidixic acid, and neomycin. Tetracycline had variable activity. All M. curtisii strains were resistant to metronidazole and its hydroxy metabolite. Of 10 M. mulieris strains, 5 were resistant to metronidazole and 2 were resistant to its hydroxy metabolite. All 12 M. curtisii and 1 of 10 M. mulieris strains were resistant to tinidazole. M. curtisii and M. mulieris produced two mutually exclusive clusters of MICs when tested against ampicillin, cefoxitin, cephalothin, moxalactam, alizarin red, Evans blue, and sodium fluoride. Gardnerella vaginalis was more susceptible to Nile blue A than was either M. curtisii or M. mulieris. Clindamycin and imipenem may be useful agents in the therapy of metronidazole-resistant bacterial vaginosis. Metronidazole, tinidazole, and Nile blue A may be of value in the development of a selective agar for Mobiluncus species.
TI  - New developments in the etiology and pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is unlike the "classic" sexually transmitted diseases. Unlike cervical infection with Chlamydia or salpingitis caused by N. gonorrhoeae, no single etiologic agent has been identified, and the organisms which are associated with infection have all been found as members of endogenous vaginal flora, with the possible exception of Mobiluncus species. If, as we suspect, BV is due to interactions among various organisms found in the vagina during vaginal health, we must determine what changes in the microbial or chemical ecology determine the development of BV. If, for instance, BV is simply due to an inversion in the concentrations of various organisms such that the anaerobes which are usually present in low numbers become predominant and the lactobacilli which usually predominate become few in number, we must determine which causes what. That is, does some organism or environmental change allow the anaerobes to overgrow and thereby inhibit the lactobacilli, or does some change inhibit the lactobacilli, thereby, allowing the other flora to overgrow? Answers to questions such as these await further research.
TI  - Vaginal lactobacilli inhibiting growth of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus and other bacterial species cultured from vaginal content of women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - On a solid agar medium the growth-inhibitory effect of 9 Lactobacillus strains cultured from vaginal content was tested on bacteria cultured from vaginal content of women with bacterial vaginosis: Mobiluncus, Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides and anaerobic cocci. Inhibition zones were observed in the growth of all of the strains isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis around all lactobacilli. The inhibitory effect of the lactobacilli was further tested on various anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic species, both type strains and fresh extragenitally cultured strains. Four Bacteroides fragilis strains as well as 2 out of 4 Staphylococcus aureus strains were clearly inhibited by the lactobacilli. The inhibition zones were generally wider at pH 5.5 than at 6.0. For all inhibited strains, (the S. aureus excepted) a low pH on the agar around the lactobacilli correlated to wider growth-inhibition zones.
TI  - Tetracycline resistance and tetM in pathogenic urogenital bacteria.
AB  - Clinical isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Bacteroides spp., and Mobiluncus spp. were screened for resistance to tetracycline and for the presence of the streptococcal tetM determinant. The S. agalactiae and G. vaginalis strains contained DNA sequences homologous to the tetM determinant, while strains of the other two genera did not.
TI  - Activity of pefloxacin and thirteen other antimicrobial agents in vitro against isolates from hospital and genitourinary infections.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of the quinolone derivative pefloxacin was compared with that of three other quinolones, five beta-lactam antibiotics and three aminoglycosides against 367 isolates from hospital patients and from out-patients with genitourinary infections. MIC90 of pefloxacin and norfloxacin for each strain was the same; that of ciprofloxacin was a little lower. All strains except Escherichia coli were resistant to nalidixic acid. Pefloxacin was highly active against Staphylococcus aureus (39 strains; MIC90 1.0 mg/l) and most strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci (56; 4 mg/l), Esch. coli (50; 0.25 mg/l), other enterobacteria (33; 1.0 mg/l) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 6; 0.25 mg/l). With Bacteroides spp. (total 78; 64 mg/l), the fragilis group (23) and the fusobacteria (19) were resistant, but the melaninogenicus-oralis group (31; range 0.06- greater than 64 mg/l) and B. ureolyticus (22; 0.125- greater than 64 mg/l) gave variable results. Amongst genitourinary isolates, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (15) and Haemophilus ducreyi (34) were sensitive (less than 0.06 mg/l) but Gardnerella vaginalis (25) and Mobiluncus spp. (11) were resistant (32 mg/l). Pefloxacin was more active than ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, latamoxef and piperacillin against S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci and than gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci. No enterobacteria or pseudomonads were resistant to pefloxacin or other quinolones, whereas some were resistant to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo activity of metronidazole against Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides spp. and Mobiluncus spp. in bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - An open, randomized, culture-controlled clinical study was designed to compare the efficacy of a single 2 g dose of metronidazole (Elyzol) with standard 7-day therapy in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV). Forty-one of 47 (87%) patients given the single dose and 30 of 33 (91%) given the 7-day treatment were found to be cured seven days after treatment. At final assessment, 24 of 34 (71%) patients given the single dose and 22 of 28 (79%) given the 7-day treatment remained cured. The two regimes were equally efficaceous in eradicating Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides spp. and Mobiluncus spp. (anaerobic curved rods) from vaginal specimens from patients with BV. The in-vitro activity of metronidazole and its hydroxy metabolite was determined for 11 strains of Gard. vaginalis, 17 strains of Bacteroides spp. and 14 strains of Mobiluncus spp. which had been isolated from patients prior to treatment. The MIC of metronidazole against Gard. vaginalis varied between 2 and greater than or equal to 128 mg/l (median MIC 32 mg/l), but the hydroxy metabolite showed a markedly increased activity against eight of the strains tested (median MIC 4 mg/l). The MIC of metronidazole against the Mobiluncus spp. varied between 0.5 and greater than or equal to 128 mg/l (median MIC 16 mg/l) and the hydroxy metabolite showed little increased activity (median MIC also 16 mg/l). The Bacteroides organisms were highly susceptible to metronidazole and to the hydroxy metabolite, each having a median MIC of 1 mg/l.
TI  - [Etiology of bacterial vaginosis (non-specific vaginitis)].
AB  - 56 women who were diagnosed bioclinically as having a bacterial vaginal infection were studied, as were 35 women as a control group. The study was a semi-quantitative analysis of the vaginal bacterial flora, both aerobic and anaerobic. It shows that Gardnerella vaginalis and anaerobic bacteria such as Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides, Veillonella and Mobiluncus were associated in a statistically significant way with bacterial vaginitis. On the other hand Lactobacilli were less frequently found (p less than 0.001) than in the control group of women. The way in which the microbial flora is changed has been observed during attacks of vaginitis and is discussed, as is the importance of making the diagnosis and of treating this syndrome.
