TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in seri kembangan, malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  == this study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around seri kembangan, a city in malaysia. pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of otus with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). proteobacteria, firmicutes and bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (otus) observed across all samples. the highest appearance frequencies (100%) were otus closely related to enterobacter sp., enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas sp. and pseudomonas putida. several otus were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, cronobacter sakazaki, cronobacter turisensis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, hafnia alvei, kurthia gibsonii, salmonella bongori, salmonella enterica, salmonella paratyphi, salmonella tyhpi, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. the condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.

TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics of microbial communities during back-slop soaking of soybeans as determined by pcr-dgge and molecular cloning.
AB  == tempe is a traditional fermented food in indonesia. the manufacture process is quite complex, which comprises two stages, preparatory soaking of soybeans and fungal solid state fermentation. daily addition of previous soak water (back-slopping) during the soybean soaking step is considered to be crucial in the manufacture of high quality tempe. the microbial diversity and dynamics of the microbial communities evolving during back-slop soaking of soybeans for tempe making was investigated by culture-independent pcr-dgge and molecular cloning. both dna and total rna were isolated and included in this study, to obtain a view on the succession of total and viable bacteria in the complex microbiota. dgge profiles indicated that enterobacter sp., enterococcus sp., pseudomonas putida, leuconostoc fallax, pediococcus pentosaceus, and weissella cibaria, were the predominant bacteria. their occurrence shifted dramatically during the back-slop  soaking procedure. this study combined with previous culture-dependent studies could gain a better understanding of the complex microbiota of traditional fermented food and give useful information for its quality control.

TI  == a simple strategy for investigating the diversity and hydrocarbon degradation abilities of cultivable bacteria from contaminated soil.
AB  == the use of indigenous bacterial strains is a valuable bioremediation strategy for cleaning the environment from hydrocarbon pollutants. the isolation and selection of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria is therefore crucial for obtaining the most promising strains for site decontamination. two different media, a minimal medium supplemented with a mixture of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and a ms medium supplemented with triphenyltetrazolium chloride, were used for the isolation of bacterial strains from two hydrocarbon contaminated soils and from their enrichment phases. the hydrocarbon degradation abilities of these bacterial isolates were easily and rapidly assessed using the 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol assay. the diversity of the bacterial communities isolated from these two soil samples and from their enrichment phases was evaluated by the combination of a bacterial clustering method, fluorescence its-pcr, and bacterial identification by 16s rrna sequencing. different pcr-based assays were performed in order to detect the genes responsible for hydrocarbon degradation. the best hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, including arthrobacter sp., enterobacter sp., sphingomonas sp., pseudomonas koreensis, pseudomonas putida and pseudomonas plecoglossicida, were isolated directly from the soil samples on minimal medium.  the nahac gene was detected only in 13 gram-negative isolates and the sequences of nahac-like genes were obtained from enterobacter, stenotrophomonas, pseudomonas brenneri, pseudomonas entomophila and p. koreensis strains. the combination of isolation on minimal medium with the 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol assay was effective in selecting different hydrocarbon-degrading strains from 353 isolates.

TI  == broad diversity of conjugative plasmids in integron-carrying bacteria from wastewater environments.
AB  == in this study we assessed the occurrence, diversity and conjugative potential of  plasmids in integron-carrying aeromonas and enterobacteriaceae from wastewaters.  sixty-six strains were included as donors in mating assays using rifampicin-resistant escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida recipient strains. the diversity of plasmids from donors and transconjugants (resistant to tetracycline or streptomycin) was evaluated by restriction analysis and replicon  typing targeting 19 incompatibility groups. restriction patterns revealed a diverse plasmid pool present in these strains. plasmids were assigned to frepb (aeromonas salmonicida, aeromonas veronii, aeromonas sp., e. coli, enterobacter sp.), fic (a. salmonicida, aeromonas sp.), fia (shigella sp.), i1 (a. veronii, aeromonas sp., e. coli), hi1 (e. coli) and u (aeromonas media) replicons. nevertheless, 50% of the plasmids could not be assigned to any replicon type. among integron-positive transconjugants, frepb, i1 and hi1 replicons were detected. results showed that wastewaters enclose a rich plasmid pool associated  with integron-carrying bacteria, capable of conjugating to different bacterial hosts. moreover, replicons detected in this study in aeromonas strains expand our current knowledge of plasmid diversity in this genus.

TI  == enhancing biodegradation of wastewater by microbial consortia with fractional factorial design.
AB  == batch experiments were conducted on the degradation of synthetic and municipal wastewater by six different strains, i.e., agrobacterium sp., bacillus sp., enterobacter cloacae, gordonia, pseudomonas stutzeri, pseudomonas putida. by applying a fractional factorial design (ffd) of experiments, the influence of each strain and their interactions were quantified. an empirical model predicting the treatment efficiency was built based on the results of the ffd experiments with an r(2) value of 99.39%. for single strain, enterobacter cloacae, gordonia and p. putida (p=0.008, 0.009 and 0.023, respectively) showed significant enhancement on organic removal in the synthetic wastewater. positive interaction  from enterobacter cloacae, gordonia (p=0.046) was found, indicating that syntrophic interaction existed, and their coexistence can improve total organic carbon (toc) degradation. verification experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of bioaugmentation by introducing three selected strains into an activated sludge reactor for treating municipal wastewater. the removal efficiency of toc with the bioaugmentation was increased from 67-72% to 80-84% at an influent toc concentration of 200mg/l. the results derived from this study indicate that the ffd is a useful screening tool for optimizing the microbial community to enhance  treatment efficiency.

TI  == nitrous oxide emission and microbial community in the rhizosphere of nodulated soybeans during the late growth period.
AB  == we examined n(2)o emissions from the rhizosphere of field-grown soybeans during the late growth stage (99-117 days after sowing). marked emissions were detected  from the nodulated root systems of field-grown soybeans, whereas a non-nodulating soybean mutant showed no emission. degraded nodules exclusively generated the n(2)o. a culture-independent analysis of microbial communities showed bradyrhizobium sp., acidvorax facilis, salmonella enterica, xanthomonas sp., enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas putida, fusarium sp., nematodes, and other protozoans to be more abundant in the degraded nodules, suggesting that some of these organisms participate in the n(2)o emission process in the soybean rhizosphere.

TI  == genome survey and characterization of endophytic bacteria exhibiting a beneficial effect on growth and development of poplar trees.
AB  == the association of endophytic bacteria with their plant hosts has a beneficial effect for many different plant species. our goal is to identify endophytic bacteria that improve the biomass production and the carbon sequestration potential of poplar trees (populus spp.) when grown in marginal soil and to gain  an insight in the mechanisms underlying plant growth promotion. members of the gammaproteobacteria dominated a collection of 78 bacterial endophytes isolated from poplar and willow trees. as representatives for the dominant genera of endophytic gammaproteobacteria, we selected enterobacter sp. strain 638, stenotrophomonas maltophilia r551-3, pseudomonas putida w619, and serratia proteamaculans 568 for genome sequencing and analysis of their plant growth-promoting effects, including root development. derivatives of these endophytes, labeled with gfp, were also used to study the colonization of their poplar hosts. in greenhouse studies, poplar cuttings (populus deltoides x populus nigra dn-34) inoculated with enterobacter sp. strain 638 repeatedly showed the highest increase in biomass production compared to cuttings of noninoculated control plants. sequence data combined with the analysis of their metabolic properties resulted in the identification of many putative mechanisms, including  carbon source utilization, that help these endophytes to thrive within a plant environment and to potentially affect the growth and development of their plant hosts. understanding the interactions between endophytic bacteria and their host  plants should ultimately result in the design of strategies for improved poplar biomass production on marginal soils as a feedstock for biofuels.

TI  == occurrence and diversity of integrons and beta-lactamase genes among ampicillin-resistant isolates from estuarine waters.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence and molecular diversity of beta-lactamase genes and integrons among gram-negative ampicillin-resistant bacteria from ria de aveiro. ampicillin-resistant isolates were selected and subjected to genotyping using rep-pcr. representatives from each rep pattern were affiliated with the following taxa by sequencing the 16s rrna gene: aeromonas caviae, a. hydrophila, a. media, a. molluscorum, a. veronii, a. salmonicida, aeromonas sp., pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas sp., escherichia coli, escherichia sp., shigella sonnei, shigella sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, r. planticola, citrobacter freundii, morganella morganii and enterobacter sp. isolates affiliated with genera escherichia or shigella were identified as escherichia coli using phenotypic-based tests. pcr was used to assess beta-lactamase encoding sequences (bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(carb), bla(ctx-m), bla(imp), bla(vim), bla(cpha/imis), bla(oxa-a), bla(oxa-b), bla(oxa-c)), class 1 and class 2 integrases, and integron variable regions. sequence analysis of pcr products was performed. beta-lactamase genes were detected in 77.8% of the enterobacteriaceae and in 10.5% of the aeromonas. the most frequently detected gene was bla(tem), followed by bla(shv,)bla(oxa-b),  bla(cpha/imis) and bla(carb). retrieved sequences shared high homology with previously described beta-lactamases. the inti1 gene was present in 29.6% of the  enterobacteriaceae and in 21% of the aeromonas isolates. the inti2 gene was present in 4 isolates. a total of 13 cassettes included in 12 different cassette  arrays were identified. the most frequently found resistance gene cassettes were  aada variants. previous investigations based on cultivation-independent approaches revealed higher molecular diversity among beta-lactamase-encoding sequences in this estuary. this fact reinforces the hypothesis that cultivation-dependent approaches may underestimate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in environmental samples and may introduce bias in the recovery  of their molecular variants.

TI  == [effects of pine wood nematode on propagation of its carrying bacteria].
AB  == in this paper, the aseptic eggs of bursaphelenchus xylophilus were obtained after treated with 30% h202, and cultured with pinus thunbergii callus. ten b. xylophilus-carrying bacterial strains directly isolated from diseased p. thugbergii and p. massoniana in six epidemic provinces i.e., gcm6-2a pseudomonas  putida, gcm6-1a p. putida, zpb1-2a p. putida, hem2a pseudomonas sp., hem1a pseudomonas sp., hem142b pseudomonas sp., gcm1-3a p. cepacia and hm3 pantoeu sp., zpb4-2b staphylococcus sciuri and zpb2-3a enterobacter amnigenus, were collected, and the effects of axenic b. xylophilus (abx) on their propagation were studied.  the results showed that pine wood nematode (pwn) promoted the propagation of 7 bacterial strains in pseudomonas and 1 bacterial strain in pantoeu sp., including pseudomonas putida, p. putida, p. putida , pseudomonas sp., pseudomonas sp., pseudomonas sp., p. cepacia and pantoeu sp., but inhibited staphylococcus sciuri  and enterobacter amnigenus, which could explain the phenomenon that pseudomonas was the prevailing genus of the bacteria carried by pwn, and might provide essential nutrition to the bacteria. the close relationship between pwn and bacterial strains in pseudomonas might account for the pine wood nematode disease.

TI  == cells of pseudomonas putida and enterobacter sp. adapt to toxic organic compounds by increasing their size.
AB  == the phenol-degrading solvent-tolerant bacterium pseudomonas putida p8 changed its cell shape when grown in the presence of aromatic compounds such as phenol and 4-chlorophenol. the sizes of cells that had been growing after addition of different concentrations of the toxic compounds were measured using a coulter counter that calculates the sizes of the rod-shaped bacteria to diameters of virtual spheres. the cells showed an increase in the diameter depending on the toxic effects of the applied concentrations of both solvents. the same effect was measured for an alkanol degrading bacterium, enterobacter sp. vkgh12, in the presence of n-butanol. the reaction of the cells to different concentrations of n-butanol was examined by scanning electron microscopy. with this technique it could be shown that the size of the bacteria increased with increasing concentrations of n-butanol. these changes in cell size were dependent on the cellular activity and occurred only after addition of non-lethal concentrations.  in the presence of lethal concentrations that completely inhibited cell growth, the cell sizes were similar to those of cells without intoxication. taking into account the mathematical formula for spherical and cylindrical diameter and surface, respectively, the cells reacted to the presence of organic solvents by decreasing the ratio between surface and volume of the cells and therefore reducing their relative surfaces. as the cell surface and especially the cytoplasmic membrane are the major targets for the toxic effects of membrane-active compounds, this reduction of the relative surface represents an adaptive response to the presence of such compounds.

TI  == microbial decolourisation of pulp and paper mill effluent in presence of nitrogen and phosphorus by activated sludge process.
AB  == the effect of ph, nutrient and aeration was studied on the removal of colour and  reduction of bod, cod and heavy metals with addition of readily available source  of nitrogen and phosphorus in concentration of 1.0 g/l. recalcitrant compound was effectively degraded by active microbial consortia. the isolated bacteria were identified as pseudomonas putida (s1), citrobacter sp. (s4) and enterobacter sp.  (s5). these organisms not only decolourised effluent upto 97% but reduced bod, cod, phenolics and sulfide upto 96.63, 96.80, 96.92 and 96.67% respectively within 24 hrs of aeration and the heavy metals were removed upto 82-99.80%. the tss and tds were sharply reduced due to degradation. the absorption maxima was also decreased to 90%. however, in control without the microbial consortium no noticeable change was produced.

TI  == sensorial and microbial effects of gaseous ozone on fresh scad (trachurus trachurus).
AB  == the bactericidal activity of gaseous ozone was investigated using a commercial ozone generator. five species of fish bacteria, pseudomonas putida, shewanella putrefaciens, brochothrix thermosphacta, enterobacter sp. and lactobacillus plantarum, were inoculated on agar surfaces and exposed to different ozonation times in a gas chamber. results showed ozone in relatively low concentrations (<  0.27 x 10(-3) g l-1) was an effective bactericide of vegetative cells of the five fish bacteria. the age of the cell culture was shown to influence the cell response following exposure. survival rate was not linearly related to ozonation  time, but exhibited biphasic death over an extended period. similar bactericidal  effects were observed on fish skin treated with ozone daily in the laboratory, with decreases of 1.0 log cfu cm-2 for the micro-organisms studied. whole fish treated daily in the laboratory using a commercial ozone generator showed improved scores for sensory analyses compared with the controls. the results were statistically significant. fish treated on board ships were also analysed for microbiological and sensory changes. controls were obtained from a similar vessel without the ozone facility in the hold. similar trends to those recorded in the laboratory for the microbiological and sensory results on ozonated fish were observed.

TI  == variability of peptidoglycan structural parameters in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == muropeptide composition of peptidoglycan from the gram-negative bacteria aeromonas sp., acinetobacter acetoaceticus, agrobacterium tumefaciens, enterobacter cloacae, proteus morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, vibrio parahaemolyticus yersinia enterocolitica and escherichia coli, was analyzed by hplc. in all instances peptidoglycan was built up from the same subunits. a wide disparity in the relative abundance of muropeptides and all structural parameters was observed. the contribution of ld-a2pm-a2pm cross-linked muropeptides was extremely variable; from 1 to 45% of cross-linked muropeptides.  muropeptides with the dipeptides lys-lys or arg-lys, indicative of murein-bound (lipo)proteins, were detected in all instances although abundance was very variable.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
