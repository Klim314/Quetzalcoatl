TI  == peptidoglycan hydrolases as species-specific markers to differentiate lactobacillus helveticus from lactobacillus gallinarum and other closely related  homofermentative lactobacilli.
AB  == we propose a new method that allows accurate discrimination of lactobacillus helveticus from other closely related homofermentative lactobacilli, especially lactobacillus gallinarum. this method is based on the amplification by pcr of two peptidoglycan hydrolytic genes, lhv_0190 and lhv_0191. these genes are ubiquitous and show high homology at the intra-species level. the pcr method gave two specific pcr products, of 542 and 747 bp, for 25 l. helveticus strains coming from various sources. for l. gallinarum, two amplicons were obtained, the specific 542 bp amplicon and another one with a size greater than 1,500 bp. no specific pcr products were obtained for 12 other closely related species of lactobacilli, including the l. acidophilus complex, l. delbrueckii, and l. ultunensis. the developed pcr method provided rapid, precise, and easy identification of l. helveticus. moreover, it enabled differentiation between the two closely phylogenetically related species l. helveticus and l. gallinarum.

TI  == lactobacillus gastricus sp. nov., lactobacillus antri sp. nov., lactobacillus kalixensis sp. nov. and lactobacillus ultunensis sp. nov., isolated from human stomach mucosa.
AB  == in an attempt to study the composition of the lactobacillus flora from mucosa of  human stomach, 16s rrna gene sequences of 129 isolates were analysed. for 15 of these, the results differed significantly from known sequences, and additional tests were performed to determine whether these isolates represented as yet unrecognized species. phenotypic and genetic characteristics revealed that these  isolates represented four novel lactobacillus species. two belong to the lactobacillus reuteri and the other two to the lactobacillus delbrueckii subgroup of lactobacillus. the names lactobacillus gastricus sp. nov., lactobacillus antri sp. nov., lactobacillus kalixensis sp. nov. and lactobacillus ultunensis sp. nov. are proposed, with the respective type strains kx156a7t (=lmg 22113t=dsm 16045t=ccug 48454t), kx146a4t (=lmg 22111t=dsm 16041t=ccug 48456t), kx127a2t (=lmg 22115t=dsm 16043t=ccug 48459t) and kx146c1t (=lmg 22117t=dsm 16047t=ccug 48460t).

TI  == quantitative analysis of diverse lactobacillus species present in advanced dental caries.
AB  == our previous analysis of 65 advanced dental caries lesions by traditional culture techniques indicated that lactobacilli were numerous in the advancing front of the progressive lesion. production of organic acids by lactobacilli is considered to be important in causing decalcification of the dentinal matrix. the present study was undertaken to define more precisely the diversity of lactobacilli found in this environment and to quantify the major species and phylotypes relative to  total load of lactobacilli by real-time pcr. pooled dna was amplified by pcr with lactobacillus genus-specific primers for subsequent cloning, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. based on 16s ribosomal dna sequence comparisons, 18 different phylotypes of lactobacilli were detected, including strong representation of both novel and gastrointestinal phylotypes. specific pcr primers were designed for nine prominent species, including lactobacillus gasseri, l. ultunensis, l. salivarius, l. rhamnosus, l. casei, l. crispatus, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, and l. gallinarum. more than three different species were identified as being present in most of the dentine samples, confirming the widespread distribution and numerical importance of various lactobacillus spp. in carious dentine. quantification by real-time pcr revealed various proportions of  the nine species colonizing carious dentine, with higher mean loads of l. gasseri and l. ultunensis than of the other prevalent species. the findings provide a basis for further characterization of the pathogenicity of lactobacillus spp. in  the context of extension of the carious lesion.
