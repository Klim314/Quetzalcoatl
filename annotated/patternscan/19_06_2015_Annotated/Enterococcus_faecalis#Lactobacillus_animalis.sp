TI  == in vitro assessment of functional properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from faecal microbiota of healthy dogs for potential use as probiotics.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified in the faeces of chinese crested and yorkshire terrier pups and their probiotic features were investigated in vitro. thirty seven isolates were identified as lactobacillus or enterococcus. out of these isolates, 31 were lactic acid bacteria (lab) and belonged to the species lactobacillus reuteri (16/37; 43.3%), lactobacillus animalis (7/37; 18.9%), lactobacillus acidophilus (3/37; 8.1%), lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (2/37; 5.4%), lactobacillus murinus (2/37; 5.4%), and lactobacillus paraplantarum (1/37; 2.7%), while six other lab isolates were enterococcus spp. (6/37; 16.2%).  strains were tested for resistance to gastric acidity (ph 2.5 for 3 h) and bile salts (0.3% ox gall), cell surface hydrophobicity by microbial adhesion to solvents, antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes), production of hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotic susceptibility. thirty four strains were highly resistant to acidic conditions with slight (18 strains) to moderate (16 strains) growth inhibition by bile salts. seven isolates had highly hydrophobic cellular surfaces and 28 strains exhibited strong antagonism against the bacterial pathogens tested, although 8 isolates tested against leptospira interrogans had no effect on pathogen growth. all isolates produced low rates of  hydrogen peroxide. based on these results, two lactobacillus strains showed promising probiotic-related features and merit investigation as probiotics for dogs.

TI  == characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  == the study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (lab) from fermented foods in xi'an, china. lab strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of lactobacillus (n = 73), and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16s rrna gene. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and s. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of lactobacillus. the erm(b) gene was detected from two strains of each of l. fermentum and l. vaginalis, and one strain of each of l. plantarum, l. salivarius, l. acidophilus, l. animalis, and s. thermophilus. the tet genes were  identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. this is the first time, the authors identified tet(s) gene from l. brevis and l. kefiri. the  erm(b) gene from l. fermentum nwl24 and l. salivarius nwl33, and tet(m) gene from l. plantarum nwl22 and l. brevis nwl59 were successfully transferred to enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. it was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in xi'an, china and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.

TI  == biological and genetic classification of canine intestinal lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  == to investigate the distribution of lactic acid bacteria (lab) inhabiting canine intestines, a total of 374 gram-positive lab and bifidobacteria (bf) isolated from large intestinal contents in 36 dogs were classified and identified by phenotypic and genetic analyses. based on cell morphological sizes, these isolates were divided into seven biotypes containing the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, enterococcus, and streptococcus. the lab and bf isolates were classified into 38 chemotypes based on sds-page protein profile analysis of whole cells. furthermore, partial 16s rdna sequencing analysis demonstrated the presence of 24 bacterial species in the 38 chemotypes from 36 dogs. the identified species consisted of ten species belonging to the genus lactobacillus  (78.8%), seven species to the genus bifidobacterium (6.8%), five species to the genus enterococcus (11.6%), one species of streptococcus bovis (2.0%), and one species of pediococcus acidilactici (0.8%). in particular, the most predominant species in canine intestines were l. reuteri, l. animalis, and l. johnsonii and were found in the high frequency of occurrence of 77.8, 80.6, and 86.1%, respectively. besides these, enterococcus faecalis, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, pediococcus acidilactici, and streptococcus bovis were also isolated in the present study. the sequences of the isolates also showed high levels of similarity to those of the reference strains registered previously in the ddbj and the similarity was above 97.2%. their partial 16s rrna genes were registered in the ddbj.

TI  == differential inflammatory mediator response in vitro from murine macrophages to lactobacilli and pathogenic intestinal bacteria.
AB  == chronic active colitis (including inflammatory bowel disease - ibd) is maintained by a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators. certain intestinal bacterial strains  may induce colitis, whereas some strains (e.g. lactobacillus spp.) show a protective effect in colitis owing to their anti-inflammatory activity. in this study, we have examined the production of selected inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ros), nitric oxide (no) and the expression of haeme oxygenase-1 (ho-1) by murine peritoneal macrophages stimulated in vitro by the intestinal bacterial strains, isolated from mice with colitis. lactobacillus strains (lactobacillus reuteri, l. johnsonii, l. animalis/murinus) and two potentially pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis) induced the production of substantial amounts of cytokines with a strain specific profile. despite some interstrain differences, all lactobacilli induced production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (il-10(high), il-6(low), il-12p70(low)). conversely, e. faecalis and e. coli induced the production of proinflammatory cytokines (tnf-alpha, il-12p70), the cytokines essential for chronic ibd. macrophages released comparably substantial amounts of ros in response to all lactobacillus strains tested, while e. coli and e. faecalis ability to induce generation of ros was negligible. in contrast to ros, the production of no/no(2) (-) by macrophages activated with all bacterial strains tested was similar. moreover, for the first time, it has been shown that intestinal bacteria differed in their ability to induce expression of ho-1, a stress-inducible enzyme with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. the beneficial immunoregulatory properties of candidate probiotic bacteria for the treatment of ibd are discussed.

TI  == relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in indigenous and exogenous bacteria.
AB  == aims: to investigate whether there is a relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and enterococci. methods and results: hydrophobicity, cell wall protein profiles and sites of interaction in the gut (by using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled bacteria) were determined for lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, b. animalis and enterococcus faecalis. we also determined the number of immunoglobulin (ig)a+, tumour necrosis factor (tnf)alpha+, interleukin (il)-6+ and il-10+ cells after oral administration of the above bacteria to balb/c mice.  all strains assessed were found to interact with the sites of induction of the immune response in the gut. no correlation with hydrophobicity was observed. when some strains at certain doses were administered to mice, bacterial translocation  to liver was observed. the oral administration of indigenous (104 cells day(-1))  and exogenous (107 cells day(-1)) bifidobacteria and lactobacilli for 5 consecutive days activated the systemic and intestinal mucosal immune response in a strain-specific way, independently whether the strain was indigenous or exogenous in relation to the host. the differences in the immunopotentiating capacity of the various strains might be related to the differences in their cell wall protein profiles. conclusions: indigenous bacteria activated the mucosal immune response at a dose significantly smaller than the one required for probiotic exogenous bacteria. however, probiotic exogenous bacteria can be used at high concentrations in fermented dairy products with a great impact on the immune system, favouring its immunomodulation. significance and impact of the study: the immunomodulation capacity of probiotic bacteria is strain specific and independent of the specificity of the host. the ability of certain strains to down-regulate the production and release of il-6 by il-10 may have potential implications in their use in cases in which cytokine deregulation or excessive production at the mucosal level can be the cause of tissue damage.

TI  == lactobacilli isolated from chicken intestines: potential use as probiotics.
AB  == lactobacillus strains were tested for their in vitro probiotic properties. cell surface hydrophobicity was found to be very high for lactobacillus fermentum subsp. cellobiosus and salmonella gallinarum; high values could indicate a greater ability to adhere to epithelial cells. studies on lactobacillus animalis  indicated relative cell surface hydrophobicities smaller than those of l. fermentum subsp. cellobiosus and l. fermentum. l. animalis and enterococcus faecalis were able to coaggregate with l. fermentum subsp. cellobiosus and l. fermentum, respectively, but not with salmonella gallinarum. after mixed-culture  studies for determining suitable growth behavior, the pair of strains l. animalis plus l. fermentum subsp. cellobiosus was selected for an attempted challenge against salmonella gallinarum. double and triple mixed-culture studies indicated  that selected lactobacillus strains were able to retain their beneficial characteristics in the presence of salmonella gallinarum such as presence of lectins, production of antimicrobial compounds, and ability to grow and compete.  the selected microorganisms can be considered as potential ingredients for a chicken probiotic feed formulation intended to control salmonellosis and also improve poultry sanitation.

TI  == conservation of the major cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == primers designed from consensus regions of the major cold shock gene of different bacterial species were used in pcr amplification of lactic acid bacteria (lab). an appropriately-sized pcr product was obtained from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ll43-1 and mg1363; lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris lc10-1, lc11-1, and  lc12-1; streptococcus thermophilus st1-1; enterococcus faecalis ef1-1; lactobacillus acidophilus la1-1; lactobacillus helveticus lh1-1; pediococcus pentosaceus pp1-1; and bifidobacterium animalis ba1-1. the pcr products were cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequences displayed high sequence similarity with the major cold shock proteins of escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis and the human y-box factor. the amino acid residues of the cold shock domain implicated in nucleic acid binding in several unrelated species were also  highly conserved in the lab strains. it is possible, therefore, that this protein in lab may also act as a transcriptional enhancer to other cold shock genes and/or act as an rna chaperone unwinding tightly folded rna molecules.

TI  == effect of a defined continuous-flow derived bacterial culture and dietary lactose on salmonella typhimurium colonization in broiler chickens.
AB  == a defined bacterial culture protective against salmonella typhimurium cecal colonization in broiler chicks was derived utilizing a continuous-flow (cf) culture apparatus. chicks receiving the cf culture in combination with a diet containing dietary lactose were protected against cecal colonization by s. typhimurium. the culture consisted of a mixture of gram-positive and gram-negative facultative and strictly anaerobic bacteria. the isolates were identified as enterococcus avium, two strains of enterococcus faecalis (designated a and b), lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus animalis, a lactobacillus that could not be identified to species level (designated strain cms), citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, e. fergusonii, bifidobacterium animals, and propionibacterium acidipropionici. results indicated that cf cultures can be  used as a tool to identify bacteria which are antagonistic to s. typhimurium in the chick cecum.
