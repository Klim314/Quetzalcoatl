effect of bovicin hc5 on growth and spore germination of bacillus cereus and bacillus thuringiensis isolated from spoiled mango pulp.
aims: to use bovicin hc5 to inhibit predominant bacteria isolated from spoiled mango pulp. methods and results: bovicin hc5 and nisin were added to brain heart infusion (bhi) medium (40-160 au ml(-1)) or mango pulp (100 au ml(-1)) and the growth of bacillus cereus and bacillus thuringiensis was monitored. cultures treated with bovicin hc5 or nisin showed longer lag phases and grew slower in bhi medium. bovicin hc5 and nisin were bactericidal and showed higher activity in mango pulp at acidic ph values. to determine the effect on spore germination and d values, mango pulp containing bovicin hc5 was inoculated with 10(6) and 10(9) spores per ml(-1), respectively, from each strain tested. bovicin hc5 reduced the outgrowth of spores from b. cereus and b. thuringiensis, but thermal sensitivity was not affected. conclusions: bovicin hc5 was bactericidal against b. cereus and b. thuringiensis isolated from spoiled mango pulp. significance and impact of the study: bacillus cereus and b. thuringiensis had not been previously isolated from spoiled mango pulp and bovicin hc5 has the potential to inhibit such bacteria in fruit pulps.
characterization of a bacteriocin produced by a newly isolated bacillus sp. strain 8 a.
aims: the aim of this research was to investigate the production of bacteriocins  by bacillus spp. isolated from native soils of south of brazil. methods and results: a bacteriocin produced by the bacterium bacillus cereus 8 a was identified. the antimicrobial activity was produced starting at the exponential growth phase, although maximum activity was at stationary growth phase. a crude bacteriocin obtained from culture supernatant fluid was inhibitory to a broad range of indicator strains, including listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, and several species of bacillus. clinically relevant bacteria such as streptococcus bovis and micrococcus luteus were also inhibited. bacteriocin was stable at 80 degrees c, but the activity was lost when the temperature reached 87 degrees c. it was resistant to the proteolytic action of trypsin and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k and pronase e. bacteriocin activity was observed in the ph range of 6.0-9.0. conclusions: a bacteriocin produced by bacillus cereus 8 a was characterized, presenting a broad spectrum of activity and potential for use as biopreservative in food. significance and impact of study: the identification of a bacteriocin with large activity spectrum, including pathogens and spoilage microorganisms, addresses an important aspect of food safety.
