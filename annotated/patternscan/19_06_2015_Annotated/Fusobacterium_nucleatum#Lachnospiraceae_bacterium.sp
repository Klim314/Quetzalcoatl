TI  == bacterial community development in experimental gingivitis.
AB  == current knowledge of the microbial composition of dental plaque in early gingivitis is based largely on microscopy and cultural methods, which do not provide a comprehensive description of oral microbial communities. this study used 454-pyrosequencing of the v1-v3 region of 16s rrna genes (approximately 500  bp), and bacterial culture, to characterize the composition of plaque during the  transition from periodontal health to gingivitis. a total of 20 healthy volunteers abstained from oral hygiene for two weeks, allowing plaque to accumulate and gingivitis to develop. plaque samples were analyzed at baseline, and after one and two weeks. in addition, plaque samples from 20 chronic periodontitis patients were analyzed for cross-sectional comparison to the experimental gingivitis cohort. all of the healthy volunteers developed gingivitis after two weeks. pyrosequencing yielded a final total of 344,267 sequences after filtering, with a mean length of 354 bases, that were clustered into an average of 299 species-level operational taxonomic units (otus) per sample. principal coordinates analysis (pcoa) plots revealed significant shifts in the bacterial community structure of plaque as gingivitis was induced, and community diversity increased significantly after two weeks. changes in the relative abundance of otus during the transition from health to gingivitis were correlated to bleeding on probing (bop) scores and resulted in the identification of new health- and gingivitis-associated taxa. comparison of the healthy volunteers to the periodontitis patients also confirmed the association of a number of putative periodontal pathogens with chronic periodontitis. taxa associated with gingivitis included fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, lachnospiraceae [g-2] sp. hot100, lautropia sp. hota94, and prevotella oulorum, whilst rothia dentocariosa was associated with periodontal health. further study  of these taxa is warranted and may lead to new therapeutic approaches to prevent  periodontal disease.

TI  == comparative microbial analysis of paired amniotic fluid and cord blood from pregnancies complicated by preterm birth and early-onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  == background: 16s rrna-based genomic analyses have revolutionized our understanding of infectious diseases. many cases which were recognized as "idiopathic" are now  known to have an infectious etiology. here, we present a proof-of-concept study to examine the microbial link between intra-amniotic infection (iai) and early-onset neonatal sepsis (eons). results: using culture independent methods, we analyzed paired amniotic fluid (af) and cord blood (cb) samples from 36 singleton pregnancies complicated by preterm birth (ptb), iai, and/or eons. ptb cases were grouped as 1) group 1- neonatal blood culture-positive eons (n=6). 2)  group 2- neonatal blood culture-negative presumed eons with positive iai (n=16).  3) group 3- neonatal blood culture-negative presumed eons with no iai (n=7); 4) group 4- no eons or iai (n=7). in addition, samples from term healthy deliveries  (n=8) served as technical controls. a total of 31 species (15 non-redundant) were identified in af, of which only 1/3 were cultivated. significantly fewer microorganisms were detected in cb, with a total of 18 species (7 non-redundant)  identified, of which only 2 (escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae) were cultivated. of those, bergeyella, fusobacterium nucleatum, and sneathia sanguinegens had not been detected in eons before. the novel species identified in af by pcr include peptoniphilus harei and lachnospiraceae sp. the majority (72%) of cb species were also detected in the matching af, with e. coli and f. nucleatum as the most prevalent. the 16s rrna sequences of paired af and cb were  99.9-100% identical, while no identical sequences were found between different pregnancies. conclusions: previously unrecognized, uncultivated or difficult-to-cultivate species are implicated in eons. microbial species in paired af and cb likely share the same infectious origin. given its prevalence in eons, f. nucleatum should be placed on the same importance scale as e. coli.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacteria in asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to use terminal restriction fragment length  polymorphism analysis and the 16s rrna gene clone library to investigate the diversity of the microbiota associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections and to compare the bacterial community structure in these two clinical conditions. samples were taken from asymptomatic endodontic infections associated with chronic periradicular lesions and from symptomatic infections clinically diagnosed as acute abscesses. 16s rrna genes from dna isolated from clinical samples were used to construct clone libraries or were subjected to terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. sequence analysis of 186 clones revealed 42 taxa; 23 (55%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which seven were unique to endodontic infections. clone sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that the most commonly detected taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum (including terminal restriction fragment types 1 and 2), peptostreptococcus micros/peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone aj062/bs044/fg014, prevotella species, dialister species, mogibacterium species, lachnospiraceae oral clone 55a-34, filifactor alocis, megasphaera sp. oral clone cs025/bs073, and veillonella sp. oral clone bp1-85/veillonella dispar/v. parvula. bacteroides-like sp. oral clone x083/bacteroidales oral clone mce7_20 and dialister sp. oral clone bs016/mce7_134 were detected only in asymptomatic teeth. on the other hand, f. nucleatum terminal restriction fragment type 2, prevotella intermedia, dialister pneumosintes, and some phylotypes were exclusively detected in symptomatic samples. bacterial profiles of symptomatic endodontic infections generated by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis were clearly different from those of asymptomatic infections. overall, the average number of terminal restriction fragments in symptomatic samples was significantly larger than in asymptomatic samples. molecular analysis of the microbiota associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic endodontic infections indicates that the endodontic bacterial diversity is greater than previously described by culture methods and that the structure of the microbiota differ significantly between asymptomatic and symptomatic infections.

TI  == molecular analysis of microbial diversity in advanced caries.
AB  == real-time pcr analysis of the total bacterial load in advanced carious lesions has shown that the total load exceeds the number of cultivable bacteria. this suggests that an unresolved complexity exists in bacteria associated with advanced caries. in this report, the profile of the microflora of carious dentine was explored by using dna extracted from 10 lesions selected on the basis of comparable total microbial load and on the relative abundance of prevotella spp.  using universal primers for the 16s rrna gene, pcr amplicons were cloned, and approximately 100 transformants were processed for each lesion. phylogenetic analysis of 942 edited sequences demonstrated the presence of 75 species or phylotypes in the 10 carious lesions. up to 31 taxa were represented in each sample. a diverse array of lactobacilli were found to comprise 50% of the species, with prevotellae also abundant, comprising 15% of the species. other taxa present in a number of lesions or occurring with high abundance included selenomonas spp., dialister spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium spp., members of the lachnospiraceae family, olsenella spp., bifidobacterium spp., propionibacterium sp., and pseudoramibacter alactolyticus. the mechanisms by which such diverse patterns of bacteria extend carious lesions, including the aspect of infection of the vital dental pulp, remain unclear.
