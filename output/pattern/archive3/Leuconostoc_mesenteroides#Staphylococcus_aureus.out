functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
this paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. the organisms previously identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. fermentum, lb. acidophilus, pediococcus acidilactici, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc dextranicum and saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees c) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). the ph fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with lb. plantarum; 4.37 in l. dextranicum+s. cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. significant differences (p <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among ph and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic a. flavus. the findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.
succession of dominant and antagonistic lactic acid bacteria in fermented cucumber: insights from a pcr-based approach.
the goal of the investigation was to study the succession of major groups of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and their antagonism in salt-fermented cucumber using pcr. in a direct detection method as well as a short enrichment process, pcr enabled detection of leuconostoc and lactobacillus during early hours of fermentation. subsequently, lactobacillus and pediococcus emerged as the dominant genera. nucleic acid sequence of culture-independent clones confirmed the detection of pediococcus as a dominant genera emerging during late stages of fermentation. pcr also revealed time-dependent emergence of mesentericin, pediocin and plantaricin a producers and accounted for the lab succession in the fermenting samples. a total of 328 lab isolates were obtained collectively from 30 cucumber samples, of which pcr could identify an overwhelming 186 lactobacillus isolates followed by 113 pediococcus and 29 leuconostoc isolates, respectively. based on antimicrobial assay against target strain leuconostoc mesenteroides nrrl b640, 28% of the lab were bacteriocin producers, of which pediocin producers were substantial, followed by plantaricin a and mesentericin producers. the bacteriocins elaborated by the isolates were active against a large number of gram-positive target lab strains and pathogenic bacteria including bacillus cereus, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus.
in vitro antimicrobial properties of recombinant asabf, an antimicrobial peptide  isolated from the nematode ascaris suum.
asabf is a csalphabeta-type antimicrobial peptide that contains four intramolecular disulfide bridges (y. kato and s. komatsu, j. biol. chem. 271:30493-30498, 1996). in the present study, a recombinant asabf was produced by using a yeast expression system, and its antimicrobial activity was characterized in detail. the recombinant asabf was active against all gram-positive bacteria tested (7 of 7; minimum bactericidal concentration [mbc], 0.03 to 1 microg/ml) except leuconostoc mesenteroides, some gram-negative bacteria (8 of 14; mbc, >0.5 microg/ml), and some yeasts (3 of 9; mbc >3 microg/ml). slight hemolytic activity (4.2% at 100 microg/ml) against human erythrocytes was observed only under low-ionic-strength conditions. less than 1 min of contact was enough to kill staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538p. the bactericidal activity against s. aureus was inhibited by salts.
microbiology of controlled rotting of egusi (colocynthis citrullus l.) fruits for the harvesting of the seeds.
microorganisms isolated from naturally rotting egusi fruits which are used as a source of dietary seeds, were mainly bacteria: bacillus subtilis, b. licheniformis, b. polymyxa, b. megaterium, b. pumilus, lactobacillus plantarum, la. brevis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, klebsiella aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus, micrococcus and candida spp. the rotting period of egusi fruits could be decreased from 120 to 72 h by using a mixture of b. subtilis and b. licheniformis.
