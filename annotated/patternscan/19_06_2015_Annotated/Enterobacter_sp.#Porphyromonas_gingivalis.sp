TI  == catecholamines and in vitro growth of pathogenic bacteria: enhancement of growth  varies greatly among bacterial species.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of catecholamines on in vitro growth of a range of bacterial species, including anaerobes. bacteria tested included: porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteriodes fragilis, shigella boydii, shigella sonnie, enterobacter sp, and salmonella choleraesuis. the results of the current study indicated that supplementation of bacterial cultures in minimal medium with norepinephrine or epinephrine did not result in increased growth of bacteria. positive controls involving treatment of escherichia coli with catecholamines did result in increased growth of that bacterial species. the results of the present study extend previous observations that showed differential capability of catecholamines to enhance bacterial growth in vitro.
