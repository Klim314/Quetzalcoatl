TI  - Microbial equol production attenuates colonic methanogenesis and sulphidogenesis  in vitro.
AB  - Hydrogen gas produced during colonic fermentation is excreted in breath and flatus, or removed by hydrogen-consuming bacteria such as methanogens and sulphate-reducing bacteria. However, recent research has shown that H2 is also consumed by equol-producing bacteria during the reduction of daidzein into equol. In this study, the interactions between methanogens, sulphate-reducing, and equol-producing bacteria were investigated under in vitro simulated intestinal conditions. In the presence of daidzein, the equol-producing bacterial consortium EPC4 gave rise to equol production in cultures of Methanobrevibacter smithii or Desulfovibrio sp. as well as in faecal samples with methanogenic or sulphate-reducing abilities. Moreover, this supplementation significantly (P<0.001) decreased the methanogenesis and sulphidogenesis. The attenuation did not occur in the absence of a daidzein source. Additionally, there was no influence of soy germ powder, daidzein or equol as such, excluding a possible inhibition by these compounds. Finally, a stronger decrease was observed with increasing amounts of EPC4 and a constant equol production, suggesting that the observed effect was only partly caused by the action of daidzein as a hydrogen sink. These findings are of relevance since abdominal discomfort such as bloating and flatulence, are related to colonic gas production, whereas equol has potential health benefits.
TI  - Isolation and characterisation of an equol-producing mixed microbial culture from a human faecal sample and its activity under gastrointestinal conditions.
AB  - Only about one third of humans possess a microbiota capable of transforming the dietary isoflavone daidzein into equol. Little is known about the dietary and physiological factors determining this ecological feature. In this study, the in vitro metabolism of daidzein by faecal samples from four human individuals was investigated. One culture produced the metabolites dihydrodaidzein and O-desmethylangolensin, another produced dihydrodaidzein and equol. From the latter, a stable and transferable mixed culture transforming daidzein into equol was obtained. Molecular fingerprinting analysis (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) showed the presence of four bacterial species of which only the first three strains could be brought into pure culture. These strains were identified as Lactobacillus mucosae EPI2, Enterococcus faecium EPI1 and Finegoldia magna EPI3, and did not produce equol in pure culture. The fourth species was tentatively identified as Veillonella sp strain EP. It was found that hydrogen gas in particular, but also butyrate and propionate, which are all colonic fermentation products from poorly digestible carbohydrates, stimulated equol production by the mixed culture. However, when fructo-oligosaccharides were added, equol production was inhibited. Furthermore, the equol-producing capacity of the isolated culture was maintained upon its addition to a faecal culture originating from a non-equol-producing individual.
