TI  == conjunctival flora of clinically normal and diseased turtles and tortoises.
AB  == background: in captive breed turtles and tortoises conjunctival disease is common. our aim was to investigate the bacterial and fungal flora present in the  eyes of healthy and pathological chelonians and to compare findings in turtles with those in tortoises. results: samples were taken from the conjunctival sacs of 34, diseased and healthy, chelonians (18 tortoises and 16 turtles) and submitted to bacterial and fungal investigation. all samples showed bacterial growth. thirteen animals (38%), harboured a single bacterial species as sole isolate and twenty-one animals (62%) harboured more than one species. detection of multiple bacterial infection was clearly greater in tortoises compared to turtles. most frequently isolated bacterial species were bacillus spp. (13 isolates), staphylococcus xylosus (10 isolates), sphingomonas paucimobilis (6 isolates), staphylococcus sciuri and aeromonas hydrophila/caviae (each 5 isolates), ochrobactrum anthropi (3 isolates), citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas luteola (each 2 isolates). only one isolate of kocuria varians/rosea, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus auricularis, staphylococcus  haemolyticus, staphylococcus lentus, morganella morganii, pasteurella multocida,  pasteurella pneumotropica/haemolytica, proteus spp., pseudomonas putida, salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and vibrio parahaemolyticus was evidenced. the presence in 8 animals of mycoplasma spp. and  in 1 animal with severe conjunctivitis of chlamydia spp. was detected by pcr. candida spp. was also isolated from two healthy animals. conclusions: a clear predominance of gram positive isolates in tortoises and gram negative isolates in turtles was found. however, we cannot ascribe the observed difference to the diversity of animal species, as other factors, including especially different characteristics of the living environments, may play a role. almost all bacterial species isolated may have clinical significance, mostly as opportunistic pathogens, both for humans and animals. that chelonians are often carrier of bacteria with zoonotic potential is a well-known fact, in particular with regard  to salmonella spp. therefore, it is not surprising the detection of a strain of salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae in the eye of one of the animals tested. worthy of note is the finding of chlamydia spp. in a severe case of conjunctivitis, though we cannot epidemiologically assess a cause-effect relationship between presence of chlamydia and disease.

TI  == freeze-substitution of gram-negative eubacteria: general cell morphology and envelope profiles.
AB  == freeze-substitution was performed on strains of escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, campylobacter fetus, vibrio cholerae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, aeromonas salmonicida, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus pleuropneumoniae, caulobacter crescentus, and leptothrix discophora with a substitution medium composed of 2% osmium tetroxide and 2% uranyl acetate in anhydrous acetone. a thick periplasmic gel ranging from 10.6 to 14.3 nm in width  was displayed in e. coli k-12, k30, and his 1 (a k-12 derivative containing the k30 capsule genes), p. multocida, c. fetus, p. putida, a. salmonicida, h. pleuropneumoniae, and p. mirabilis. the other bacteria possessed translucent periplasms in which a thinner peptidoglycan layer was seen. capsular polysaccharide, evident as electron-dense fibers radiating outward perpendicular  to the cell surface, was observed on e. coli k30 and his 1 and p. mirabilis cells. a more random arrangement of fibers forming a netlike structure was apparent surrounding cells of h. pleuropneumoniae. for the first time a capsule,  distinct from the sheath, was observed on l. discophora. in all instances, capsular polysaccharide was visualized in the absence of stabilizing agents such  as homologous antisera or ruthenium red. other distinct envelope structures were  observed external to the outer membrane including the sheath of l. discophora and the s layers of a. salmonicida a450 and c. crescentus cb15a. we believe that the  freeze-substitution technique presents a more accurate image of the structural organization of these cells and that it has revealed complex ultrastructural relationships between cell envelope constituents previously difficult to visualize by more conventional means of preparation.

TI  == collaborative evaluation of the abbott avantage system for identification of frequently isolated nonfermentative or oxidase-positive gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == the capability of the abbott avantage system to identify 10 species of commonly isolated glucose nonfermentative or oxidase-positive gram-negative bacilli in a 5-h test period was evaluated in a collaborative study. the avantage nonenteric data base uses 20 biochemical test reactions performed in an expanded abbott bacterial identification cartridge plus the results of a manual oxidase test. the species included in the avantage data base are acinetobacter anitratus, acinetobacter iwoffi, aeromonas hydrophila, flavobacterium meningosepticum-iib group, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, pseudomonas fluorescens-putida group, pseudomonas maltophilia, pasteurella multocida, and plesiomonas shigelloides. the collaborative study included the testing of 200 coded challenge strains in all three laboratories and the subsequent testing of an additional group of 100 to 200 clinical isolates recovered independently by each laboratory. reference identifications for all isolates were determined by conventional biochemical test reactions. the overall accuracy of identification of the coded challenge strains for the three laboratories was 97%, whereas 95% of 437 clinical isolates and selected stock cultures of clinical derivation were identified correctly.
