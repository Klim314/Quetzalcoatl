TI  == increase in detectable opportunistic bacteria in the oral cavity of orthodontic patients.
AB  == objectives: this study was performed to detect the opportunistic bacteria and fungi from the oral cavities of orthodontic patients and examine the ability of the organisms to adhere to saliva-coated metallic brackets. methods: opportunistic bacteria and fungi were isolated from 58 patients (orthodontic group: 42; non-orthodontic group: 16) using culture methods and were identified based on their biochemical and enzymatic profiles. seven opportunistic and four streptococcal strains were tested for their ability to adhere to saliva-coated metallic brackets. results: more opportunistic bacteria and fungi were detected in the orthodontic group than in the non-orthodontic group (p < 0.05). opportunistic bacteria adhered to saliva-coated metallic brackets to the same degree as oral streptococci. conclusions: the isolation frequencies of opportunistic bacteria and fungi increase during orthodontic treatment, suggesting the importance of paying special attention to oral hygiene in orthodontic patients to prevent periodontal disease and the aggravation of systemic disease in immunocompromised conditions.

TI  == influence of transient salivary flora on assessment of mutans streptococci level  by the "strip mutans" method.
AB  == the dentocult sm ("strip mutans") method occasionally shows decoloration of broth and of colonies of mutans streptococci on the plastic strip, thereby making interpretation difficult. in an attempt to explain the phenomenon and to investigate the influence of the salivary flora on the "strip mutans" method, a total of 46 subjects were sampled. saliva was analyzed using the "strip mutans" method and conventional plating techniques to identify mutans streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci, enteric bacteria, and yeasts. approximately 85% of the "strip mutans" scores coincided with the conventional msb-plating method. two samples showed decolored mutans streptococci colonies on the "strip mutans" strip. enterococcus spp. were present in the saliva of these test subjects and could grow in the "strip mutans" broth. enterococcus faecalis was able to induce  the same type of decoloration under experimental pure culture conditions. three "strip mutans" samples showed small colonies of mutans streptococci, visible only under magnification (x 10-20). staphylococcus epidermidis was present in these saliva samples and showed heavy growth in the broth. under experimental pure culture conditions s. epidermidis also inhibited the growth of mutans streptococci to some extent.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine in a controlled release delivery system.
AB  == chlorhexidine is widely used as a mouth rinse in the prevention and treatment of  periodontal diseases and dental caries. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine in a controlled release delivery system. the controlled release dispenser comprised a polymeric inner core matrix containing the medicament with an outer vinyl membrane controlling the drug release. the effect on the following bacteria was studied: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mutans, wolinella recta, bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, eikenella corrodens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. chlorhexidine-containing vinyl patches with a diameter of 5.5 mm were placed on blood agar plates containing the various bacteria. the plates were incubated aerobically or anaerobically at 37 degrees c for 24 h or longer, when appropriate, and examined for inhibition of bacterial growth. distinct zones of inhibition were seen surrounding all vinyl patches on all plates with all bacteria. thus, the vinyl dispenser appeared to be an effective vehicle for releasing chlorhexidine to a localized area such as the surface of a tooth, a periodontal pocket, or a root canal.
