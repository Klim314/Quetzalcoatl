selective responses of three ginkgo biloba leaf-derived constituents on human intestinal bacteria.
the selective responses of ginkgo biloba leaf-derived materials against six intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared with that of bilobalide, ginkgolides a and b, kaempferol, and quercetin.
the components of g. biloba leaves were characterized as kaempferol 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside), kaempferol 3-o-(2' '-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside, and quercetin 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) by spectroscopic analysis.
the growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. at 2 mg/disk, kaempferol 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) and quercetin 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) revealed potent inhibition against clostridium perfringens, and kaempferol 3-o-(2' '-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside showed a clear inhibitory effect on escherichia coli. at 0.5 mg/disk, quercetin 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) showed a strong activity against c. perfringens, but weak activity was exhibited by kaempferol 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) against c. perfringens and kaempferol 3-o-(2' '-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside against e. coli.
no inhibition was observed from treatments conducted with bilobalide, ginkgolides a and b, kaempferol, or quercetin.
furthermore, these isolated compounds did not inhibit bifidobacterium bifidum, b. longum, b. adolescentis, or lactobacillus acidophilus.
