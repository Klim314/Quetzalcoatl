TI  == lactobacillus rhamnosus r11 consumed in a food supplement survived human digestive transit without modifying microbiota equilibrium as assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the survival of lactobacillus rhamnosus r11 and lactobacillus acidophilus r52 in the human digestive tract and their effects  on the microbiota homeostasis. we designed an open human trial including 14 healthy volunteers. a 3-week exclusion period of fermented products was followed  by a 12-day consumption period of 4 capsules daily containing 2 x 10(9)l. rhamnosus r11 and 1 x 10(8)l. acidophilus r52, and a 12-day wash-out period. the  2 strains and dominant bacterial groups of the microbiota were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. at the end of the capsule consumption period, high levels of l. rhamnosus r11 were detected in faecal samples from all  volunteers, reaching a mean value of 7.1 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) equivalents/g of stool. l. acidophilus r52 was detected in the stools of only 1 volunteer, reaching a maximum level of 6.1 log(10) cfu equivalents/g of stool. dilution plating enumerations performed in parallel provided less consistent and  generally lower levels. no significant effect of capsule consumption was observed on microbiota homeostasis for the dominant faecal populations. mean values of 8.8, 9.2, 9.9 and 10.6 log(10) cfu equivalents/g of stool were obtained for the clostridium coccoides, bifidobacterium sp., bacteroides sp. and clostridium leptum groups, respectively.

TI  == [influence of selected lactobacillus sp. on clostridium difficile strains with different toxigenicity profile].
AB  == this study was performed for determination of antagonistic activity of lactobacillus spp. (l. plantarum 2017405, l. rhamnosus gg, l. acidophilus dsm 21007 and l. fernmentumn 353) on clostridiunl difficile strains belonging to different toxigenicity profiles. forty strains c. difficile isolated from patients suffering from antibiotic associated diarrhea (aad) were used. among c.  difficile strains 13 produced toxin a and b (a+b+cdt-), 14 produced only toxin b  (ab'cdt), 9 produced toxins a and b and possessing of binary toxin genes (a+b+cdt-) and 4 were non-toxigenic (a-b-cdt-). we did not observe relationship between degree of antagonistic activity lactobacillus spp. and profile of toxigenicity of c. difficile strains.

TI  == antagonistic activity of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria against entero- and uropathogens.
AB  == aim: to develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. methods and results: the antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lactobacillus plantarum 299v and lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium lactis bb12, bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). bacterial  fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. pyelonephritic escherichia coli was highly suppressed by gg and both bifidobacteria strains. lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and me-3 were the most  effective against salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while me-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. the highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for lact. fermentum me-3 (p < 0.05). no efficient antagonist against clostridium difficile was found. the positive correlations between the ph, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics  were assessed. conclusions: developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of lactobacillus and/or bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. significance and impact of the study: screening lactobacillus and bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy  studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.

TI  == the effect of probiotic strains on the microbiota of the simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (shime).
AB  == the aim of the present work was to study five potential probiotic strains (lactobacillus plantarum, two strains of l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. rhamnosus and bifidobacterium sp.) comparatively in the simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (shime) in vitro model, and to evaluate this model as a tool in the screening and selection of probiotic bacteria. the impact of the strains on the composition of microbiota and its metabolic activities (production of lactic acid and short-chain fatty acids) was studied. changes in composition of the microbiota become apparent as a result of probiotic treatment. a marked, but temporary, increase was noted in the number of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria. the profiles of d(-) and l(+) isomers of lactic acid detected in  the shime after addition of probiotic strains corresponded well to those that are produced in pure culture conditions. the numbers of enterobacteriaceae decreased  markedly and those of clostridia detectably during the intervention, while the enterococci tended to increase after the treatment. this pattern was similar in the reactors representing both the small and large intestine in the model. the changes in short-chain fatty acids were small, and no definite trend was observed.
