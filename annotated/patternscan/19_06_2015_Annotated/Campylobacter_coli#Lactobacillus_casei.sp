TI  == cross-contamination in the kitchen: effect of hygiene measures.
AB  == aims: to determine the effect of hygiene measures on cross-contamination of campylobacter jejuni at home and to select a safe tracer organism for c. jejuni.  methods and results: comparative tests were conducted with nonpathogenic escherichia coli and lactobacillus casei and l. casei was chosen as the safe tracer organism. salads containing chicken breast fillet contaminated with a known number of c. jejuni and l. casei were prepared according to different cross-contamination scenarios and contamination levels of salads were determined. cross-contamination could be strongly reduced when cleaning cutting board and cutlery with hot water (68 degrees c), but generally was not prevented using consumer-style cleaning methods for hands and cutting board. conclusions: dish-washing does not sufficiently prevent cross-contamination, thus different cutting boards for raw meat and other ingredients should be used and meat-hand contact should be avoided or hands should be thoroughly cleaned with soap. lactobacillus casei can be used as a safe tracer organism for c. jejuni in consumer observational studies. significance and impact of the study: cross-contamination plays an important role in the transmission of food-borne illness, especially for c. jejuni. this study delivers suitable data to quantitatively assess the risk of campylobacteriosis caused by cross-contamination and it shows the effect of different preventive hygiene measures.

TI  == lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  == samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. yeasts (20.1%), streptococcus spp. (8.7%), staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. the lactobacillus isolates were l. brevis (24.6%) l. fermentum (18.5%) l. casei (16.9%), l. delbrueckii (15.4%), l. plantarum (9.23%), l. acidophilus (7.69%), l. jensenii (4.62%), l. salivarius (1.54%) and l. gasseri (1.54%). the most common species was l. brevis (24.6%). the strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. all the lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella dysenteriae, s. sonnei, klebsiella spp. and campylobacter sp. all the lactobacilli except l. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. the involvement of lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. the ability of lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.
