TI  - Genital carriage of the genus Haemophilus in pregnancy: species distribution and  antibiotic susceptibility.
AB  - Recent reports have hypothesized that colonization of the maternal genital tract  with noncapsulated H. influenzae could result in neonatal invasive disease. In this study, genital carriage of the genus Haemophilus was investigated in 510 pregnant women attending an Italian hospital for routine controls. Overall, vaginal carriage of the genus Haemophilus was 9.0% (46/510). A high colonization rate with H. parainfluenzae (37/510, 7.3%) was found; other species, such as H. pittmaniae (7/510, 1.4%) and H. haemolyticus (2/510, 0.4%), were detected for the first time in the genital flora by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Notably, no H. influenzae was identified in agreement with previous investigations indicating that this species is rarely isolated from the genitourinary tract of pregnant women. No antibiotic resistance was detected in H. pittmaniae and H. haemolyticus, but quite a high degree of ampicillin (10/37, 27%) and ciprofloxacin (3/37, 8.1%) resistance was observed in H. parainfluenzae. Five ampicillin-resistant isolates were beta-lactamase producers whereas 5 isolates exhibited a beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) phenotype. Sequencing of penicillin-binding protein (PBP)3 revealed that the Val511Ala, Asn526Ser, Ala530Ser and Thr574Ala changes were associated with BLNAR phenotypes. Two ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates carried substitutions in both GyrA (Ser84Phe and Asp88Tyr) and ParC (Ser84Tyr and Met198Leu), the other ciprofloxacin-resistant isolate had substitutions in ParC, only (Ser138Thr and Met198Leu). In conclusions, about ten per cent of pregnant women carried a species of Haemophilus in their genital tract. The emergence of non-beta-lactamase-mediated resistance in genital H. parainfluenzae is a matter of concern because of the risk of mother-to-baby transmission.
TI  - Inter-species transfer of the penicillin-binding protein 3-encoding gene ftsI between Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus haemolyticus can confer reduced susceptibility to beta-lactam antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Mutations in ftsI, encoding penicillin-binding protein 3, can cause decreased beta-lactam susceptibility in Haemophilus influenzae. Sequencing of ftsI from clinical strains has indicated inter-species recombination of ftsI between H. influenzae and Haemophilus haemolyticus. This study documents apparently unrestricted homologous recombination of ftsI between H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus in vitro. Transfer of ftsI from resistant isolates conferred similar but not identical increases in MIC of susceptible strains of H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus.
TI  - What the pediatrician should know about non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) live exclusively in the pharynges of humans and are increasingly recognized as pathogens that cause both localized infections of the respiratory tract (middle ear spaces, sinuses, and bronchi) and systemic infections such as bacteraemia and pneumonia. Only one vaccine antigen of NTHi, Protein D, has been extensively studied in humans and its efficacy in preventing NTHi otitis media is modest. Recent genetic analyses reveal that NTHi are closely related to Haemophilus haemolyticus (Hh), previously thought to be a non-pathogenic commensal of the pharynx. This review discusses the differences between the pathogenic potential of encapsulated and non-typeable Hi. In addition, information on the lifestyles and bacterial characteristics of NTHi and Hh as they pertain to their pathogenic capacities and the value of the Haemophilus taxonomy to clinicians are presented. Further, the epidemiology and mechanisms of NTHi antibiotic resistance, which include production of beta-lactamase and alterations of penicillin-binding protein 3, are reviewed, as are the challenges of vaccine antigen discovery in NTHi.
TI  - Comparative Profile of Heme Acquisition Genes in Disease-Causing and Colonizing Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus haemolyticus.
AB  - Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) are Gram-negative bacteria that colonize the human pharynx, and can also cause respiratory tract infections such as acute otitis media (AOM). Since NTHi require iron from its host for aerobic growth, the heme acquisition genes may play a significant role in avoiding host nutritional immunity and determining virulence. Therefore we employed a hybridization-based technique to compare the prevalence of five heme acquisition genes (hxuA, hxuB, hxuC, hemR, and hup) between 514 middle ear strains from children with AOM and 235 throat strains from healthy children. We also investigated their prevalences in 148 Haemophilus haemolyticus strains, a closely-related species that also colonizes the human pharynx and is considered to be non-pathogenic. Four out of five genes (hxuA, hxuB, hxuC, and hemR) were significantly more prevalent in middle ear (96%, 100%, 100%, and 97% respectively) compared to throat strains (80%, 92%, 93%, and 85% respectively) of NTHi, suggesting that strains possessing these genes have a virulence advantage over those lacking them. All five genes were dramatically more prevalent in NTHi strains compared to H. haemolyticus with hxuA 91%/9% (NTHi/H. haemolyticus), hxuB 98%/11%, hxuC 98%/11%, hemR 93%/20%, and hup 97%/34%, further supporting their potential role in virulence and highlighting their possibility to serve as biomarkers to distinguish H. influenzae from H. haemolyticus. In summary, this study demonstrates that heme acquisition genes are more prevalent in disease-causing NTHi strains isolated from the middle ear compared to colonizing NTHi strains and H. haemolyticus isolated from the pharynx.
TI  - Difficult identification of Haemophilus influenzae, a typical cause of upper respiratory tract infections, in the microbiological diagnostic routine.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae is a key pathogen of upper respiratory tract infections. Its reliable discrimination from nonpathogenic Haemophilus spp. is necessary because merely colonizing bacteria are frequent at primarily unsterile sites. Due to close phylogenetic relationship, it is not easy to discriminate H. influenzae from the colonizer Haemophilus haemolyticus. The frequency of H. haemolyticus isolations depends on factors like sampling site, patient condition, and geographic region. Biochemical discrimination has been shown to be nonreliable. Multiplex PCR including marker genes like sodC, fucK, and hpd or sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, the P6 gene, or multilocus-sequence-typing is more promising. For the diagnostic routine, such techniques are too expensive and laborious. If available, matrix-assisted laser-desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry is a routine-compatible option and should be used in the first line. However, the used database should contain well-defined reference spectra, and the spectral difference between H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus is small. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization is an option for less well-equipped laboratories, but the available protocol will not lead to conclusive results in all instances. It can be used as a second line approach. Occasional ambiguous results have to be resolved by alternative molecular methods like 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
TI  - Identifying Haemophilus haemolyticus and Haemophilus influenzae by SYBR Green real-time PCR.
AB  - SYBR Green real time PCR assays for protein D (hpd), fuculose kinase (fucK) and [Cu, Zn]-superoxide dismutase (sodC) were designed for use in an algorithm for the identification of Haemophilus influenzae and H. haemolyticus. When tested on 127 H. influenzae and 60 H. haemolyticus all isolates were identified correctly.
TI  - Relationship between clinical site of isolation and ability to form biofilms in vitro in nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is an opportunistic pathogen associated with a range of infections, including various lower respiratory infections, otitis media, and conjunctivitis. There is some debate as to whether or not NTHi produces biofilms and, if so, whether or not this is relevant to pathogenesis. Although many studies have examined the association between in vitro biofilm formation and isolates from a specific infection type, few have made comparisons from isolates from a broad range of isolates grouped by clinical source. In our study 50 NTHi from different clinical sources, otitis media, conjunctivitis, lower respiratory tract infections in both cystic fibrosis and non-cystic fibrosis patients, and nasopharyngeal carriage, plus 10 nasopharyngeal isolates of the commensal Haemophilus haemolyticus were tested for the ability to form biofilm by using a static microtitre plate crystal violet assay. A high degree of variation in biofilm forming ability was observed across all isolates, with no statistically significant differences observed between the groups, with the exception of the isolates from conjunctivitis. These isolates had uniformly lower biofilm forming ability compared with isolates from the other groups (p < 0.005).
TI  - Molecular tools for differentiation of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae from Haemophilus haemolyticus.
AB  - Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) and Haemophilus haemolyticus are closely related bacteria that reside in the upper respiratory tract. NTHi is associated with respiratory tract infections that frequently result in antibiotic prescription whilst H. haemolyticus is rarely associated with disease. NTHi and H. haemolyticus can be indistinguishable by traditional culture methods and molecular differentiation has proven difficult. This current review chronologically summarizes the molecular approaches that have been developed for differentiation of NTHi from H. haemolyticus, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each target and/or technique. We also provide suggestions for the development of new tools that would be suitable for clinical and research laboratories.
TI  - Haemophilus haemolyticus is infrequently misidentified as Haemophilus influenzae  in diagnostic specimens in Australia.
AB  - The commensal Haemophilus haemolyticus is difficult to differentiate from the respiratory pathogen Haemophilus influenzae using phenotypic tests. In a study that used molecular tests to retrospectively identify 447 phenotypically identified H. influenzae isolates from diagnostic specimens in Australia, only 7 (1.5%) H. haemolyticus were identified.
TI  - Difficulties in species identification within the genus Haemophilus - A pilot study addressing a significant problem for routine diagnostics.
AB  - Diagnostic misidentifications of commensalic Haemophilus haemolyticus as pathogenic Haemophilus influenzae are frequent. This pilot study evaluates whether isolations of H. haemolyticus are frequent enough in Germany to cause a relevant diagnostic problem, considering the fact that even H. influenzae is a mere colonizer in about 30% of isolations. In microbiological laboratories of two hospitals located in Northern and Southern Germany, the distribution of Haemophilus spp. was analyzed during a six-month-period. Site of infection, sex, and age of the patients was taken into consideration. A total of 77 Haemophilus spp. isolates was acquired and discriminated on species level, comprising: 48 H. influenzae, 25 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 H. haemolyticus, and 1 Haemophilus parahaemolyticus. The proportion of H. haemolyticus was calculated to range between 1.2% and 16.2 % within the 95% confidence limits. Commensalic Haemophilus spp. were isolated from oropharynx-associated sites only. H. influenzae, in contrast, was detected in clinically relevant materials like lower respiratory materials and conjunctiva swabs. Altogether, there was a low proportion of clinical H. haemolyticus isolates. Accordingly, the problem of unnecessary antibiotic therapies due to misidentifications of H. haemolyticus as H. influenzae is quantitatively negligible compared with the risk of confusing H. influenzae colonizations with infections.
TI  - Classification, identification, and clinical significance of haemophilus and aggregatibacter species with host specificity for humans.
AB  - The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive update on the current classification and identification of Haemophilus and Aggregatibacter species with exclusive or predominant host specificity for humans. Haemophilus influenzae and some of the other Haemophilus species are commonly encountered in the clinical microbiology laboratory and demonstrate a wide range of pathogenicity, from life-threatening invasive disease to respiratory infections to a nonpathogenic, commensal lifestyle. New species of Haemophilus have been described (Haemophilus pittmaniae and Haemophilus sputorum), and the new genus Aggregatibacter was created to accommodate some former Haemophilus and Actinobacillus species (Aggregatibacter aphrophilus, Aggregatibacter segnis, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). Aggregatibacter species are now a dominant etiology of infective endocarditis caused by fastidious organisms (HACEK endocarditis), and A. aphrophilus has emerged as an important cause of brain abscesses. Correct identification of Haemophilus and Aggregatibacter species based on phenotypic characterization can be challenging. It has become clear that 15 to 20% of presumptive H. influenzae isolates from the respiratory tracts of healthy individuals do not belong to this species but represent nonhemolytic variants of Haemophilus haemolyticus. Due to the limited pathogenicity of H. haemolyticus, the proportion of misidentified strains may be lower in clinical samples, but even among invasive strains, a misidentification rate of 0.5 to 2% can be found. Several methods have been investigated for differentiation of H. influenzae from its less pathogenic relatives, but a simple method for reliable discrimination is not available. With the implementation of identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, the more rarely encountered species of Haemophilus and Aggregatibacter will increasingly be identified in clinical microbiology practice. However, identification of some strains will still be problematic, necessitating DNA sequencing of multiple housekeeping gene fragments or full-length 16S rRNA genes.
TI  - Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of 4-amino-N- (4-aminophenyl)benzamide analogues of quinoline-based SGI-1027 as inhibitors of DNA methylation.
AB  - Quinoline derivative SGI-1027 (N-(4-(2-amino-6-methylpyrimidin-4-ylamino)phenyl)-4-(quinolin-4-ylamino)benzamid e) was first described in 2009 as a potent inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1, 3A and 3B. Based on molecular modeling studies, performed using the crystal structure of Haemophilus haemolyticus cytosine-5 DNA methyltransferase (MHhaI C5 DNMT), which suggested that the quinoline and the aminopyridimine moieties of SGI-1027 are important for interaction with the substrates and protein, we designed and synthesized 25 derivatives. Among them, four compounds-namely the derivatives 12, 16, 31 and 32-exhibited activities comparable to that of the parent compound. Further evaluation revealed that these compounds were more potent against human DNMT3A than against human DNMT1 and induced the re-expression of a reporter gene, controlled by a methylated cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, in leukemia KG-1 cells. These compounds possessed cytotoxicity against leukemia KG-1 cells in the micromolar range, comparable with the cytotoxicity of the reference compound, SGI-1027. Structure-activity relationships were elucidated from the results. First, the presence of a methylene or carbonyl group to conjugate the quinoline moiety decreased the activity. Second, the size and nature of the aromatic or heterocycle subsitutents effects inhibition activity: tricyclic moieties, such as acridine, were found to decrease activity, while bicyclic substituents, such as quinoline, were well tolerated. The best combination was found to be a bicyclic substituent on one side of the compound, and a one-ring moiety on the other side. Finally, the orientation of the central amide bond was found to have little effect on the biological activity. This study provides new insights in to the structure-activity relationships of SGI-1027 and its derivative.
TI  - Role of inter-species recombination of the ftsI gene in the dissemination of altered penicillin-binding-protein-3-mediated resistance in Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus haemolyticus.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To screen the ftsI gene sequences obtained from clinical isolates of  non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) and Haemophilus haemolyticus for the presence of mosaic ftsI gene structures, and to evaluate the role of inter-species recombination of the ftsI gene in the formation and distribution of resistant ftsI genes. METHODS: The ftsI genes of 100 Haemophilus isolates comprising genetically defined beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-susceptible (gBLNAS), beta-lactamase-positive ampicillin-resistant (gBLPAR), beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (gBLNAR) and beta-lactamase-positive amoxicillin/clavulanate-resistant (gBLPACR) isolates of NTHi (n = 50) and H. haemolyticus (n = 50) were analysed in this study. Both the flanking regions and the full-length ftsI gene sequences of all study isolates were screened for mosaic structures using H. influenzae Rd and H. haemolyticus ATCC 33390 as reference parental sequences, and bioinformatics methods were used for recombination analysis using SimPlot. RESULTS: Of the 100 clinical isolates analysed 34% (34/100) harboured mosaic ftsI gene structures containing distinct ftsI gene fragments similar to both reference parental sequences. The inter-species recombination events were exclusively encountered in the ftsI gene of gBLNAR/gBLPACR isolates of both NTHi and H. haemolyticus, and were always associated with the formation of a mosaic fragment at the 3' end of the ftsI gene. There was no evidence supporting horizontal gene transfer (HGT) involving the entire ftsI gene among the clinical isolates in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence for the HGT and inter-species recombination of the ftsI gene among gBLNAR/gBLPACR isolates of NTHi and H. haemolyticus in a clinical setting, highlighting the importance of recombination of the ftsI gene in the emergence of altered penicillin-binding protein 3 and BLNAR-mediated resistance.
TI  - Unidentified intralesional and intracellular coccoid microorganism discovered in  the young man with a diffuse erosive gastroduodenitis and multiple superficial ulcerations.
AB  - A Helicobacter pylori-negative young Japanese man with dyspeptic symptoms suffered from a diffuse erosive gastroduodenitis and multiple superficial ulcerations. Histology and electron microscopic examinations on the biopsy specimens revealed the presence of multiple unidentified intralesional and intracellular coccoid microorganisms in the pathological gastroduodenal mucosa. Microaerophilic and anaerobic Gram-negative coccoid and filamentobacillary bacteria were cultured from the gastric aspirate. The triple therapy containing tetracycline for 14 days followed by 4 months treatment with omeprazole resulted in the resolution of the gastroduodenal pathology. The question, therefore, was raised regarding a possible role for the cultured coccoid bacteria in the pathogenesis. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of the isolated Gram-negative coccoid bacteria revealed a close relationship with Haemophilus haemolyticus. The unidentified coccoid microorganisms and cultured X and V factors independent coccoid bacteria, however, shared similar phenotypic, microbiological and pathological characteristics to the novel Gram-negative Streptococcaceae: Okadaella gastrococcus.
TI  - A PCR-high-resolution melt assay for rapid differentiation of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus haemolyticus.
AB  - We have developed a PCR-high-resolution melt (PCR-HRM) assay to discriminate nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) colonies from Haemophilus haemolyticus. This method is rapid and robust, with 96% sensitivity and 92% specificity compared to the hpd#3 assay. PCR-HRM is ideal for high-throughput screening for NTHi surveillance and clinical trials.
TI  - Comparative genomic analysis reveals distinct genotypic features of the emerging  pathogen Haemophilus influenzae type f.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of invasive disease caused by encapsulated Haemophilus  influenzae type f (Hif) has increased in the post-H. influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine era. We previously annotated the first complete Hif genome from a clinical isolate (KR494) that caused septic shock and necrotizing myositis. Here, the full genome of Hif KR494 was compared to sequenced reference strains Hib 10810, capsule type d (Hid) Rd Kw20, and finally nontypeable H. influenzae 3655. The goal was to identify possible genomic characteristics that may shed light upon the pathogenesis of Hif. RESULTS: The Hif KR494 genome exhibited large regions of synteny with other H. influenzae, but also distinct genome rearrangements. A predicted Hif core genome of 1390 genes was shared with the reference strains, and 6 unique genomic regions comprising half of the 191 unique coding sequences were revealed. The majority of these regions were inserted genetic fragments, most likely derived from the closely-related Haemophilus spp. including H. aegyptius, H. haemolyticus and H. parainfluenzae. Importantly, the KR494 genome possessed several putative virulence genes that were distinct from non-type f strains. These included the sap2 operon, aef3 fimbriae, and genes for kanamycin nucleotidyltranserase, iron-utilization proteins, and putative YadA-like trimeric autotransporters that may increase the bacterial virulence. Furthermore, Hif KR494 lacked a hisABCDEFGH operon for de novo histidine biosynthesis, hmg locus for lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis and biofilm formation, the Haemophilus antibiotic resistance island and a Haemophilus secondary molybdate transport system. We confirmed the histidine auxotrophy and kanamycin resistance in Hif by functional experiments. Moreover, the pattern of unique or missing genes of Hif KR494 was similar in 20 Hif clinical isolates obtained from different years and geographical areas. A cross-species comparison revealed that the Hif genome shared more characteristics with H. aegyptius than Hid and NTHi. CONCLUSIONS: The genomic comparative analyses facilitated identification of genotypic characteristics that may be related to the specific virulence of Hif. In relation to non-type f H. influenzae strains, the Hif genome contains differences in components involved in metabolism and survival that may contribute to its invasiveness.
TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - Identification of Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus haemolyticus by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  - Generally accepted laboratory methods that have been used for decades do not reliably distinguish between H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus isolates. H. haemolyticus strains are often incorrectly identified as nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi). To distinguish H. influenzae from H. haemolyticus we have created a new database on the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) bio-typer 2 and compared the results with routine determination of Haemophilus (growth requirement for X and V factor), and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). In total we have tested 277 isolates, 244 H. influenzae and 33 H. haemolyticus. Using MLST as the gold standard, the agreement of MALDI-TOF MS was 99.6 %. MALDI-TOF MS allows reliable and rapid discrimination between H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus.
TI  - An application of outer membrane protein p6-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay for detection of haemophilus influenzae in middle ear fluids and nasopharyngeal secretions.
AB  - An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific to outer membrane protein P6 (P6-ELISA) was applied for detecting Haemophilus influenzae in middle ear fluids (MEFs) from acute otitis media (AOM) patients and in nasopharyngeal secretions (NPSs) from acute rhinosinusitis patients. P6-ELISA had a sensitivity of 83.3% for MEFs and 71.5% for NPSs and a specificity of 85.6% for MEFs and 92.5% for NPSs, respectively. Real-time PCR exhibited significant differences in the number of ompP1 gene copies among samples determined by P6-ELISA to be positive and negative for H. influenzae. However, because the P6-ELISA test has the reactivity in Haemophilus species include two commensals H. haemolyticus and H. parainfluenzae, it is thus a weak method in order to detect only NTHi correctly. Consequently, diagnosis using the P6-ELISA should be based on an overall evaluation, including the results of other related examinations and clinical symptoms to prevent misleading conclusions in clinical setting.
TI  - Rapid discrimination of Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, and H. haemolyticus by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and two matrix-assisted laser-desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) platforms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to considerable differences in pathogenicity, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and H. haemolyticus have to be reliably discriminated in routine diagnostics. Retrospective analyses suggest frequent misidentifications of commensal H. haemolyticus as H. influenzae. In a multi-center approach, we assessed the suitability of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and matrix-assisted laser-desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass-spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) for the identification of H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and H. haemolyticus to species level. METHODOLOGY: A strain collection of 84 Haemophilus spp. comprising 50 H. influenzae, 25 H. parainfluenzae, 7 H. haemolyticus, and 2 H. parahaemolyticus including 77 clinical isolates was analyzed by FISH with newly designed DNA probes, and two different MALDI-TOF-MS systems (Bruker, Shimadzu) with and without prior formic acid extraction. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Among the 84 Haemophilus strains analyzed, FISH led to 71 correct results (85%), 13 uninterpretable results (15%), and no misidentifications. Shimadzu MALDI-TOF-MS resulted in 59 correct identifications (70%), 19 uninterpretable results (23%), and 6 misidentifications (7%), using colony material applied directly. Bruker MALDI-TOF-MS with prior formic acid extraction led to 74 correct results (88%), 4 uninterpretable results (5%) and 6 misidentifications (7%). The Bruker MALDI-TOF-MS misidentifications could be resolved by the addition of a suitable H. haemolyticus reference spectrum to the system's database. In conclusion, no analyzed diagnostic procedure was free of errors. Diagnostic results have to be interpreted carefully and alternative tests should be applied in case of ambiguous test results on isolates from seriously ill patients.
TI  - PCR screening for the N526K substitution in isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus haemolyticus.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Firstly, to evaluate the current PBP3-S primers of Hasegawa et al. (Microb Drug Resist 2003; 9: 39-46) and develop new primers for the amplification of N526 in isolates of Haemophilus haemolyticus. Secondly, to develop a new PCR assay for the detection (by amplification) of the N526K substitution, encoded by either the AAA or AAG single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position 1576-1578 of the ftsI gene, in isolates of both Haemophilus influenzae and H. haemolyticus. METHODS: A total of 50 H. influenzae and 50 H. haemolyticus isolates, comprising N526 and N526K genotypes, were used to evaluate the performance of SNP-based PCR primers for the detection of the beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin resistance (BLNAR)-defining N526K substitution in H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus, using a real-time PCR platform. RESULTS: The PBP3-S primers of Hasegawa et al. failed to amplify H. haemolyticus isolates, irrespective of their N526/N526K status, owing to an inability of the forward primer to bind the H. haemolyticus ftsI sequence, giving an overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 40% when using all of the isolates. However, the PBP3-N526 and PBP3-N526K PCR primers designed in this study were 100% sensitive and specific, and 84% sensitive and 100% specific, respectively, for the detection of N526K-positive isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Although antibiotic resistance surveillance studies on H. influenzae should include a definitive test for H. influenzae/H. haemolyticus identification, the new primers from this study will not only allow for PCR characterization of both H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus with respect to the N526K BLNAR substitutions, they will also stop incorrect characterization of susceptible H. haemolyticus isolates as low-BLNAR H. influenzae.
TI  - Microbiological diagnosis and antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia and acute COPD exacerbation in daily clinical practice: comparison to current guidelines.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this secondary analysis was to evaluate current microbiological approaches, microbiology, and antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) in clinical practice and to compare them with current international guidelines. METHODS: A total of 362 patients with suspected CAP were enrolled in 14 European centers in a prospective multicenter study. RESULTS: A total of 279 inpatients (CAP, n = 222; AECOPD, n = 57) were evaluated. A total of 83 (37 %) CAP patients and 25 (44 %) AECOPD patients did not undergo any microbiological tests. In patients with CAP/AECOPD, blood culture was performed in 109 (49 %)/16 (28.1 %), urinary antigen tests for Legionella pneumophila in 67 (30 %)/9 (16 %), and sputum investigation in 55 (25 %)/17 (30 %), respectively. The most frequent pathogens in CAP were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, L. pneumophila, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterobacter cloacae; in AECOPD they were Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. All CAP patients (mean = 11.1 days) and 35 (61.4 %) of AECOPD patients (mean = 8.9 days) received antibiotics. CAP patients were given mostly aminopenicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors and AECOPD patients were given mostly cephalosporins. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogens isolated in CAP and AECOPD and the antibiotic therapy used are in good accordance with the guidelines. Blood culture, recommended for all CAP patients, was performed in only 50 % of the cases and antibiotic therapy lasted longer than the suggested 5-7 days. Therefore, international guidelines regarding performance of blood culture and duration of antibiotic therapy should be adopted more often. This duration was independent of the number of isolated pathogens and number of symptoms on admission. Therefore, the question arises as to whether microbiological data are necessary only for patients who are resistant to initial therapy.
TI  - MALDI-TOF MS distinctly differentiates nontypable Haemophilus influenzae from Haemophilus haemolyticus.
AB  - Nontypable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) and Haemophilus haemolyticus exhibit different pathogenicities, but to date, there remains no definitive and reliable strategy for differentiating these strains. In this study, we evaluated matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) as a potential method for differentiating NTHi and H. haemolyticus. The phylogenetic analysis of concatenated 16S rRNA and recombinase A (recA) gene sequences, outer membrane protein P6 gene sequencing and single-gene PCR were used as reference methods. The original reference database (ORD, provided with the Biotyper software) and new reference database (NRD, extended with Chinese strains) were compared for the evaluation of MALDI-TOF MS. Through a search of the ORD, 76.9% of the NTHi (40/52) and none of the H. haemolyticus (0/20) strains were identified at the species level. However, all NTHi and H. haemolyticus strains used for identification were accurately recognized at the species level when searching the NRD. From the dendrogram clustering of the main spectra projections, the Chinese and foreign H. influenzae reference strains were categorized into two distinct groups, and H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus were also separated into two categories. Compared to the existing methods, MALDI-TOF MS has the advantage of integrating high throughput, accuracy and speed. In conclusion, MALDI-TOF MS is an excellent method for differentiating NTHi and H. haemolyticus. This method can be recommended for use in appropriately equipped laboratories.
TI  - Prevalence and mechanisms of beta-lactam resistance in Haemophilus haemolyticus.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the phenotypic and genotypic beta-lactam resistance profiles of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) and the closely phylogenetically related Haemophilus haemolyticus. METHODS: XV-dependent Haemophilus species isolated as normal flora from nasopharyngeal and throat swabs (n = 312) were screened by PCR for markers to determine NTHi and H. haemolyticus identity. All NTHi and H. haemolyticus isolates were subsequently tested for susceptibilities to ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate, and characterized with respect to the presence of blaTEM, blaROB and ftsI gene mutations. RESULTS: Of the 312 isolates, 236 (75%) were identified as NTHi, 61 (20%) as H. haemolyticus and 15 (5%) as equivocal. PCR for resistance genes showed 15.7% (37/236) of NTHi and 13.1% (8/61) of H. haemolyticus isolates were blaTEM positive and none was positive for blaROB. The blaTEM genes of both species were encoded on similar replicons and associated with the same promoter types. Altered penicillin-binding protein 3 due to the N526K substitution accounted for 31% of both NTHi (73/236) and H. haemolyticus (19/61) isolates, respectively. The presence of N526K in both NTHi and H. haemolyticus was associated with slightly raised ampicillin MICs compared with the H. influenzae Rd and H. haemolyticus ATCC 33390 control strains. In addition, some NTHi gBLNAR-associated substitutions were seen in H. haemolyticus with and without N526K, and appear to represent part of the baseline genotype of that species. CONCLUSIONS: The phenotypic and genotypic beta-lactam resistance in NTHi and H. haemolyticus is very similar, such that H. haemolyticus may represent a reservoir for beta-lactam resistance determinants for NTHi.
TI  - Low occurrence of 'non-haemolytic Haemophilus haemolyticus' misidentified as Haemophilus influenzae in cystic fibrosis respiratory specimens, and frequent recurrence of persistent H. influenzae clones despite antimicrobial treatment.
AB  - Non-influenzae commensal Haemophilus species of low pathogenicity may be difficult to discriminate from Haemophilus influenzae. We investigated the level of misidentifications in respiratory specimens from cystic fibrosis patients and evaluated the colonisation dynamics of genuine H. influenzae isolates. One hundred and ninety-two presumptive H. influenzae isolates were re-examined by assessment of marker genes sodC and fucK, and isolates with aberrant genotypes were subjected to multilocus sequence typing. Misidentifications (3%) were mainly caused by failure to identify porphyrin-synthesising strains, and only a single strain (0.5%) could be classified as 'non-haemolytic Haemophilus haemolyticus'. Sequential isolates of confirmed H. influenzae isolates from individual patients were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Despite the routine prescription of antimicrobial therapy, the majority of H. influenzae isolates were identical with at least one of the strains cultured from the two preceding positive samples from the same patient.
TI  - In young children, persistent wheezing is associated with bronchial bacterial infection: a retrospective analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Young children with persistent wheezing pose a diagnostic and therapeutical challenge to the pediatrician.We aimed to evaluate bacterial bronchial infection as a possible reason for non response to conventional asthma therapy, and to identify and characterise the predominant pathogens involved. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed microbiological and cytological findings in a selected population of young wheezers with symptoms unresponsive to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy, who underwent flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Procedural measures were taken to limit contamination risk and quantitative bacterial culture of BAL fluid (significance cut-off >/= 10(4) colony-forming units/ml) was used. Modern microbiological methods were used for detection of a wide panel of pathogens and for characterisation of the bacterial isolates. RESULTS: 33 children aged between 4 and 38 months, without structural anomalies of the conductive airways were evaluated. Significant bacterial BAL cultures were found in 48,5 % of patients. Haemophilus influenzae was isolated in 30,3 %, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 12,1 % and Moraxella catarrhalis in 12,1 %. All H. influenzae isolates were non-encapsulated strains and definitely distinguished from non-haemolytic H. haemolyticus. Respiratory viruses were detected in 21,9 % of cases with mixed bacterial-viral infection in 12,1 %. Cytology revealed a marked neutrophilic inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial infection of the bronchial tree is common in persistent preschool wheezers and provides a possible explanation for non response to ICS therapy. Non-typeable H. influenzae seems to be the predominant pathogen involved, followed by S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis.
TI  - Haemophilus haemolyticus isolates causing clinical disease.
AB  - We report seven cases of Haemophilus haemolyticus invasive disease detected in the United States, which were previously misidentified as nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae. All cases had different symptoms and presentations. Our study suggests that a testing scheme that includes reliable PCR assays and standard microbiological methods should be used in order to improve H. haemolyticus identification.
TI  - Culture and PCR detection of Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus haemolyticus  in Australian Indigenous children with bronchiectasis.
AB  - A PCR for protein D (hpd#3) was used to differentiate nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) from Haemophilus haemolyticus. While 90% of nasopharyngeal specimens and 100% of lower-airway specimens from 84 Indigenous Australian children with bronchiectasis had phenotypic NTHI isolates confirmed as H. influenzae, only 39% of oropharyngeal specimens with phenotypic NTHI had H. influenzae. The nasopharynx is therefore the preferred site for NTHI colonization studies, and NTHI is confirmed as an important lower-airway pathogen.
TI  - Molecular surveillance of true nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae: an evaluation  of PCR screening assays.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Unambiguous identification of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is not possible by conventional microbiology. Molecular characterisation of phenotypically defined NTHi isolates suggests that up to 40% are Haemophilus haemolyticus (Hh); however, the genetic similarity of NTHi and Hh limits the power of simple molecular techniques such as PCR for species discrimination. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we assess the ability of previously published and novel PCR-based assays to identify true NTHi. Sixty phenotypic NTHi isolates, classified by a dual 16S rRNA gene PCR algorithm as NTHi (n = 22), Hh (n = 27) or equivocal (n = 11), were further characterised by sequencing of the 16S rRNA and recA genes then interrogated by PCR-based assays targeting the omp P2, omp P6, lgtC, hpd, 16S rRNA, fucK and iga genes. The sequencing data and PCR results were used to define NTHi for this study. Two hpd real time PCR assays (hpd#1 and hpd#3) and the conventional iga PCR assay were equally efficient at differentiating study-defined NTHi from Hh, each with a receiver operator characteristic curve area of 0.90 [0.83; 0.98]. The hpd#1 and hpd#3 assays were completely specific against a panel of common respiratory bacteria, unlike the iga PCR, and the hpd#3 assay was able to detect below 10 copies per reaction. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data suggest an evolutionary continuum between NTHi and Hh and therefore no single gene target could completely differentiate NTHi from Hh. The hpd#3 real time PCR assay proved to be the superior method for discrimination of NTHi from closely related Haemophilus species with the added potential for quantification of H. influenzae directly from specimens. We suggest the hpd#3 assay would be suitable for routine NTHi surveillance and to assess the impact of antibiotics and vaccines, on H. influenzae carriage rates, carriage density, and disease.
TI  - An invasive Haemophilus haemolyticus isolate.
AB  
TI  - Evaluation of new biomarker genes for differentiating Haemophilus influenzae from Haemophilus haemolyticus.
AB  - PCR detecting the protein D (hpd) and fuculose kinase (fucK) genes showed high sensitivity and specificity for identifying Haemophilus influenzae and differentiating it from H. haemolyticus. Phylogenetic analysis using the 16S rRNA gene demonstrated two distinct groups for H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus.
TI  - Genome sequences for five strains of the emerging pathogen Haemophilus haemolyticus.
AB  - We report the first whole-genome sequences for five strains, two carried and three pathogenic, of the emerging pathogen Haemophilus haemolyticus. Preliminary analyses indicate that these genome sequences encode markers that distinguish H. haemolyticus from its closest Haemophilus relatives and provide clues to the identity of its virulence factors.
TI  - Identification of unknown ocular pathogens in clinically suspected eye infections using ribosomal RNA gene sequence analysis.
AB  - DNA sequence-based identification of pathogens from ocular samples of patients with clinically suspected eye infections was accomplished using 16S and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) ribosomal RNA gene sequence analysis. PCR was positive for 24 of 99 samples tested. Both culture and 16S rDNA sequence analysis identified Pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococci and Enterobacteriaceae. Isolates misidentified as Burkholderia cepacia by biochemical tests were identified as Ralstonia mannitolilytica by 16S rDNA sequence analysis. Sequence analysis identified the following microorganisms from 19 culture-negative samples: Haemophilus influenzae, Sphingomonas sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Morganella morganii, Mycobacterium sp., Chryseobacterium sp., Pseudomonas saccharophila (Xanthomonas) and the fungus, Phaeoacremonium inflatipes.
TI  - Haemophilus Species
AB  - The genus Haemophilus includes a number of species that cause a wide variety of infections but share a common morphology and a requirement for blood-derived factors during growth that has given the genus its name. Haemophilus influenzae, the major pathogen, can be separated into encapsulated or typable strains, of which there are seven types (a through f including e') based on the antigenic structure of the capsular polysaccharide, and unencapsulated or nontypable strains. Type b H influenzae is by far the most virulent organism in this group, commonly causing bloodstream invasion and meningitis in children younger than 2 years. Nontypable strains are frequent causes of respiratory tract disease in infants, children, and adults. Other Haemophilus species cause disease less frequently. Haemophilus parainfluenzae sometimes causes pneumonia or bacterial endocarditis. Haemophilus ducreyi causes chancroid. Haemophilus aphrophilus is a member of the normal flora of the mouth and occasionally causes bacterial endocarditis. Haemophilus aegyptius, which causes conjunctivitis and Brazilian purpuric fever, and Haemophilus haemolyticus used to be separated on the basis of their ability to agglutinate or lyse red blood cells, but both are now included among the nontypable H influenzae strains.
TI  - Prevalence of genetic differences in phosphorylcholine expression between nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus haemolyticus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although non-typeable (NT) Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus haemolyticus are closely related human commensals, H. haemolyticus is non-pathogenic while NT H. influenzae is an important cause of respiratory tract infections. Phase-variable phosphorylcholine (ChoP) modification of lipooligosaccharide (LOS) is a NT H. influenzae virulence factor that, paradoxically, may also promote complement activation by binding C-reactive protein (CRP). CRP is known to bind more to ChoP positioned distally than proximally in LOS, and the position of ChoP within LOS is dictated by specific licD alleles (designated here as licDI, licDIII, and licDIV) that are present in a lic1 locus. The lic1 locus contains the licA-licD genes, and ChoP-host interactions may also be influenced by a second lic1 locus that allows for dual ChoP substitutions in the same strain, or by the number of licA gene tetranucleotide repeats (5'-CAAT-3') that reflect phase-variation mutation rates. RESULTS: Using dot-blot hybridization, 92% of 88 NT H. influenzae and 42.6% of 109 H. haemolyticus strains possessed a lic1 locus. Eight percent of NT H. influenzae and none of the H. haemolyticus strains possessed dual copies of lic1. The licDIII and licDIV gene alleles were distributed similarly (18-22%) among the NT H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus strains while licDI alleles were present in 45.5% of NT H. influenzae but in less than 1% of H. haemolyticus strains (P < .0001). NT H. influenzae had an average of 26.8 tetranucleotide repeats in licA compared to 14.8 repeats in H. haemolyticus (P < .05). In addition, NT H. influenzae strains that possessed a licDIII allele had increased numbers of repeats compared to NT H. influenzae with other licD alleles (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that genetic similarities and differences of ChoP expression exist between NT H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus and strengthen the hypothesis that, at the population level, these differences may, in part, provide an advantage in the virulence of NT H. influenzae.
TI  - Neonatal community-acquired pneumonia: pathogens and treatment.
AB  - AIM: To analyse the bacterial pathogens and drug sensitivities for neonatal community-acquired pneumonia. METHODS: Seven hundred sixty sputum samples from newborns with community-acquired pneumonia were cultured to determine microbial organisms present and their drug sensitivities. RESULTS: Of the 760 specimens, 425 grew pathogens for a 55.9% positive rate. Among the 425 positive cultures, 278 grew gram-negative organisms (65.4%), 142 grew gram-positive organisms (33.3%), while 5 grew fungus (1.3%). The most common gram-negative organisms were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae, while the most common gram-positive organisms were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. To the gram-negative organisms, the most sensitive drugs were meropenem, imipenem and amikacin, while to the gram-positive ones were vancomycin, teicoplanin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. CONCLUSIONS: The most common causative bacteria were gram-negative organisms, which were highly sensitive to Meropenem, Imipenem and Amikacin, yet often treatable with more focused antibiotic coverage, which depended on the bacterium identified.
TI  - Haemophilus influenzae outer membrane protein P6 molecular characterization may not differentiate all strains of H. Influenzae from H. haemolyticus.
AB  - Distinguishing nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus haemolyticus isolates by outer membrane protein (OMP) P6 gene sequencing is complicated by sequence variants in isolates. Further testing using RapID NH and multilocus sequence analysis may not help identify some isolates. Translated OMP P6 gene sequences are not conserved among all isolates presumed to be H. influenzae.
TI  - Nasopharyngeal carriage of Haemophilus haemolyticus in otitis-prone and healthy children.
AB  - Haemophilus haemolyticus is often incorrectly categorized as nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) upon culture. PCR analyses of 266 NTHI-like nasopharyngeal isolates from children with and without recurrent acute otitis media (rAOM) revealed that 11.7% were H. haemolyticus and 9.4% gave equivocal results. Children with rAOM were more likely to carry H. haemolyticus.
TI  - Prevalence of Haemophilus influenzae type b genetic islands among clinical and commensal H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus isolates.
AB  - Five genetic islands (HiGI) found in Haemophilus influenzae type b strain Eagan were used as hybridization probes on type b, Haemophilus haemolyticus, and nontypeable H. influenzae (NTHi) isolates. HiGI2 and HiGI7 were significantly more prevalent in NTHi isolates from children with otitis media than in those from the throats of healthy children.
TI  - Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus haemolyticus in tonsillar cultures of adults with acute pharyngotonsillitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical implication of Haemophilus haemolyticus, one of the closest relative of Haemophilus influenzae, on acute pharyngotonsillitis. METHODS: We applied polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and IgA protease gene (iga) to distinguish H. haemolyticus and H. influenzae. RESULTS: Among the 199 Haemophilus spp. isolated from 214 patients with acute pharyngotonsillitis, 52 (24.3%) H. influenzae strains and 23 (10.7%) H. haemolyticus strains were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for 16S rDNA and IgA protease gene (iga). All H. haemolyticus strains showed hemolysis on horse blood agar and there were no other Haemophilus spp., nonhemolytic H. haemolyticus and H. influenzae variant strains that had absent iga gene. H. hemolyticus showed close genetic relationship with H. influenzae evaluated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The cases of acute pharyngotonsillitis showing WBC=7000/mm(3) or CRP=8 mg/dl were frequently found among cases with H. influenzae rather than cases with H. haemolyticus. CONCLUSION: H. haemolyticus is a pharyngeal commensal that is isolated frequently from adults with acute pharyngotonsillitis.
TI  - Antimicrobial characterisation of CEM-101 activity against respiratory tract pathogens, including multidrug-resistant pneumococcal serogroup 19A isolates.
AB  - CEM-101 is a novel fluorinated macrolide-ketolide with potent activity against bacterial pathogens that are susceptible or resistant to other macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS(B))-ketolide agents. CEM-101 is being developed for oral and parenteral use in moderate to moderately severe community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. The objective of this study was to assess the activity of CEM-101 and comparators against contemporary respiratory tract infection (RTI) isolates. A worldwide sample of organisms was used, including Streptococcus pneumoniae [n=168; 59.3% erythromycin-resistant and 18 multidrug-resistant (MDR) serogroup 19A strains], Moraxella catarrhalis (n=21; 11 beta-lactamase positive), Haemophilus influenzae (n=100; 48 beta-lactamase positive), Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Haemophilus haemolyticus (n=12), and Legionella pneumophila (n=30). Testing and interpretation were performed using reference Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute methods. CEM-101 was very potent against S. pneumoniae [minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms (MIC90)=0.25 mg/L; highest MIC at 0.5 mg/L] and was 2- and > or =32-fold more active than telithromycin and clindamycin, respectively. CEM-101 also demonstrated potent activity against S. pneumoniae MDR-19A strains (MIC90=0.5 mg/L). CEM-101 was the most potent antimicrobial agent tested against L. pneumophila, with all MIC values at < or = 0.015 mg/L (telithromycin MIC90=0.03 mg/L). CEM-101 was as potent as azithromycin against Haemophilus spp. RTI pathogens (MIC90=2 mg/L), with no variations for beta-lactamase production. CEM-101 MIC values against M. catarrhalis were all at < or =0.5mg/L. Interestingly, CEM-101 potency was ca. 6 log(2) dilutions greater than telithromycin MIC results among 44 beta-haemolytic streptococci having telithromycin MICs > or = 2 mg/L. CEM-101 exhibited the greatest potency and widest spectrum of activity against RTI pathogens among the tested MLS(B)-ketolide agents (azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, telithromycin, clindamycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin) and was comparable overall with levofloxacin.
TI  - Prevalence of the sodC gene in nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus haemolyticus by microarray-based hybridization.
AB  - The sodC gene has been reported to be a useful marker for differentiating nontypeable (NT) Haemophilus influenzae from Haemophilus haemolyticus in respiratory-tract samples, but discrepancies exist as to the prevalence of sodC in NT H. influenzae. Therefore, we used a microarray-based, "library-on-a-slide" method to differentiate the species and found that 21 of 169 (12.4%) NT H. influenzae strains and all 110 (100%) H. haemolyticus strains possessed the sodC gene. Multilocus sequence analysis confirmed that the 21 NT H. influenzae strains were H. influenzae and not H. haemolyticus. An inactive sodC gene has been reported in encapsulated H. influenzae strains belonging to phylogenetic division II. Capsule-specific Southern hybridization and PCR and a lack of copper/zinc-cofactored superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) expression indicated that 6 of the 21 sodC-containing NT H. influenzae strains in our study were likely capsule-deficient mutants belonging to phylogenetic division II. DNA sequence comparisons of the 21 H. influenzae sodC genes with sodC from H. haemolyticus or encapsulated H. influenzae demonstrated that the sodC genes of the six H. influenzae capsule-deficient mutants were, on average, 99% identical to sodC from encapsulated H. influenzae but only 85% identical to sodC from H. haemolyticus. The sodC genes from 2/15 NT H. influenzae strains were similarly more closely related to sodC from encapsulated strains, while sodC genes from 13 NT H. influenzae strains were almost 95% identical to sodC genes from H. haemolyticus, suggesting the possibility of interspecies recombination in these strains. In summary, this study demonstrates that sodC is not completely absent (9.2%) in true NT H. influenzae strains.
TI  - Detection of cryptic genospecies misidentified as Haemophilus influenzae in routine clinical samples by assessment of marker genes fucK, hap, and sodC.
AB  - Clinical isolates of Haemophilus influenzae were assessed for the presence of fucK, hap, and sodC by hybridization with gene-specific probes, and isolates diverging from the expected H. influenzae genotype were characterized by phenotype and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Two of 480 isolates were finally classified as variant strains ("nonhemolytic Haemophilus haemolyticus").
TI  - Delineation of the species Haemophilus influenzae by phenotype, multilocus sequence phylogeny, and detection of marker genes.
AB  - To obtain more information on the much-debated definition of prokaryotic species, we investigated the borders of Haemophilus influenzae by comparative analysis of H. influenzae reference strains with closely related bacteria including strains assigned to Haemophilus haemolyticus, cryptic genospecies biotype IV, and the never formally validated species "Haemophilus intermedius". Multilocus sequence phylogeny based on six housekeeping genes separated a cluster encompassing the type and the reference strains of H. influenzae from 31 more distantly related strains. Comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequences supported this delineation but was obscured by a conspicuously high number of polymorphic sites in many of the strains that did not belong to the core group of H. influenzae strains. The division was corroborated by the differential presence of genes encoding H. influenzae adhesion and penetration protein, fuculokinase, and Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase, whereas immunoglobulin A1 protease activity or the presence of the iga gene was of limited discriminatory value. The existence of porphyrin-synthesizing strains ("H. intermedius") closely related to H. influenzae was confirmed. Several chromosomally encoded hemin biosynthesis genes were identified, and sequence analysis showed these genes to represent an ancestral genotype rather than recent transfers from, e.g., Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Strains previously assigned to H. haemolyticus formed several separate lineages within a distinct but deeply branching cluster, intermingled with strains of "H. intermedius" and cryptic genospecies biotype IV. Although H. influenzae is phenotypically more homogenous than some other Haemophilus species, the genetic diversity and multicluster structure of strains traditionally associated with H. influenzae make it difficult to define the natural borders of that species.
TI  - Comparison of laboratory-based and phylogenetic methods to distinguish between Haemophilus influenzae and H. haemolyticus.
AB  - New methods to distinguish between nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae and nonhemolytic H. haemolyticus were compared. The results of iga variable region hybridization to dotblots and library-on-a-slide microarrays were more similar to a "gold standard" multigenephylogenetic tree than iga-conserved region hybridization or P6 7F3 epitope immunoblots.
TI  - Relationships of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae strains to hemolytic and nonhemolytic Haemophilus haemolyticus strains.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae is both a human respiratory pathogen and pharyngeal commensal, while H. haemolyticus, the closest phylogenetic relative of H. influenzae, is arguably a strict pharyngeal commensal. A hemolytic phenotype has historically differentiated H. haemolyticus from H. influenzae, but the recent recognition of significant nonhemolytic H. haemolyticus colonization has decreased this trait's resolvability. Given this and the potential of recombination between the species, we examined the distribution of microbiologic and molecular traits between collections of H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus strains separated within a dendrogram obtained by multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA). All strains hybridizing with a probe to iga, a gene encoding an immunoglobulin A protease of H. influenzae, clustered apart from strains that did not hybridize with the probe. Other traits also segregated significantly along this division, suggesting a separation of the species. Of note, the LOS genes licA, lic2A, and lgtC of H. influenzae were approximately 2, 6, and 54 times, respectively, more prevalent in H. influenzae than in H. haemolyticus. In contrast to species separation, interspecies recombination was evidenced by the inability of single gene sequences to phylogenetically separate the species and by the "fuzzy" distribution of some species-specific traits across the species dividing line. Together, these data support the historically accurate and pragmatic division of these species while recognizing their potential for recombination. Future comparative genomic studies identifying common and distinctive genes could be useful in evaluating their role in the commensal or virulent growth, respectively, of H. influenzae.
TI  - Bacterial colonization in suspected sexually abused children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous studies concluded that symptomatic prepubertal children with  Gardnerella vaginalis infection should be investigated for child sexual abuse. Gardnerella vaginalis is only one out of a group of organism that cause bacterial vaginosis. The aim of the study was to report the frequency of bacterial colonization as well as sexually transmitted diseases and to correlate these data with patient characteristics. METHODS: Data were collected from 1996 to 2006. Medical records of 180 girls, median age at first sexual abuse 7.44 years (range 1-16, SD 3.937), have been evaluated retrospectively. SPSS software 12.0 has been used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Only 18.3% of patients complained of vaginal discharge or pruritus. Sexually transmitted diseases were documented: Gonorrhoea 1 (1.8%, 56 tested), Chlamydia trachomatis 1 (1.6%, 62 tested), Syphilis 0 (0%, 5 tested), Trichomonas vaginalis 1 (0.7%, 136 tested) and HIV 0 (0%, 27 tested). Bacterial colonization were documented (121 tested): Gardnerella vaginalis 29 (24%), Enterobacteriaceae 50 (41.3%), Haemophilus influenzae 11 (9.1%), Streptococcus a haemolyticus 35 (28.9%), Streptococcus Group B 8 (6.6%), Staphylococcus Koag neg. 37 (30.6%), Staphylococcus aureus 10 (8.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 4 (4.1%), Bacteroides 19 (15.7%), Prevotella 24 (19.8%), Klebsiella 4 (3.3%), Corynebacteria 20 (16.5%) and Ureaplasma 9 (7.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Sexually transmitted diseases are infrequent in children suspected for child sexual abuse. Bacterial colonization is common, however, not correlated with clinical symptoms (except for Bacteroides) and hymenal/vaginal injuries.
TI  - Pharyngeal colonization dynamics of Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus haemolyticus in healthy adult carriers.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae is an important cause of respiratory infections, including acute otitis media, sinusitis, and chronic bronchitis, which are preceded by asymptomatic H. influenzae colonization of the human pharynx. The aim of this study was to describe the dynamics of pharyngeal colonization by H. influenzae and an intimately related species, Haemophilus haemolyticus, in healthy adults. Throat specimens from four healthy adult carriers were screened for Haemophilus species; 860 isolates were identified as H. influenzae or H. haemolyticus based on the porphyrin test and on dependence on hemin and NAD for growth. Based on tests for hemolysis, for the presence of the 7F3 epitope of the P6 protein, and for the presence of iga in 412 of the isolates, 346 (84%) were H. influenzae, 47 (11%) were H. haemolyticus, 18 (4%) were nonhemolytic H. haemolyticus, and 1 was a variant strain. Carriers A and B were predominantly colonized with nontypeable H. influenzae, carrier C predominantly with b(-) H. influenzae mutants, and carrier D with H. haemolyticus. A total of 358 H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus isolates were genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) following SmaI or EagI digestion of their DNA, and the carriers displayed the following: carrier A had 11 unique PFGE genotypes, carrier B had 15, carrier C had 7, and carrier D had 10. Thus, adult H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus carriers are colonized with multiple unique genotypes, the colonizing strains exhibit genetic diversity, and we observed day-to-day and week-to-week variability of the genotypes. These results appear to reflect both evolutionary processes that occur among H. influenzae isolates during asymptomatic pharyngeal carriage and sample-to-sample collection bias from a large, variable population of colonizing bacteria.
TI  - Airway bacterial concentrations and exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  - RATIONALE: Increased bacterial concentration (load) in the lower airways and new  bacterial strain acquisition have been posited as mechanisms for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. Bacterial concentrations are higher during exacerbation than during stable disease; however, these studies are cross sectional and devoid of strain typing. OBJECTIVES: To determine if the increased bacterial concentrations function as a separate mechanism for exacerbation induction independent of new strain acquisition. METHODS: In a prospective, longitudinal cohort of patients with COPD, the relationship between exacerbation occurrence, sputum bacterial concentrations, and new strain acquisition was examined. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical information, quantitative sputum cultures, and molecular typing of potential bacterial pathogen isolates. Over 81 months, 104 subjects completed 3,009 clinic visits, 560 (19.6%) during exacerbations and 2,449 (80.4%) during stable disease. Among preexisting strains, sputum concentrations of Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus haemolyticus were not different in exacerbation versus stable disease. Moraxella catarrhalis (stable, 10(8.38 +/- 0.13) [mean +/- SEM] vs. exacerbation, 10(7.78 +/- 0.26); p = 0.02) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (stable, 10(8.42 +/- 0.21) vs. exacerbation, 10(7.76 +/- 0.52); p = 0.07) concentrations were lower during exacerbations compared with stable periods. Concentrations of new strains of H. influenzae (stable, 10(7.28 +/- 0.15) vs. exacerbation, 10(7.76 +/- 0.17); p = 0.04) and M. catarrhalis (stable, 10(7.85 +/- 0.15) vs. exacerbation, 10(8.37 +/- 0.14); p = 0.02), were increased during exacerbations; however, the differences were small. CONCLUSIONS: Change in bacterial load is unlikely to be an important mechanism for exacerbations. Better understanding of the host-pathogen interaction, rather than enumerating bacteria in respiratory samples, is required to provide new insights into bacterial infection in COPD.
TI  - Horizontal gene transfer of ftsI, encoding penicillin-binding protein 3, in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Horizontal gene transfer has been identified in only a small number of genes in Haemophilus influenzae, an organism which is naturally competent for transformation. This report provides evidence for the genetic transfer of the ftsI gene, which encodes penicillin-binding protein 3, in H. influenzae. Mosaic structures of the ftsI gene were found in several clinical isolates of H. influenzae. To identify the origin of the mosaic sequence, complete sequences of the corresponding gene from seven type strains of Haemophilus species were determined. Comparison of these sequences with mosaic regions identified a homologous recombination of the ftsI gene between H. influenzae and Haemophilus haemolyticus. Subsequently, ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae strains harboring identical ftsI sequences were genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Divergent PFGE patterns among beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) strains from different hospitals indicated the potential for the genetic transfer of the mutated ftsI gene between these isolates. Moreover, transfer of the ftsI gene from BLNAR strains to beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin-susceptible (BLNAS) H. influenzae strains was evaluated in vitro. Coincubation of a BLNAS strain (a rifampin-resistant mutant of strain Rd) and BLNAR strains resulted in the emergence of rifampin- and cefdinir-resistant clones at frequencies of 5.1 x 10(-7) to 1.5 x 10(-6). Characterization of these doubly resistant mutants by DNA sequencing of the ftsI gene, susceptibility testing, and genotyping by PFGE revealed that the ftsI genes of BLNAR strains had transferred to BLNAS strains during coincubation. In conclusion, horizontal transfer of the ftsI gene in H. influenzae can occur in an intraspecies and an interspecies manner.
TI  - Haemophilus haemolyticus: a human respiratory tract commensal to be distinguished from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Haemophilus influenzae is a common pathogen in adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In a prospective study, selected isolates of apparent H. influenzae had an altered phenotype. We tested the hypothesis that these variant strains were genetically different from typical H. influenzae. METHODS: A prospective study of adults with COPD was conducted. Strains of apparent H. influenzae obtained from a range of clinical sources were evaluated by ribosomal DNA sequence analysis, multilocus sequence analysis, DNA-DNA hybridization, and sequencing of the conserved P6 gene. RESULTS: Variant strains were determined to be Haemophilus haemolyticus by means of 4 independent methods. Analysis of 490 apparent H. influenzae strains, identified by standard methods, revealed that 39.5% of sputum isolates and 27.3% of nasopharyngeal isolates were H. haemolyticus. Isolates obtained from normally sterile sites were all H. influenzae. In a prospective study, acquisitions of new strains of H. haemolyticus were not associated with exacerbations of COPD, whereas 45% of acquisitions of new strains of H. influenzae were associated with exacerbations. CONCLUSIONS: Standard methods do not reliably distinguish H. haemolyticus from H. influenzae. H. haemolyticus is a respiratory tract commensal. The recognition that some strains of apparent H. influenzae are H. haemolyticus substantially strengthens the association of true H. influenzae with clinical infection.
TI  - Presence of copper- and zinc-containing superoxide dismutase in commensal Haemophilus haemolyticus isolates can be used as a marker to discriminate them from nontypeable H. influenzae isolates.
AB  - Respiratory isolates of Haemophilus haemolyticus are regularly misclassified as nontypeable (NT) Haemophilus influenzae due to an aberrant hemolytic reaction on blood agar, with implications for treatment. The presence of sodC or its cognate protein, copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, can distinguish respiratory isolates of H. haemolyticus from NT H. influenzae with 100% accuracy.
TI  - PD-140248 (Parke-Davis & Co).
AB  - PD-140248 is an isomerase inhibitor and topoisomerase II inhibitor under development by Parke-Davis and Co as a potential treatment for bacterial infection. Although no details of active development have been published in the scientific literature since 1996, in September 1999, the company confirmed that PD-140248 is still in active development [338530]. The compound is one of two new pyrrolidinyl naphthyridines (the other compound being PD-131628) with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, including activity against quinolone-resistant bacteria. PD-140248 demonstrates strong in vitro activity, particularly against Gram-positive bacteria, such as quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (S aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S epidermidis), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (S haemolyticus), methicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant S aureus, Streptococcus species, Streptococcus pneumoniae (S pneumoniae) and Enterococcus faecalis (E faecalis). An MIC90 value of 0.015 microg/ml was obtained against Haemophilus influenzae (H influenzae) and Moraxella catarrhalis [160129]. The (3R,1S) enantiomer, PD-140248, demonstrated a 1- to 10-fold enhanced activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms in vitro and in vivo compared to its stereoisomers, and has thus been targeted for further preclinical studies [133377].
TI  - The binding of MBL to common bacteria in infectious diseases of children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To purify Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) from human serum and detect its  binding ability to several kinds of bacteria common in infectious diseases of children. METHODS: MBL was purified from human serum by affinity chromatography on mannan-Sepharose 4B column. Its binding ability to eight species, 97 strains of bacteria was detected by enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). RESULTS: MBL has different binding ability to bacteria and shows strong binding ability to Klebsiella ornithinolytica and Escherichia coli, but shows relatively lower binding ability to Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterobacter cloacae and Staphylococcus epidermidis. To different isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus, MBL shows quite different binding ability. CONCLUSIONS: MBL has different binding ability to different bacteria, and has relatively stronger binding ability to Gram-negative bacteria. Its binding ability to different isolates of certain kinds of bacteria is quite different.
TI  - Structural basis of ICF-causing mutations in the methyltransferase domain of DNMT3B.
AB  - Mutations in the gene encoding for a de novo methyltransferase, DNMT3B, lead to an autosomal recessive Immunodeficiency, Centromeric instability and Facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome. To analyse the protein structure and consequences of ICF-causing mutations, we modelled the structure of the DNMT3B methyltransferase domain based on Haemophilus haemolyticus protein in complex with the cofactor AdoMet and the target DNA sequence. The structural model has a two-subdomain fold where the DNA-binding region is situated between the subdomains on a surface cleft having positive electrostatic potential. The smaller subdomains of the methyltransferases differ in length and sequences and therefore only the target recognition domain loop was modelled to show the location of an ICF-causing mutation. Based on the model, the DNMT3B recognizes the GC sequence and flips the cytosine from the double-stranded DNA to the catalytic pocket. The amino acids in the cofactor and target cytosine binding sites and also the electrostatic properties of the binding pockets are conserved. In addition, a registry of all known ICF-causing mutations, DNMT3Bbase, was constructed. The structural principles of the pathogenic mutations based on the modelled structure and the analysis of chi angle rotation changes of mutated side chains are discussed.
TI  - Sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  - AIMS: To test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin B was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees C with five inocula of 14 bacteria. Two yeasts (Candida spp) and one Aspergillus were also tested. Contaminated media were then inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a Bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. Changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened daily by visual inspection. The sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. RESULTS: Organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria irrespective of the starting inoculums: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Haemophilus influenzae. For micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal only (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida kruzei, Aspergillus fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. Mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (SD 13.8, range 2-52). In cases of detection by the blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.
TI  - Zebularine: a novel DNA methylation inhibitor that forms a covalent complex with  DNA methyltransferases.
AB  - Mechanism-based inhibitors of enzymes, which mimic reactive intermediates in the  reaction pathway, have been deployed extensively in the analysis of metabolic pathways and as candidate drugs. The inhibition of cytosine-[C5]-specific DNA methyltransferases (C5 MTases) by oligodeoxynucleotides containing 5-azadeoxycytidine (AzadC) and 5-fluorodeoxycytidine (FdC) provides a well-documented example of mechanism-based inhibition of enzymes central to nucleic acid metabolism. Here, we describe the interaction between the C5 MTase from Haemophilus haemolyticus (M.HhaI) and an oligodeoxynucleotide duplex containing 2-H pyrimidinone, an analogue often referred to as zebularine and known to give rise to high-affinity complexes with MTases. X-ray crystallography has demonstrated the formation of a covalent bond between M.HhaI and the 2-H pyrimidinone-containing oligodeoxynucleotide. This observation enables a comparison between the mechanisms of action of 2-H pyrimidinone with other mechanism-based inhibitors such as FdC. This novel complex provides a molecular explanation for the mechanism of action of the anti-cancer drug zebularine.
TI  - Phylogeny of the genus Haemophilus as determined by comparison of partial infB sequences.
AB  - A 453 bp fragment of infB, the gene encoding translation initiation factor 2, was sequenced and compared from 66 clinical isolates and type strains of Haemophilus species and related bacteria. Analysis of the partial infB sequences obtained suggested that the human isolates dependent on X and V factor, H. influenzae, H. haemolyticus, H. aegyptius and some cryptic genospecies of H. influenzae, were closely related to each other. H. parainfluenzae constituted a heterogeneous group within the boundaries of the genus, whereas H. aphrophilus/paraphrophilus and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were only remotely related to the type species of the genus Haemophilus H. parahaemolyticus and H. paraphrohaemolyticus took up an intermediary position and may not belong in the genus Haemophilus sensu stricto. Ambiguous results were obtained with seven isolates tentatively identified as H. segnis, which fell into two discrete clusters. The delineation of 'Haemophilus sensu stricto' as suggested by infB analysis supports previous results obtained by DNA hybridization, in contrast to the delineation inferred from 16S rRNA sequence comparison.
TI  - In vitro activities of RWJ-54428 (MC-02,479) against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - RWJ-54428 (MC-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. In a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), RWJ-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an MIC at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (MIC(90)) of 2 microg/ml. For coagulase-negative staphylococci, RWJ-54428 was 32 times more active than imipenem, with an MIC(90) of 2 microg/ml. RWJ-54428 was active against S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (RWJ-54428 MIC range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). RWJ-54428 was eight times more potent than methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MIC(90), 0.5 microg/ml). For ampicillin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), RWJ-54428 had an MIC(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. RWJ-54428 was also active against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. The potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; RWJ-54428 MICs ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. RWJ-54428 was more active than penicillin G and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). RWJ-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). This survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to RWJ-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.
TI  - Cerebrospinal meningitis with the presence of Acinetobacter spp.
AB  - The study was conducted on 16 strains of Acinetobacter sp. which were isolated from cerebrospinal fluid. The diagnostic material was analysed with the use of automatic BacT/Alert system (Organon Teknika). The analysis was performed in the Department of Microbiology, Medical University in Bydgoszcz. API 20NE system (bioMerieux) enabled the identification of 14 strains (87.5%) as A. baumannii, 1 strain as A. haemolyticus and 1 strain as A. lwoffii. The micro-organisms were isolated from patients whose age ranged between 4 and 66 years. These patients were treated in the departments of Neurosurgery (75.0%), Neurology (18.8%) and Intensive Therapy (6.2%). The infection of cerebrospinal fluid was caused by injury and subsequent exposure to the bacteria present in external environment. Antibiotic-sensitivity of these micro-organisms was evaluated with the help of disc-diffusion method, observing standardisation conditions outlined by NCCLS. All the strains proved sensitive to carbapenems, 15 strains were sensitive to netilmicin, 7 strains--to tobramycin and 7 strains--to amikacin. All the strains displayed multiple resistance. The only exception was A. haemolyticus. The use of two-discs allowed for the detection of ESBLs in 7 A. baumannii strains. Positive results were most frequently obtained after the combination of sublactam and aztreonam. Due to microscopic resemblance between Acinetobacter spp., and bacteria of Neisseria, Moraxella and Haemophilus genus, microbiological diagnostics should not be restricted to microscopic assessment of cerebrospinal fluid and quick serological tests evaluating the antigens of the most frequent aetiological factors. Considering multiple resistance of Acinetobacter spp. to antibiotics, the treatment should be based on sensitivity tests and the ability of a given antibiotic to penetrate into cerebrospinal fluid. In our opinion, both reasonable antibiotic policy as well as observing the principles of hygiene and monitoring infections play equally important roles in the prevention of infections with Acinetobacter spp. Such combined measures may help to prevent the spreading of multiple resistant strains in hospital environment.
TI  - An investigation into the influences of species and biotype on the type of IgA1 protease produced by isolates of Haemophilus.
AB  - A total of 59 isolates of different Haemophilus spp., mostly from clinical specimens, was characterised, biotyped and examined for production of type 1 or type 2 IgA1 protease. IgA1 protease activity was not found in any isolate of a species with no or low virulence for man including H. parainfluenzae, H. haemolyticus, H. aphrophilus, H. paraphrophilus, H. segnis, H. paraphrohaemolyticus and H. haemoglobinophilus. IgA1 protease was produced by all isolates of H. influenzae and H. aegyptius and by some isolates of H. parahaemolyticus. The type of IgA1 protease appeared to be independent of the biotype of the isolate in H. influenzae. For the first time some isolates of H. aegyptius were found that produced type 2 IgA1 protease. IgA1 protease production in H. parahaemolyticus may be associated with the virulence of the isolate.
TI  - Functional roles of the conserved aromatic amino acid residues at position 108 (motif IV) and position 196 (motif VIII) in base flipping and catalysis by the N6-adenine DNA methyltransferase from Thermus aquaticus.
AB  - The DNA methyltransferase (Mtase) from Thermus aquaticus (M.TaqI) catalyzes the transfer of the activated methyl group of S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the N6 position of adenine within the double-stranded DNA sequence 5'-TCGA-3'. To achieve catalysis M.TaqI flips the target adenine out of the DNA helix. On the basis of the three-dimensional structure of M.TaqI in complex with the cofactor and its structural homology to the C5-cytosine DNA Mtase from Haemophilus haemolyticus, Tyr 108 and Phe 196 were suggested to interact with the extrahelical adenine. The functional roles of these two aromatic amino acid residues in M.TaqI were investigated by mutational analysis. The obtained mutant Mtases were analyzed in an improved kinetic assay, and their ability to flip the target base was studied in a fluorescence-based assay using a duplex oligodeoxynucleotide containing the fluorescent base analogue 2-aminopurine at the target position. While the mutant Mtases containing the aromatic amino acid Trp at position 108 or 196 (Y108W and F196W) showed almost wild-type catalytic activity, the mutant Mtases with the nonaromatic amino acid Ala (Y108A and F196A) had a strongly reduced catalytic constant. Y108A was still able to flip the target base, whereas F196A was strongly impaired in base flipping. These results indicate that Phe 196 is important for stabilizing the extrahelical target adenine and suggest that Tyr 108 is involved in placing the extrahelical target base in an optimal position for methyl group transfer. Since both aromatic amino acids belong to the conserved motifs IV and XIII found in N6-adenine and N4-cytosine DNA Mtases as well as in N6-adenine RNA Mtases, a similar function of aromatic amino acid residues within these motifs is expected for the different Mtases.
TI  - Development of a Haemophilus two-dimensional protein database.
AB  - Members of the Haemophilus genus are responsible for various human infections including respiratory infections and meningitis. The complete nucleotide sequence of the Rd strain of Haemophilus influenzae has been reported and represents a valuable resource to investigate gene expression within this bacterial group. We described previously the application of two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE) to characterise the proteins of Haemophilus influenzae (Cash et al., Electrophoresis 1995, 16, 135-148). We have extended these data with comparative studies of the proteins from other members of the Haemophilus genus (specifically H. parainfluenzae, H. haemolyticus and H. parahaemolyticus) to identify homologous proteins and, by extension, the genes encoding them, among these bacteria. The proteins extracted from each of these bacterial isolates were compared by coelectrophoresis to the 2-D protein profile of the reference nontypable strain of H. influenzae (HI-64443) used as the basis for the 2-D protein database. A composite reference 2-D protein profile of HI-64443 was derived from three independent analyses of the soluble bacterial proteins. Between 21% and 37% of the HI-64443 proteins from the reference 2-D protein profile comigrated with proteins in the other isolates from the Haemophilus genus. This compared with 62% and 64% comigration when HI-64443 was compared with the Eagan and Rd strains of H. influenzae, respectively. The 2-D protein profile of the Rd strain of H. influenzae was compared to that of HI-64443 by coelectrophoresis; 64% of the proteins detected for the Rd strain comigrated with proteins found for HI-64443 when analysed in parallel. The capacity of 2-D PAGE to investigate global interactions of gene expression was applied to the analysis of superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression in H. influenzae strain Eagan. A "knock-out" mutant in the sodA gene which encodes [Mn]-SOD was characterised with respect to protein synthesis compared to the parental isolate. From these analyses, the primary product of sodA was provisionally identified as a protein with a molecular mass of 25500 Da and an estimated pI of 6.55. Quantitative changes in the expression of two other proteins in the SOD mutant were detected by comparison with the parental isolate. These data are discussed in relation to the development of a 2-D protein database for H. influenzae and related bacteria to investigate genome homologies and gene expression.
TI  - Neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Airway colonization with Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) and Gram-positive cocci (GPC) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. Whether GNB are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI) and/or to the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is unknown. METHODS: We prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. Data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. The severity of BPD was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with GPC (Staphylococus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). Superimposed on 36% of these infants was GNB airway colonization with Klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), Enterobacter cloacae (25%), Escherichia coli (25%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), Serratia marcescen (10%), Acinetobacter baumannii and Haemophilus influenzae (5%). Comparison between 174 GPC- and 86 GNB-colonized infants showed that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. Fifteen percent of GNB-colonized infants developed BSI caused by GNB and 14% developed BSI caused by GPC. No significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and BSI was noted. GNB infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with GPC. GNB colonization was a predictor of severe BPD after controlling for ventilation. Ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of GNB-colonized and 33% of noncolonized infants and was not a predictor of BPD severity. CONCLUSION: GNB airway colonization creates a moderate risk for BSI. Antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate GNB. GNB airway colonization is associated with severe BPD, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate GNB from the airways should be undertaken.
TI  - Genetic identification of cryptic genospecies of Haemophilus causing urogenital and neonatal infections by PCR using specific primers targeting genes coding for 16S rRNA.
AB  - Previous genetic analysis of Haemophilus influenzae strains isolated from genital and neonatal infections identified a group of biotype IV that constitutes a cryptic genospecies only distantly related to H. influenzae and H. Haemolyticus. Small-subunit rRNA genes of two representative strains of this genital Haemophilus genospecies (strains 16N and 2406) were sequenced. The analysis indicated that these strains form a monophyletic unit with H. haemolyticus and H. influenzae biogroups Influenzae and Aegyptius and are more closely related to H. haemolyticus than to H. influenzae biogroups Influenzae and Aegyptius. 16S rRNA gene sequences were used to formulate primers for PCR-based identification of cryptic genital Haemophilus organisms. A 242-bp fragment was amplified from strains belonging to the genital Haemophilus genospecies but not from strains of 12 other Haemophilus species, including strains of H. influenzae biotype IV sensu stricto.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. Rationale for clinical use.
AB  - Most Gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500; Synercid). Minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (MIC90) were < or = 1 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Listeria monocytogenes. Importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of S. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin G)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. Enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant Enterococcus faecium. E. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. Among the Gram-negative respiratory pathogens Moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and Haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. are resistant. The drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus. Synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant E. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus with the combination of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus infection in rabbits, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. The drug is rapidly bactericidal against Gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the MIC, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of CS-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of CS-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone drug, was tested against 761 clinical isolates. CS-940 activity against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae was most similar to that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, with a large range of MICs inhibiting 90% of isolates tested (MIC90S) of 0.015 to 16 micrograms/ml (median MIC90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). CS-940 had greater activity than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin when they were tested against Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90S, 0.03 micrograms/ml) and Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia (MIC90S, 2 micrograms/ml). CS-940 demonstrated a high degree of potency against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria spp. (MIC90S, < or = 0.06 micrograms/ml). CS-940 was two- to eightfold more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. CS-940 was also very active against Streptococcus spp. and enterococci, for which MIC90S were < or = 2 micrograms/ml; for Enterococcus faecium, however, the MIC90 was 4 micrograms/ml. CS-940 was generally less active than a comparison investigational fluoroquinolone, clinafloxacin. This compound appears promising by in vitro test analysis and warrants further in vivo trials.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activities of the penem WY-49605 (SUN5555) against recent clinical isolates from five U.S. medical centers.
AB  - The in vitro activity of WY-49605 (SUN5555) (WY) was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid against 2,958 consecutive clinical isolates from five medical centers and 402 respiratory pathogens from 18 other facilities. Most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by WY (MIC at which 50% of the isolates are inhibited [MIC50], < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml). MIC90s of > or = 8.0 micrograms/ml were observed for Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia spp., and Proteus mirabilis. WY was the most active drug against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.12 microgram/ml) and other coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC90, 4.0 micrograms/ml). The four drugs were not active against nonenteric gram-negative bacilli, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. At 2.0 micrograms/ml, WY inhibited 82% of Enterococcus faecalis strains and was equal to or superior to the other drugs against streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of WY-49605 compared with those of six other oral agents and selection of disk content for disk diffusion susceptibility testing.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of an oral penem, WY-49605, was compared with those of six other oral antimicrobial agents against 598 bacterial isolates representing 51 different species. WY-49605 exhibited good activity against most gram-positive bacteria and members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. It had little activity against nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli, Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., enterococci, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Its activity was unaffected by the beta-lactamases of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococci. Disk diffusion susceptibility tests were performed with 5-, 10-, 15-, and 30-micrograms WY-49605 disks. The 5-micrograms disk is recommended, with tentative breakpoints of > or = 16 mm for susceptibility (MIC, < or = 2.0 microgram/ml) and < or = 12 mm for resistance (MIC, > or = 8.0 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Binding of human hemoglobin by Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Binding of biotinylated human hemoglobin to Haemophilus influenzae was detected when organisms were grown in heme-deplete, but not heme-replete, conditions. Hemoglobin binding was completely inhibited by a 100-fold excess of unlabelled human hemoglobin or human hemoglobin complexed with human haptoglobin. Binding was only partially inhibited by rat hemoglobin, bovine hemoglobin, human globin, and bovine globin, and not at all by heme, human serum albumin, bovine serum albumin, human transferrin, or myoglobin. Hemoglobin binding was saturable at 16-20 ng of hemoglobin per 10(9) cfu. Binding of human hemoglobin was detected in serotypes a-f and serologically non-typable strains of H. influenzae, as well as Haemophilus haemolyticus but not Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Haemophilus parahaemolyticus, or Escherichia coli.
TI  - Genetic characterization of a cryptic genospecies of Haemophilus causing urogenital and neonatal infections.
AB  - In recent years, reports originating from several areas of the world have identified biotype IV strains of Haemophilus influenzae as a cause of serious urogenital, neonatal, and mother-infant infections. Preliminary analysis of a sample of biotype IV isolates found evidence for a cryptic genospecies of Haemophilus (R. Quentin, A. Goudeau, R. J. Wallace, Jr., A. L. Smith, R. K. Selander, and J. M. Musser. J. Gen. Microbiol. 136:1203-1209, 1990). Eighteen biotype IV strains assigned to the cryptic genospecies were further characterized by their rDNA restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns and genomic DNA-DNA hybridization. Isolates of the cryptic genospecies have distinctive rDNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms that differ from those of Haemophilus haemolyticus and H. influenzae. Genomic hybridization studies show that these organisms are allied with H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus and suggest a distant trifurcation of H. influenzae, H. haemolyticus, and the cryptic genospecies.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of CP-99,219, a novel azabicyclo-naphthyridone.
AB  - CP-99,219 is a trifluoronaphthyridone with significant antibacterial activity that includes the family Enterobacteriaceae (MICs for 90% of the strains tested [MIC90s], < or = 0.015 to 0.5 micrograms/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and gonococci (MICs, < or = 0.015 micrograms/ml). Legionella spp. were also CP-99,219 susceptible, with MICs of 0.008 to 0.12 micrograms/ml. CP-99,219 demonstrated activity greater than that of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, or enoxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 1 microgram/ml), Xanthomonas maltophilia (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 1 microgram/ml), and pneumococci (MIC90, 0.12 micrograms/ml). Numerous ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates were susceptible to CP-99,219, a new compound showing potential value for further in vivo trials.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, a dual-action antibacterial agent, against bacterial isolates from cancer patients compared with those of other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 23-9424 against bacterial isolates from patients with cancer was compared with those of fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone, and ceftazidime. Ro 23-9424 inhibited the majority of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and all Aeromonas isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. It was also active against Acinetobacter spp. and Haemophilus influenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. The MIC for 90% of isolates (MIC90) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 16.0 micrograms/ml. All group A and B streptococci were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml, and 90% of group G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 1.0 micrograms/ml. All methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 60% of methicillin-resistant strains were susceptible to 2.0 micrograms of Ro 23-9424 per ml, whereas the MIC90 for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus hominis isolates was 4.0 micrograms/ml. Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Enterococcus spp. were less susceptible; MIC90s for them were 16.0 and 32.0 micrograms/ml. Ro 23-9424 has a broad antibacterial spectrum and potential utility for therapy of infections in cancer patients.
TI  - Copper-zinc superoxide dismutase in Haemophilus species.
AB  - Copper-zinc superoxide dismutases ([Cu,Zn]-SODs) are ubiquitous in eukaryotes but have rarely been found in prokaryotes. A gene for [Cu,Zn]-SOD (sodC) has recently been cloned from Haemophilus influenzae type b and H. parainfluenzae, so other Haemophilus and related species were screened for the presence of [Cu,Zn]-SODs by visualization of bands of SOD activity in non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels and by gene probing. Strains of H. aphrophilus, H. paraphrophilus, H. haemolyticus, H. paraphrohaemolyticus, some non-typable H. influenzae, H. haemoglobinophilus (canis) and H. parasuis were all found to have [Cu,Zn]-SOD activity (inhibited by 2 mM-cyanide) in polyacrylamide gels. In a Southern blot analysis, DNA from H. aphrophilus, H. paraphrophilus, H. haemolyticus and [Cu,Zn]-SOD-containing non-typable H. influenzae--but not the other species--hybridized to a 360 nucleotide DNA probe containing the 5'-part of sodC cloned from H. influenzae type b. Bacterial [Cu,Zn]-SODs are more prevalent than has previously been recognized.
TI  - Phylogeny of 54 representative strains of species in the family Pasteurellaceae as determined by comparison of 16S rRNA sequences.
AB  - Virtually complete 16S rRNA sequences were determined for 54 representative strains of species in the family Pasteurellaceae. Of these strains, 15 were Pasteurella, 16 were Actinobacillus, and 23 were Haemophilus. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on sequence similarity, using the Neighbor-Joining method. Fifty-three of the strains fell within four large clusters. The first cluster included the type strains of Haemophilus influenzae, H. aegyptius, H. aphrophilus, H. haemolyticus, H. paraphrophilus, H. segnis, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. This cluster also contained A. actinomycetemcomitans FDC Y4, ATCC 29522, ATCC 29523, and ATCC 29524 and H. aphrophilus NCTC 7901. The second cluster included the type strains of A. seminis and Pasteurella aerogenes and H. somnus OVCG 43826. The third cluster was composed of the type strains of Pasteurella multocida, P. anatis, P. avium, P. canis, P. dagmatis, P. gallinarum, P. langaa, P. stomatis, P. volantium, H. haemoglobinophilus, H. parasuis, H. paracuniculus, H. paragallinarum, and A. capsulatus. This cluster also contained Pasteurella species A CCUG 18782, Pasteurella species B CCUG 19974, Haemophilus taxon C CAPM 5111, H. parasuis type 5 Nagasaki, P. volantium (H. parainfluenzae) NCTC 4101, and P. trehalosi NCTC 10624. The fourth cluster included the type strains of Actinobacillus lignieresii, A. equuli, A. pleuropneumoniae, A. suis, A. ureae, H. parahaemolyticus, H. parainfluenzae, H. paraphrohaemolyticus, H. ducreyi, and P. haemolytica. This cluster also contained Actinobacillus species strain CCUG 19799 (Bisgaard taxon 11), A. suis ATCC 15557, H. ducreyi ATCC 27722 and HD 35000, Haemophilus minor group strain 202, and H. parainfluenzae ATCC 29242. The type strain of P. pneumotropica branched alone to form a fifth group. The branching of the Pasteurellaceae family tree was quite complex. The four major clusters contained multiple subclusters. The clusters contained both rapidly and slowly evolving strains (indicated by differing numbers of base changes incorporated into the 16S rRNA sequence relative to outgroup organisms). While the results presented a clear picture of the phylogenetic relationships, the complexity of the branching will make division of the family into genera a difficult and somewhat subjective task. We do not suggest any taxonomic changes at this time.
TI  - On the relationship between theoretical presumptions asbestos genotoxicity and the practical monitoring of exposed workers.
AB  - From the genotoxic viewpoint, there exists a sufficient evidence for asbestos carcinogenicity to human population and animals. Asbestos is a solid cancer promoter (cocarcinogen) of non-mutagenic character having epigenetic effects (15, 16). No data have been published on its mutagenic activity in "in vivo" conditions in man. The only results are those of our pilot study carried out in the period of 1981-1983, which cast doubts on the official view of non-mutagenic character of asbestos--at least under occupational conditions of its processing (34, 36, 37). The study presented here represents ten years' efforts made in the biological (cytogenetic) monitoring of persons occupationally exposed to asbestos in a factory for its processing (occupational risk). Simultaneously, a preliminary answer is given to the question whether the Osinek factory (situated in a housing area) is or is not dangerous for inhabitants of the town of Kostelec nad Orlici, namely for their genetic apparatus (environmental risk). Using the method of chromosome aberrations analysis in peripheral blood lymphocytes, a total of 431 subjects (245 males and 186 females) were examined in the period of 1981 to 1988. Of these, 111 persons were from control workplaces (from Osinek or--starting from 1984--from other plants in Kostelec nad Orlici; in addition to that 14 pensioners without any occupational exposure were examined). The average age of workers exposed to asbestos risk was 42.7 years, in the controls it was 43.9 years, in pensioners exposed to asbestos earlier 63.5 years and in those never exposed to asbestos 66.5 years. The average number of years spent at Osinek factory amounted to 21.5 years. About one third of employees were found to suffer from allergies (first of all those of air passages) and one sixth from chronic ailments of the upper air passages (Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus were diagnosed most frequently). A third part of workers from high-risk workshops are smokers, only a fourth of the controls. About 40% of workers regularly consume alcoholic drinks. The average morbidity rate at Osinek in 1981 to 1988 was 6.3% (in workers as high as 9%), which is about 2% higher as compared with mean values obtained in the district of Rychnov nad Kneznou and East-Bohemian region. Within the nine-year period (1981-1989), 21 occupational diseases were diagnosed, while in the previous 24 years there were 24 cases of an occupational disease. Earlier they were mainly asbestoses (87%), in the last period mainly cancer diseases coinciding with asbestosis (81%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Clinical results of a multicenter study with sulbactam/ampicillin for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory and urinary tract infections.
AB  - A total of 124 patients with lower respiratory tract (44) or urinary tract infections (80) were enrolled in an open, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sulbactam/ampicillin, administered at the dosage of 3 g/die by intramuscular route. Pretreatment pathogens from patients with lower respiratory tract infections included: Streptococcus alpha-haemolyticus in 8 cases, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus in 2 cases, Staphylococcus albus in 7 cases, Haemophilus influenzae in 7 cases, Staphylococcus aureus in 6 cases, Klebsiella oxytoca in 5 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 cases, Escherichia coli in 2 cases; in one subject (2.75%), no microorganisms were isolated. In vitro, 36 isolates (84%) were sensitive to SA and 7 (16%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, all the causative pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated. In patients with urinary tract infections, pretreatment pathogens were: E. coli in 40 cases, S. albus in 16 cases, Proteus mirabilis in 8 cases, Enterobacter agglomerans in 6 cases, Proteus vulgaris in 3 cases, Streptococcus faecalis in 3 cases, Streptococcus liquefaciens in 2 cases, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 cases. In vitro, 64 isolates (80%) were sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin and 16 (20%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, 63 out of the 64 pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated; in one case the therapy was interrupted due to adverse effect. Clinical efficacy: in subjects with lower respiratory tract infections, sulbactam/ampicillin cured 32 patients (72.72%) and ameliorated the clinical status of 8 patients (18.18%); efficacy rate: 90.9%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Distribution of protein D, an immunoglobulin D-binding protein, in Haemophilus strains.
AB  - Protein D, a novel surface protein of the bacterial species Haemophilus influenzae with specific affinity for human immunoglobulin (Ig) D was detected in all 127 H. influenzae strains studied. All strains representing different serotypes of encapsulated strains and different biotypes of nonencapsulated strains bound 125I-labeled IgD to a high degree (38 to 74%). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot (immunoblot) analysis showed that protein D from all H. influenzae strains had the same apparent molecular weight (i.e., 42,000) and reacted with all three different anti-protein D monoclonal antibodies. By Scatchard analysis, the number of protein D residues on a nontypeable H. influenzae strain was estimated to be approximately 2,800 per organism. The equilibrium constant for the reaction between a human IgD myeloma protein and IgD was found to be 5.8 x 10(8) M-1. Also, all strains of H. haemolyticus and H. aegypticus strains tested bound IgD, 21 to 28% and 41 to 48%, respectively. In extracts of those bacteria, a 42,000-molecular-weight protein reactive with IgD and all three anti-protein D monoclonal antibodies was found. In H. parainfluenzae, H. aphrophilus, H. paraphrophilus, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, a 42,000-molecular-weight protein that was reactive with one to three of three anti-protein D monoclonal antibodies but not reactive with human IgD was detected with Western blot analysis. Other Haemophilus species (H. ducreyi, H. parasuis, H. parahaemolyticus, H. segnis, and H. haemoglobinophilus) did not react with human monoclonal IgD or anti-protein D antibodies. On the basis of the wide distribution of protein D among H. influenzae strains, we suggest that protein D could be a vaccine candidate.
TI  - Detection of Haemophilus influenzae in cerebrospinal fluids by polymerase chain reaction DNA amplification.
AB  - Two primer sets were chosen for the detection of Haemophilus influenzae in cerebrospinal fluid by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) DNA amplification. One primer set was selected from sequences encoding a capsulation-associated protein and reacted with target DNA from all 15 capsulate H. influenzae strains (all serotypes) examined. The other primer set was selected from the DNA sequence of a gene encoding for outer-membrane protein P6 and reacted with the 15 capsulate and 10 non-capsulate strains of H. influenzae tested. This primer set also reacted with the closely related species H. haemolyticus and H. aegyptius, and with two of nine H. parainfluenzae strains. In reconstruction experiments, PCR DNA amplification was able to detect as few as five H. influenzae cells when 40 cycles of amplification were used. Two hundred cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples collected consecutively from patients suffering from meningitis were investigated by PCR; 40 were culture-positive for H. influenzae and 39 of these were also clearly positive in the PCR test with both primer sets. Contamination occurred to some extent with 40 cycles of amplification but was completely eliminated when the number of cycles was reduced to 35. We conclude that the two primer sets are appropriate for the detection of H. influenzae by PCR, each having its own specificity. When these two primer sets are used, PCR is a technique of equivalent sensitivity to culture for the detection of H. influenzae in CSF.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefpirome and cefepime, two new cephalosporins.
AB  - In in vitro tests the broad-spectrum cephalosporins cefpirome and cefepime were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, although often less so against strains resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and ticarcillin-clavulanate, and against most strains of Acinetobacter spp. and Aeromonas hydrophila. They were also active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although strains with non-plasmid mediated beta-lactam resistance were sometimes less sensitive. Other Pseudomonas spp. varied in their sensitivity. Both agents were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, but beta-lactamase-producing Branhamella catarrhalis were somewhat less sensitive. Neisseria gonorrhoeae were susceptible, although non-beta-lactamase producing penicillin-resistant strains had higher MICs. Gardnerella vaginalis was also susceptible and Campylobacter coli/jejuni usually susceptible. Both antibiotics had good activity against Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci except for methicillin-resistant strains and Staphylococcus haemolyticus which were of borderline sensitivity. All streptococci were sensitive, with the exception of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci and enterococci against which cefpirome had greater activity than cefepime. Both antibiotics had little useful activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group or Bacteroides oralis group but were active against most other anaerobes. Clostridium difficile and some other Clostridium species were resistant.
TI  - Comparison of the RIM-H rapid identification kit with conventional tests for the  identification of Haemophilus spp.
AB  - A commercially available system, the RIM-H system (Austin Biological Laboratories, Austin, Tex.), was evaluated for its ability to rapidly and accurately identify various Haemophilus spp. A total of 110 clinical isolates were tested by both the RIM and conventional identification procedures. The RIM agreed with the standard identification for 100% of the Haemophilus influenzae (76 of 76) and 92.0% of the Haemophilus parainfluenzae (23 of 25) isolates tested. The identifications of Haemophilus parahaemolyticus, Haemophilus aphrophilus, and Haemophilus haemolyticus also correlated with those obtained by conventional methods. The RIM was found to be rapid and easy to use and was considered a suitable alternative to conventional identification procedures.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of less commonly isolated Haemophilus species using Haemophilus test medium.
AB  - Haemophilus test medium (HTM) was developed recently for dilution and disk diffusion antimicrobial agent susceptibility testing of Haemophilus influenzae. The application of HTM to the testing of other, less frequently encountered Haemophilus species recovered from humans was evaluated in this study by using commercially prepared HTM (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.) in broth microdilution and agar disk diffusion susceptibility tests with 18 antimicrobial agents. A total of 93.3% of 90 isolates belonging to six Haemophilus species provided acceptable growth in HTM agar disk diffusion tests, while only 63.3% (57 of 90) provided acceptable growth in the broth microdilution tests. However, HTM agar dilution testing provided an alternative method for those strains (primarily H. haemolyticus) which failed to grow adequately in broth. Based on the latest National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines (standard M2-T4) for interpretation of HTM disk tests of H. influenzae, the overall very major, major, and minor errors for all 18 drugs and six species tested were 0.2, 0.7, and 3.4%, respectively. Thus, the use of HTM in agar or broth susceptibility tests can be recommended for testing the less commonly encountered Haemophilus species by using the same test conditions and interpretive guidelines developed for H. influenzae.
TI  - Utilization of transferrin-bound iron by Haemophilus species of human and porcine origins.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae and H. haemolyticus acquired iron bound to human transferrin but not to human lactoferrin, ovo- or porcine transferrins. Conversely the swine pathogens H. pleuropneumoniae and H. parasuis used iron bound only to porcine transferrin. Growth under conditions of iron deprivation induced the production of siderophores and iron-repressible outer membrane proteins in H. parainfluenzae, H. paraphrophilus and H. parasuis but not in H. influenzae, H. haemolyticus or H. pleuropneumoniae. The latter 3 Haemophilus species appear to sequester transferrin bound iron via a siderophore-independent mechanism. However, the ability to produce iron chelating compounds did not enable H. parainfluenzae or H. paraphrophilus to utilize transferrin bound iron.
TI  - Nonculture detection of Haemophilus influenzae in sputum with monoclonal antibodies specific for outer membrane lipoprotein P6.
AB  - Isolation of Haemophilus influenzae from sputum is hampered by overgrowth by other microorganisms or by antibiotic treatment of the patient. To overcome this problem in the detection of H. influenzae, an in situ immunoperoxidase staining technique was developed with monoclonal antibody (MAb) 8BD9, immunoglobulin subclass G2a. MAb 8BD9 appeared to be directed to an epitope on the outer membrane lipoprotein P6 of H. influenzae. The species specificity of MAb 8BD9 was analyzed by staining isolates from different bacterial species. MAb 8BD9 reacted with all 300 H. influenzae strains tested and with H. aegyptius and H. haemolyticus. Twenty-six of 30 H. parainfluenzae strains, other Haemophilus species, and other bacterial species often isolated from sputum were not stained. The staining technique was compared with culture of 845 routinely obtained sputum samples from patients with respiratory tract infections. In 829 sputa (98.1%), the results of both techniques were in agreement; 173 were positive for H. influenzae, and 656 were negative. With 14 sputum samples, the staining method gave a positive result for H. influenzae, but the bacterium was not cultured. This could be ascribed to antibiotic treatment of the patient (n = 7), the presence of other MAb 8BD9-positive Haemophilus species in the sputum (n = 5), and overgrowth by swarming Proteus mirabilis or by Branhamella catarrhalis. In the immunoperoxidase- and Gram-stained smears of two sputum samples, no bacteria were seen, although some H. influenzae was cultured. On the basis of these results, we conclude that immunoperoxidase staining with MAb 8BD9 is a fast and reliable extension of the available detection techniques for H. influenzae.
TI  - Isolation and biochemical characterization of Haemophilus species isolated simultaneously from the oropharyngeal and anogenital areas.
AB  - Several reports have described the high frequency of pharyngeal isolation of Haemophilus species. Few studies have compared the simultaneous isolation rate of this species in the oropharyngeal and anogenital areas. Using two selective media, heart infusion agar (HIA) supplemented with 5% defibrinated rabbit blood, 1% IsoVitaleX, and either bacitracin alone (100 micrograms/ml) or bacitracin (5 micrograms/ml), vancomycin (3 micrograms/ml), and polymyxin B (1 microgram/ml), we isolated Haemophilus species in both areas in 89 of 399 (22.2%) patients consulting a sexually transmitted disease clinic. Of those, 56 were males and 33 were females. We recovered Haemophilus species in the oropharyngeal area in 384 patients (96%), while rectal and genital areas were colonized in 48 (12.0%) and 55 (13.8%) patients, respectively (both areas were colonized in 14 patients). Haemophilus parainfluenzae was isolated almost twice as often in the anogenital area as was H. influenzae. H. influenzae biotypes II and III and H. haemolyticus were the more prevalent XV-requiring haemophili isolated from the oropharynx, while H. influenzae biotype IV was more prevalent in the anogenital area. H. parainfluenzae biotypes I, II, and III were more prevalent in the oropharynx, while biotypes I and II were more prevalent in the anogenital area.
TI  - Cytosine methylation as an effector of right-handed to left-handed DNA structural transitions.
AB  - Cytosine methylation has energetic and structural influences on left-handed Z-DNA formation in supercoiled plasmids. The restriction and modification enzymes from Haemophilus haemolyticus (HhaI and M.HhaI) provide a system to locate and analyze small segments of Z-DNA in large supercoiled plasmids. An approach is outlined that uses M.HhaI as an in vivo conformational probe for the detection of unusual DNA structures in a living cell. Also, characteristic features of the M.HhaI gene and protein are discussed.
TI  - Overproduction and purification of the M.HhaII methyltransferase from Haemophilus haemolyticus.
AB  - The HhaII methyltransferase gene from Haemophilus haemolyticus was subcloned in an expression vector under control of the hybrid trp-lac promoter. Induction with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside results in overproduction of the methyltransferase to about 3% of total cellular protein. The methyltransferase was purified to near electrophoretic homogeneity by phosphocellulose, DEAE, and gel chromatography. Its monomer Mr by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is 25 kDa, in good agreement with that predicted from the nucleotide sequence. Crystals of the methyltransferase were obtained in the presence of a two-fold molar excess of the duplex oligodeoxynucleotide substrate 5'd-GGACTCC.CCTGAGG.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies of rokitamycin dry syrup in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies on rokitamycin (RKM) dry syrup, a new macrolide antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results are summarized as follows. 1. Plasma concentrations and urinary recovery rates after oral administration on fasting of RKM dry syrup at doses of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg to 2 and 1 cases, respectively, were determined. Peak plasma levels were obtained in 30 minutes after administration of both dosages with half-lives of 1.5 to 2.2 hours. A clear-cut dose response was observed. Urinary recovery rates in the first 6 hours after administration ranged from 1.75 to 2.26%. 2. The MICs of RKM against 80 clinical isolates (Streptococcus pyogenes 9, Streptococcus pneumoniae 14, Branhamella catarrhalis 4, Haemophilus influenzae 27, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 9, Haemophilus haemolyticus 2, Haemophilus parahaemolyticus 14 and Campylobacter jejuni 1) were compared with MICs of midecamycin acetate (MOM), josamycin (JM) and erythromycin (EM). The antibacterial activity of RKM was superior to those of MOM and JM and slightly inferior to that of EM. 3. Twenty-eight pediatric patients with acute infectious diseases (acute tonsillitis 4, streptococcal infection 4, acute bronchitis 9, pneumonia 4, mycoplasmal pneumonia 2 and Campylobacter enteritis 5) were treated with RKM dry syrup at a daily dose of 12-42.9 mg/kg t.i.d. as a rule. Efficacy rates were 92.9% clinically and 58.6% bacteriologically. 4. No adverse reactions were observed. Abnormal laboratory findings were mild; thrombocytosis in 2 and eosinophilia in 1. 5. The taste and the odor of RKM dry syrup preparation were sufficiently tolerable for the pediatric patients to accept it.
TI  - [Per rectal administration of antibiotics. Clinical use of ampicillin in respiratory tract infection in children].
AB  - As one of our clinical studies on per rectal administration of antibiotics, children who suffered respiratory tract infection (RTI) were administered with ampicillin (ABPC) through this route. Our conclusions drawn from this study are as follows: 1. One hundred and eighty strains of aerobic bacteria which were isolated by us in 1984-1985 were tested for the sensitivity to ABPC using plate-disk method. MIC's of ABPC for all the strains of Streptococcus pyogenes were lower than 0.024 micrograms/ml. MIC's for all the strains of Streptococcus haemolyticus were 0.05-0.20 microgram/ml. MIC's for 88% of the strains tested of Haemophilus influenzae were 0.10-0.78 microgram/ml. 2. Bacterial flora in the respiratory tract of 97 cases of children, who suffered RTI, were cultured. Almost half of them were Gram-positive cocci, the rest belonged to Gram-negative groups. This indicates that broad-spectrum antibiotics should be chosen first even before the diagnosis of causative organisms is established. 3. Soon after a per rectal administration of ABPC to children, high blood concentrations of the drug were observed by paper-disk method. 4. Eleven cases, which included 2 cases of pneumonia, of 15 children who suffered RTI and were given this antibiotic were greatly improved within 3-10 days. No serious side effects were observed. 5. Our brief study reported here indicates that ABPC administration by rectal route is safe and useful for the clinical treatment of RTI of children.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, in vivo promoter mapping, and expression in Escherichia coli of the gene for the HhaI methyltransferase.
AB  - A 1476-base pair DNA fragment from Haemophilus haemolyticus containing the HhaI methyltransferase gene was isolated from a cell library and cloned into pBR322. The nucleotide sequence of this fragment was determined. The structural gene is 981 nucleotides in length coding for a protein of 327 amino acids (Mr 37,000). The translational start signal (ATG) is preceded by the putative ribosome-binding site (TAAG). Recombinant plasmids containing the 1476-basepair fragment are completely methylated when isolated from Escherichia coli, as judged by their insusceptibility to the HhaI restriction endonuclease. However, the presence of an active HhaI methylase gene in certain E. coli strains results in a very poor yield of transformants and/or in vivo-originated deletions due to the Rg1 functions of these hosts. The in vivo transcription initiation sites have been identified by S1 protection and primer-extension experiments using specific probes with total RNA prepared from E. coli cells (HB101 or RR1) which tolerate the expression of MHhaI.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of the Vitek Neisseria-Haemophilus Identification card.
AB  - A clinical evaluation of the Vitek Neisseria-Haemophilus Identification (NHI) card (Vitek Systems, Inc., Hazelwood, Mo.) was performed with 480 clinical isolates and stock strains of Neisseria spp., Haemophilus spp., and other fastidious microorganisms included in the data base of the system. Identifications obtained with the NHI card were compared with those determined by conventional methods. The card identified 83.2% of 244 Neisseria spp. and Branhamella catarrhalis, 54.9% of 164 Haemophilus spp., and 84.7% of 72 fastidious gram-negative species with no further testing required. Some isolates produced good confidence-marginal separation identifications, in which the correct identification was listed with one or two other possible identifications and extra tests were required and suggested. When isolates producing good confidence-marginal separation identifications were included, correct identifications of these organism groups increased to 97.1, 92.7, and 94.4%, respectively. Among the commonly isolated microorganisms, the NHI card identified 99.1% of 110 N. gonorrhoeae, 98.5% of 68 N. meningitidis, 93.9% of 98 H. influenzae, and 95.6% of 46 H. parainfluenzae strains. All of these organisms produced excellent to very good confidence level identifications except for H. influenzae biotypes II, III, and VII, for which hemolytic reactions were required for differentiation from H. haemolyticus. The NHI card reliably identified other fastidious gram-negative species, including H. aphrophilus, Eikenella corrodens, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Kingella denitrificans.
TI  - In vitro activity of flurithromycin, a novel macrolide antibiotic.
AB  - Flurithromycin is an (8,S)-8-fluoroerythromycin isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces erythraeus ATCC 31772, a blocked mutant of a strain producer of erythromycin. Its in vitro antibacterial activity has been determined on recent clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens. The range of MIC for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus group A is from 0.0015 to 0.006 microgram/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae from 0.012 to 0.4 microgram/ml, for Staphylococcus aureus from 0.1 to 3.1 micrograms/ml. Its action is bacteriostatic and increases at alkaline pH. Among anaerobes Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, other species of Bacteroides and Peptostreptococcus are particularly susceptible. Flurithromycin also showed some activity on Mycobacterium bovis, M. scrofulaceum and M. phley. The determination of killing curves indicated that in most cases a killing effect was obtained at 4 X MIC. A combination of flurithromycin with ampicillin or doxycycline sometimes was synergic, but more often additive and never antagonistic. The possible interference of flurithromycin on some parameters of the natural system of defense was determined. At concentrations equal to therapeutic levels in blood and tissues, flurithromycin did not influence chemotaxis, phagocytosis, metabolic activation and the killing activity of neutrophils.
TI  - Characterisation of Haemophilus spp. isolated from infant conjunctivitis.
AB  - Haemophilus strains isolated from children under the age of 11 months with conjunctivitis were characterised by biotype, sugar fermentation, plasmid pattern and outer-membrane-protein profiles. H. influenzae was the most common species identified and was separated into 14 groups based on sugar fermentation and biotype patterns and into more than 20 groups when plasmid and outer-membrane-protein profiles were included. Small (mol. wt less than 10 X 10(6)) plasmids were identified in 11 of 34 (32%) H. influenzae isolates, 1 of 2 H. haemolyticus and 4 of 6 (67%) H. parainfluenzae isolates. Examination of sugar-fermentation and plasmid patterns increased the ability to distinguish between strains isolated at different times from recurrent disease and may have general applications in the study of Haemophilus strains isolated from a single anatomical site.
TI  - LY164846 in vitro antimicrobial activity testing, including disk diffusion susceptibility tests using 30-microgram disks.
AB  - A new oral cephalosporin, LY164846 (Eli Lilly & Co., Indianapolis, Ind.), was found to have a unique antimicrobial spectrum confined to methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus spp., streptococci (except Enterococcus spp.), Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and some anaerobes. Cephalothin in vitro tests (30-microgram disks or dilution) can represent LY164846 for laboratory testing if comparable interpretive breakpoints are applied to strains within the spectrum of LY164846. Organisms not inhibited by LY164846 (MICs greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) were members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., enterococci, and some strains of Staphylococcus haemolyticus and of the Bacteroides fragilis group.
TI  - HhaI methylase and restriction endonuclease as probes for B to Z DNA conformational changes in d(GCGC) sequences.
AB  - The capacity of the modification methylase (MHhaI) and restriction endonuclease (HhaI) form Haemophilus haemolyticus to methylate and cleave, respectively, recognition sites which are in right-handed B or left-handed Z structures was determined in vitro. Plasmids containing tracts of (dC-dG) as well as numerous individual d(GCGC) sites distributed around the vector were studied. Negative supercoiling was used to convert the (dC-dG) tracts (approximately 30 bp in length) from a right-handed to a left-handed conformation. (Methyl-3H)-SAM was used to localize and quantitate modified d(GCGC) recognition sites, whereas cleavage by HhaI was used to detect unmethylated sites. In the left-handed Z-form, the (dC-dG) blocks were not methylated by MHhaI and not cleaved by HhaI. A two-dimensional gel analysis of a family of 33 topoisomers treated with MHhaI revealed that the lack of methylation in the (dC-dG) blocks was directly correlated to the supercoil-induced B to Z transition in these segments. These results are significant with respect to enzyme-DNA interactions in general and provide the basis for using HhaI and MHhaI as probes for different DNA structures and conformational transitions under physiological conditions.
TI  - Fimbriation of Haemophilus species isolated from the respiratory tract of adults.
AB  - Twenty-two clinical isolates of Haemophilus species were studied within two passages of their original isolation for the presence of fimbriae by negative-staining electron microscopy. Six isolates were identified as fimbriated, including three strains of nontypable Haemophilus influenzae, one strain of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and two strains of Haemophilus haemolyticus. In fresh isolates of fimbriated strains of nontypable H. influenzae, approximately 40%-50% of cells had fimbriae; after five passages in vitro, less than 1% of the cells had fimbriae. Thus, a variety of Haemophilus species that colonize the human respiratory tract can be fimbriated, and this fimbriation is rapidly lost on passage in vitro.
TI  - Relative proportions of Haemophilus species in the throat of healthy children and adults.
AB  - To determine normal proportions of pharyngeal Haemophilus species, qualitative and quantitative mapping of the species in the pharynx of ten healthy children and ten healthy adults was carried out using a selective and a non-selective medium. Haemophilus organisms were present in all samples, comprising approximately 10% of the total cultivable flora (range 0.6-36.9%). Haemophilus parainfluenzae was a member of the normal flora throughout life, constituting 74% of pharyngeal Haemophilus organisms. Haemophilus segnis and Haemophilus paraphrophilus occurred more frequently in samples from adults, whereas Haemophilus haemolyticus was present in only one sample. Non-encapsulated Haemophilus influenzae strains, usually of multiple biotypes, were present in 80% of the children but accounted for a mean of only 1.8% of the total flora. Their number decreased with increasing age; 40% of the adults harbored Haemophilus influenzae but only of a single biotype which constituted a minor proportion of the total flora (mean 0.15%). These findings suggest that host mechanisms can influence changes in the proportions of Haemophilus influenzae strains colonizing the host.
TI  - Effect of oral administration of a variety of bacteria on depressed macrophage functions in tumour-bearing rats.
AB  - In consideration of the well documented influence of normal microbial flora on the level of activation of macrophages, we evaluated the effects of oral administration of bacteria on rats with depressed macrophage functions. An oral, killed polyvalent vaccine (Diplococcus pneumoniae types I, II and III, Streptococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae), the live lyophilized Streptococcus faecium and spores of Bacillus subtilis, respectively, were administered orally to immuno-depressed rats. Results demonstrate the restoration of phagocytosis, intracellular killing and the chemotactic activity of macrophages. These experimental observations suggest that bacterial flora associated with mucosae can influence the level of activation of peritoneal macrophages.
TI  - Aspects of the pathogenicity of some oral and other haemophili.
AB  - The pathogenicity of the predominantly non-capsulated, V-factor requiring haemophili that are commonly recovered from oral infections has been explored by studies of their endotoxins and infectivity as compared with those of Haemophilus influenzae. Similar yields of endotoxin (2.40-2.59% w/w) were obtained from all the haemophili examined except H. haemolyticus (1.61% w/w). The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) extracts all contained heptoses but not 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate (KDO). The fatty acid compositions of the lipid-A fractions were essentially similar but comprised 76% of the LPS in the H. influenzae type d strain tested and only 20% in the H. influenzae type b strain and some strains of H. parainfluenzae. All extracts contained arachidic acid, which may be unique to haemophili. The endotoxins from all strains produced characteristic pyrogenic and polymorph effects in rabbits. The endotoxins from the pharyngeal X- and V-factor-requiring strains had LD50 values for actinomycin-D-sensitised mice of 2.4-2.7 micrograms/kg, and were about eight times more potent than those from the oral V-factor-requiring strains (LD50 values 17.2-22.4 micrograms/ml). Approximately ten thousand times more free endotoxin was detected in broth cultures of H. influenzae type b than in those of oral haemophili, and this greater endotoxin release was not associated with a greater degree of autolysis. Endotoxin release from viable cells may be important in the pathogenicity of this organism. H. influenzae type b was much more potent in producing infection in chambers implanted subcutaneously in guinea pigs than were oral strains of haemophili; only 10 type b organisms were required, compared with 9 X 10(5) of H. parainfluenzae. However, in infections maintained for 90 days, the numbers of haemophili--c. 10(7)/ml of chamber fluid--were similar for all the test strains. Thus, although the oral haemophili lack special attributes of invasiveness and resistance to host defences, they are not devoid of pathogenic potential and, if allowed to proliferate, may become an important element in an infection.
TI  - The nucleotide sequence of the HhaII restriction and modification genes from Haemophilus haemolyticus.
AB  - We have determined the nucleotide sequence of a cloned 1710-bp segment of Haemophilus haemolyticus DNA which contains the HhaII restriction (r) and modification (m) genes. The m gene is 513 bp in length and the rgene is 681 bp in length. Both are in the same reading frame, being separated by a 21-bp region. A ribosome-binding site is identified in front of each gene, but no Haemophilus promoter is apparent on the cloned fragment. Transcription originates from a plasmid promotor and proceeds in the direction m to r.
TI  - [Clinical studies on cefroxadine in the field of pediatrics (author's transl)].
AB  - Cefroxadine dry syrup was administered to 57 children with acute febrile respiratory tract infections and 2 children with scarlet fever in the dose of 40 mg/kg/day q.i.d. for 2 approximately 7 days. 65 strains of organism were isolated as pathogen from the 59 patients, and 50 of the 65 strains (76.9%) showed bacteriologically good responses. Clinically, 55 children (93.2%) had good response. Out of 63 strains isolated from the 57 cases with respiratory infections, 48 strains (76.2%) showed good bacteriological response. As for the type of pathogen, all strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 86.4% of Streptococcus haemolyticus and 90.0% of Streptococcus pneumoniae had good response, but as for Haemophilus influenzae it was only 47.6%. In one child, Streptococcus pneumoniae appeared during cefroxadine treatment in addition to the preexisting Haemophilus influenza. From the 4 children having no response for their respiratory infections, H. influenzae were isolated in 3 cases and Streptococcus haemolyticus was isolated in 1 case, before starting the treatment. As for side effects, mild diarrhea developed in only 3 children.
TI  - The nucleotide sequence of IS5 from Escherichia coli.
AB  - A 3-kb fragment of Haemophilus haemolyticus DNA which carries the HhaII restriction (r) and modification (m) genes has been cloned into the PstI site of pBR322 (Mann et al., 1978). When propagated in Escherichia coli, it was observed that spontaneous insertions of IS5 inactivated the restriction gene, producing r- mutants at a frequency of 10(-6). Electron microscopy, restriction-site mapping and sequence analysis of two r- plasmids have demonstrated the presence of IS5 at a single target site in both possible orientations. The complete nucleotide sequence of IS5 has been determined. It is 1195 bp long and has inverted terminal repeats of 16 bp. The target site for IS5 in this plasmid is 5'-CTAG. Approx. ten copies of IS5 were found to be present at about the same locations on the E. coli chromosome in various K-12 strains, using Southern hybridization analysis.
TI  - Cellular fatty acid composition of Haemophilus species, Pasteurella multocida, Actinobacillus Actinomycetemcomitans and Haemophilus vaginalis (Corynebacterium vaginale).
AB  - The fatty acid composition of 35 Haemophilus influenzae strains was found to be grossly similar and characterized by relatively large amounts of 14:0, 3-OH-14:0, 16:1 and 16:0. The three C18 fatty acids 18:2, 18:1 and 18:0 were also present, but in much lower concentrations. This general pattern was also found for most of the other species of Haemophilus examined (H. aegyptius, H. aphrophilus, H. canis, H. gallinarum, H. haemolyticus, and H. parainfluenzae). Small but distinct quantitative discrepancies were detected for H. ducreyi and the haemin-independent species H. paraphrohaemolyticus, H. paraphrophilus and H. suis. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was found to be indistinguishable from H. influenzae. Pasteurella multocida also exhibited a fatty acid pattern closely related to that of Haemophilus, but could be distinguished by its higher concentration levels of the C18 fatty acids. The fatty acid pattern of H. vaginalis was considerably different from those of the other species examined. This species lacked 3-OH-14:0 and 18:2 and contained small amounts of 14:0 and 16:0, whereas 18:1 and 18:0 were the major constituents.
TI  - Cross-reactions between Haemophilus influenzae and nineteen other bacterial species.
AB  - Forty-one different antigens were demonstrated in an antigen preparation obtained by sonication of a Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) type b strain, using crossed immunoelectrophoresis and antiserum obtained from rabbits. Antigens were characterized by absorption experiments with whole heat-killed bacteria, temperature resistance and protein and polysaccharide staining. Cross-reactions between H. influenzae type b and 19 other bacterial species were studied by various quantitative immunoelectrophoretic methods, using the reference system. A non-capsulated H. influenzae cross-reacted extensively (41 antigens) with H. influenzae type b and Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and Haemophilus haemolyticus showed considerable cross-reactivity with H. influenzae type b (26 and 32 antigens respectively), while antigens from eight other bacterial species cross-reacted to varying degrees with one to five H. influenzae antigens.
TI  - Significance of the detection of beta-galactosidase and of beta-xylosidase in the taxonomic study of the genus Haemophilus.
AB  - A total of 314 strains of Haemophilus, isolated from clinical samples, were studied for the production of beta-galactosidase and beta-xylosidase. None of the H. influenzae strains studied (9 beta-lactamase positive strains and 129 beta-lactamase negative strains) possessed these enzymes. Both enzymes were almost constantly observed among strains of H. paraphrophilus (10 strains studied) and of H. paraphrohaemolyticus (9 strains studied). Among the other species (H. parainfluenzae, 55 strains; H. haemolyticus, 5 strains; H. parahaemolyticus, 97 strains), beta-galactosidase was present in about 30% of the strains studied whereas beta-xylosidase was detected occasionally (3% of the strains studied). Detection of these two enzymes could be a valuable test for the taxonomic study of the genus Haemophilus. However, the type of substrate used for the detection of beta-xylosidase is important: use of the para-nitro-phenyl-beta-xylopyranoside yielded more positive results than the use of its ortho-isomer.
TI  - Characterization of plasmids from Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Haemophilus haemolyticus.
AB  
TI  - Radiometric detection of Haemophilus in simulated blood cultures.
AB  - The radiometric detection of various Haemophilus species was studied in simulated blood cultures and in blood culture media without added blood, but supplemented with nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD) or hemin, or both. Haemophilus aphrophilus was the only species studied that was radiometrically detectable without added blood or NAD. All other species studied (Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Haemophilus haemolyticus, and Haemophilus parahaemolyticus) required either added NAD, whole blood, or washed blood cells for growth and radiometric detection. The results of this study and extensive experience with clinical specimens show that the radiometric system is an effective means of rapidly detecting Haemophilus in blood cultures, but it is essential that it be used in conjunction with a subculture three to five days after inoculation.
TI  - [Ampicillin-resistant "Haemophilus": their detection and occurrence in Brussels area (author's transl)].
AB  - Three hundred and five strains of Haemophilus (129 H. influenzae, 55 H. parainfluenzae, 97 H. parahaemolyticus, 5 H. haemolyticus, 10 H. paraphrophilus and 9 H. paraphrohaemolyticus) isolated from pathological material over the year 1976, were systematically tested for beta-lactamase production. Only 2 strains of H. parainfluenzae produced this enzyme. Both were able to transfer ampicillin resistance to Escherichia coli K12. All strains but the two beta-lactamase producers were susceptible to penicillin G, ampicillin and cephalotin. However, the correct interpretation of the susceptibility tests needed the microscopic observation of prints of the inhibition zones surrounding the disks: all sensitive strains presented a hazy growth around the disks which corresponded to the presence of spheroplasts; this phenomenon was not observed with the 2 beta-lactamase producing strains of H. parainfluenzae which grew up to the disks but presented a typical bacillary form.
TI  - Cloning of restriction and modification genes in E. coli: the HbaII system from Haemophilus haemolyticus.
AB  - The genes for a Class II restriction-modification system (HhaII) from Haemophilus haemolyticus have been cloned in Escherichia coli. The vector used for cloning was plasmid pBR322 which confers resistance to tetracycline and ampicillin and contains a single endonuclease R-PstI site, (formula: see text), in the ampicillin gene. The procedure developed by Bolivar et al. (1977) was used to form DNA recombinants. H. haemolyticus DNA was cleaved with PstI endonuclease and poly(dC) extensions were added to the 3'-OH termini using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Circular pBR322 DNA was cleaved to linear molecules with PstI endonuclease and poly(dG) extensions were added to the 3'-OH termini, thus regenerating the PstI cleavage site sequences. Recombinant molecules, formed by annealing the two DNAs, were used to transfect a restriction and modification-deficient strain of E. coli (HB101 r-m-recA). Tetracycline-resistant clones were tested for acquisition of restriction phenotype (as measured by growth on plates seeded with phage lambdacI-0). A single phage-resistant clone was found. The recombinant plasmid, pD110, isolated from this clone, had acquired 3 kilobases of additional DNA which could be excised with PstI endonuclease. In addition to the restriction function, cells carrying the plasmid expressed the HhaII modification function. Both activities have been partially purified by single-stranded DNA-agarose chromatography. The cloned HhaII restriction activity yields cleavage patterns identical to HinfI. A restriction map of the cloned DNA segment is presented.
TI  - Bactericidal factor produced by Haemophilus influenzae b: partial purification of the factor and transfer of its genetic determinant.
AB  - When aerobically grown on complex media, Haemophilus influenzae b and unencapsulated variants, Rb strains, produced a bactericidal factor that was active against other Haemophilus species and certain genera of the Enterobacteriaceae. A total of 341 clinical isolates of Haemophilus were tested for susceptibility to the factor. Ninety-three percent of H. influenzae (nontypable), 75% of H. haemolyticus, 71% of H. parainfluenzae, and 22% of H. parahaemolyticus were susceptible. H. influenaze b strains were resistant producers of the bactericidal factor and H. influenzae f strains were susceptible nonproducers. Only one strain each of H. aegyptius and H. aphrophilus was isolated and each was susceptible and resistant, respectively. 143 clinical isolates of the Enterobacteriaceae were tested and of those 82% of Escherichia coli, 85% of Salmonella sp., and all Citrobacter sp., Shigella sp., and Yersinia sp. were sensitive to the bactericidal factor produced by H. influenzae b. Attempts to isolate the bactericidal activity from mechanically disrupted, solubilized, or osmotically shocked cells failed to release active bactericidal factor. However, we partially purified the bactericidal factor from the spent culture medium of aerobically grown H. influenzae b by a series of extractions. The ability to produce the bactericidal factor was transferable to nonproducer strains without also genetically transforming for type b encapsulation. The converse was also true in that type b capsules were produced by transformed H. influenzae Rd strains but no bactericidal factor was detected from these strains. Additionally, nitrosoguanidine-induced mutants of H. influenzae b lost the ability to produce bactericidal factor without loss of their type-specific capsule, demonstrating that production of the bactericidal factor was genetically separable from production of the type capsule of H. influenzae b.
TI  - Cleavage map of bacteriophage phiX174 RF DNA by restriction enzymes.
AB  - phiX RF DNA was cleaved by restriction enzymes from Haemophilus influenzae Rf (Hinf I) and Haemophilus haemolyticus (Hha. I). Twenty one fragments of approximately 25 to 730 base pairs were produced by Hinf I and seventeen fragments of approximately 40 to 1560 base pairs by Hha I. The order of these fragments has been established by digestion on Haemophilus awgyptius (Hae III) and Arthrobacter luteus (Alu I) endonuclease fragments of phiX RF with Hinf I and Hha1. By this method of reciprocal digestion a detailed cleavage map of phiX RF DNA was constructed, which includes also the previously determined Hind II, Hae III and Alu I cleavage maps of phiX 174 RF DNA (1, 2). Moreover, 28 conditional lethal mutants of bacteriophage phiX174 were placed in this map using the genetic fragment assay (3).

TI  - [Characteristics of some species of microorganisms related to the genus of hemoglobinophils].
AB  - The saccharolytic capacity in respect to 14 carbohydrates, the lipolytic activity, the presence of urease, catalase, galactosidase, the formation of hydrogen sulphide and indol and also serological properties with the species agglutinating sera were studied in the representatives of the genus of hemoglobinophilic microbes: H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, H. aegiptius, H. haemolyticus, H. aphrophilus. There were revealed differences in the individual representatives of the genus by the enzymatic activity and serological properties. Thus, representatives of H. influenzae possessed urease activity, but all of them lacked galactosidase. H. aegiptius possessed urease and galactosidase, and H. parainfluenzae, H. haemolyticus and H. aphrophilus--galactosidase of high activity, but no urease. Representatives of each of the species were agglutinated by homologous sera only.
TI  - Bacteriology and clinical significance of hemolytic Haemophilus in the throat.
AB  - Hemolytic Haemophilus are rarely isolated in the clinical laboratory, as they do  not grow on sheep or human blood-agar alone. On rabbit blood-agar they grow well and are hemolytic, but they grow less well and are not hemolytic on sheep blood-agar with added X and V factors. A survey was made to determine their incidence in pharyngitis. From 28 of 100 sore throats and from 57 of 100 normal throats, only normal bacterial flora were isolated. beta-Streptococci were present in significant numbers in 9 sore and 11 normal throats; staphylococci in 8 sore and 4 normal throats; pneumococci in 20 sore and 11 normal throats; H. influenzae or H. parainfluenzae in 13 sore and no normal throats; hemolytic Haemophilus in 30 sore and 18 normal throats; enteric bacilli in 1 of each; Candida and Neisseria in 2 sore throats each. All of the 33 hemolytic Haemophilus isolates identified to species were H. parahaemolyticus. All were sensitive in vitro to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and tetracycline; 30 were sensitive to ampicillin and 30 to penicillin, 26 to novobiocin, and 12 to methicillin. H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, and H. haemolyticus are indistinguishable by Gram stain morphology, but H. parahaemolyticus is larger than the other three. Hemolytic and nonhemolytic species are indistinguishable by colonial morphology or by nutritional requirements; only hemolysis gives positive differentiation. Nevertheless, only rarely would this be of clinical importance. H. parahaemolyticus apparently may cause pharyngitis, but it is almost always susceptible to penicillin and rarely if ever causes sequelae.
