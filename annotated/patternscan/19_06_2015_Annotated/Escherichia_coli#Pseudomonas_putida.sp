TI  == variation in bacterial atp concentration during rapid changes in extracellular ph and implications for the activity of attached bacteria.
AB  == in this study we investigated the relationship between a rapid change in extracellular ph and the alteration of bacterial atp concentration. this relationship is a key component of a hypothesis indicating that bacterial bioenergetics - the creation of atp from adp via a proton gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane - can be altered by the physiochemical charge-regulation effect, which results in a ph shift at the bacteria's surface upon adhesion to another surface. the bacterial atp concentration was measured during a rapid change in extracellular ph from a baseline ph of 7.2 to ph values between 3.5 and 10.5. experiments were conducted with four neutrophilic bacterial strains, including the gram-negative escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida and the gram-positive bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus epidermidis. a change in bulk  ph produced an immediate response in bacterial atp, demonstrating a direct link between changes in extracellular ph and cellular bioenergetics. in general, the shifts in atp were similar across the four bacterial strains, with results following an exponential relationship between the extracellular ph and cellular atp concentration. one exception occurred with s. epidermidis, where there was no variation in cellular atp at acidic ph values, and this finding is consistent with this species' ability to thrive under acidic conditions. these results provide insight into obtaining a desired bioenergetic response in bacteria through (i) the application of chemical treatments to vary the local ph and (ii)  the selection and design of surfaces resulting in local ph modification of attached bacteria via the charge-regulation effect.

TI  == structural and kinetic characterization of recombinant 2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde dehydrogenase from pseudomonas putida g7.
AB  == the first enzyme in the oxalocrotonate branch of the naphthalene-degradation lower pathway in pseudomonas putida g7 is nahi, a 2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde  dehydrogenase which converts 2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde to 2-hydroxymuconate  in the presence of nad+. nahi is in family 8 (aldh8) of the nad(p)+-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily. in this work, we report the cloning, expression, purification and preliminary structural and kinetic characterization  of the recombinant nahi. the nahi gene was subcloned into a t7 expression vector  and the enzyme was overexpressed in escherichia coli arcticexpress as a hexa-histidine-tagged fusion protein. after purification by affinity and size-exclusion chromatography, dynamic light scattering and small-angle x-ray scattering experiments were conducted to analyze the oligomeric state and the overall shape of the enzyme in solution. the protein is a tetramer in solution and has nearly perfect 222 point group symmetry. protein stability and secondary  structure content were evaluated by a circular dichroism spectroscopy assay under different thermal conditions. furthermore, kinetic assays were conducted and, for the first time, km (1.3+/-0.3mum) and kcat (0.9s-1) values were determined at presumed nad+ saturation. nahi is highly specific for its biological substrate and has no activity with salicylaldehyde, another intermediate in the naphthalene-degradation pathway.

TI  == three pseudomonas putida fnr family proteins with different sensitivities to o2.
AB  == the escherichia coli fumarate-nitrate reduction regulator (fnr) protein is the paradigm for bacterial o2-sensing transcription factors. however, unlike e. coli, some bacterial species possess multiple fnr proteins that presumably have evolved to fulfill distinct roles. here, three fnr proteins (anr, pp_3233 and pp_3287) from a single bacterial species, pseudomonas putida kt2440, have been analyzed. under anaerobic conditions, all three proteins had spectral properties resembling those of [4fe-4s] proteins. the reactivity of the anr [4fe-4s] cluster with o2 was similar to that of e. coli fnr and during conversion to the apo-protein, via  a [2fe-2s] intermediate, cluster sulfur was retained. like anr, reconstituted pp_3233 and pp_3287 were converted to [2fe-2s] forms when exposed to o2, but their [4fe-4s] clusters reacted more slowly. transcription from an fnr-dependent  promoter with a consensus fnr-binding site in p. putida and e. coli strains expressing only one fnr protein was consistent with the in vitro responses to o2. taken together the experimental results suggest that the local environments of the iron-sulfur clusters in the different p. putida fnr proteins influence their  reactivity with o2, such that anr resembles e. coli fnr and is highly-responsive  to low concentrations of o2, whereas pp_3233 and pp_3287 have evolved to be less  sensitive to o2.

TI  == the production of omega-hydroxy palmitic acid using fatty acid metabolism and cofactor optimization in escherichia coli.
AB  == hydroxylated fatty acids (hfas) are used as important precursors for bulk and fine chemicals in the chemical industry. here, to overproduce long-chain (c16-c18) fatty acids and hydroxy fatty acid, their biosynthetic pathways including thioesterase (lreu_0335) from lactobacillus reuteri dsm20016, beta-hydroxyacyl-acp dehydratase (fabz) from escherichia coli, and a p450 system  (i.e., cyp153a from marinobacter aquaeolei vt8 and cama/camb from pseudomonas putida atcc17453) were overexpressed. acyl-coa synthase (fadd) involved in fatty  acid degradation by beta-oxidation was also deleted in e. coli bw25113. the engineered e. coli ffa4 strain without the p450 system could produce 503.0 mg/l of palmitic (c16) and 508.4 mg/l of stearic (c18) acids, of which the amounts are ca. 1.6- and 2.3-fold higher than those of the wild type. on the other hand, the  e. coli hfa4 strain including the p450 system for omega-hydroxylation could produce 211.7 mg/l of omega-hydroxy palmitic acid, which was 42.1 +/- 0.1 % of the generated palmitic acid, indicating that the hydroxylation reaction was the rate-determining step for the hfa production. for the maximum production of omega-hydroxy palmitic acid, nadh, i.e., an essential cofactor for p450 reaction, was overproduced by the integration of nad+-dependent formate dehydrogenase (fdh) from candida boidinii into e. coli chromosome and the deletion of alcohol dehydrogenase (adh). finally, the nadh-level-optimized e. coli strain produced 610 mg/l of omega-hydroxy palmitic acid (omega-hpa), which was almost a threefold increase in its yield compared to the same strain without nadh overproduction.

TI  == quantitatively predicting bacterial adhesion using surface free energy determined with a spectrophotometric method.
AB  == bacterial adhesion onto solid surfaces is of importance in a wide spectrum of problems, including environmental microbiology, biomedical research, and various  industrial applications. despite many research efforts, present thermodynamic models that rely on the evaluation of the adhesion energy are often elusive in predicting the bacterial adhesion behavior. here, we developed a new spectrophotometric method to determine the surface free energy (sfe) of bacterial cells. the adhesion behaviors of five bacterial species, pseudomonas putida kt2440, salmonella typhimurium atcc 14028, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, and escherichia coli dh5alpha, onto two model substratum surfaces, i.e., clean glass and silanized glass surfaces, were studied. we found that bacterial adhesion was unambiguously mediated by the sfe difference between the bacterial cells and the solid substratum. the lower the sfe difference, the higher degree of bacterial adhesion. we therefore propose the use of the sfe difference as an accurate and simple thermodynamic measure for quantitatively predicting bacterial adhesion. the methodological advance and thermodynamic simplification in the paper have implications in controlling bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on solid surfaces.

TI  == phenotypic knockouts of selected metabolic pathways by targeting enzymes with camel-derived nanobodies (vs).
AB  == surveying the dynamics of metabolic networks of gram-negative bacteria often requires the conditional shutdown of enzymatic activities once the corresponding  proteins have been produced. we show that given biochemical functions can be entirely suppressed in vivo with camel antibodies (vhhs, nanobodies) that target  active sites of cognate enzymes expressed in the cytoplasm. as a proof of principle, we raised vhhs against 2,5-dihydroxypyridine dioxygenase (nicx) of pseudomonas putida, involved in nicotinic acid metabolism. once fused to a thioredoxin domain, the corresponding nanobodies inhibited the enzyme both in escherichia coli and in p. putida cells, which then accumulated the metabolic substrate of nicx. vhhs were further engineered to track the antigen in vivo by c-terminal fusion to a fluorescent protein. conditional expression of the resulting vhhs allows simultaneously to track and target proteins of interest and enables the design of transient phenotypes without mutating the genetic complement of the bacteria under study.

TI  == making variability less variable: matching expression system and host for oxygenase-based biotransformations.
AB  == variability in whole-cell biocatalyst performance represents a critical aspect for stable and productive bioprocessing. in order to investigate whether and how  oxygenase-catalyzed reactions are affected by such variability issues in solvent-tolerant pseudomonas, different inducers, expression systems, and host strains were tested for the reproducibility of xylene and styrene monooxygenase catalyzed hydroxylation and epoxidation reactions, respectively. significantly higher activity variations were found for biocatalysts based on solvent-tolerant  pseudomonas putida dot-tie and s12 compared with solvent-sensitive p. putida kt2440, escherichia coli jm101, and solvent-tolerant pseudomonas taiwanensis vlb120. specific styrene epoxidation rates corresponded to cellular styrene monooxygenase contents. detected variations in activity strictly depended on the  type of regulatory system employed, being high with the alk- and low with the lac-system. these results show that the occurrence of clonal variability in recombinant gene expression in pseudomonas depends on the combination of regulatory system and host strain, does not correlate with a general phenotype such as solvent tolerance, and must be evaluated case by case.

TI  == marine hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria as whole-cell biosensors for n-alkanes.
AB  == whole-cell biosensors offer potentially useful, cost-effective systems for the in-situ monitoring of seawater for hydrocarbons derived from accidental spills. the present work compares the performance of a biosensor system for the detection of alkanes in seawater, hosted in either escherichia coli (commonly employed in whole-cell biosensors but not optimized for alkane assimilation) or different marine bacteria specialized in assimilating alkanes. the sensor system was based  on the pseudomonas putida alks regulatory protein and the palkb promoter fused to a gene encoding the green fluorescent protein. while the e. coli sensor provided  the fastest response to pure alkanes (25-fold induction after 2 h under the conditions used), a sensor based on alcanivorax borkumensis was slower, requiring 3-4 h to reach similar induction values. however, the a. borkumensis sensor showed a fourfold lower detection threshold for octane (0.5 mum), and was also better at sensing the alkanes present in petrol. at petrol concentrations of 0.0125%, the a. borkumensis sensor rendered a sevenfold induction, while e. coli  sensor showed no response. we discuss possible explanations to this behaviour in  terms of the cellular adaptations to alkane uptake and the basal fluorescence produced by each bacterial strain, which was lowest for a. borkumensis.

TI  == improved n-butanol tolerance in escherichia coli by controlling membrane related  functions.
AB  == as the increasing demand from both chemical and fuel markets, the interest in producing n-butanol using biological route has been rejuvenated to engineer an economical fermentation process, competing with the currently-dominant chemical synthesis. n-butanol has been traditionally produced from the abe fermentation of clostridium acetobutylicum. this system, however, is not economically feasible due to its limited efficiency and the lack of genetic modification tools for further improvements. alternatively, n-butanol synthesis pathway was successfully transferred into escherichia coli and rapidly improved to reach a level of production comparable to the native producer. nevertheless, the toxicity of n-butanol has become a common issue that either approach has to deal with. previously, we reported our success in improving n-butanol tolerance in e. coli by engineering an artificial transcription factor (atf) that can modify the expression level of multiple targets simultaneously and improved the n-butanol tolerance of mg1655 strain to 1.5% (vol/vol) n-butanol. however, it was observed  that some possible n-butanol tolerance mechanisms did not occurred upon the atf expression, especially the membrane-related functions such as the homeoviscous adaptation, iron uptaking system, and efflux pump system. in this work, we attempted to enhance the n-butanol tolerance associated with the atf by combining it with the membrane-related functions in e. coli, including the overexpression of fatty acid synthesis genes, iron-uptaking protein feoa, and introducing a srpabc efflux pump from pseudomonas putida into e. coli. the synergistic effect of this combinatorial approach led to 4, 5, and 9-fold improved growths in the cultures containing 1, 1.5, and 2% (vol/vol) n-butanol, respectively, of an mg1655 knockout strain engineered for n-butanol production, and expanded the tolerance limit to 2% (vol/vol) n-butanol.

TI  == bacterial cell surface properties: role of loosely bound extracellular polymeric  substances (lb-eps).
AB  == this study investigated the effect of loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances (lb-eps) on the comprehensive surface properties of four bacteria (bacillus subtilis, streptococcus suis, escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida). the removal of lb-eps from bacterial surfaces by high-speed centrifugation (12,000xg) was confirmed by sem images. viability tests showed that the percentages of viable cells ranged from 95.9% to 98.0%, and no significant difference was found after treatment (p>0.05). ftir spectra revealed the presence of phosphodiester, carboxylic, phosphate, and amino functional groups on bacteria surfaces, and the removal of lb-eps did not alter the types of cell surface functional groups. potentiometric titration results suggested the total site concentrations on the intact bacteria were higher than those on lb-eps free bacteria. most of the acidity constants (pka) were almost identical, except the increased pka values of phosphodiester groups on lb-eps free s. suis and e. coli  surfaces. the electrophoretic mobilities and hydrodynamic diameters of the intact and lb-eps free bacteria were statistically unchanged (p>0.05), indicating lb-eps had no influence on the net surface charges and size distribution of bacteria. however, lb-esp could enhance cell aggregation processes. the four lb-eps free bacteria all exhibited fewer hydrophobicity values (26.1-65.0%) as compared to the intact cells (47.4-69.3%), suggesting the removal of uncharged nonpolar compounds (e.g., carbohydrates) in lb-eps. these findings improve our understanding of the changes in cell surface characterizations induced by lb-eps, and have important implications for assessing the role of lb-eps in bacterial adhesion and transport behaviors.

TI  == construction of a novel phenol synthetic pathway in escherichia coli through 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylation.
AB  == phenol is a bulk chemical with lots of applications in the chemical industry. fermentative production of phenol had been realized in both pseudomonas putida and escherichia coli by recruiting tyrosine phenol-lyase (tpl). the tpl pathway needs tyrosine as the direct precursor for phenol production. in this work, a novel phenol synthetic pathway was created in e. coli by recruiting 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase, which can convert 4-hydroxybenzoate to phenol and carbon dioxide. activating 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (dahp) synthase and chorismate pyruvate lyase (ubic) through plasmid overexpression led  to 7- and 69-fold increase of phenol production, respectively, demonstrating that these two enzymes were the rate-limiting steps for phenol production. genetically stable strains were then obtained by gene integration and gene modulation directly in chromosome. phenol titer increased 147-fold (from 1.7 to 250 mg/l) after modulating the dahp synthase, ubic, and 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase genes in chromosome. five solvents were tested for two-phase extractive fermentation to eliminate phenol toxicity to e. coli cells. tributyrin and dibutyl phthalate were the best two solvents for improving phenol production, leading to 23 and 30 % increase of total phenol production, respectively. two-phase fed-batch fermentation of the best strain phe009 was performed in a 7 l fermentor, which produced 9.51 g/l phenol with a yield of 0.061 g/g glucose.

TI  == biosynthesis of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyalkanoates) by recombinant escherichia coli from glucose.
AB  == the polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) copolymers consisting of short-chain-length (scl)  and medium-chain-length (mcl) monomers have various properties ranging from stiff to flexible depending on the molar fraction of the monomer compositions. it has been reported that phag, which is first known as a (r)-3-hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein (acp)-coa transferase, actually functions as a 3-hydroxyacyl-acp thioesterase, and the product of pp0763 gene from pseudomonas putida kt2440 has a (r)-3-hydroxyacyl (3ha)-coa ligase activity (appl. environ. microbiol., 78, 519-527, 2012). in this study, we found a new (r)-3ha-coa ligase (the product of  pa3924 gene) from pseudomonas aeruginosa pao. the pa3924 gene was coexpressed with pha synthase 1 gene (phac1ps) and phagps gene from pseudomonas sp. 61-3, and beta-ketothiolase gene (phbare) and acetoacetyl-coa reductase gene (phbbre) from  ralstonia eutropha in escherichia coli ls5218 at 25 degrees c. as a result, the copolymer containing 94.6 mol% 3-hydroxybutyrate (3hb) and 5.4 mol% mcl-3-hydroxyalkanoates (3ha) consisting of c8, c10, c12 and c14 was synthesized  by recombinant e. coli ls5218 from glucose as the sole carbon source. the concentration of p(3hb-co-3ha) (scl-co-mcl-pha) synthesized by the recombinant e. coli ls5218 harboring phac1ps, phagps, phbabre and the pa3924 genes was approximately 7-fold higher than that of the recombinant ls5218 harboring phac1ps, phagps, phbabre and the pp0763 genes. the number-average molecular weight of the p(3hb-co-5.4% 3ha) copolymer was 233 x 103, which was relatively high molecular weight. in addition, the physical and the mechanical properties of the copolymer were demonstrated to improve the brittleness of p(3hb) homopolymer.

TI  == arsh is an organoarsenical oxidase that confers resistance to trivalent forms of  the herbicide monosodium methylarsenate and the poultry growth promoter roxarsone.
AB  == environmental organoarsenicals are produced by microorganisms and are introduced  anthropogenically as herbicides and antimicrobial growth promoters for poultry and swine. nearly every prokaryote has an ars (arsenic resistance) operon, and some have an arsh gene encoding an atypical flavodoxin. the role of arsh in arsenic resistance has been unclear. here we demonstrate that arsh is an organoarsenical oxidase that detoxifies trivalent methylated and aromatic arsenicals by oxidation to pentavalent species. escherichia coli, which does not  have an arsh gene, is very sensitive to the trivalent forms of the herbicide monosodium methylarsenate [msma or mas(v)] and antimicrobial growth promoter roxarsone [rox(v)], as well as to phenylarsenite [phas(iii), also called phenylarsine oxide or pao]. pseudomonas putida has two chromosomally encoded arsh genes and is highly resistant to the trivalent forms of these organoarsenicals. a derivative of p. putida with both arsh genes deleted is sensitive to mas(iii), phas(iii) or rox(iii). p. putida arsh expressed in e. coli conferred resistance to each trivalent organoarsenical. cells expressing pparsh oxidized the trivalent organoarsenicals. pparsh was purified, and the enzyme in vitro similarly oxidized the trivalent organoarsenicals. these results suggest that arsh catalyzes a novel biotransformation that confers resistance to environmental methylated and aromatic arsenicals.

TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in seri kembangan, malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  == this study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around seri kembangan, a city in malaysia. pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of otus with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). proteobacteria, firmicutes and bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (otus) observed across all samples. the highest appearance frequencies (100%) were otus closely related to enterobacter sp., enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas sp. and pseudomonas putida. several otus were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, cronobacter sakazaki, cronobacter turisensis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, hafnia alvei, kurthia gibsonii, salmonella bongori, salmonella enterica, salmonella paratyphi, salmonella tyhpi, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. the condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.

TI  == transferable antibiotic resistance plasmids from biogas plant digestates often belong to the incp-1epsilon subgroup.
AB  == manure is known to contain residues of antibiotics administered to farm animals as well as bacteria carrying antibiotic resistance genes (args). these genes are  often located on mobile genetic elements. in biogas plants (bgps), organic substrates such as manure and plant material are mixed and fermented in order to  provide energy, and resulting digestates are used for soil fertilization. the fate of plasmid carrying bacteria from manure during the fermentation process is  unknown. the present study focused on transferable antibiotic resistance plasmids from digestates of seven bgps, using manure as a co-substrate, and their phenotypic and genotypic characterization. plasmids conferring resistance to either tetracycline or sulfadiazine were captured by means of exogenous plasmid isolation from digestates into pseudomonas putida kt2442 and escherichia coli cv601 recipients, at transfer frequencies ranging from 10(-5) to 10(-7). transconjugants (n = 101) were screened by pcr-southern blot hybridization and real-time pcr for the presence of incp-1, incp-1epsilon, incw, incn, incp-7, incp-9, lowgc, and incq plasmids. while 61 plasmids remained unassigned, 40 plasmids belonged to the incp-1epsilon subgroup. all these incp-1epsilon plasmids were shown to harbor the genes tet(a), sul1, qacedelta1, inti1, and integron gene cassette amplicons of different size. further analysis of 16 representative incp-1epsilon plasmids showed that they conferred six different multiple antibiotic resistance patterns and their diversity seemed to be driven by the gene cassette arrays. incp-1epsilon plasmids displaying similar restriction and antibiotic resistance patterns were captured from different bgps, suggesting that they may be typical of this environment. our study showed that bgp digestates are a potential source of transferable antibiotic resistance plasmids, and in particular the broad host range incp-1epsilon plasmids might contribute to the spread of args when digestates are used as fertilizer.

TI  == enzyme fusion for whole-cell biotransformation of long-chain sec-alcohols into esters.
AB  == enzyme fusion was investigated as a strategy to improve productivity of a two-step whole-cell biocatalysis. the biotransformation of long-chain sec-alcohols into esters by an alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) and baeyer-villiger monooxygenases (bvmos) was used as the model reaction. the recombinant escherichia coli, expressing the fusion enzymes between the adh of micrococcus luteus nctc2665 and the bvmo of pseudomonas putida kt2440 or rhodococcus jostii rha1, showed significantly greater bioconversion activity with long-chain sec-alcohols (e.g., 12-hydroxyoctadec-9-enoic acid (1a), 13-hydroxyoctadec-9-enoic acid (2a), 14-hydroxyicos-11-enoic acid (4a)) when compared to the recombinant e. coli expressing the adh and bvmos independently. for instance, activity of the recombinant e. coli expressing the adh-gly-bvmo, in which glycine-rich peptide was used as the linker, with 1a was increased up to 22 mumol g dry cells-1 min-1. this value is over 40 % greater than the recombinant e. coli expressing the adh and bvmo independently. the substantial improvement appeared to be driven by an increase in the functional expression of the bvmos and/or an increase in mass transport efficiency by localizing two active sites in close proximity.

TI  == prediction of distal residue participation in enzyme catalysis.
AB  == a scoring method for the prediction of catalytically important residues in enzyme structures is presented and used to examine the participation of distal residues  in enzyme catalysis. scores are based on the partial order optimum likelihood (pool) machine learning method, using computed electrostatic properties, surface  geometric features, and information obtained from the phylogenetic tree as input  features. predictions of distal residue participation in catalysis are compared with experimental kinetics data from the literature on variants of the featured enzymes; some additional kinetics measurements are reported for variants of pseudomonas putida nitrile hydratase (ppnh) and for escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase (ap). the multilayer active sites of p. putida nitrile hydratase and  of human phosphoglucose isomerase are predicted by the pool log zp scores, as is  the single-layer active site of p. putida ketosteroid isomerase. the log zp score cutoff utilized here results in over-prediction of distal residue involvement in  e. coli alkaline phosphatase. while fewer experimental data points are available  for p. putida mandelate racemase and for human carbonic anhydrase ii, the pool log zp scores properly predict the previously reported participation of distal residues.

TI  == development of a growth-dependent selection system for identification of l-threonine aldolases.
AB  == threonine aldolases (tas) are useful enzymes for the synthesis of beta-hydroxy-alpha-amino acids due to their capability to catalyze asymmetric aldol reactions. starting from two prochiral compounds, an aldehyde and glycine,  two chiral stereocenters were formed in a single step via c-c bond formation. owing to poor diastereoselectivity and low activity, the enzymatic synthesis of beta-hydroxy-alpha-amino acids by tas is still a challenge. for identification of new tas, a growth-dependent selection system in pseudomonas putida kt2440 has been developed. this bacterium is able to use aromatic compounds such as benzaldehyde, which is the cleavage product of the ta-mediated retro-aldol reaction of phenylserine, as sole carbon source via the beta-ketoadipate pathway. with dl-threo-beta-phenylserine as sole carbon source, this strain showed only slight growth in minimal medium. this growth deficiency can be restored by introducing and expressing genes encoding tas. in order to develop a highly efficient selection system, the gene tapp of p. putida kt2440 encoding a ta was successfully deleted by replacement with an antibiotic resistance cassette. different growth studies were carried out to prove the operability of the selection system. genes encoding for l- and d-specific tas (l-ta genes of escherichia coli (ltae) and saccharomyces cerevisiae (gly1) and d-ta gene of achromobacter xylosoxidans (dtaax)) were introduced into the selection strain p.  putida kt2440deltatapp, followed by cultivation on minimal medium supplemented with dl-threo-beta-phenylserine. the results demonstrate that only the selection  strains with plasmid-encoded l-tas were able to grow on this racemic amino acid,  whereas the corresponding strain harboring the gene coding for a d-specific ta showed no growth. in summary, it can be stated that a powerful screening tool was developed to identify easily by growth new l-specific threonine aldolases or other enzymes from genomic or metagenomic libraries liberating benzaldehyde.

TI  == isolation of oxygenase genes for indigo-forming activity from an artificially polluted soil metagenome by functional screening using pseudomonas putida strains as hosts.
AB  == metagenomes contain the dna from many microorganisms, both culturable and non-culturable, and are a potential resource of novel genes. in this study, a 5.2-gb metagenomic dna library was constructed from a soil sample (artificially polluted with four aromatic compounds, i.e., biphenyl, phenanthrene, carbazole, and 3-chlorobenzoate) in escherichia coli by using a broad-host-range cosmid vector. the resultant library was introduced into naphthalene-degrading pseudomonas putida-derived strains having deficiencies in their naphthalene dioxygenase components, and indigo-forming clones on the indole-containing agar plates were screened. cosmids isolated from 29 positive clones were classified by their various properties (original screening hosts, hosts showing indigo-forming  activity, and digestion patterns with restriction enzymes), and six representative cosmids were chosen. sequencing and in vitro transposon mutagenesis of the six cosmids resulted in the identification of genes encoding putative class b and d flavoprotein monooxygenases, a multicomponent hydroxylase, and a reductase that were responsible for the indigo-forming activity in the host cells. among them, the genes encoding the multicomponent hydroxylase were demonstrated to be involved in phenol degradation. furthermore, two genes encoding ring-cleavage dioxygenases were also found adjacent to the genes responsible for the indigo formation, and their functions were experimentally confirmed.

TI  == detection and characterization of a bacteriocin, putadicin t01, produced by pseudomonas putida isolated from hot spring water.
AB  == pseudomonas strains isolated from hot spring water were tested for bacteriocin-like substance (bls) production using a target panel of closely related microorganisms and other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. molecular identification was carried out through specific pcr and 16s rna sequence analysis. isolates were identified as brevundimonas diminuta and pseudomonas putida, the latter exhibited antimicrobial activity. pseudomonas putida strains produce an inhibitory substance against other pseudomonas strains  and other species including food-borne pathogens. the bls was sensitive to the proteolytic action of proteinase k, pronase e and trypsin but resistant to alpha-amylase, rnase and lipase c, reflecting its proteinaceous nature. the bls was stable at 100 degrees c and also after thermal treatment at 121 degrees c for 15 min. additionally, it was stable within a wide range of ph (2-10). the substance from p. putida t01 strain was bactericidal to escherichia coli. sds-page analysis of the partial purified supernatant of strain t01 revealed a bls with an approximate molecular mass of 8 kda. therefore, the results of this study show that p. putida strain t01 produces a bls with a higher activity spectrum, which may find application in human medicine and in minimally processed food preservation.

TI  == functional expression of l-lysine alpha-oxidase from scomber japonicus in escherichia coli for one-pot synthesis of l-pipecolic acid from dl-lysine.
AB  == l-pipecolic acid is a key component of biologically active molecules and a pharmaceutically important chiral building block. it can be stereoselectively produced from l-lysine by a two-step bioconversion involving l-lysine alpha-oxidase and (1)-piperideine-2-carboxylae (pip2c) reductase. in this study,  we focused on an l-lysine alpha-oxidase from scomber japonicus that was originally identified as an apoptosis-inducing protein (aip) and applied the enzyme to one-pot fermentation of l-pipecolic acid in escherichia coli. a synthetic gene coding for an aip was expressed in e. coli, and the recombinant enzyme was purified and characterized. the purified enzyme was determined to be a homodimer with a molecular mass of 133.9 kda. the enzyme essentially exhibited the same substrate specificity as the native enzyme. optimal temperature and ph for the enzymatic reaction were 70 degrees c and 7.4, respectively. the enzyme was stable below 60 degrees c and at a ph range of 5.5-7.5 but was markedly inhibited by co(2+). to establish a one-pot fermentation system for the synthesis of optically pure l-pipecolic acid from dl-lysine, an e. coli strain carrying a plasmid encoding aip, pip2c reductase from pseudomonas putida, lysine racemase from p. putida, and glucose dehydrogenase from bacillus subtilis was constructed. the one-pot process produced 45.1 g/l of l-pipecolic acid (87.4 % yield from dl-lysine) after a 46-h reaction with high optical purity (>99.9 % enantiomeric excess).

TI  == expression levels of chaperones influence biotransformation activity of recombinant escherichia coli expressing micrococcus luteus alcohol dehydrogenase  and pseudomonas putida baeyer-villiger monooxygenase.
AB  == we demonstrated for the first time that the archaeal chaperones (i.e., gamma-prefoldin and thermosome) can stabilize enzyme activity in vivo. ricinoleic acid biotransformation activity of recombinant escherichia coli expressing micrococcus luteus alcohol dehydrogenase and the pseudomonas putida kt2440 baeyer-villiger monooxygenase improved significantly with co-expression of gamma-prefoldin or recombinant themosome originating from the deep-sea hyperthermophile archaea methanocaldococcus jannaschii. furthermore, the degree of enhanced activity was dependent on the expression levels of the chaperones. for example, whole-cell biotransformation activity was highest at 12 micromol/g dry cells/min when gamma-prefoldin expression level was approximately 46% of the  theoretical maximum. this value was approximately two-fold greater than that in e. coli, where the gamma-prefoldin expression level was zero or set to the theoretical maximum. therefore, it was assumed that the expression levels of chaperones must be optimized to achieve maximum biotransformation activity in whole-cell biocatalysts.

TI  == biodegradation of hexachlorobenzene by a constructed microbial consortium.
AB  == a consortium comprised of an engineered escherichia coli dh5alpha and a natural pentachlorophenol (pcp) degrader, sphingobium chlorophenolicum atcc 39723, was assembled for degradation of hexachlorobenzene (hcb), a persistent organic pollutant. the engineered e. coli strain, harbouring a gene cassette (cama (+) camb (+) camc) that encodes the f87w/y96f/l244a/v247l mutant of cytochrome p-450cam (cyp101), oxidised hcb to pcp. the resulting pcp was then further completely degraded by atcc 39723. the results showed that almost 40 % of 4 mum hcb was degraded by the consortium at a rate of 0.033 nmol/mg (dry weight)/h over 24 h, accompanied by transient accumulation and immediate consumption of the intermediate pcp, detected by gas chromatography. in contrast, in the consortium  comprised of pseudomonas putida paw340 harbouring cama (+) camb (+) camc and atcc 39723, pcp accumulated in paw340 cells but could not be further degraded, which may be due to a permeability barrier of pseudomonas paw340 for pcp transportation. the strategy of bacterial co-culture may provide an alternative approach for the bioremediation of hcb contamination.

TI  == de novo production of the monoterpenoid geranic acid by metabolically engineered  pseudomonas putida.
AB  == background: production of monoterpenoids as valuable chemicals using recombinant  microbes is a growing field of interest. unfortunately, antimicrobial activity of most monoterpenoids hampers a wide application of microorganisms for their production. strains of pseudomonas putida, a fast growing and metabolically versatile bacterium, often show an outstanding high tolerance towards organic solvents and other toxic compounds. therefore, pseudomonas putida constitutes an  attractive alternative host in comparison to conventionally used microorganisms.  here, metabolic engineering of solvent tolerant pseudomonas putida as a novel microbial cell factory for de novo production of monoterpenoids is reported for the first time, exemplified by geranic acid production from glycerol as carbon source. the monoterpenoic acid is an attractive compound for application in the flavor, fragrance, cosmetics and agro industries. results: a comparison between escherichia coli, saccharomyces cerevisiae and pseudomonas putida concerning the  ability to grow in the presence of geranic acid revealed that the pseudomonad bears a superior resilience compared to the conventionally used microbes. moreover, pseudomonas putida dsm 12264 wildtype strain efficiently oxidized externally added geraniol to geranic acid with no further degradation. omitting external dosage of geraniol but functionally expressing geraniol synthase (ges) from ocimum basilicum, a first proof-of-concept for de novo biosynthesis of 1.35  mg/l geranic acid in p. putida dsm 12264 was achieved. doubling the amount of glycerol resulted in twice the amount of product. co-expression of the six genes  of the mevalonate pathway from myxococcus xanthus to establish flux from acetyl-coa to the universal terpenoid precursor isopentenylpyrophosphate yielded  36 mg/l geranic acid in shake flask experiments. in the bioreactor, the recombinant strain produced 193 mg/l of geranic acid under fed-batch conditions within 48 h. conclusion: metabolic engineering turned pseudomonas putida dsm 12264, a versatile monoterpenoid oxidation biocatalyst, into an efficient microbial cell factory for de novo geranic acid production. improvements by metabolic and process engineering are expected to further increase the product concentration. to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first example of a de novo production of a monoterpenoid with pseudomonas putida and of a microbial monoterpenoic acid synthesis in general.

TI  == enhancement of protocatechuate decarboxylase activity for the effective production of muconate from lignin-related aromatic compounds.
AB  == the decarboxylation reaction of protocatechuate has been described as a bottleneck and a rate-limiting step in cis,cis-muconate (ccma) bioproduction from renewable feedstocks such as sugar. because sugars are already in high demand in  the development of many bio-based products, our work focuses on improving protocatechuate decarboxylase (pdc) activity and ccma production in particular, from lignin-related aromatic compounds. we previously had transformed an escherichia coli strain using aroy, which had been used as a protocatechuate decarboxylase encoding gene from klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae a170-40, and inserted other required genes from pseudomonas putida kt2440, to allow the production of ccma from vanillin. this recombinant strain produced ccma from vanillin, however the pdc reaction step remained a bottleneck during incubation.  in the current study, we identify a way to increase protocatechuate decarboxylase activity in e. coli through enzyme production involving both aroy and kpdb; the latter which encodes for the b subunit of 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase. this permits expression of pdc activity at a level approximately 14-fold greater than  the strain with aroy only. the expression level of aroy increased, apparently as  a function of the co-expression of aroy and kpdb. our results also imply that ccma may inhibit vanillate demethylation, a reaction step that is rate limiting for efficient ccma production from lignin-related aromatic compounds, so even though ccma production may be enhanced, other challenges to overcome vanilate demethylation inhibition still remain.

TI  == development of recombinant methioninase to target the general cancer-specific metabolic defect of methionine dependence: a 40-year odyssey.
AB  == introduction: all tested cancer cell types are methionine dependent in that the cells arrest and eventually die when deprived of methionine, a condition that is  generally nontoxic to normal cells. methionine dependence is the only known general metabolic defect in cancer. methionine-deprived cancer cells arrest at the s/g2 phase, an unusual position for cell cycle arrest. in order to exploit the cancer-specific metabolic defect of methionine dependence, methioninases were developed. areas covered: the present expert opinion describes the phenomena of methionine dependence and a methioninase cloned from pseudomonas putida (chemical name: l-methionine alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane lyase [ec 4.4.1.11]). the  cloned methioninase, termed recombinant methioninase, or rmetase, has been tested in mouse models of human cancer as well as in macaque monkeys and a pilot phase i trial of human cancer patients. efficacy of rmetase has been demonstrated against various cancer types in mouse models. expert opinion: the most promising application of rmetase therapy is in sequential combination therapy, whereby the  cancer cells within a tumor are trapped in s/g2 by methioninase treatment and then treated with chemotherapeutic agents active against cells in s/g2.

AB  == pseudomonas plecoglossicida is a lethal pathogen of ayu (plecoglossus altivelis)  in japan and is responsible for substantial economic costs to ayu culture. previously, we demonstrated the efficacy of phage therapy against p. plecoglossicida infection using two lytic phages (pppw-3 and pppw-4) (s. c. park, i. shimamura, m. fukunaga, k. mori, and t. nakai, appl environ microbiol 66:1416-1422, 2000, http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/aem.66.4.1416-1422.2000; s. c. park and t. nakai, dis aquat org 53:33-39, 2003, http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/dao053033). in the present study, the complete genome sequences of these therapeutic p. plecoglossicida phages were determined and analyzed for deleterious factors as therapeutic agents. the genome of pppw-3 (myovirus) consisted of 43,564 bp with a gc content of 61.1% and 66 predicted open reading frames (orfs). approximately half of the genes were similar to the genes of the escherichia coli phage vb_ecom_eco1230-10 (myovirus). the genome of pppw-4 (podovirus) consisted of 41,386 bp with a gc content of 56.8% and 50 predicted orfs. more than 70% of the  genes were similar to the genes of pseudomonas fluorescens phage varphiibb-pf7a and pseudomonas putida phage varphi15 (podoviruses). the whole-genome analysis revealed that no known virulence genes were present in pppw-3 and pppw-4. an integrase gene was found in pppw-3, but other factors used for lysogeny were not  confirmed. the pcr detection of phage genes in phage-resistant variants provided  no evidence of lysogenic activity in pppw-3 and pppw-4. we conclude that these two lytic phages qualify as therapeutic agents.

TI  == quantitative analysis of chemotaxis towards toluene by pseudomonas putida in a convection-free microfluidic device.
AB  == chemotaxis has been shown to be beneficial for the migration of soil-inhabiting bacteria towards industrial chemical pollutants, which they degrade. many studies have demonstrated the importance of this microbial property under various circumstances; however, few quantitative analyses have been undertaken to measure the two essential parameters that characterize the chemotaxis of bioremediation bacteria: the chemotactic sensitivity coefficient chi(0) and the chemotactic receptor constant k(c). the main challenge to determine these parameters is that  chi(0) and k(c) are coupled together in non-linear mathematical models used to evaluate them. in this study we developed a method to accurately measure these parameters for pseudomonas putida in the presence of toluene, an important pollutant in groundwater contamination. our approach uses a multilayer microfluidic device to expose bacteria to a convection-free linear chemical gradient of toluene that is stable over time. the bacterial distribution within the gradient is measured in terms of fluorescence intensity, and is then used to  fit the parameters kc and chi(0) with mathematical models. critically, bacterial  distributions under chemical gradients at two different concentrations were used  to solve for both parameters independently. to validate the approach, the chemotaxis parameters of escherichia coli strains towards alpha-methylaspartate were experimentally derived and were found to be consistent with published results from related work.

TI  == new transposon tools tailored for metabolic engineering of gram-negative microbial cell factories.
AB  == re-programming microorganisms to modify their existing functions and/or to bestow bacteria with entirely new-to-nature tasks have largely relied so far on specialized molecular biology tools. such endeavors are not only relevant in the  burgeoning metabolic engineering arena but also instrumental to explore the functioning of complex regulatory networks from a fundamental point of view. a la carte modification of bacterial genomes thus calls for novel tools to make genetic manipulations easier. we propose the use of a series of new broad-host-range mini-tn5-vectors, termed pbamds, for the delivery of gene(s) into the chromosome of gram-negative bacteria and for generating saturated mutagenesis libraries in gene function studies. these delivery vectors endow the  user with the possibility of easy cloning and subsequent insertion of functional  cargoes with three different antibiotic-resistance markers (kanamycin, streptomycin, and gentamicin). after validating the pbamd vectors in the environmental bacterium pseudomonas putida kt2440, their use was also illustrated by inserting the entire poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (phb) synthesis pathway from cupriavidus necator in the chromosome of a phosphotransacetylase mutant of escherichia coli. phb is a completely biodegradable polyester with a number of industrial applications that make it attractive as a potential replacement of oil-based plastics. the non-selective nature of chromosomal insertions of the biosynthetic genes was evidenced by a large landscape of phb synthesis levels in  independent clones. one clone was selected and further characterized as a microbial cell factory for phb accumulation, and it achieved polymer accumulation levels comparable to those of a plasmid-bearing recombinant. taken together, our  results demonstrate that the new mini-tn5-vectors can be used to confer interesting phenotypes in gram-negative bacteria that would be very difficult to  engineer through direct manipulation of the structural genes.

AB  == 6-hydroxy-3-succinoyl-pyridine (hsp) 3-monooxygenase (hspb), a flavoprotein essential to the pyrrolidine pathway of nicotine degradation, catalyzes pyridine-ring beta-hydroxylation, resulting in carbon-carbon cleavage and production of 2,5-dihydroxypyridine. here, we generated his6-tagged hspb in escherichia coli, characterized the properties of the recombinant enzyme, and investigated its mechanism of catalysis. in contrast to conclusions reported previously, the second product of the hspb reaction was shown to be succinate, with isotope labeling experiments providing direct evidence that the newly introduced oxygen atom of succinate is derived from h2o. phylogenetic analysis reveals that hspb is the most closely related to two p-nitrophenol 4-monooxygenases, and the experimental results exhibit that p-nitrophenol is a substrate of hspb. the reduction of hspb (with maxima at 375 and 460 nm, and a shoulder at 485 nm) by nadh was followed by stopped-flow spectroscopy, and the rate constant for reduction was shown to be stimulated by hsp. reduced hspb reacts with oxygen to form a c(4a)-(hydro)peroxyflavin intermediate with an absorbance maximum at approximately 400 nm within the first few milliseconds before converting to the oxidized flavoenzyme species. the formed c(4a)-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate reacts with hsp to form an intermediate that hydrolyzes to the products 2,5-dihydroxypyridine and succinate. the investigation on the catalytic mechanism of a flavoprotein pyridine-ring beta-position hydroxylase provides useful information for the biosynthesis of pyridine derivatives.

AB  == inducible expression is a versatile genetic tool for controlling gene transcription, determining gene functions and other uses. herein, we describe our attempts to create several inducible systems based on a cumate or a resorcinol switch, a hammerhead ribozyme, the laci repressor, and isopropyl beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside (iptg). we successfully developed a new cumate (p-isopropylbenzoic acid)-inducible gene switch in actinobacteria that is based on the cymr regulator, the operator sequence (cmt) from the pseudomonas putida cumate degradation operon and p21 synthetic promoter. resorcinol-inducible expression system is also functional and is composed of the rolr regulator and the pa3 promoter fused with the operator (rolo) from the corynebacterium glutamicum resorcinol catabolic operon. using the gusa (beta-glucuronidase) gene  as a reporter, we showed that the newly generated expression systems are tightly  regulated and hyper-inducible. the activity of the uninduced promoters is negligible in both cases. whereas the induction factor reaches 45 for streptomyces albus in the case of cumate switch and 33 in the case of resorcinol  toggle. the systems are also dose-dependent, which allows the modulation of gene  expression even from a single promoter. in addition, the cumate system is versatile, given that it is functional in different actinomycetes. finally, these systems are nontoxic and inexpensive, as these are characteristics of cumate and  resorcinol, and they are easy to use because inducers are water-soluble and easily penetrate cells. therefore, the p21-cmt-cymr and pa3-rolo-rolr systems are powerful tools for engineering actinobacteria.

TI  == oxidative stress response in pseudomonas putida.
AB  == pseudomonas putida is widely distributed in nature and is capable of degrading various organic compounds due to its high metabolic versatility. the survival capacity of p. putida stems from its frequent exposure to various endogenous and  exogenous oxidative stresses. oxidative stress is an unavoidable consequence of interactions with various reactive oxygen species (ros)-inducing agents existing  in various niches. ros could facilitate the evolution of bacteria by mutating genomes. aerobic bacteria maintain defense mechanisms against oxidative stress throughout their evolution. to overcome the detrimental effects of oxidative stress, p. putida has developed defensive cellular systems involving induction of stress-sensing proteins and detoxification enzymes as well as regulation of oxidative stress response networks. genetic responses to oxidative stress in p. putida differ markedly from those observed in escherichia coli and salmonella spp. two major redox-sensing transcriptional regulators, soxr and oxyr, are present and functional in the genome of p. putida. however, the novel regulators  finr and hexr control many genes belonging to the e. coli soxr regulon. oxidative stress can be generated by exposure to antibiotics, and iron homeostasis in p. putida is crucial for bacterial cell survival during treatment with antibiotics.  this review highlights and summarizes current knowledge of oxidative stress in p. putida, as a model soil bacterium, together with recent studies from molecular genetics perspectives.

TI  == a stress-responsive escherichia coli protein, cysq is a highly effective solubility enhancer for aggregation-prone heterologous proteins.
AB  == when used as an n-terminal fusion expression partner, the escherichia coli stress-responsive protein, cysq dramatically increased the cytoplasmic solubility of various aggregation-prone heterologous proteins: pseudomonas putida cutinase (cut), human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (hg-csf), human ferritin light chain (hftn-l), arginine deiminase (adi), human interleukin-2 (il2), human activation induced cytidine deaminase (aid), and deletion mutant of human glutamate decarboxylase (gad448-585). as compared with well-known fusion tags such as glutathione-s-transferase (gst) and maltose-binding protein (mbp), the performance of cysq as solubility enhancer was evidently better than gst and was  similar to or better than mbp for the seven heterologous proteins above. this is  likely due to the intrinsic ability of cysq to form its native conformation, probably promoting the binding of molecular chaperones during the folding of cysq-fusion protein. when used as a substrate, p-nitrophenyl butyrate (pnb) was successfully hydrolyzed to p-nitrophenol by cysq-cut fusion mutant. even after cysq was removed, the solubility of hftn-l and hg-csf, the secondary structure of hg-csf, and self-assembly activity of hftn-l were successfully maintained. conclusively, it seems that cysq is a highly effective solubility enhancer and fusion expression partner for the production of a variety of bio-active recombinant proteins.

TI  == continuous-flow extractive desorption electrospray ionization coupled to normal phase separations and for direct lipid analysis from cell extracts.
AB  == normal phase liquid chromatography is a common mode for chiral separations. many  chiral amines are used as drugs or are important intermediates for drug synthesis. electrospray ionization mass spectrometry is well known for its high sensitivity. however, when using normal phase liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization is hampered by the poor ionization efficiency of analytes from organic eluents. continuous-flow extractive desorption electrospray ionization, which introduces the eluents through a hypodermic needle into the electrospray plume is demonstrated here for its success to interface normal phase liquid chromatography to mass spectrometry detection. such an approach was shown to be as or more sensitive than ultraviolet detection for a selected set of aromatic amine-functionalized enantiomers. also demonstrated is the direct infusion of cell extracts to monitor phospholipids from three different bacterial cells. despite their presence in non-electrospray-ionization-friendly extraction solvents, continuous-flow extractive desorption electrospray ionization enabled the sensitive detection of phospholipids and the ability to tune ion forms through incorporation of different spray modifiers.

TI  == fructose 1-phosphate is the one and only physiological effector of the cra (frur) regulator of pseudomonas putida.
AB  == fructose-1-phosphate (f1p) is the preferred effector of the catabolite repressor/activator (cra) protein of the soil bacterium pseudomonas putida but its ability to bind other metabolic intermediates in vivo is unclear. the cra protein of this microorganism (cra(pp)) was submitted to mobility shift assays with target dna sequences (the pfrub promoter) and candidate effectors fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (fbp), glucose 6-phosphate (g6p), and fructose-6-phosphate (f6p). 1 mm f1p was sufficient to release most of the cra protein from its operators but more than 10 mm of fbp or g6p was required to free the same complex. however, isothermal titration microcalorimetry failed to expose any specific interaction between cra(pp) and fbp or g6p. to solve this paradox, transcriptional activity of a pfrub-lacz fusion was measured in wild-type and deltafrub cells growing on substrates that change the intracellular concentrations of f1p and fbp. the data indicated that pfrub activity was stimulated by fructose but not by glucose or succinate. this suggested that cra(pp) represses expression in vivo of the cognate frubka operon in a fashion dependent just on f1p, ruling out any other physiological effector. molecular docking and dynamic simulations of the cra-agonist interaction indicated that both metabolites can bind the repressor, but the breach in the relative affinity  of cra(pp) for f1p vs fbp is three orders of magnitude larger than the equivalent distance in the escherichia coli protein. this assigns the cra protein of p. putida the sole role of transducing the presence of fructose in the medium into a variety of direct and indirect physiological responses.

TI  == cultivation to improve in vivo solubility of overexpressed arginine deiminases in escherichia coli and the enzyme characteristics.
AB  == background: overexpression of foreign genes in escherichia coli cells is an efficient means to obtain recombinant proteins. the technique is, however, often  hampered by misfolding, degradation, aggregation and formation in inclusion bodies of products. results: in this study, we reported that in vivo solubility of overexpressed arginine deiminases (adi) improved by changing the cultivation conditions. adi is enzymes that convert l-arginine to l-citrulline. after codon optimization, we synthesized the adi gene of pseudomonas putida and constructed it for overexpression in e. coli cells. the radi products were mainly in inclusion body forms. we performed a series of optimization to enhance solubility of the protein. co-expression with the groes-groel chaperone team increased approximately 5-fold of the radi activity. in addition the combination of l-arginine and d-glucose in the luria-bertani (lb) growth medium further increased the total activity to about 15 times. separate l-arginine and d-glucose or the addition of other saccharides or amino acids had no such effects. the solubilization effects of the combination of l-arginine and d-glucose were further confirmed in the overexpression of another adi from listeria welshimeri.  the enzymatic and conversion characteristics of the radi products were further determined. conclusions: combined addition of l-arginine and d-glucose in the lb  medium significantly improved in vivo solubility of radi proteins. the present study suggested a new strategy to increase the solubilization of overexpressed recombinant proteins in e. coli cells.

TI  == assessment of planctomycetes cell viability after pollutants exposure.
AB  == in this study, the growth of six different planctomycetes, a particular ubiquitous bacterial phylum, was assessed after exposure to pollutants. in addition and for comparative purposes, pseudomonas putida, escherichia coli and vibrio anguillarum were tested. each microorganism was exposed to several concentrations of 21 different pollutants. after exposure, bacteria were cultivated using the drop plate method. in general, the strains exhibited a great variation of sensitivity to pollutants in the order: v. anguillarum > planctomycetes > p. putida > e. coli. e. coli showed resistance to all pollutants tested, with the exception of phenol and sodium azide. copper, ridomil(r) (fungicide), hydrazine and phenol were the most toxic pollutants. planctomycetes  were resistant to extremely high concentrations of nitrate, nitrite and ammonium  but they were the only bacteria sensitive to previcur n(r) (fungicide). sodium azide affected the growth on plates of e. coli, p. putida and v. anguillarum, but not of planctomycetes. however, this compound affected planctomycetes cell respiration but with less impact than in the aforementioned bacteria. our results provide evidence for a diverse response of bacteria towards pollutants, which may influence the structuring of microbial communities in ecosystems under stress, and provide new insights on the ecophysiology of planctomycetes.

TI  == occurrence of multi-antibiotic resistant pseudomonas spp. in drinking water produced from karstic hydrosystems.
AB  == aquatic environments could play a role in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes by enabling antibiotic-resistant bacteria transferred through wastewater inputs to connect with autochthonous bacteria. consequently, drinking water could be a potential pathway to humans and animals for antibiotic resistance genes. the aim of this study was to investigate occurrences of escherichia coli and pseudomonas spp. in drinking water produced from a karst, a vulnerable aquifer with frequent increases in water turbidity after rainfall events and run-offs. water samples were collected throughout the system from the karstic springs to the drinking water tap during three non-turbid periods and two turbid events. e.  coli densities in the springs were 10- to 1000-fold higher during the turbid events than during the non-turbid periods, indicating that, with increased turbidity, surface water had entered the karstic system and contaminated the spring water. however, no e. coli were isolated in the drinking water. in contrast, pseudomonas spp. were isolated from the drinking water only during turbid events, while the densities in the springs were from 10- to 100-fold higher than in the non-turbid periods. all the 580 pseudomonas spp. isolates obtained from the sampling periods were resistant (to between 1 and 10 antibiotics), with similar resistance patterns. among all the pseudomonas isolated throughout the drinking water production system, between 32% and 86% carried the major resistance pattern: ticarcillin, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, cefsulodin, and/or aztreonam, and/or sulfamethoxazol-trimethoprim, and/or fosfomycin. finally, 8 pseudomonas spp. isolates, related to the pseudomonas putida and pseudomonas fluorescens species, were isolated from the drinking water. thus, pseudomonas could be involved in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance via drinking water during critical periods.

TI  == atr-ftir spectroscopic evidence for biomolecular phosphorus and carboxyl groups facilitating bacterial adhesion to iron oxides.
AB  == attenuated total reflectance (atr) fourier transform infrared (ftir) spectroscopy has been used to probe the binding of bacteria to hematite (alpha-fe2o3) and goethite (alpha-feooh). in situ atr-ftir experiments with bacteria (pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli), mixed amino acids, polypeptide extracts, deoxyribonucleic acid (dna), and a suite of model compounds were conducted. these compounds represent carboxyl, catecholate, amide, and phosphate  groups present in siderophores, amino acids, polysaccharides, phospholipids, and  dna. due in part to the ubiquitous presence of carboxyl groups in biomolecules, numerous ir peaks corresponding to outer-sphere or unbound (1400 cm(-1)) and inner-sphere (1310-1320 cm(-1)) coordinated carboxyl groups are noted following reaction of bacteria and biomolecules with alpha-fe2o3 and alpha-feooh. however,  the data also reveal that the presence of low-level amounts (i.e., 0.45-0.79%) of biomolecular phosphorous groups result in strong ir bands at approximately 1043 cm(-1), corresponding to inner-sphere fe-o-p bonds, underscoring the importance of bacteria associated p-containing groups in biomolecule and cell adhesion. spectral comparisons also reveal slightly greater p-o-fe contributions for bacteria (pseudomonad, e. coli) deposited on alpha-feooh, as compared to alpha-fe2o3. this data demonstrates that slight differences in bacterial adhesion to fe oxides can be attributed to bacterial species and fe-oxide minerals. however, more importantly, the strong binding affinity of phosphate in all bacteria samples to both fe-oxides results in the formation of inner-sphere fe-o-p bonds, signifying the critical role of biomolecular p in the initiation of bacterial adhesion.

TI  == reaction and catalyst engineering to exploit kinetically controlled whole-cell multistep biocatalysis for terminal fame oxyfunctionalization.
AB  == the oxyfunctionalization of unactivated c-h bonds can selectively and efficiently be catalyzed by oxygenase-containing whole-cell biocatalysts. recombinant escherichia coli w3110 containing the alkane monooxygenase alkbgt and the outer membrane protein alkl from pseudomonas putida gpo1 have been shown to efficiently catalyze the terminal oxyfunctionalization of renewable fatty acid methyl esters  yielding bifunctional products of interest for polymer synthesis. in this study,  alkbgtl-containing e. coli w3110 is shown to catalyze the multistep conversion of dodecanoic acid methyl ester (dame) via terminal alcohol and aldehyde to the acid, exhibiting michaelis-menten-type kinetics for each reaction step. in two-liquid phase biotransformations, the product formation pattern was found to be controlled by dame availability. supplying dame as bulk organic phase led to accumulation of the terminal alcohol as the predominant product. limiting dame availability via application of bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (behp) as organic carrier solvent enabled almost exclusive acid accumulation. furthermore, utilization of behp enhanced catalyst stability by reducing toxic effects of substrate and products. a further shift towards the overoxidized products was achieved by co-expression of the gene encoding the alcohol dehydrogenase alkj, which was shown to catalyze efficient and irreversible alcohol to aldehyde oxidation in vivo. with dame as organic phase, the aldehyde accumulated as main product using resting cells containing alkbgt, alkl, as well as alkj. this study  highlights the versatility of whole-cell biocatalysis for synthesis of industrially relevant bifunctional building blocks and demonstrates how integrated reaction and catalyst engineering can be implemented to control product formation patterns in biocatalytic multistep reactions.

AB  == chemoselective reduction of activated carbon-carbon double bond in conjugated nitroalkenes was achieved using escherichia coli bl21(de3) whole cells. nine different substrates have been used furnishing the reduced products in moderate to good yields. 1-nitro-4-phenyl-1,3-butadiene and (2-nitro-1-propenyl)benzene were successfully biotransformed with corresponding product yields of 54% and 45% respectively. using this simple and environmentally friendly system 2-(2-nitropropyl)pyridine and 2-(2-nitropropyl)naphthalene were synthesized and characterized for the first time. high substrate conversion efficiency was coupled with low enantioselectivity, however 29% enantiomeric excess was detected in the case of 2-(2-nitropropyl)pyridine. it was shown that electronic properties of the aromatic ring, which affected polarity of the double bond, were not highly influential factors in the reduction process, but the presence of the nitro functionality was essential for the reaction to proceed. 1-phenyl-4-nitro-1,3-butadiene could not be biotransformed by whole cells of pseudomonas putida kt2440 or bacillus subtilis 168 while it was successfully reduced by e. coli dh5alpha but with lower efficiency in comparison to e. coli bl21(de3). knockout mutant affected in nema gene coding for n-ethylmaleimide reductase (bl21deltanema) could still catalyze bioreductions suggesting multiple  active reductases within e. coli bl21(de3) biocatalyst. the described biocatalytic reduction of substituted nitroalkenes provides an efficient route for the preparation of the corresponding nitroalkanes and introduces the new application of the strain traditionally utilized for recombinant protein expression.

TI  == enhancement of thermo-stability and product tolerance of pseudomonas putida nitrile hydratase by fusing with self-assembling peptide.
AB  == self-assembling amphipathic peptides (saps) are the peptides that can spontaneously assemble into ordered nanostructures. it has been reported that the attachment of saps to the n- or c-terminus of an enzyme can benefit the thermo-stability of the enzyme. here, we discovered that the thermo-stability and product tolerance of nitrile hydratase (nhase) were enhanced by fusing with two of the saps (eak16 and elk16). when the elk16 was fused to the n-terminus of beta-subunit, the resultant nhase (sap-nhase-2) became an active inclusion body;  eak16 fused nhase in the n-terminus of beta-subunit (sap-nhase-1) and elk16 fused nhase in the c-terminus of beta-subunit (sap-nhase-10) did not affect nhase solubility. compared with the deactivation of the wild-type nhase after 30 min incubation at 50 degrees c, sap-nhase-1, sap-nhase-2 and sap-nhase-10 retained 45%, 30% and 50% activity; after treatment in the buffer containing 10% acrylamide, the wild-type retained 30% activity, while sap-nhase-1, sap-nhase-2 and sap-nhase-10 retained 52%, 42% and 55% activity. these sap-nhases with enhanced thermo-stability and product tolerance would be helpful for further industrial applications of the nhase.

TI  == engineering cellular robustness of microbes by introducing the groesl chaperonins from extremophilic bacteria.
AB  == the cellular robustness is a big concern for efficient microbial production of biofuels and biochemicals. in this study, the groesl genes from extremophilic bacteria were found to serve as transplantable stress-response elements to improve diverse types of stress-tolerances of other microbes. by overexpressing the groesl from the solvent-tolerant pseudomonas putida in escherichia coli, its  thermo-tolerance and ethanol-tolerance were significantly increased. meanwhile, the groesl from the thermophilic thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis endowed clostridium acetobutylicum with improved corn cob hydrolysates (cch)-tolerance as well as elevated butanol productivity. the chaperonins groesl have been widely considered as cellular stress-response proteins and overexpression of native groesl has been proven to improve cellular tolerances facing various stresses. here we found that the groesl genes from extremophilic bacteria were superior to  the native ones, possibly because they have adapted to the environmental stresses during long-term natural evolution. moreover, our results also revealed that different extreme groesl genes performed quite different in different microbes. thus the relation and compatibility between the extremophiles and the host must be considered for selection of the proper groesl for engineering microbial robustness.

TI  == a tricistronic heat shock operon is important for stress tolerance of pseudomonas putida and conserved in many environmental bacteria.
AB  == small heat shock proteins (shsps) including the well-studied ibpa protein from escherichia coli are molecular chaperones that bind to non-native proteins and prevent them from aggregation. we discovered an entirely unexplored tricistronic  small heat shock gene cluster in pseudomonas putida. the genes pp3314, pp3313 and pp3312 (renamed to hspx, hspy and hspz respectively) are transcribed in a single  transcript. in addition to sigma(32) -dependent transcriptional control, translation of the first and second gene of the operon is controlled by rna thermometers with novel architectures. biochemical analysis of hspy, hspz and p.  putida ibpa demonstrated that they assemble into homo-oligomers of different sizes whose quaternary structures alter in a temperature-dependent manner. ibpa and hspy are able to prevent the model substrate citrate synthase from thermal aggregation in vitro. increased stress sensitivity of a p. putida strain lacking  hspx, hspy and hspz revealed an important role of these shsps in stress adaptation. the hspxyz operon is conserved among metabolically related bacteria that live in hostile environments including polluted soils. this heat shock operon might act as a protective system to promote survival in such ecological niches.

TI  == expanding ester biosynthesis in escherichia coli.
AB  == to expand the capabilities of whole-cell biocatalysis, we have engineered escherichia coli to produce various esters. the alcohol o-acyltransferase (atf) class of enzyme uses acyl-coa units for ester formation. the release of free coa  upon esterification with an alcohol provides the free energy to facilitate ester  formation. the diversity of coa molecules found in nature in combination with various alcohol biosynthetic pathways allows for the biosynthesis of a multitude  of esters. small to medium volatile esters have extensive applications in the flavor, fragrance, cosmetic, solvent, paint and coating industries. the present work enables the production of these compounds by designing several ester pathways in e. coli. the engineered pathways generated acetate esters of ethyl, propyl, isobutyl, 2-methyl-1-butyl, 3-methyl-1-butyl and 2-phenylethyl alcohols.  in particular, we achieved high-level production of isobutyl acetate from glucose (17.2 g l(-1)). this strategy was expanded to realize pathways for tetradecyl acetate and several isobutyrate esters.

TI  == robustness of pseudomonas putida kt2440 as a host for ethanol biosynthesis.
AB  == expansion of the burgeoning biofuels agenda involves not only the design of suitable genetic and metabolic devices but also their deployment into suitable hosts that can endure the stress brought about by the products themselves. the microorganisms that are easiest to genetically manipulate for these endeavors (e.g. escherichia coli) are often afflicted by an undesirable sensitivity to the  very product that they are engineered to synthesize. in this context, we have examined the resistance to the stress arising from ethanol synthesis and/or its addition to cultures of recombinant pseudomonas putida, using as a benchmark the  same trait in an e. coli strain. to this end, ethanologenic strains of these two  species were constructed by functionally expressing pdc (pyruvate decarboxylase)  and adhb (alcohol dehydrogenase) from zymomonas mobilis. recombinants were compared under anoxic conditions as ethanol producers, and cell survival, stress  resistance, and phenotypic stability were quantified in each case. p. putida consistently outperformed e. coli in every ethanol tolerance test conducted - whether the alcohol was produced endogenously or added exogenously. these results highlight the value of this bacterium as a microbial cell factory for the production of biofuels owing to its naturally pre-evolved ability to withstand different kinds of chemical stresses.

TI  == biochemical analysis of recombinant alkj from pseudomonas putida reveals a membrane-associated, flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent dehydrogenase suitable for the biosynthetic production of aliphatic aldehydes.
AB  == the noncanonical alcohol dehydrogenase alkj is encoded on the alkane-metabolizing alk operon of the mesophilic bacterium pseudomonas putida gpo1. to gain insight into the enzymology of alkj, we have produced the recombinant protein in escherichia coli and purified it to homogeneity using his6 tag affinity and size  exclusion chromatography (sec). despite synthesis in the cytoplasm, alkj was associated with the bacterial cell membrane, and solubilization with n-dodecyl-beta-d-maltoside was necessary to liberate the enzyme. sec and spectrophotometric analysis revealed a dimeric quaternary structure with stoichiometrically bound reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (fadh2). the holoenzyme showed thermal denaturation at moderate temperatures around 35 degrees c, according to both activity assay and temperature-dependent circular dichroism  spectroscopy. the tightly bound coenzyme was released only upon denaturation with sds or treatment with urea-kbr and, after air oxidation, exhibited the characteristic absorption spectrum of fad. the enzymatic activity of purified alkj for 1-butanol, 1-hexanol, and 1-octanol as well as the n-alkanol derivative  omega-hydroxy lauric acid methyl ester (hlame) was quantified in the presence of  the artificial electron acceptors phenazine methosulfate (pms) and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (dcpip), indicating broad substrate specificity with the lowest activity on the shortest alcohol, 1-butanol. furthermore, alkj was able to accept as cosubstrates/oxidants the ubiquinone derivatives q0 and q1, also in conjunction with cytochrome c, which suggests coupling to the bacterial respiratory chain of this membrane-associated enzyme in its physiological environment. using gas chromatographic analysis, we demonstrated specific biocatalytic conversion by alkj of the substrate hlame to the industrially relevant aldehyde, thus enabling the biotechnological production of 12-amino lauric acid methyl ester via subsequent enzymatic transamination.

TI  == improving kinetic or thermodynamic stability of an azoreductase by directed evolution.
AB  == protein stability arises from a combination of factors which are often difficult  to rationalise. therefore its improvement is better addressed through directed evolution than by rational design approaches. in this study, five rounds of mutagenesis/recombination followed by high-throughput screening ( approximately 10,000 clones) yielded the hit 1b6 showing a 300-fold higher half life at 50 degrees c than that exhibited by the homodimeric wild type ppazor azoreductase from pseudomonas putida met94. the characterization using fluorescence, calorimetry and light scattering shows that 1b6 has a folded state slightly less  stable than the wild type (with lower melting and optimal temperatures) but in contrast is more resistant to irreversible denaturation. the superior kinetic stability of 1b6 variant was therefore related to an increased resistance of the  unfolded monomers to aggregation through the introduction of mutations that disturbed hydrophobic patches and increased the surface net charge of the protein. variants 2a1 and 2a1-y179h with increased thermodynamic stability (10 to 20 degrees c higher melting temperature than wild type) were also examined showing the distinctive nature of mutations that lead to improved structural robustness: these occur in residues that are mostly involved in strengthening the solvent-exposed loops or the inter-dimer interactions of the folded state.

AB  == the expression of sigma(54)-dependent pseudomonas putida pu promoter is activated by xylr activator when cells are exposed to a variety of aromatic inducers. in this study, the transcriptional activation of the p. putida pu promoter was recreated in the heterologous host escherichia coli. here we show that the camp receptor protein (crp), a well-known carbon utilization regulator, had an inhibitory effect on the expression of pu promoter in a camp-dependent manner. the inhibitory effect was not activator specific. in vivo kmno4 and dms footprinting analysis indicated that crp-camp poised the rna polymerase at pu promoter, inhibiting the isomerization step of the transcription initiation even  in the presence of an activator. therefore, the presence of pts-sugar, which eliminates camp, could activate the poised rna polymerase at pu promoter to transcribe. moreover, the activation region 1 (ar1) of crp, which interacts directly with the alphactd (c-terminal domain of alpha-subunit) of rna polymerase, was found essential for the crp-mediated inhibition at pu promoter. a model for the above observations is discussed.

AB  == biofilms represent a substantial problem in the food industry, with food spoilage, equipment failure, and public health aspects to consider. besides, biofilms may be a hot spot for plasmid transfer, by which antibiotic resistance can be disseminated to potential foodborne pathogens. this study investigated biomass and plasmid transfer in dual-species (pseudomonas putida and escherichia  coli) biofilm models relevant to the food industry. two different configurations  (flow-through and drip-flow) and two different inoculation procedures (donor-recipient and recipient-donor) were tested. the drip-flow configuration integrated stainless steel coupons in the setup while the flow-through configuration included a glass flow cell and silicone tubing. the highest biomass density [10 log (cells cm-(2))] was obtained in the silicone tubing when first the recipient strain was inoculated. high plasmid transfer ratios, up to 1/10 (transconjugants/total bacteria), were found. depending on the order of inoculation, a difference in transfer efficiency between the biofilm models could be found. the ease by which the multiresistance plasmid was transferred highlights the importance of biofilms in the food industry as hot spots for the acquisition of multiresistance plasmids. this can impede the treatment of foodborne illnesses if pathogens acquire this multiresistance in or from the biofilm.

TI  == expression, purification and characterization of the proline dehydrogenase domain of puta from pseudomonas putida pos-f84.
AB  == the objective of the present work was to express a truncated form of pseudomonas  putida puta that shows proline dehydrogenase (prodh) activity. the puta gene encoding prodh enzyme was cloned into pet23a vector and expressed in escherichia  coli strain bl-21 (de3) plyss. the recombinant p. putida enzyme was biochemically characterized and its three dimensional structure was also predicted. prodh encoding sequence showed an open reading frame of 1,035-bp encoding a 345 amino acid residues polypeptide chain. purified his-tagged enzyme gave a single band with a molecular mass of 40 kda on sds-page. the molecular mass of the isolated enzyme was found to be about 40 kda by gel filtration. this suggested that the enzyme of interest consists of one subunit. the k m and v max values of recombinant p. putida prodh were estimated to be 31 mm and 132 mumol/min, respectively. the optimum ph and temperature for the catalytic activity of the enzyme was about ph 8.5 and 30 degrees c. the modeling analysis of the three dimensional structure elucidated that ser-165, lys-195 and ala-252 were key residues for the prodh activity. this study provides data on the cloning, sequencing and recombinant expression of puta prodh domain from p. putida pos-f84.

TI  == pcr-based amplification and heterologous expression of pseudomonas alcohol dehydrogenase genes from the soil metagenome for biocatalysis.
AB  == the amplification of useful genes from metagenomes offers great biotechnological  potential. we employed this approach to isolate alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) genes from pseudomonas to aid in the synthesis of optically pure alcohols from various  ketones. a pcr primer combination synthesized by reference to the adh sequences of known pseudomonas genes was used to amplify full-length adh genes directly from 17 samples of dna extracted from soil. three such adh preparations were used to construct escherichia coli plasmid libraries. of the approximately 2800 colonies obtained, 240 putative adh-positive clones were identified by colony-pcr. next, 23 functional adh genes named using the descriptors hbadh and hpadh were analyzed. the adh genes obtained via this metagenomic approach varied  in their dna and amino acid sequences. expression of the gene products in e. coli indicated varying substrate specificity. two representative genes, hbadh-1 and hpadh-24, expressed in e. coli and pseudomonas putida, respectively, were purified and characterized in detail. the enzyme products of these genes were confirmed to be useful for producing anti-prelog chiral alcohols.

TI  == virtual screening of mandelate racemase mutants with enhanced activity based on binding energy in the transition state.
AB  == mandelate racemase (mr) is a promising candidate for the dynamic kinetic resolution of racemates. however, the poor activity of mr towards most of its non-natural substrates limits its widespread application. in this work, a virtual screening method based on the binding energy in the transition state was established to assist in the screening of mr mutants with enhanced catalytic efficiency. using r-3-chloromandelic acid as a model substrate, a total of 53 mutants were constructed based on rational design in the two rounds of screening. the number of mutants for experimental validation was brought down to 17 by the virtual screening method, among which 14 variants turned out to possess improved  catalytic efficiency. the variant v26i/y54v showed 5.2-fold higher catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/k(m)) towards r-3-chloromandelic acid than that observed for the wild-type enzyme. using this strategy, mutants were successfully obtained for two other substrates, r-mandelamide and r-2-naphthylglycolate (v26i and v29l, respectively), both with a 2-fold improvement in catalytic efficiency. these results demonstrated that this method could effectively predict the trend of mutational effects on catalysis. analysis from the energetic and structural assays indicated that the enhanced interactions between the active sites and the  substrate in the transition state led to improved catalytic efficiency. it was concluded that this virtual screening method based on the binding energy in the transition state was beneficial in enzyme rational redesign and helped to better  understand the catalytic properties of the enzyme.

TI  == interspecies signalling: pseudomonas putida efflux pump ttgghi is activated by indole to increase antibiotic resistance.
AB  == in gram-negative bacteria, multidrug efflux pumps are responsible for the extrusion of chemicals that are deleterious for growth. some of these efflux pumps are induced by endogenously produced effectors, while abiotic or biotic signals induce the expression of other efflux pumps. in pseudomonas putida, the ttgabc efflux pump is the main antibiotic extrusion system that respond to exogenous antibiotics through the modulation of the expression of this operon mediated by ttgr. the plasmid-encoded ttgghi efflux pump in p. putida plays a minor role in antibiotic resistance in the parental strain; however, its role is  critical in isogenic backgrounds deficient in ttgabc. expression of ttgghi is repressed by the ttgv regulator that recognizes indole as an effector, although p. putida does not produce indole itself. because indole is not produced by pseudomonas, the indole-dependent antibiotic resistance seems to be part of an antibiotic resistance programme at the community level. pseudomonas putida recognizes indole added to the medium or produced by escherichia coli in mixed microbial communities. transcriptomic analyses revealed that the indole-specific  response involves activation of 43 genes and repression of 23 genes. indole enhances not only the expression of the ttgghi pump but also a set of genes involved in iron homeostasis, as well as genes for amino acid catabolism. in a ttgabc-deficient p. putida, background ampicillin and other bactericidal compounds lead to cell death. co-culture of e. coli and p. putida deltattgabc allowed growth of the p. putida mutant in the presence of ampicillin because of induction of the indole-dependent efflux pump.

TI  == biochemical and structural analysis of rraa proteins to decipher their relationships with 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-oxoglutarate/4-carboxy-4-hydroxy-2-oxoadipate aldolases.
AB  == 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-oxoglutarate (hmg)/4-carboxy-4-hydroxy-2-oxoadipate (cha) aldolases are class ii (divalent metal ion dependent) pyruvate aldolases from the meta cleavage pathways of protocatechuate and gallate. the enzyme from pseudomonas putida f1 is structurally similar to a group of proteins termed regulators of rnase e activity a (rraa) that bind to the regulatory domain of rnase e and inhibit the ribonuclease activity in certain bacteria. analysis of homologous rraa-like proteins from varying species revealed that they share sequence conservation within the active site of hmg/cha aldolase. in particular,  the p. putida f1 hmg/cha aldolase has a d-x20-r-d motif, whereas a g-x20-r-d-x2-e/d motif is observed in the structures of the rraa-like proteins from thermus thermophilus hb8 (ttrraa) and saccharomyces cerevisiae s288c (yer010cp) that may support metal binding. ttrraa and yer010cp were found to contain hmg aldolase and oxaloacetate decarboxylase activities. similar to the p. putida f1 hmg/cha aldolase, both ttrraa and yer010cp enzymes required divalent metal ions for activity and were competitively inhibited by oxalate, a pyruvate enolate analogue, suggesting a common mechanism among the enzymes. the rraa from  escherichia coli (ecrraa) lacked detectable c-c lyase activity. upon restoration  of the g-x20-r-d-x2-e/d motif, by site-specific mutagenesis, the ecrraa variant was able to catalyze oxaloacetate decarboxylation. sequence analysis of rraa-like gene products found across all the domains of life revealed conservation of the metal binding motifs that can likely support a divalent metal ion-dependent enzyme reaction either in addition to or in place of the putative rraa function.

TI  == identification of 3-sulfinopropionyl coenzyme a (coa) desulfinases within the acyl-coa dehydrogenase superfamily.
AB  == in a previous study, the essential role of 3-sulfinopropionyl coenzyme a (3sp-coa) desulfinase acyl-coa dehydrogenase (acd) in advenella mimigardefordensis strain dpn7(t) (acddpn7) during degradation of 3,3'-dithiodipropionic acid (dtdp) was elucidated. dtdp is a sulfur-containing precursor substrate for biosynthesis of polythioesters (ptes). acddpn7 showed high amino acid sequence similarity to acyl-coa dehydrogenases but was unable to  catalyze a dehydrogenation reaction. hence, it was investigated in the present study whether 3sp-coa desulfinase activity is an uncommon or a widespread property within the acyl-coa dehydrogenase superfamily. therefore, proteins of the acyl-coa dehydrogenase superfamily from advenella kashmirensis wt001, bacillus cereus dsm31, cupriavidus necator n-1, escherichia coli bl21, pseudomonas putida kt2440, burkholderia xenovorans lb400, ralstonia eutropha h16, variovorax paradoxus b4, variovorax paradoxus s110, and variovorax paradoxus tbea6 were expressed in e. coli strains. all purified acyl-coa dehydrogenases appeared as homotetramers, as revealed by size exclusion chromatography. acds110, acdb4, acdh16, and acdkt2440 were able to dehydrogenate isobutyryl-coa. acdkt2440 additionally dehydrogenated butyryl-coa and valeryl-coa, whereas acddsm31 dehydrogenated only butyryl-coa and valeryl-coa. no dehydrogenation reactions were observed with propionyl-coa, isovaleryl-coa, succinyl-coa, and glutaryl-coa  for any of the investigated acyl-coa dehydrogenases. only acdtbea6, acdn-1, and acdlb400 desulfinated 3sp-coa and were thus identified as 3sp-coa desulfinases within the acyl-coa dehydrogenase family, although none of these three acds dehydrogenated any of the tested acyl-coa thioesters. no appropriate substrates were identified for acdbl21 and acdwt001. spectrophotometric assays provided apparent km and vmax values for active substrates and indicated the applicability of phylogenetic analyses to predict the substrate range of uncharacterized acyl-coa dehydrogenases. furthermore, c. necator n-1 was found to utilize 3sp as  the sole source of carbon and energy.

TI  == periplasmic glucose-binding protein from pseudomonas putida csv86--identification of the glucose-binding pocket by homology-model-guided site-specific mutagenesis.
AB  == glucose transport in pseudomonas putida csv86 is mediated via a periplasmic glucose-binding protein (gbp)-dependent putative glucose abc transporter. here we describe a homology model and functional characterization of gbp from csv86 (ppgbp). a whole-cell [(14)c]-glucose uptake study revealed that glucose is transported by the high-affinity intracellular phosphorylative pathway. ppgbp was cloned, over-expressed in escherichia coli and purified to apparent homogeneity.  the purified ppgbps from both e. coli and csv86 were found to be specific for glucose. a homology model of ppgbp was constructed that resembles the class ii family of periplasmic binding proteins. the model showed highest structural similarity to gbp of thermus thermophilus (ttgbp, rmsd 0.64 a). structural analysis and molecular docking studies predicted w35, w36, e41, k92, k339 and h379 of ppgbp as putative glucose-binding residues. alanine substitution of these residues resulted in significantly reduced [(14)c]-glucose binding activity. analysis of the operonic arrangement and structural comparative studies suggested that ppgbp and ttgbp probably originated from a common ancestor. structural adaptations that inhibit binding of di- or trisaccharides at the glucose-binding  pocket of ppgbp were also identified.

TI  == functional assembly of camphor converting two-component baeyer-villiger monooxygenases with a flavin reductase from e. coli.
AB  == the major limitation in the synthetic application of two-component baeyer-villiger monooxygenases was addressed by identifying the 28-kda flavin-reductase fre from escherichia coli as a suitable supplier of reduced fmn  for these enzymes. coexpression of fre with either 2,5- or 3,6-diketocamphane monooxygenase from pseudomonas putida ncimb 10007 significantly enhanced the conversion of camphor and norcamphor serving as representative ketones. with purified enzymes, full conversion was achieved, while only slight amounts of product were formed in the absence of this flavin reductase. fusion of the genes  of fre and dkcmos into single open reading frame constructs resulted in unstable  proteins exhibiting flavin reducing, but poor oxygenating activity, which led to  overall decreased conversion of camphor.

TI  == production of medium chain length fatty alcohols from glucose in escherichia coli.
AB  == metabolic engineering offers the opportunity to produce a wide range of commodity chemicals that are currently derived from petroleum or other non-renewable resources. microbial synthesis of fatty alcohols is an attractive process because it can control the distribution of chain lengths and utilize low cost fermentation substrates. specifically, primary alcohols with chain lengths of 12  to 14 carbons have many uses in the production of detergents, surfactants, and personal care products. the current challenge is to produce these compounds at titers and yields that would make them economically competitive. here, we demonstrate a metabolic engineering strategy for producing fatty alcohols from glucose. to produce a high level of 1-dodecanol and 1-tetradecanol, an acyl-acp thioesterase (bte), an acyl-coa ligase (fadd), and an acyl-coa/aldehyde reductase (maacr) were overexpressed in an engineered strain of escherichia coli. yields were improved by balancing expression levels of each gene, using a fed-batch cultivation strategy, and adding a solvent to the culture for extracting the product from cells. using these strategies, a titer of over 1.6 g/l fatty alcohol with a yield of over 0.13 g fatty alcohol/g carbon source was achieved. these are the highest reported yield of fatty alcohols produced from glucose in e. coli.

TI  == selective steroid oxyfunctionalisation by cyp154c5, a bacterial cytochrome p450.
AB  == background: cytochrome p450 monooxygenases--able to regio- and stereoselectively  hydroxylate non-activated carbon atoms--are important enzymes for the synthesis of valuable intermediates in the production of steroid hormones in the pharmaceutical industry. however, up to now only a few bacterial enzymes able to  hydroxylate steroids have been reported. cyp154c5 from nocardia farcinica ifm 10152, a bacterial p450 monooxygenase, was previously shown to convert testosterone to 16alpha-hydroxytestosterone. since the hydroxylation at 16alpha-position is of special interest for the pharmaceutical industry, we have  studied this enzyme in more detail to investigate its activity and selectivity in bioconversions of further steroids. results: cyp154c5 was coexpressed in escherichia coli together with putidaredoxin and putidaredoxin reductase from pseudomonas putida as redox partners for electron transfer and applied in bioconversions of various pregnanes and androstanes [pregnenolone (1), dehydroepiandrosterone (2), progesterone (3), androstenedione (4), testosterone (5) and nandrolone (6)]. structure elucidation of the formed products revealed an exclusive regio- and stereoselectivity of cyp154c5, always yielding the corresponding 16alpha-hydroxylated steroids. application of whole cells expressing the three components, p450, pdx and pdr, in steroid biotransformations resulted in significantly higher conversions and total turnover numbers (ttn) compared to reactions using cell-free extracts. additionally, considerably higher substrate loads (up to 15 mm) were tolerated by the whole-cell system. furthermore, turnover numbers (ton) were determined for the six different steroids using whole cells. thus, testosterone was found to be the worst substrate with a ton of only 0.8 mumol substrate consumed min-1 mumol(-1) cyp154c5, while progesterone and pregnenolone were converted the fastest resulting in ton of 3.3 mumol substrate consumed min(-1) mumol(-1) cyp154c5. conclusion: cyp154c5 from n. farcinica constitutes a promising catalyst due to its high regio- and stereoselectivity in the hydroxylation of different steroids  as well as its efficient expression in e. coli at high yields. using this enzyme, 16alpha-hydroxylated steroids, which are important precursors for the synthesis of high value steroidal drugs in the pharmaceutical industry, can be selectively  produced on preparative scale with ttn (mumol substrate consumed mumol(-1) cyp154c5) exceeding 2000.

TI  == expression, purification, and characterization of formaldehyde dehydrogenase from pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == as a member of zinc-containing medium-chain alcohol dehydrogenase family, formaldehyde dehydrogenase (fdh) can oxidize toxic formaldehyde to less active formate with nad(+) as a cofactor and exists in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.  most fdhs are well known to be glutathione-dependent in the catalysis of formaldehyde oxidation, but the enzyme from pseudomonas putida is an exception, which is independent of glutathione. to identify novel glutathione-independent fdhs from other bacterial strains and facilitate the corresponding structural and enzymatic studies, high-level soluble expression and efficient purification of these enzymes need to be achieved. here, we present molecular cloning, expression, and purification of the fdh from pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a gram-negative pathogenic bacterium causing opportunistic human infection. the fdh of p. aeruginosa shows high sequence identity (87.97%) with that of p. putida. our results indicated that coexpression with molecular chaperones groes, groel, and tig has significantly attenuated inclusion body formation and improved the solubility of the recombinant fdh in escherichiacoli cells. a purification protocol including three chromatographic steps was also established to isolate the recombinant fdh to homogeneity with a yield of approximately 3.2 mg from 1l of cell culture. the recombinant p. aeruginosa fdh was properly folded and biologically functional, as demonstrated by the mass spectrometric, crystallographic, and enzymatic characterizations of the purified proteins.

TI  == the novel bacterial n-demethylase pdmab is responsible for the initial step of n,n-dimethyl-substituted phenylurea herbicide degradation.
AB  == the environmental fate of phenylurea herbicides has received considerable attention in recent decades. the microbial metabolism of n,n-dimethyl-substituted phenylurea herbicides can generally be initiated by mono-n-demethylation. in this study, the molecular basis for this process was revealed. the pdmab genes in sphingobium sp. strain ybl2 were shown to be responsible for the initial mono-n-demethylation of commonly used n,n-dimethyl-substituted phenylurea herbicides. pdmab is the oxygenase component of a bacterial rieske non-heme iron  oxygenase (ro) system. the genes pdmab, encoding the alpha subunit pdma and the beta subunit pdmb, are organized in a transposable element flanked by two direct  repeats of an insertion element resembling isrh1. furthermore, this transposable  element is highly conserved among phenylurea herbicide-degrading sphingomonads originating from different areas of the world. however, there was no evidence of  a gene for an electron carrier (a ferredoxin or a reductase) located in the immediate vicinity of pdmab. without its cognate electron transport components, expression of pdmab in escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, and other sphingomonads resulted in a functional enzyme. moreover, coexpression of a putative [3fe-4s]-type ferredoxin from sphingomonas sp. strain rw1 greatly enhanced the catalytic activity of pdmab in e. coli. these data suggested that pdmab has a low specificity for electron transport components and that its optimal ferredoxin may be the [3fe-4s] type. pdma exhibited low homology to the alpha subunits of previously characterized ros (less than 37% identity) and did not cluster with the ro group involved in o- or n-demethylation reactions, indicating that pdmab is a distinct bacterial ro n-demethylase.

TI  == pseudomonas putida alka and alkb proteins comprise different defense systems for  the repair of alkylation damage to dna - in vivo, in vitro, and in silico studies.
AB  == alkylating agents introduce cytotoxic and/or mutagenic lesions to dna bases leading to induction of adaptive (ada) response, a mechanism protecting cells against deleterious effects of environmental chemicals. in escherichia coli, the  ada response involves expression of four genes: ada, alka, alkb, and aidb. in pseudomonas putida, the organization of ada regulon is different, raising questions regarding regulation of ada gene expression. the aim of the presented studies was to analyze the role of alka glycosylase and alkb dioxygenase in protecting p. putida cells against damage to dna caused by alkylating agents. the results of bioinformatic analysis, of survival and mutagenesis of methyl methanesulfonate (mms) or n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng) treated p.  putida mutants in ada, alka and alkb genes as well as assay of promoter activity  revealed diverse roles of ada, alka and alkb proteins in protecting cellular dna  against alkylating agents. we found alka protein crucial to abolish the cytotoxic but not the mutagenic effects of alkylans since: (i) the mutation in the alka gene was the most deleterious for mms/mnng treated p. putida cells, (ii) the activity of the alka promoter was ada-dependent and the highest among the tested  genes. p. putida alkb (ppalkb), characterized by optimal conditions for in vitro  repair of specific substrates, complementation assay, and m13/ms2 survival test,  allowed to establish conservation of enzymatic function of p. putida and e. coli  alkb protein. we found that the organization of p. putida ada regulon differs from that of e. coli. alka protein induced within the ada response is crucial for protecting p. putida against cytotoxicity, whereas ada prevents the mutagenic action of alkylating agents. in contrast to e. coli alkb (ecalkb), ppalkb remains beyond the ada regulon and is expressed constitutively. it probably creates a backup system that protects p. putida strains defective in other dna repair systems against alkylating agents of exo- and endogenous origin.

AB  == crude glycerol is a promising renewable feedstock in bioconversion processes for  the production of fuels and chemicals. impurities present in crude glycerol can however, negatively impact the fermentation process. successful crude glycerol utilization requires robust microbial production hosts that tolerate and preferably, can utilize such impurities. we investigated utilization of crude, unpurified glycerol as a substrate for the production of aromatic compounds by solvent tolerant pseudomonas putida s12. in high-cell density fed-batch fermentations, p. putida s12 surprisingly performed better on crude glycerol than on purified glycerol. by contrast, growth of escherichia coli was severely compromised under these high cell density cultivation conditions on crude glycerol. for p. putida s12 the biomass-to-substrate yield, maximum biomass production rate and substrate uptake rate were consistently higher on crude glycerol. moreover, production of p-hydroxybenzoate by engineered p. putida s12palb5 on crude glycerol showed a 10% yield improvement over production on purified glycerol. p. putida s12 is a favorable host for bioconversion processes  utilizing crude glycerol as a substrate. its intrinsic stress-tolerance properties provide the robustness required for efficient growth and metabolism on this renewable substrate.

TI  == improving the lethal effect of cpl-7, a pneumococcal phage lysozyme with broad bactericidal activity, by inverting the net charge of its cell wall-binding module.
AB  == phage endolysins are murein hydrolases that break the bacterial cell wall to provoke lysis and release of phage progeny. recently, these enzymes have also been recognized as powerful and specific antibacterial agents when added exogenously. in the pneumococcal system, most cell wall associated murein hydrolases reported so far depend on choline for activity, and cpl-7 lysozyme constitutes a remarkable exception. here, we report the improvement of the killing activity of the cpl-7 endolysin by inversion of the sign of the charge of the cell wall-binding module (from -14.93 to +3.0 at neutral ph). the engineered  variant, cpl-7s, has 15 amino acid substitutions and an improved lytic activity against streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiresistant strains), streptococcus pyogenes, and other pathogens. moreover, we have demonstrated that  a single 25-mug dose of cpl-7s significantly increased the survival rate of zebrafish embryos infected with s. pneumoniae or s. pyogenes, confirming the killing effect of cpl-7s in vivo. interestingly, cpl-7s, in combination with 0.01% carvacrol (an essential oil), was also found to efficiently kill gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida, an effect not described previously. our findings provide a strategy to improve the lytic activity of phage endolysins based on facilitating their pass through the negatively charged bacterial envelope, and thereby their interaction with the cell wall target, by modulating the net charge of the cell wall-binding modules.

AB  == acinetobacter sp. strain yaa has five genes (atda1 to atda5) involved in aniline  oxidation as a part of the aniline degradation gene cluster. from sequence analysis, the five genes were expected to encode a glutamine synthetase (gs)-like protein (atda1), a glutamine amidotransferase-like protein (atda2), and an aromatic compound dioxygenase (atda3, atda4, and atda5) (m. takeo, t. fujii, and  y. maeda, j. ferment. bioeng. 85:17-24, 1998). a recombinant pseudomonas strain harboring these five genes quantitatively converted aniline into catechol, demonstrating that catechol is the major oxidation product from aniline. to elucidate the function of the gs-like protein atda1 in aniline oxidation, we purified it from recombinant escherichia coli harboring atda1. the purified atda1 protein produced gamma-glutamylanilide (gamma-ga) quantitatively from aniline and l-glutamate in the presence of atp and mgcl2. this reaction was identical to glutamine synthesis by gs, except for the use of aniline instead of ammonia as the substrate. recombinant pseudomonas strains harboring the dioxygenase genes (atda3 to atda5) were unable to degrade aniline but converted gamma-ga into catechol, indicating that gamma-ga is an intermediate to catechol and a direct substrate for the dioxygenase. unexpectedly, a recombinant pseudomonas strain harboring only atda2 hydrolyzed gamma-ga into aniline, reversing the gamma-ga formation by atda1. deletion of atda2 from atda1 to atda5 caused gamma-ga accumulation from aniline in recombinant pseudomonas cells and inhibited the growth of a recombinant acinetobacter strain on aniline, suggesting that atda2 prevents gamma-ga accumulation that is harmful to the host cell.

TI  == functional characterization of the bacterial iac genes for degradation of the plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid.
AB  == pseudomonas putida 1290 is a model organism for the study of bacterial degradation of the plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid (iaa). this property is encoded by the iac gene cluster. insertional inactivation and/or deletion of individual iac genes and heterologous expression of the gene cluster in escherichia coli were combined with mass spectrometry to demonstrate that iac-based degradation of iaa is likely to involve 2-hydroxy-iaa, 3-hydroxy-2-oxo-iaa, and catechol as intermediates. the first gene of the cluster, iaca encodes for the first step in the pathway, and also can convert indole to indoxyl to produce the blue pigment indigo. transcriptional profiling of iac genes in p. putida 1290 revealed that they were induced in the presence of iaa. based on results with an iacr knockout, we propose that this gene codes for  a repressor of iaca expression and that exposure to iaa relieves this repression. transformation of p. putida kt2440 (which cannot degrade iaa) with the iac gene cluster conferred the ability to grow on iaa as a sole source of carbon and energy, but not the ability to chemotaxi towards iaa. we could show such tactic response for p. putida 1290, thus representing the first demonstration of bacterial chemotaxis towards iaa. we discuss the ecological significance of our findings, and specifically the following question: under what circumstances do bacteria with the ability to degrade, recognize, and move towards iaa have a selective advantage?

TI  == identification, structure, and function of a novel type vi secretion peptidoglycan glycoside hydrolase effector-immunity pair.
AB  == bacteria employ type vi secretion systems (t6sss) to facilitate interactions with prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. despite the widespread identification of t6sss  among gram-negative bacteria, the number of experimentally validated substrate effector proteins mediating these interactions remains small. here, employing an  informatics approach, we define novel families of t6s peptidoglycan glycoside hydrolase effectors. consistent with the known intercellular self-intoxication exhibited by the t6s pathway, we observe that each effector gene is located adjacent to a hypothetical open reading frame encoding a putative periplasmically localized immunity determinant. to validate our sequence-based approach, we functionally investigate a representative family member from the soil-dwelling bacterium pseudomonas protegens. we demonstrate that this protein is secreted in  a t6ss-dependent manner and that it confers a fitness advantage in growth competition assays with pseudomonas putida. in addition, we determined the 1.4 a  x-ray crystal structure of this effector in complex with its cognate immunity protein. the structure reveals the effector shares highest overall structural similarity to a glycoside hydrolase family associated with peptidoglycan n-acetylglucosaminidase activity, suggesting that t6s peptidoglycan glycoside hydrolase effector families may comprise significant enzymatic diversity. our structural analyses also demonstrate that self-intoxication is prevented by the immunity protein through direct occlusion of the effector active site. this work  significantly expands our current understanding of t6s effector diversity.

TI  == new dye-decolorizing peroxidases from bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas putida met94: towards biotechnological applications.
AB  == this work provides spectroscopic, catalytic, and stability fingerprints of two new bacterial dye-decolorizing peroxidases (dyps) from bacillus subtilis (bsdyp)  and pseudomonas putida met94 (ppdyp). dyps are a family of microbial heme-containing peroxidases with wide substrate specificity, including high redox potential aromatic compounds such as synthetic dyes or phenolic and nonphenolic lignin units. the genes encoding bsdyp and ppdyp, belonging to subfamilies a and  b, respectively, were cloned and heterologously expressed in escherichia coli. the recombinant ppdyp is a 120-kda homotetramer while bsdyp enzyme consists of a  single 48-kda monomer. the optimal ph of both enzymes is in the acidic range (ph  4-5). bsdyp has a bell-shape profile with optimum between 20 and 30 degrees c whereas ppdyp shows a peculiar flat and broad (10-30 degrees c) temperature profile. anthraquinonic or azo dyes, phenolics, methoxylated aromatics, and also  manganese and ferrous ions are substrates used by the enzymes. in general, ppdyp  exhibits higher activities and accepts a wider scope of substrates than bsdyp; the spectroscopic data suggest distinct heme microenvironments in the two enzymes that might account for the distinctive catalytic behavior. however, the bs enzyme with activity lasting for up to 53 h at 40 degrees c is more stable towards temperature or chemical denaturation than the ppdyp. the results of this work will guide future optimization of the biocatalytis towards their utilization in the fields of environmental or industrial biotechnology.

TI  == microbial production of the aromatic building-blocks (s)-styrene oxide and (r)-1,2-phenylethanediol from renewable resources.
AB  == (s)-styrene oxide and (r)-1,2-phenylethanediol are chiral aromatic molecular building blocks used commonly as precursors to pharmaceuticals and other specialty chemicals. two pathways have been engineered in escherichia coli for their individual biosynthesis directly from glucose. the novel pathways each constitute extensions of the previously engineered styrene pathway, developed by  co-expressing either styrene monooxygenase (smo) or styrene dioxygenase (sdo) to  convert styrene to (s)-styrene oxide and (r)-1,2-phenylethanediol, respectively.  styab from pseudomonas putida s12 was determined to be the most effective smo. sdo activity was achieved using nahaaabacad of pseudomonas sp. ncib 9816-4, a naphthalene dioxygenase with known broad substrate specificity. production of phenylalanine, the precursor to both pathways, was systematically enhanced through a number of mutations, most notably via deletion of tyra and over-expression of tkta. as a result, (r)-1,2-phenylethanediol reached titers as  high as 1.23 g/l, and at 1.32 g/l (s)-styrene oxide titers already approach their toxicity limit. as with other aromatics, product toxicity was strongly correlated with a model of membrane accumulation and disruption. this study additionally demonstrates that greater flux through the styrene pathway can be achieved if its toxicity is addressed, as achieved in this case by reacting styrene to less toxic products.

TI  == role for ferredoxin:nad(p)h oxidoreductase (fpra) in sulfate assimilation and siderophore biosynthesis in pseudomonads.
AB  == pyridine-2,6-bis(thiocarboxylate) (pdtc), produced by certain pseudomonads, is a  sulfur-containing siderophore that binds iron, as well as a wide range of transition metals, and it affects the net hydrolysis of the environmental contaminant carbon tetrachloride. the pathway of pdtc biosynthesis has not been defined. here, we performed a transposon screen of pseudomonas putida dsm 3601 to identify genes necessary for pdtc production (pdt phenotype). transposon insertions within genes for sulfate assimilation (cysd, cysnc, and cysg [coba2])  dominated the collection of pdt mutations. in addition, two insertions were within the gene for the lysr-type transcriptional activator finr (pp1637). phenotypic characterization indicated that finr mutants were cysteine bradytrophs. the pdt phenotype of finr mutants could be complemented by the known target of finr regulation, fpra (encoding ferredoxin:nadp(+) oxidoreductase), or  by escherichia coli cysji (encoding sulfite reductase). these data indicate that  fpra is necessary for effective sulfate assimilation by p. putida and that the effect of finr mutation on pdtc production was due to deficient expression of fpra and sulfite reduction. fpra expression in both p. putida and p. aeruginosa was found to be regulated by finr, but in a manner dependent upon reduced sulfur  sources, implicating finr in sulfur regulatory physiology. the genes and phenotypes identified in this study indicated a strong dependence upon intracellular reduced sulfur/cysteine for pdtc biosynthesis and that pseudomonads utilize sulfite reduction enzymology distinct from that of e. coli and possibly similar to that of chloroplasts and other proteobacteria.

AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of clary sage, juniper, lemon and marjoram essential oils (eos) and their major components on the formation of bacterial and yeast biofilms and on the inhibition of ahl-mediated quorum sensing (qs). methods and results: biofilm formation was measured by crystal violet and resazurin staining, and qs inhibition was detected by paper disc diffusion assay. marjoram eo inhibited bacillus cereus, pichia anomala, pseudomonas putida and mixed-culture biofilm formation of ps. putida and escherichia coli and showed the best qs inhibitor effect on chromobacterium violaceum. for b. cereus, all components showed better antibiofilm capacity than  the parent eos. lemon eo inhibited e. coli and mixed-culture biofilms, and cinnamon was effective against the mixed forms. scanning electron microscopy showed the loss of three-dimensional structures of biofilms. conclusions: the eos and components used seem to be good candidates for prevention of biofilm formation and inhibition of the ahl-mediated qs mechanism. significance and impact of the study: biofilm formation on foods and food industrial equipment is  a serious problem causing food spoilage and emergence of foodborne diseases. this article highlights the importance of studying eos as potential disinfectants and  food preservatives.

AB  == a methyl ethyl ketone (mek)-inducible system based on the broad-host-range plasmid pbbr1mcs2 and on the p meka promoter region of the mek degradation operon of pseudomonas veronii mek700 was characterized in escherichia coli jm109 and pseudomonas putida kt2440. for validation, beta-galactosidase (lacz) was used as  a reporter. the novel system, which is positively regulated by mekr, a member of  the arac/xyls family of regulators, was shown to be subject to carbon catabolite  repression by glucose, which, however, could not be attributed to the single action of the global regulators crc and ptsn. an advantage is its extremely tight regulation accompanied with three magnitudes of fold increase of gene expression  after treatment with mek. the transcriptional start site of p meka was identified by primer extension, thereby revealing a potential stem-loop structure at the 5'  end of the mrna. since mekr was highly insoluble, its putative binding site was identified through sequence analysis. the operator seems to be composed of a 15-bp tandem repeat (caccn5cttcaa) separated by a 6-bp spacer region, which resembles known binding patterns of other members of the arac/xyls family. subsequent mutational modifications of the putative operator region confirmed its importance for transcriptional activation. as the -35 promoter element seems to be overlapped by the putative operator, a class ii activation mechanism is assumed.

TI  == engineered escherichia coli for short-chain-length medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate copolymer biosynthesis from glycerol and dodecanoate.
AB  == short-chain-length medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate (scl-mcl pha) copolymers are promising as bio-plastics with properties ranging from thermoplastics to elastomers. in this study, the hybrid pathway for the biosynthesis of scl-mcl pha copolymers was established in recombinant escherichia coli by co-expression of beta-ketothiolase (phaare) and nadph-dependent acetoacetyl-coa reductase (phabre) from ralstonia eutropha together with pha synthases from r. eutropha (phacre), aeromonas hydrophila (phacah), and pseudomonas putida (phac2pp) and with (r)-specific enoyl-coa hydratases from p. putida (phaj1pp and phaj4pp), and a. hydrophila (phajah). when glycerol supplemented with dodecanoate was used as primary carbon source, e. coli harboring various combinations of phaabcj produced scl-mcl pha copolymers of various monomer compositions varying from c4 to c10. in addition, polymer property analysis suggested that the copolymers produced from this recombinant source have thermal properties (lower glass transition and melting temperatures)  superior to polyhydroxybutyrate homopolymer.

TI  == engineering of a hybrid biotransformation system for cytochrome p450sca-2 in escherichia coli.
AB  == p450sca-2 is an industrially important enzyme that stereoselectively converts mevastatin into pravastatin. however, little information or engineering efforts have been reported for this enzyme or its redox partner. in this study, we successfully reconstituted the p450sca-2 activity in escherichia coli by co-expression with putidaredoxin reductase (pdr) and putidaredoxin (pdx) from the pseudomonas putida cytochrome p450cam system. with an hplc-based screening assay, random mutagenesis was applied to yield a mutant (r8-5c) with a pravastatin yield of the whole-cell biotransformation 4.1-fold that of the wild type. p450sca-2 wild-type and r8-5c were characterized in terms of mevastatin binding and hydroxylation, electron transfer, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. r8-5c showed an active p450 expression level that was 3.8-fold that of the wild type, with relatively smaller changes in the apparent k(cat)/k(m) with respect to the substrate mevastatin (1.3-fold) or pdx (1.5-fold) compared with the wild type. thus, the increase in the pravastatin yield of the whole-cell biotransformation primarily came from the improved active p450 expression, which has resulted largely from better heme incorporation, although none of the six mutations of r8-5c are located near the heme active site. these results will facilitate further engineering of this p450sca-2 system and provide useful clues for improving other hybrid p450 systems.

TI  == short rose-like rna thermometers control ibpa synthesis in pseudomonas species.
AB  == the bacterial small heat shock protein ibpa protects client proteins from aggregation. due to redundancy in the cellular chaperone network, deletion of the ibpa gene often leads to only a mild or no phenotypic defect. in this study, we show that a pseudomonas putida ibpa deletion mutant has a severe growth defect under heat stress conditions and reduced survival during recovery revealing a critical role of ibpa in heat tolerance. transcription of the ibpa gene depends on the alternative heat shock sigma factor sigma(32). production of ibpa protein  only at heat shock temperatures suggested additional translational control. we conducted a comprehensive structural and functional analysis of the 5' untranslated regions of the ibpa genes from p. putida and pseudomonas aeruginosa. both contain a rose-type rna thermometer that is substantially shorter and simpler than previously reported rose elements. comprised of two hairpin structures only, they inhibit translation at low temperature and permit translation initiation after a temperature upshift. both elements regulate reporter gene expression in escherichia coli and ribosome binding in vitro in a temperature-dependent manner. structure probing revealed local melting of the second hairpin whereas the first hairpin remained unaffected. high sequence and structure conservation of pseudomonal ibpa untranslated regions and their ability to confer thermoregulation in vivo suggest that short rose-like thermometers are  commonly used to control ibpa synthesis in pseudomonas species.

TI  == characterization of flavin-based fluorescent proteins: an emerging class of fluorescent reporters.
AB  == fluorescent reporter proteins based on flavin-binding photosensors were recently  developed as a new class of genetically encoded probes characterized by small size and oxygen-independent maturation of fluorescence. flavin-based fluorescent  proteins (fbfps) address two major limitations associated with existing fluorescent reporters derived from the green fluorescent protein (gfp)-namely, the overall large size and oxygen-dependent maturation of fluorescence of gfp. however, fbfps are at a nascent stage of development and have been utilized in only a handful of biological studies. importantly, a full understanding of the performance and properties of fbfps as a practical set of biological probes is lacking. in this work, we extensively characterize three fbfps isolated from pseudomonas putida, bacillus subtilis, and arabidopsis thaliana, using in vitro studies to assess probe brightness, oligomeric state, maturation time, fraction of fluorescent holoprotein, ph tolerance, redox sensitivity, and thermal stability. furthermore, we validate fbfps as stable molecular tags using in vivo  studies by constructing a series of fbfp-based transcriptional constructs to probe promoter activity in escherichia coli. overall, fbfps show key advantages as broad-spectrum biological reporters including robust ph tolerance (4-11), thermal stability (up to 60 degrees c), and rapid maturation of fluorescence (<3  min.). in addition, the fbfp derived from arabidopsis thaliana (ilov) emerged as  a stable and nonperturbative reporter of promoter activity in escherichia coli. our results demonstrate that fbfp-based reporters have the potential to address key limitations associated with the use of gfp, such as ph-sensitive fluorescence and slow kinetics of fluorescence maturation (10-40 minutes for half maximal fluorescence recovery). from this view, fbfps represent a useful new addition to  the fluorescent reporter protein palette, and our results constitute an important framework to enable researchers to implement and further engineer improved fbfp-based reporters with enhanced brightness and tighter flavin binding, which will maximize their potential benefits.

TI  == particle-cell contact enhances antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles.
AB  == background: it is generally accepted that antibacterial properties of ag nanoparticles (agnps) are dictated by their dissolved fraction. however, dissolution-based concept alone does not fully explain the toxic potency of nanoparticulate silver compared to silver ions. methodology/principal findings: herein, we demonstrated that the direct contact between bacterial cell and agnps' surface enhanced the toxicity of nanosilver. more specifically, cell-np contact increased the cellular uptake of particle-associated ag ions - the single and ultimate cause of toxicity. to prove that, we evaluated the toxicity of three different agnps (uncoated, pvp-coated and protein-coated) to six bacterial strains: gram-negative escherichia coli, pseudomonas fluorescens, p. putida and p. aeruginosa and gram-positive bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus. while the toxicity of agno3 to these bacteria varied only slightly (the 4-h ec50  ranged from 0.3 to 1.2 mg ag/l), the 4-h ec50 values of protein-coated agnps for  various bacterial strains differed remarkably, from 0.35 to 46 mg ag/l. by systematically comparing the intracellular and extracellular free ag(+) liberated from agnps, we demonstrated that not only extracellular dissolution in the bacterial test environment but also additional dissolution taking place at the particle-cell interface played an essential role in antibacterial action of agnps. the role of the np-cell contact in dictating the antibacterial activity of ag-nps was additionally proven by the following observations: (i) separation of bacterial cells from agnps by particle-impermeable membrane (cut-off 20 kda, approximately 4 nm) significantly reduced the toxicity of agnps and (ii) p. aeruginosa cells which tended to attach onto agnps, exhibited the highest sensitivity to all forms of nanoparticulate ag. conclusions/significance: our findings provide new insights into the mode of antibacterial action of nanosilver and explain some discrepancies in this field, showing that "ag-ion" and "particle-specific" mechanisms are not controversial but, rather, are two faces of the same coin.

TI  == strategy for successful expression of the pseudomonas putida nitrile hydratase activator p14k in escherichia coli.
AB  == background: activators of nitrile hydratase (nhase) are essential for functional  nhase biosynthesis. however, the activator p14k in p. putida is difficult to heterogeneously express, which retards the clarification of the mechanism of p14k involved in the maturation of nhase. although a strep tag containing p14k (strep-p14k) was over-expressed, its low expression level and low stability affect the further analysis. results: we successfully expressed p14k through genetic modifications according to n-end rule and analyzed the mechanism for its  difficult expression. we found that mutation of the second n-terminal amino-acid  of the protein from lysine to alanine or truncating the n-terminal 16 amino-acid  sequence resulted in successful expression of p14k. moreover, fusion of a pelb leader and strep tag together (pelb-strep-p14k) at the n-terminus increased p14k  expression. in addition, the pelb-strep-p14k was more stable than the strep-p14k. conclusions: our results are not only useful for clarification of the role of p14k involved in the nhase maturation, but also helpful for heterologous expression of other difficult expression proteins.

TI  == bacterial tethering analysis reveals a "run-reverse-turn" mechanism for pseudomonas species motility.
AB  == we have developed a program that can accurately analyze the dynamic properties of tethered bacterial cells. the program works especially well with cells that tend  to give rise to unstable rotations, such as polar-flagellated bacteria. the program has two novel components. the first dynamically adjusts the center of the cell's rotational trajectories. the second applies piecewise linear approximation to the accumulated rotation curve to reduce noise and separate the motion of bacteria into phases. thus, it can separate counterclockwise (ccw) and clockwise  (cw) rotations distinctly and measure rotational speed accurately. using this program, we analyzed the properties of tethered pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas putida cells for the first time. we found that the pseudomonas flagellar motor spends equal time in both ccw and cw phases and that it rotates with the same speed in both phases. in addition, we discovered that the cell body can remain stationary for short periods of time, leading to the existence of a third phase of the flagellar motor which we call "pause." in addition, p. aeruginosa cells adopt longer run lengths, fewer pause frequencies, and shorter pause durations as part of their chemotactic response. we propose that one purpose of the pause phase is to allow the cells to turn at a large angle, where  we show that pause durations in free-swimming cells positively correlate with turn angle sizes. taken together, our results suggest a new "run-reverse-turn" paradigm for polar-flagellated pseudomonas motility that is different from the "run-and-tumble" paradigm established for peritrichous escherichia coli.

TI  == inhibitory effect of pseudomonas putida nitrogen-related phosphotransferase system on conjugative transfer of incp-9 plasmid from escherichia coli.
AB  == conjugative plasmid transfer systems have been well studied, but very little is known about the recipient factors that control horizontal transmission. a self-transmissible incp-9 naphthalene catabolic plasmid, nah7, carries the traf gene, whose product is considered to be a host-range modifier of nah7, because its traf deletion mutant (nah7df) is transmissible from pseudomonas putida to p.  putida and escherichia coli and from e. coli to e. coli, but not from e. coli to  p. putida. in this study, transposon mutagenesis of p. putida kt2440 was performed to isolate the mutants that could receive nah7df from e. coli. the mutants had the transposon insertions in ptsp or ptso, encoding two of three components of the nitrogen-related phosphotransferase system (pts(ntr) ). the kt2440 derivative lacking ptsn, encoding the remaining component of pts(ntr) , was also able to receive nah7df. these results indicated that the pts(ntr) in p.  putida is involved in inhibition of conjugative transfer of nah7df from e. coli.  our further experiments using site-directed mutants suggested the indirect involvement of the phosphorylated form of ptso in the inhibition of the conjugative transfer. conjugative transfer of nah7 and another incp-9 plasmid, pww0, from e. coli was partially inhibited by the ptso function in kt2440.

TI  == broad host range vectors for expression of proteins with (twin-) strep-tag, his-tag and engineered, export optimized yellow fluorescent protein.
AB  == background: in current protein research, a limitation still is the production of  active recombinant proteins or native protein associations to assess their function. especially the localization and analysis of protein-complexes or the identification of modifications and small molecule interaction partners by co-purification experiments requires a controllable expression of affinity- and/or fluorescence tagged variants of a protein of interest in its native cellular background. advantages of periplasmic and/or homologous expressions can  frequently not be realized due to a lack of suitable tools. instead, experiments  are often limited to the heterologous production in one of the few well established expression strains. results: here, we introduce a series of new rk2 based broad host range expression plasmids for inducible production of affinity-  and fluorescence tagged proteins in the cytoplasm and periplasm of a wide range of gram negative hosts which are designed to match the recently suggested modular standard european vector architecture and database. the vectors are equipped with a yellow fluorescent protein variant which is engineered to fold and brightly fluoresce in the bacterial periplasm following sec-mediated export, as shown from fractionation and imaging studies. expression of strep-tag(r)ii and twin-strep-tag(r) fusion proteins in pseudomonas putida kt2440 is demonstrated for various orfs. conclusion: the broad host range constructs we have produced enable good and controlled expression of affinity tagged protein variants for single-step purification and qualify for complex co-purification experiments. periplasmic export variants enable production of affinity tagged proteins and generation of fusion proteins with a novel engineered aequorea-based yellow fluorescent reporter protein variant with activity in the periplasm of the tested gram-negative model bacteria pseudomonas putida kt2440 and escherichia coli k12 for production, localization or co-localization studies. in addition, the new tools facilitate metabolic engineering and yield assessment for cytoplasmic or periplasmic protein production in a number of different expression hosts when yields in one initially selected are insufficient.

TI  == a new large-dna-fragment delivery system based on integrase activity from an integrative and conjugative element.
AB  == during the past few decades, numerous plasmid vectors have been developed for cloning, gene expression analysis, and genetic engineering. cloning procedures typically rely on pcr amplification, dna fragment restriction digestion, recovery, and ligation, but increasingly, procedures are being developed to assemble large synthetic dnas. in this study, we developed a new gene delivery system using the integrase activity of an integrative and conjugative element (ice). the advantage of the integrase-based delivery is that it can stably introduce a large dna fragment (at least 75 kb) into one or more specific sites (the gene for glycine-accepting trna) on a target chromosome. integrase recombination activity in escherichia coli is kept low by using a synthetic hybrid promoter, which, however, is unleashed in the final target host, forcing the integration of the construct. upon integration, the system is again silenced. two variants with different genetic features were produced, one in the form of a  cloning vector in e. coli and the other as a mini-transposable element by which large dna constructs assembled in e. coli can be tagged with the integrase gene.  we confirmed that the system could successfully introduce cosmid and bacterial artificial chromosome (bac) dnas from e. coli into the chromosome of pseudomonas  putida in a site-specific manner. the integrase delivery system works in concert  with existing vector systems and could thus be a powerful tool for synthetic constructions of new metabolic pathways in a variety of host bacteria.

AB  == chemosensory pathways are a major signal transduction mechanism in bacteria. cher methyltransferases catalyze the methylation of the cytosolic signaling domain of  chemoreceptors and are among the core proteins of chemosensory cascades. these enzymes have primarily been studied escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium,  which possess a single cher involved in chemotaxis. many other bacteria possess multiple cher genes. because the sequences of chemoreceptor signaling domains are highly conserved, it remains to be established with what degree of specificity cher paralogues exert their activity. we report here a comparative analysis of the three cher paralogues of pseudomonas putida. isothermal titration calorimetry studies show that these paralogues bind the product of the methylation reaction,  s-adenosylhomocysteine, with much higher affinity (kd of 0.14-2.2 mum) than the substrate s-adenosylmethionine (kd of 22-43 mum), which indicates product feedback inhibition. product binding was particularly tight for cher2. analytical ultracentrifugation experiments demonstrate that cher2 is monomeric in the absence and presence of s-adenosylmethionine or s-adenosylhomocysteine. methylation assays show that cher2, but not the other paralogues, methylates the  mcps and mcpt chemotaxis receptors. the mutant in cher2 was deficient in chemotaxis, whereas mutation of cher1 and cher3 had either no or little effect on chemotaxis. in contrast, biofilm formation of the cher1 mutant was largely impaired but not affected in the other mutants. we conclude that cher2 forms part of a chemotaxis pathway, and cher1 forms part of a chemosensory route that controls biofilm formation. data suggest that cher methyltransferases act with high specificity on their cognate chemoreceptors.

TI  == the solution structures of two prophage homologues of the bacteriophage lambda ea8.5 protein reveal a newly discovered hybrid homeodomain/zinc-finger fold.
AB  == a cluster of genes in the exoxis region of bacteriophage lambda are capable of inhibiting the initiation of dna synthesis in escherichia coli. the most indispensible gene in this region is ea8.5. here, we report the nuclear magnetic  resonance structures of two ea8.5 orthologs from enteropathogenic e. coli and pseudomonas putida prophages. both proteins are characterized by a fused homeodomain/zinc-finger fold that escaped detection by primary sequence search methods. while these folds are both associated with a nucleic acid binding function, the amino acid composition suggests otherwise, leading to the possibility that ea8.5 associates with other viral and host proteins.

AB  == a minireplicon containing the rep gene and oriv site of the gamma subgroup of the incp-9 caprolactam pbs267 biodegradation plasmid was cloned for the first time. it was established that a minimized variant of pbs267 plasmid cannot be sustained in e. coli and is inherited in an unstable way in bacteria pseudomonas. using in  vitro mutagenesis, mutant variants of the minireplicon were produced, characterized by an increased number of copies in cells, the ability to replicate in e. coli, and relatively stable inheritance in p. putida cells. the obtained constructs are the basis for a study of the replication mechanisms of incp-9 group plasmids, as well as use as vectors for molecular cloning in a wide range of gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == the impact of the conjugative incp-1 plasmid pkjk5 on multispecies biofilm formation is dependent on the plasmid host.
AB  == horizontal gene transfer by conjugation has been reported to increase overall biofilm formation. biofilm is considered a hot spot for plasmid transfer, and it  has been found that social interactions during biofilm formation can increase the biomass. in this study, we demonstrate a contrast to previous studies by showing  that the conjugative incp-1 plasmid pkjk5 influences biofilm formation negatively. the results showed that a co-culture (pseudomonas putida, kluyvera sp., and escherichia coli) formed significantly more biofilm than the strains did individually. when pkjk5 was inserted into p. putida, biofilm formation was significantly reduced compared with the co-culture without plasmid. a nonconjugative version of pkjk5 was also used, and the biofilm formation was restored. visualization with the bioflux 1000 facility showed that the presence of pkjk5-containing p. putida in the co-culture led to a changed biofilm structure, where the cells showed a higher tendency to attach to other cells rather than surfaces. this study thus indicates that the presence of conjugative  plasmids in some species may decrease the surface-associated biofilm formation of a mixed co-culture by facilitating cell-cell attachment with reduced surface attachment as the consequence.

TI  == transcription factor-based screens and synthetic selections for microbial small-molecule biosynthesis.
AB  == continued advances in metabolic engineering are increasing the number of small molecules being targeted for microbial production. pathway yields and productivities, however, are often suboptimal, and strain improvement remains a persistent challenge given that the majority of small molecules are difficult to  screen for and their biosynthesis does not improve host fitness. in this work, we have developed a generalized approach to screen or select for improved small-molecule biosynthesis using transcription factor-based biosensors. using a  tetracycline resistance gene 3' of a small-molecule inducible promoter, host antibiotic resistance, and hence growth rate, was coupled to either small-molecule concentration in the growth medium or a small-molecule production  phenotype. biosensors were constructed for two important chemical classes, dicarboxylic acids and alcohols, using transcription factor-promoter pairs derived from pseudomonas putida, thauera butanivorans, or e. coli. transcription  factors were selected for specific activation by either succinate, adipate, or 1-butanol, and we demonstrate product-dependent growth in e. coli using all three compounds. the 1-butanol biosensor was applied in a proof-of-principle liquid culture screen to optimize 1-butanol biosynthesis in engineered e. coli, identifying a pathway variant yielding a 35% increase in 1-butanol specific productivity through optimization of enzyme expression levels. lastly, to demonstrate the capacity to select for enzymatic activity, the 1-butanol biosensor was applied as synthetic selection, coupling in vivo 1-butanol biosynthesis to e. coli fitness, and an 120-fold enrichment for a 1-butanol production phenotype was observed following a single round of positive selection.

AB  == the widespread use of caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) and other methylxanthines in beverages and pharmaceuticals has led to significant environmental pollution. we have developed a portable caffeine degradation operon by refactoring the alkylxanthine degradation (alx) gene cluster from pseudomonas  putida cbb5 to function in escherichia coli. in the process, we discovered that adding a glutathione s-transferase from janthinobacterium sp. marseille was necessary to achieve n 7 -demethylation activity. e. coli cells with the synthetic operon degrade caffeine to the guanine precursor, xanthine. cells deficient in de novo guanine biosynthesis that contain the refactored operon are  ''addicted'' to caffeine: their growth density is limited by the availability of  caffeine or other xanthines. we show that the addicted strain can be used as a biosensor to measure the caffeine content of common beverages. the synthetic n-demethylation operon could be useful for reclaiming nutrient-rich byproducts of coffee bean processing and for the cost-effective bioproduction of methylxanthine drugs.

AB  == bacteria producing new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (ndm-1) exhibit high level  resistance to beta-lactams including carbapenems. this broad-spectrum resistance  limits treatment options for infections caused by ndm-1 producers. ndm-1 was first isolated from an indian patient in sweden; since then, ndm-1 producing isolates have been identified in many countries including turkey. in this study,  we investigated the presence of ndm-1 by pcr method in various gram-negative isolates recovered from clinical specimens in tertiary care hospitals in samsun,  turkey. a total of 210 carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates (132 acinetobacter baumannii, 54 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 pseudomonas putida, 8 enterobacter cloacae, 3 enterobacter aerogenes, 3 klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 providencia rettgeri, 2 escherichia coli and 1 citrobacter freundii) were included in the study. identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolates were performed by using vitek-2 compact (biomerieux, france) and bd  phoenix (bd diagnostic systems, md) automated systems. the results of antibiotic  susceptibility testing were interpreted according to the clsi recommendations. in our study, ndm-1 gene was not detected in any of the clinical isolates by pcr. there was only one case study that reported the presence of ndm-1 in clinical isolates from turkey [poirel l et al. antimicrob agents chemother 2012;56:2784].  our data, together with the others, indicated that the existence of ndm-1 in clinical isolates is not common in turkey. however, since ndm-1 is a plasmid-encoded enzyme, there is always a risk of spread of this resistance through the bacterial strains in our country. therefore, continuous surveillance  and investigation of carbapenem-resistant isolates with resistance patterns suggestive of ndm-1 may enable to identify ndm-1 producing isolates. meanwhile special care should be given on rational antibiotic use and establishment of appropriate infection control policies to prevent the spread of ndm-1 producers and other potential resistant strains.

TI  == effects of shear on initial bacterial attachment in slow flowing systems.
AB  == initial bacterial attachment, likely affected by local shear, could influence biofilm formation. however, there are contradictory reports for the shear effects on attachment of different bacteria onto different surfaces. in this study, four  bacteria, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, and escherichia coli, were examined for their attachment to glass and octadecyltrichlorosilane (ots) modified glass under different shears. polystyrene particles were used to verify that their shear dependent attachment on glass and  ots could be interpreted using an analysis based on the extended derjaguin-landau-verwey-overbeek (xdlvo) theory. in particular, the critical shear force (f(c-shear)) could correlate with the maximum attractive force (f(max)(xdlvo)) toward the secondary energy minimum as f(c-shear)=cf(max)(xdlvo). for these particles, c of ~1 was obtained, the value was within the coefficient range (0.1-1) of substances sliding over glass. for s. epidermidis, e. coli and p. aeruginosa on glass, c was 0.3, <0.6 and 0.2, respectively. when considering potential protein adsorption on ots during bacterial attachment, c of these species on ots was slightly above 1. a greatly enhanced attachment of p. aeruginosa on ots was also observed, probably due to the presence of flagella. for p. putida, the attachment first decreased slightly or maintained with shear and then increased. such behaviors were probably caused by the increased secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (eps) at higher shears by p. putida. the results from this study suggested that, without complications from surface features/eps, the analysis based on the xdlvo theory could provide a basis for understanding shear effect on initial bacterial attachment.

TI  == a phthalate family oxygenase reductase supports terpene alcohol oxidation by cyp238a1 from pseudomonas putida kt2440.
AB  == cyp238a1, one of the two p450 enzymes in the genome of pseudomonas putida kt2440, has been produced heterologously in escherichia coli, purified, and found to bind acyclic and cyclic terpene alcohols such as farnesol, nerolidol, linalool, and terpineol. the other p450 enzyme in this organism (gene locus: pp1950) was also produced in e. coli but no substrate has been identified from a limited screen. a phthalate family oxygenase reductase (pfor) encoded by the pp1957 gene, just downstream of the pp1955 gene for cyp238a1, accepts electrons from the reduced form of both nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nadh) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and is able to support monooxygenase activity of cyp238a1, both in vitro and in e. coli, in which both enzymes are produced. cyp238a1 oxidizes cis- and trans-nerolidol to the 9-hydroxy product, with no evidence of attack at the olefinic double bonds. the nadh turnover rate of 170 nmol(nmol-p450)(-)(1) min(-)(1) for cyp238a1 with cis-nerolidol as substrate at a pp1957:cyp238a1 concentration ratio of 8:1 suggests that this pfor could function as the physiological redox partner for cyp238a1. the physiological role of cyp238a1 may be related to the pp1955 gene being part of an island/cluster of inducible genes associated with energy metabolism and response to xenobiotics.

AB  == hydrothermal liquefaction of algae biomass is a promising technology for the production of sustainable biofuels, but the non-oil, aqueous co-product of the process has only been examined to a limited extent. the aqueous phase from liquefaction of the alga nannochloropsis oculata (aqal) was used to make growth media for model heterotrophic microorganisms escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. growth rates, yields, and carbon/nitrogen/phosphorus uptake were measured. e. coli and p. putida could grow using aqal as the sole c, n, and p source in media containing 10 vol.%-40 vol.% aqal with the best growth occurring at 20 vol.%. s. cerevisiae could grow under these conditions only if the media were supplemented with glucose. the results indicate that in a biorefinery utilizing algae liquefaction, the aqueous co-product may be recycled via microbial cultures with significantly less dilution than previously published methods.

AB  == in recent years, glycerol has become an attractive carbon source for microbial processes, as it accumulates massively as a by-product of biodiesel production, also resulting in a decline of its price. a potential use of glycerol in biotechnology is the synthesis of poly(3-hydroxypropionate) [poly(3hp)], a biopolymer with promising properties which is not synthesized by any known wild-type organism. in this study, the genes for 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase (dhat) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldd) of pseudomonas putida kt2442, propionate-coenzyme a (propionate-coa) transferase (pct) of clostridium propionicum x2, and polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) synthase (phac1) of ralstonia eutropha h16 were cloned and expressed in the 1,3-propanediol producer shimwellia blattae. in a two-step cultivation process, recombinant s. blattae cells accumulated up to 9.8% +/- 0.4% (wt/wt [cell dry weight]) poly(3hp) with glycerol as the sole carbon source. furthermore, the engineered strain tolerated the application of crude glycerol derived from biodiesel production, yielding a cell  density of 4.05 g cell dry weight/liter in a 2-liter fed-batch fermentation process.

AB  == whereas the biochemical properties of the monooxygenase components that catalyze  the oxidation of 2,5-diketocamphane and 3,6-diketocamphane (2,5-dkcmo and 3,6-dkcmo, respectively) in the initial catabolic steps of (+) and (-) isomeric forms of camphor (cam) metabolism in pseudomonas putida atcc 17453 are relatively well characterized, the actual identity of the flavin reductase (fred) component  that provides the reduced flavin to the oxygenases has hitherto been ill defined. in this study, a 37-kda fred was purified from a camphor-induced culture of p. putida atcc 17453 and this facilitated cloning and characterization of the requisite protein. the active fred is a homodimer with a subunit molecular weight of 18,000 that uses nadh as an electron donor (km = 32 mum), and it catalyzes the reduction of flavin mononucleotide (fmn) (km = 3.6 mum; kcat = 283 s(-1)) in preference to flavin adenine dinucleotide (fad) (km = 19 mum; kcat = 128 s(-1)).  sequence determination of approximately 40 kb of the cam degradation plasmid revealed the locations of two isofunctional 2,5-dkcmo genes (came25-1 for 2,5-dkcmo-1 and came25-2 for 2,5-dkcmo-2) as well as that of a 3,6-dkcmo-encoding gene (came36). in addition, by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, the cam plasmid  was established to be linear and approximately 533 kb in length. to enable functional assessment of the two-component monooxygenase system in baeyer-villiger oxidations, recombinant plasmids expressing fred in tandem with the respective 2,5-dkcmo- and 3,6-dkcmo-encoding genes in escherichia coli were constructed. comparative substrate profiling of the isofunctional 2,5-dckmos did  not yield obvious differences in baeyer-villiger biooxidations, but they are distinct from 3,6-dkcmo in the stereoselective oxygenations with various mono- and bicyclic ketone substrates.

TI  == a comparative analysis of the properties of regulated promoter systems commonly used for recombinant gene expression in escherichia coli.
AB  == background: production of recombinant proteins in bacteria for academic and commercial purposes is a well established field; however the outcomes of process  developments for specific proteins are still often unpredictable. one reason is the limited understanding of the performance of expression cassettes relative to  each other due to different genetic contexts. here we report the results of a systematic study aiming at exclusively comparing commonly used regulator/promoter systems by standardizing the designs of the replicon backbones. results: the vectors used in this study are based on either the rk2- or the pmb1- origin of replication and contain the regulator/promoter regions of xyls/pm (wild-type), xyls/pm ml1-17 (a pm variant), laci/pt7lac, laci/ptrc and arac/pbad to control expression of different proteins with various origins. generally and not unexpected high expression levels correlate with high replicon copy number and the laci/pt7lac system generates more transcript than all the four other cassettes. however, this transcriptional feature does not always lead to a correspondingly more efficient protein production, particularly if protein functionality is considered. in most cases the xyls/pm ml1-17 and laci/pt7lac systems gave rise to the highest amounts of functional protein production, and the xyls/pm ml1-17 is the most flexible in the sense that it does not require any specific features of the host. the arac/pbad system is very good with respect to  tightness, and a commonly used bioinformatics prediction tool (rbs calculator) suggested that it has the most translation-efficient utr. expression was also studied by flow cytometry in individual cells, and the results indicate that cell to cell heterogeneity is very relevant for understanding protein production at the population level. conclusions: the choice of expression system needs to be evaluated for each specific case, but we believe that the standardized vectors developed for this study can be used to more easily identify the nature of case-specific bottlenecks. by then taking into account the relevant characteristics of each expression cassette it will be easier to make the best choice with respect to the goal of achieving high levels of protein expression in functional or non-functional form.

TI  == targeted disinfection of e. coli via bioconjugation to photoreactive tio2.
AB  == the selective control of pathogenic bacteria is an ongoing challenge. a strategy  is proposed that combines targeted binding of the bacterium, using antibodies, with their photoactivated oxidative destruction. photoactive colloidal tio2 was first derivatized with e. coli antibodies (ea-tio2). when mixtures of the organisms e. coli and pseudomonas putida ( p. putida ) were exposed to modified ea-tio2, the particles preferentially selected e. coli for surface binding. two consequences arose from surface bioconjugation: bacteria were found to flocculate upon mixing at appropriate ratios of ea-tio2/ e. coli , and ea-tio2-bound e. coli underwent cell death after exposure to uv light. in the former case, flocculation of the bacteria was optimal at ~50 ea-tio2 particles per e. coli . selective flocculation provides an alternative strategy for pathogen removal. with respect  to uv disinfection, as few as 26 ea-tio2 particles per e. coli gave a 10 000-fold decrease in viable bacteria. thus, it is possible to selectively target and kill  one type of bacteria in a mixture of pathogens. the results give support to the proposal that photocatalytic tio2 most effectively delivers an oxidizing agent when the titania is bound to the bacterial surface.

TI  == proteomic analysis of pseudomonas putida reveals an organic solvent tolerance-related gene mmsb.
AB  == organic solvents are toxic to most microorganisms. however, some organic-solvent-tolerant (ost) bacteria tolerate the destructive effects of organic solvent through various accommodative mechanisms. in this work, we developed an ost adapted strain pseudomonas putida juct1 that could grow in the presence of 60% (v/v) cyclohexane. two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to compare and analyze the total cellular protein of p. putida juct1 growing with or without 60% (v/v) cyclohexane. under different solvent conditions, five high-abundance protein spots whose intensity values show over 60% discrepancies were identified by maldi-tof/tof spectra. specifically, they are arginine deiminase, carbon-nitrogen hydrolase family putative hydrolase, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase, protein chain elongation factor ef-ts, and isochorismatase superfamily hydrolase. the corresponding genes of the latter three proteins, mmsb, tsf, and pseen0851, were separately expressed in escherichia coli to evaluate their effect on ost properties of the host strain. in the presence of 4% (v/v) cyclohexane, e. coli harboring mmsb could grow to 1.70 od(660), whereas cell growth of e. coli jm109 (the control) was completely inhibited by 2% (v/v) cyclohexane. transformants carrying tsf or pseen0851 also showed an increased resistance to cyclohexane and other organic solvents compared with the control. of these three genes, mmsb exhibited the most prominent effect  on increasing ost of e. coli. less oxidation product of cyclohexane was detected  because mmsb transformants might help keep a lower intracellular cyclohexane level. this study demonstrates a feasible approach for elucidating ost mechanisms of microorganisms, and provides molecular basis to construct organic-solvent-tolerant strains for industrial applications.

TI  == taxis of pseudomonas putida f1 toward phenylacetic acid is mediated by the energy taxis receptor aer2.
AB  == the phenylacetic acid (paa) degradation pathway is a widely distributed funneling pathway for the catabolism of aromatic compounds, including the environmental pollutants styrene and ethylbenzene. however, bacterial chemotaxis to paa has not been studied. the chemotactic strain pseudomonas putida f1 has the ability to utilize paa as a sole carbon and energy source. we identified a putative paa degradation gene cluster (paa) in p. putida f1 and demonstrated that paa serves as a chemoattractant. the chemotactic response was induced during growth with paa and was dependent on paa metabolism. a functional chea gene was required for the  response, indicating that paa is sensed through the conserved chemotaxis signal transduction system. a p. putida f1 mutant lacking the energy taxis receptor aer2 was deficient in paa taxis, indicating that aer2 is responsible for mediating the response to paa. the requirement for metabolism and the role of aer2 in the response indicate that p. putida f1 uses energy taxis to detect paa. we also revealed that paa is an attractant for escherichia coli; however, a mutant lacking a functional aer energy receptor had a wild-type response to paa in swim  plate assays, suggesting that paa is detected through a different mechanism in e. coli. the role of aer2 as an energy taxis receptor provides the potential to sense a broad range of aromatic growth substrates as chemoattractants. since chemotaxis has been shown to enhance the biodegradation of toxic pollutants, the  ability to sense paa gradients may have implications for the bioremediation of aromatic hydrocarbons that are degraded via the paa pathway.

AB  == novel multifunctional bioresponsive gelatin and alginate based hydrogels with in-built antioxidant regenerating system and antimicrobial properties were successfully synthesized. these hydrogels are based on the versatile reactions catalyzed by cellobiose dehydrogenase (cdh). cdh uses cellobiose and cello-oligosacharides as electron donors to reduce oxidized phenolic antioxidants, quinones, or molecular oxygen to h(2)o(2) (a well-known antimicrobial agent). the antioxidant regenerating system consisting of cdh and cellobiose increased the ability of catechol to quench nitric oxide (no), superoxide (o(2)(-)) and hydroxyl radicals (oh*) in solution and when incorporated into hydrogels. the cdh loaded into the hydrogels free of oxidized phenolic antioxidants and quinones reduced molecular to h(2)o(2) resulting in the complete inhibition of the growth of stapylococcus aeureus, bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas putida, escherichia coli and cellulomonasmicrobium cellulans. this study therefore presents a new concept for synthesizing multifunctional bioresponsive chronic wound dressing polymers with in-built continuous antioxidant system able to continuously quench [reactive oxygen species (ros) and reactive nitrogen species (rnos)], and antimicrobial properties able to prevent microbial colonization of wound.

AB  == aims: to elucidate the mechanism of action of a nonchemical microbial control technology employing coupled hydrodynamic and ultrasound-induced stress. methods  & results: the effects of a laboratory model system using a commercial nonchemical device on pseudomonas putida revealed growth and respiration were inhibited without a loss of viability from the treated population. damage to cell membranes was evident using fluorescent microscopy and a reporter strain containing lux genes fused with a membrane damage stress-response promoter. other reporter strains also indicated the possible involvement of dna and protein repair systems. a consequence of treatment was a reduced ability to form biofilms. conclusions: the nonchemical device caused a biostatic effect on treated cells induced by sublethal damage to several cellular systems, including  cell membranes. significance and impact of the study: the study demonstrates that biostasis can be an effective mechanism for microbial control in some industrial  systems and provides insight into understanding and applying this device and other nonchemical microbial control technologies to real-world problems of microbial contamination.

TI  == the biology of habitat dominance; can microbes behave as weeds?
AB  == competition between microbial species is a product of, yet can lead to a reduction in, the microbial diversity of specific habitats. microbial habitats can resemble ecological battlefields where microbial cells struggle to dominate and/or annihilate each other and we explore the hypothesis that (like plant weeds) some microbes are genetically hard-wired to behave in a vigorous and ecologically aggressive manner. these 'microbial weeds' are able to dominate the  communities that develop in fertile but uncolonized--or at least partially vacant--habitats via traits enabling them to out-grow competitors; robust tolerances to habitat-relevant stress parameters and highly efficient energy-generation systems; avoidance of or resistance to viral infection, predation and grazers; potent antimicrobial systems; and exceptional abilities to sequester and store resources. in addition, those associated with nutritionally complex habitats are extraordinarily versatile in their utilization of diverse substrates. weed species typically deploy multiple types of antimicrobial including toxins; volatile organic compounds that act as either hydrophobic or highly chaotropic stressors; biosurfactants; organic acids; and moderately chaotropic solutes that are produced in bulk quantities (e.g. acetone, ethanol).  whereas ability to dominate communities is habitat-specific we suggest that some  microbial species are archetypal weeds including generalists such as: pichia anomala, acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas putida; specialists such as dunaliella salina, saccharomyces cerevisiae, lactobacillus spp. and other lactic  acid bacteria; freshwater autotrophs gonyostomum semen and microcystis aeruginosa; obligate anaerobes such as clostridium acetobutylicum; facultative pathogens such as rhodotorula mucilaginosa, pantoea ananatis and pseudomonas aeruginosa; and other extremotolerant and extremophilic microbes such as aspergillus spp., salinibacter ruber and haloquadratum walsbyi. some microbes, such as escherichia coli, mycobacterium smegmatis and pseudoxylaria spp., exhibit characteristics of both weed and non-weed species. we propose that the concept of nonweeds represents a 'dustbin' group that includes species such as synodropsis spp., polypaecilum pisce, metschnikowia orientalis, salmonella spp., and caulobacter crescentus. we show that microbial weeds are conceptually distinct from plant weeds, microbial copiotrophs, r-strategists, and other ecophysiological groups of microorganism. microbial weed species are unlikely to  emerge from stationary-phase or other types of closed communities; it is open habitats that select for weed phenotypes. specific characteristics that are common to diverse types of open habitat are identified, and implications of weed  biology and open-habitat ecology are discussed in the context of further studies  needed in the fields of environmental and applied microbiology.

TI  == cloning of a novel nicotine oxidase gene from pseudomonas sp. strain hzn6 whose product nonenantioselectively degrades nicotine to pseudooxynicotine.
AB  == pseudomonas sp. strain hzn6 utilizes nicotine as its sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy. however, its catabolic mechanism has not been elucidated. in this study, self-formed adaptor pcr was performed to amplify the upstream sequence of the pseudooxynicotine amine oxidase gene. a 1,437-bp open reading frame (designated nox) was found to encode a nicotine oxidase (nox) that shows 30% amino acid sequence identity with 6-hydroxy-l-nicotine oxidase from arthrobacter nicotinovorans. the nox gene was cloned into a broad-host-range cloning vector and transferred into the non-nicotine-degrading bacteria escherichia coli dh5alpha (dh-nox) and pseudomonas putida kt2440 (kt-nox). the transconjugant kt-nox obtained nicotine degradation ability and yielded an equimolar amount of pseudooxynicotine, while dh-nox did not. reverse transcription-pcr showed that the nox gene is expressed in both dh5alpha and kt2440, suggesting that additional factors required for nicotine degradation are  present in a pseudomonas strain(s), but not in e. coli. the mutant of strain hzn6 with nox disrupted lost the ability to degrade nicotine, but not pseudooxynicotine. these results suggested that the nox gene is responsible for the first step of nicotine degradation. the (rs)-nicotine degradation results showed that the two enantiomers were degraded at approximately the same rate, indicating that nox does not show chiral selectivity. site-directed mutagenesis revealed that both the conserved flavin adenine dinucleotide (fad)-binding gxgxxg motif and his456 are essential for nicotine degradation activity.

TI  == the entner-doudoroff pathway empowers pseudomonas putida kt2440 with a high tolerance to oxidative stress.
AB  == glucose catabolism of pseudomonas putida is carried out exclusively through the entner-doudoroff (ed) pathway due to the absence of 6-phosphofructokinase. in order to activate the embden-meyerhof-parnas (emp) route we transferred the pfka  gene from escherichia coli to a p. putida wild-type strain as well as to an eda mutant, i.e. lacking 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase. pfka(e. coli) failed to redirect the carbon flow from the ed route towards the emp pathway, suggesting that ed was essential for sugar catabolism. the presence of pfka(e. coli) was detrimental for growth, which could be traced to the reduction of atp and nad(p)h pools along with alteration of the nad(p)h/nadp(+) ratio. pseudomonas putida cells carrying pfka(e. coli) became highly sensitive to diamide and hydrogen peroxide, the response to which is very demanding of nadph. the inhibitory effect of pfka(e. coli) could in part be relieved by methionine, the synthesis of which relies much on nadph. these results expose the role of the ed  pathway for generating the redox currency (nadph) that is required for counteracting oxidative stress. it is thus likely that environmental bacteria that favour the ed pathway over the emp pathway do so in order to gear their aerobic metabolism to endure oxidative-related insults.

TI  == engineering escherichia coli for renewable production of the 5-carbon polyamide building-blocks 5-aminovalerate and glutarate.
AB  == through metabolic pathway engineering, novel microbial biocatalysts can be engineered to convert renewable resources into useful chemicals, including monomer building-blocks for bioplastics production. here we describe the systematic engineering of escherichia coli to produce, as individual products, two 5-carbon polyamide building blocks, namely 5-aminovalerate (amv) and glutarate. the modular pathways were derived using "parts" from the natural lysine degradation pathway of pseudomonas putida kt2440. endogenous over-production of the required precursor, lysine, was first achieved through metabolic deregulation of its biosynthesis pathway by introducing feedback resistant mutants of aspartate kinase iii and dihydrodipicolinate synthase. further disruption of native lysine decarboxylase activity (by deleting cada and  ldcc) limited cadaverine by-product formation, enabling lysine production to 2.25 g/l at a glucose yield of 138 mmol/mol (18% of theoretical). co-expression of lysine monooxygenase and 5-aminovaleramide amidohydrolase (encoded by davba) then resulted in the production of 0.86 g/l amv in 48 h. finally, the additional co-expression of glutaric semialdehyde dehydrogenase and 5-aminovalerate aminotransferase (encoded by davdt) led to the production of 0.82 g/l glutarate under the same conditions. at this output, yields on glucose were 71 and 68 mmol/mol for amv and glutarate (9.5 and 9.1% of theoretical), respectively. these findings further expand the number and diversity of polyamide monomers that can be derived directly from renewable resources.

AB  == 5-aminovalerate (5ava) is the precursor of valerolactam, a potential building block for producing nylon 5, and is a c5 platform chemical for synthesizing 5-hydroxyvalerate, glutarate, and 1,5-pentanediol. escherichia coli was metabolically engineered for the production of 5-aminovalerate (5ava) and glutarate. when the recombinant e. coli wl3110 strain expressing the pseudomonas  putidadavab genes encoding delta-aminovaleramidase and lysine 2-monooxygenase, respectively, were cultured in a medium containing 20g/l of glucose and 10g/l of  l-lysine, 3.6g/l of 5ava was produced by converting 7g/l of l-lysine. when the davab genes were introduced into recombinant e. coli strainxq56allowing enhanced  l-lysine synthesis, 0.27 and 0.5g/l of 5ava were produced directly from glucose by batch and fed-batch cultures, respectively. further conversion of 5ava into glutarate could be demonstrated by expression of the p. putida gabtd genes encoding 5ava aminotransferase and glutarate semialdehyde dehydrogenase. when recombinant e. coli wl3110 strain expressing the davab and gabtd genes was cultured in a medium containing 20g/l glucose, 10g/l l-lysine and 10g/l alpha-ketoglutarate, 1.7g/l of glutarate was produced.

TI  == whole-cell-based cyp153a6-catalyzed (s)-limonene hydroxylation efficiency depends on host background and profits from monoterpene uptake via alkl.
AB  == living microbial cells are considered to be the catalyst of choice for selective  terpene functionalization. however, such processes often suffer from side product formation and poor substrate mass transfer into cells. for the hydroxylation of (s)-limonene to (s)-perillyl alcohol by pseudomonas putida kt2440 (pgec47deltab)(pcom8-pfr1500), containing the cytochrome p450 monooxygenase cyp153a6, the side products perillyl aldehyde and perillic acid constituted up to 26% of the total amount of oxidized terpenes. in this study, it is shown that the reaction rate is substrate-limited in the two-liquid phase system used and that host intrinsic dehydrogenases and not cyp153a6 are responsible for the formation  of the undesired side products. in contrast to p. putida kt2440, e. coli w3110 was found to catalyze perillyl aldehyde reduction to the alcohol and no oxidation to the acid. furthermore, e. coli w3110 harboring cyp153a6 showed high limonene hydroxylation activities (7.1 u g cdw-1). the outer membrane protein alkl was found to enhance hydroxylation activities of e. coli twofold in aqueous single-phase and fivefold in two-liquid phase biotransformations. in the latter system, e. coli harboring cyp153a6 and alkl produced up to 39.2 mmol (s)-perillyl alcohol l tot-1 within 26 h, whereas no perillic acid and minor amounts of perillyl aldehyde (8% of the total products) were formed. in conclusion, undesired perillyl alcohol oxidation was reduced by choosing e. coli's enzymatic  background as a reaction environment and co-expression of the alkl gene in e. coli represents a promising strategy to enhance terpene bioconversion rates.

TI  == evidence for lignin oxidation by the giant panda fecal microbiome.
AB  == the digestion of lignin and lignin-related phenolic compounds from bamboo by giant pandas has puzzled scientists because of the lack of lignin-degrading genes in the genome of the bamboo-feeding animals. we constructed a 16s rrna gene library from the microorganisms derived from the giant panda feces to identify the possibility for the presence of potential lignin-degrading bacteria. phylogenetic analysis showed that the phylotypes of the intestinal bacteria were  affiliated with the phyla proteobacteria (53%) and firmicutes (47%). two phylotypes were affiliated with the known lignin-degrading bacterium pseudomonas  putida and the mangrove forest bacteria. to test the hypothesis that microbes in  the giant panda gut help degrade lignin, a metagenomic library of the intestinal  bacteria was constructed and screened for clones that contained genes encoding laccase, a lignin-degrading related enzyme. a multicopper oxidase gene, designated as lac51, was identified from a metagenomic clone. sequence analysis and copper content determination indicated that lac51 is a laccase rather than a  metallo-oxidase and may work outside its original host cell because it has a tat-type signal peptide and a transmembrane segment at its n-terminus. lac51 oxidizes a variety of lignin-related phenolic compounds, including syringaldazine, 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, ferulic acid, veratryl alcohol, guaiacol, and sinapinic acid at conditions that simulate the physiologic environment in giant panda intestines. furthermore, in the presence of 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (abts), syringic acid, or  ferulic acid as mediators, the oxidative ability of lac51 on lignin was promoted. the absorbance of lignin at 445 nm decreased to 36% for abts, 51% for syringic acid, and 51% for ferulic acid after incubation for 10 h. our findings demonstrate that the intestinal bacteria of giant pandas may facilitate the oxidation of lignin moieties, thereby clarifying the digestion of bamboo lignin by the animal.

TI  == characterization of the transcriptional stimulatory properties of the pseudomonas putida rapa protein.
AB  == rna polymerase-associated factors can significantly affect its performance at specific promoters. here we identified a pseudomonas putida rna polymerases-associated protein as a homolog of escherichia coli rapa. we found that p. putida rapa stimulates the transcription from promoters dependent on a variety of sigma-factors (sigma(70), sigma(s), sigma(54), sigma(32), sigma(e)) in vitro. the level of stimulation varied from 2- to 10-fold, with the maximal effect observed with the sigma(e)-dependent phtra promoter. stimulation by rapa was apparent in the multi-round reactions and was modulated by salt concentration in vitro. however, in contrast to findings with e. coli rapa, p. putida rapa-mediated stimulation of transcription was also evident using linear templates. these properties of p. putida rapa were apparent using either e. coli- or p. putida-derived rna polymerases. analysis of individual steps of transcription revealed that p. putida rapa enhances the stability of competitor-resistant open-complexes formed by rna polymerase at promoters. in vivo, p. putida rapa can complement the inhibitory effect of high salt on growth  of an e. coli rapa null strain. however, a p. putida rapa null mutant was not sensitive to high salt. the in vivo effects of lack of rapa were only detectable  for the sigma(e)-phtra promoter where the rapa-deficiency resulted in lower activity. the presented characteristics of p. putida rapa indicate that its functions may extend beyond a role in facilitating rna polymerase recycling to include a role in transcription initiation efficiency.

AB  == bacterial attachment on solid surfaces has various implications in environmental, industrial and medical applications. in this study, the effects of rhamnolipid biosurfactants on initial attachment of bacteria on hydrophilic glass and hydrophobic octadecyltrichlorosilane (ots) modified glass were evaluated under continuous-flow conditions. the bacteria investigated were three gram-negative species pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, and escherichia coli, and two gram-positive species staphylcoccus epidermidis and bacillus subtilis. rhamnolipids, at 10 and 200 mg/l, significantly reduced the attachment of all but s. epidermidis on both glass and ots-modified glass. for s. epidermidis rhamnolipids reduced the attachment on ots-modified glass but not on glass. studies were further done to identify the mechanism(s) by which rhamnolipids reduced the cell attachment. the following potential properties of rhamnolipids were investigated: inhibition of microbial growth, change of cell surface hydrophobicity, easier detachment of cells already attached to substratum, and modification of substratum surface properties. results showed that rhamnolipids were ineffective for the latter two effects. rhamnolipids, up to 200mg/l, inhibited the growth of b. subtilis, s. epidermidis and p. aeruginosa pao1 but not the growth of e. coli, p. putida and p. aeruginosa e0340. also, rhamnolipids  tended to increase the hydrophobicity of p. aeruginosa pao1 and e. coli, decrease the hydrophobicity of p. putida and s. epidermidis, and have no clear effect on the hydrophobicity of b. subtillis. these trends however did not correlate with the observed trend of cell attachment reduction. the responsible mechanism(s) remained unknown.

TI  == engineering an anaerobic metabolic regime in pseudomonas putida kt2440 for the anoxic biodegradation of 1,3-dichloroprop-1-ene.
AB  == pseudomonas putida kt2440, a microbial cell factory of reference for industrial whole-cell biocatalysis, is unable to support biochemical reactions that occur under anoxic conditions, limiting its utility for a large number of relevant biotransformations. unlike (facultative) anaerobes, p. putida resorts to nadh oxidation via an oxic respiratory chain and completely lacks a true fermentation  metabolism. therefore, it cannot achieve the correct balances of energy and redox couples (i.e., atp/adp and nadh/nad(+)) that are required to sustain an o(2)-free lifestyle. to overcome this state of affairs, the acetate kinase (acka) gene of the facultative anaerobe escherichia coli and the pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase ii (adhb) genes of the aerotolerant zymomonas mobilis were knocked-in to a wild-type p. putida strain. biochemical and genetic assays showed that conditional expression of the entire enzyme set allowed the engineered bacteria to adopt an anoxic regime that maintained considerable metabolic activity. the resulting strain was exploited as a host for the heterologous expression of a 1,3-dichloroprop-1-ene degradation pathway recruited from pseudomonas pavonaceae 170, enabling the recombinants to degrade this recalcitrant chlorinated compound anoxically. these results underscore the value  of p. putida as a versatile agent for biotransformations able to function at progressively lower redox statuses.

TI  == structural basis for outer membrane sugar uptake in pseudomonads.
AB  == substrate-specific outer membrane channels of gram-negative bacteria mediate uptake of many small molecules, including carbohydrates. the mechanism of sugar uptake by enterobacterial channels, such as escherichia coli lamb (maltoporin), has been characterized in great detail. in pseudomonads and related organisms, sugar uptake is not mediated by lamb but by oprb channels. beyond the notion that oprb channels seem to prefer monosaccharides as substrates, very little is known  about oprb-mediated sugar uptake. here i report the x-ray crystal structure of an oprb channel from pseudomonas putida f1. the structure shows that oprb forms a monomeric, 16-stranded beta-barrel with a constriction formed by extracellular loops l2 and l3. the side chains of two highly conserved arginine residues (arg(83) and arg(110)) and a conserved glutamate (glu(106)) line the channel constriction and interact with a bound glucose molecule. liposome swelling uptake assays show a strong preference for monosaccharide transport over disaccharides.  moreover, substrates with a net negative charge are disfavored by the channel, probably due to the negatively charged character of the constriction. the architecture of the eyelet and the absence of a greasy slide provide an explanation for the observed specificity of oprb for monosaccharides rather than  the oligosaccharides preferred by lamb and related enterobacterial channels.

AB  == the present study evaluated the toxic potential and physicochemical characteristics of waste water generated in nitrocellulose production, including  effluents from delignification, bleaching, nitration and mixture (composed of these three effluents), from a plant in the paraiba valley, sao paulo, brazil. the test organisms used for toxicity assays were daphnia similis, danio rerio, escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida and pseudokircheneriella subcaptata. the results showed that the effluents analyzed present acute and chronic toxicity for the organisms tested. nitration effluent was the least toxic, while delignification and bleaching effluents were the most toxic. the naturally occurring pollutants in wood fiber and cotton, like lignin, probably contributed  to effluents toxicity, in addition to higher concentrations of total dissolved solids, which are in non-compliance with brazilian legislation, conductivity, chemical oxygen demand and color. the discharge of nitrocellulose effluent into an aquatic environment should only occur after appropriate treatment, due to their toxic characteristics.

TI  == strong stimulation of recombinant protein production in escherichia coli by combining stimulatory control elements in an expression cassette.
AB  == background: the xyls/pm expression system has been used to produce recombinant proteins at industrial levels in escherichia coli. activation of transcription from the pm promoter takes place in the presence of benzoic acid or derivatives of it. previous mutagenesis studies resulted in identification of several variants of the expression control elements xyls (x), pm (p) and the 5'-untranslated region (u) that individually gave rise to strongly stimulated expression. the goal of this study was to test if combination of such stimulatory mutations in the same expression vectors would lead to further increase of expression levels. results: we combined x, p and u variants that were originally  identified due to their ability to strongly stimulate expression of the reporter  gene bla (resistance to penicillin). combination of optimized elements stimulated bla expression up to 75-fold (x, p and u combined) relative to the wild-type system, while accumulated transcript levels increased about 50-fold. this is much more than for the elements individually. we also tested combination of the variant elements on two other and unrelated genes, celb (encoding phosphoglucomutase) and the human growth factor gene gm-csf. protein production from these genes is much more efficient than from bla in the wild-type system, but expression was still significantly stimulated by the combination of x, p and  u variants, although not to the same extent as for bla. we also integrated a single copy of the expression cassette with each gene into the e. coli chromosome and found that the expression level from this single copy was higher for bla than for the wild-type plasmid system, while it was lower for celb and gm-csf. conclusion: our results show that combination of stimulatory expression control elements can be used to further increase production of different proteins in e. coli. for one reporter gene (bla) this allowed for more protein production from a single gene copy integrated on the chromosome, compared to the wild-type plasmid  system. the approach described here should in principle be applicable for improvement of any expression cassette.

TI  == deepening tol and tou catabolic pathways of pseudomonas sp. ox1: cloning, sequencing and characterization of the lower pathways.
AB  == pseudomonas sp. ox1 is able to metabolize toluene and o-xylene through the tou catabolic pathway, whereas its mutant m1 strain was found to be able to use m- and p-xylene as carbon and energy source, using the tol catabolic pathway. here we report the complete nucleotide sequence of the phe lower operon of the tou catabolic pathway, and the sequence of the last four genes of the xyl-like lower  operon of the tol catabolic pathway. dna sequence analysis shows the gene order within the operons to be phecdefghi (phe operon) and xyl-likeqkih (xyl-like operon), identical to the order found for the isofunctional genes of meta operons in the toluene/xylene pathway of tol plasmid pww0 from pseudomonas putida mt-2 and the phenol/methylphenol pathway of pvil50 from pseudomonas sp. cf600. the nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences are homologous to the equivalent  gene and enzyme sequences from other pseudomonas meta pathways. recombinant 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (hmsd) and 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase (hmsh), coded by phecd genes, respectively, and ada and hoa enzymes from both phe and xyl operons were expressed in e. coli and steady-state kinetic analysis was carried out. the analysis of the kinetic parameters of hmsd and hmsh showed that the enzymes from pseudomonas sp. ox1 are  more specialized to channel metabolites into the two branches of the lower pathway than homologous enzymes from other pseudomonads. the kinetics parameters  of recombinant ada from phe and xyl-like operon were found to be similar to those of homologous enzymes from other pseudomonas strains. in addition, the enzyme from xyl-like operon showed a substrate affinity three times higher than the enzyme from phe operon.

TI  == production of medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates by sequential feeding of  xylose and octanoic acid in engineered pseudomonas putida kt2440.
AB  == background: pseudomonas putida kt2440 is able to synthesize large amounts of medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates (mcl-phas). to reduce the substrate cost, which represents nearly 50% of the total pha production cost, xylose, a hemicellulose derivate, was tested as the growth carbon source in an engineered p. putida kt2440 strain. results: the genes encoding xylose isomerase (xyla) and  xylulokinase (xylb) from escherichia coli w3110 were introduced into p. putida kt2440. the recombinant kt2440 exhibited a xyla activity of 1.47 u and a xylb activity of 0.97 u when grown on a defined medium supplemented with xylose. the cells reached a maximum specific growth rate of 0.24 h(-1) and a final cell dry weight (cdw) of 2.5 g l(-1) with a maximal yield of 0.5 g cdw g(-1) xylose. since no mcl-pha was accumulated from xylose, mcl-pha production can be controlled by the addition of fatty acids leading to tailor-made pha compositions. sequential feeding strategy was applied using xylose as the growth substrate and octanoic acid as the precursor for mcl-pha production. in this way, up to 20% w w(-1) of mcl-pha was obtained. a yield of 0.37 g mcl-pha per g octanoic acid was achieved  under the employed conditions. conclusions: sequential feeding of relatively cheap carbohydrates and expensive fatty acids is a practical way to achieve more  cost-effective mcl-pha production. this study is the first reported attempt to produce mcl-pha by using xylose as the growth substrate. further process optimizations to achieve higher cell density and higher productivity of mcl-pha should be investigated. these scientific exercises will undoubtedly contribute to the economic feasibility of mcl-pha production from renewable feedstock.

TI  == construction and application of an escherichia coli bioreporter for aniline and chloroaniline detection.
AB  == aniline and chlorinated anilines (cas) are classified as priority pollutants; therefore, an effective method for detection and monitoring is required. in this  study, a green-fluorescence protein-based bioreporter for the detection of aniline and cas was constructed in escherichia coli dh5alpha, characterized and tested with soil and wastewater. the sensing capability relied on the regulatory  control between a two-component regulatory protein, tods/todt, and the p( todx )  promoter of pseudomonas putida t-57 (ppt57), since the gene expression of tods, todt, and todc2 are positively induced with 4-chloroaniline. the bioreporter system (dh5alpha/ppxgfp-ptodst) is markedly unique with the two co-existing plasmids. the inducibility of the fluorescence response was culture-medium- and time-dependent. cells grown in m9g medium exhibited a low background fluorescence level and were readily induced by 4ca after 3-h exposure, reaching the maximum induction level at 9 h. when tested with benzene, toluene, ethyl-benzene and xylene, aniline and cas, the response data were best fit by a sigmoidal dose-response relationship, from which the k((1/2)) value was determined for the  positive effectors. 3ca and 4ca were relatively powerful inducers, while some poly-chlorinated anilines could also induce green fluorescence protein expression. the results indicated a broader recognition range of ppt57'stodst than previously reported for p. putida. the test results with environmental samples were reliable, indicating the potential application of this bioreporter in the ecotoxicology assessment and bioremediation of areas contaminated with aniline- and/or cas.

TI  == the oxidation of alkylaryl sulfides and benzo[b]thiophenes by escherichia coli cells expressing wild-type and engineered styrene monooxygenase from pseudomonas  putida ca-3.
AB  == nine different sulfur-containing compounds were biotransformed to the corresponding sulfoxides by escherichia coli bl21(de3) cells expressing styrene monooxygenase (smo) from pseudomonas putida ca-3. thioanisole was consumed at 83.3 mumoles min(-1) g cell dry weight(-1) resulting mainly in the formation of r-thioanisole sulfoxide with an enantiomeric excess (ee) value of 45 %. the rate  of 2-methyl-, 2-chloro- and 2-bromo-thioanisole consumption was 2-fold lower than that of thioanisole. surprisingly, the 2-methylthioanisole sulfoxide product had  the opposite (s) configuration to that of the other 2-substituted thioanisole derivatives and had a higher ee value (84 %). the rate of oxidation of 4-substituted thioanisoles was higher than the corresponding 2-substituted substrates but the ee values of the products were consistently lower (10-23 %). the rate of benzo[b]thiophene and 2-methylbenzo[b]thiophene sulfoxidation was approximately 10-fold lower than that of thioanisole. the ee value of the benzo[b]thiophene sulfoxide could not be determined as the product racemized rapidly. e. coli cells expressing an engineered smo (smoeng r3-11) oxidised 2-substituted thioanisoles between 1.8- and 2.8-fold faster compared to cells expressing the wild-type enzyme. smoeng r3-11 oxidised benzo[b]thiophene and 2-methylbenzo[b]thiophene 10.1 and 5.6 times faster that the wild-type enzyme. the stereospecificity of the reaction catalysed by smoeng was unchanged from that of the wild type. using the x-ray crystal structure of the p. putida s12 smo, it  was evident that the entrance of substrates into the smo active site is limited by the binding pocket bottleneck formed by the side chains of val-211 and asn-46  carboxyamide group.

TI  == microbial d-xylonate production.
AB  == d-xylonic acid is a versatile platform chemical with reported applications as complexing agent or chelator, in dispersal of concrete, and as a precursor for compounds such as co-polyamides, polyesters, hydrogels and 1,2,4-butanetriol. with increasing glucose prices, d-xylonic acid may provide a cheap, non-food derived alternative for gluconic acid, which is widely used (about 80 kton/year)  in pharmaceuticals, food products, solvents, adhesives, dyes, paints and polishes. large-scale production has not been developed, reflecting the current limited market for d-xylonate. d-xylonic acid occurs naturally, being formed in the first step of oxidative metabolism of d-xylose by some archaea and bacteria via the action of d-xylose or d-glucose dehydrogenases. high extracellular concentrations of d-xylonate have been reported for various bacteria, in particular gluconobacter oxydans and pseudomonas putida. high yields of d-xylonate from d-xylose make g. oxydans an attractive choice for biotechnical production. g. oxydans is able to produce d-xylonate directly from plant biomass  hydrolysates, but rates and yields are reduced because of sensitivity to hydrolysate inhibitors. recently, d-xylonate has been produced by the genetically modified bacterium escherichia coli and yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and kluyveromyces lactis. expression of nad(+)-dependent d-xylose dehydrogenase of caulobacter crescentus in either e. coli or in a robust, hydrolysate-tolerant, industrial saccharomyces cerevisiae strain has resulted in d-xylonate titres, which are comparable to those seen with g. oxydans, at a volumetric rate approximately 30% of that observed with g. oxydans. with further development, genetically modified microbes may soon provide an alternative for production of d-xylonate at industrial scale.

TI  == surface-enhanced raman scattering (sers) revealing chemical variation during biofilm formation: from initial attachment to mature biofilm.
AB  == surface-enhanced raman scattering (sers) has recently been proved to be a promising technique for characterizing the chemical composition of the biofilm matrix. in the present study, to fully understand the chemical variations during  biofilm formation, sers based on silver colloidal nanoparticles was applied to evaluate the chemical components in the matrix of biofilm at different growth phases, including initial attached bacteria, colonies, and mature biofilm. meanwhile, atomic force microscopy was also applied to study the changes of biofilm morphology. three model bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, and bacillus subtilis, were used to cultivate biofilms. the results showed that the content of carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids in the biofilm matrix increased significantly along with the biofilm growth of the three bacteria judging from the intensities and appearance probabilities of related marker peaks in the sers spectra. the content of lipids, however, only increased  in the gram-negative biofilms (e. coli and p. putida) rather than the gram-positive biofilm (b. subtilis). our findings strongly suggest the sers has significant potential for studying chemical variations during biofilm formation.

AB  == the aim of this study was to explore the influence of a moderate static magnetic  field (smf) of different densities on escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida that are commonly found in wastewater treatment plants. in line with literature reports that smf increases the efficiency of wastewater treatment the findings of this study indicated that smf negatively influenced the growth but positively influenced the enzymatic activities and atp levels of the two model bacteria. the inhibitory effect of smf on growth of e. coli and p. putida was most pronounced at their optimal growth temperature (37 degrees c and 28 degrees c respectively)  and was reversible shortly after the smf had been terminated. finally, the results suggested that the induced energy metabolism reflected in higher dehydrogenase activities and atp levels may be more important for survival, and adaptation to smf induced stress than the increase in the expression of the rpos  gene.

TI  == pseudomonas putida pydr, a rutr-like transcriptional regulator, represses the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase gene in the pyrimidine reductive catabolic pathway.
AB  == the pyrimidine reductive catabolic pathway is important for the utilization of uracil and thymine as sources of nitrogen and carbon. the pathway is controlled by three enzymes: dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (dpd), dihydropyrimidinase and  beta-alanine synthase. the putative dpd genes, pydx and pyda, are tandemly arranged in the pseudomonas putida genome. intriguingly, a putative transcriptional regulator, pydr, homologous to escherichia coli rutr, a repressor of the rut-dependent pyrimidine degradation pathway, is located downstream of pydx and pyda. in this study, we show that a pyda strain of p. putida fails to grow on a minimal media containing uracil or thymine as a sole nitrogen source, demonstrating the physiological importance of dpd in the reductive pathway. the expression of pyda and dpd activity in the absence of uracil were significantly higher in a pydr strain than in the wild-type strain, indicating that pydr acts as a repressor of the pyrimidine reductive pathway in p. putida. phylogenetic analysis of rutr and pydr suggests that these homologous repressors may have evolved from a common ancestral protein that regulates pyrimidine degradation.

TI  == a chemoreceptor from pseudomonas putida forms active signalling complexes in escherichia coli.
AB  == chemoreceptors sense environmental stimuli and transmit the information to the flagellar motors via a histidine kinase that controls the phosphorylation level of the effector protein chey. the cytoplasmic domain of chemoreceptors consists of a long alpha-helical hairpin that forms, in the dimer, a coiled-coil four-helix bundle. even though the sequence and general structure of the cytoplasmic domain are strongly conserved within eubacteria and archaea, the total length of the alpha-helical hairpin is variable and defines seven classes of chemoreceptors. in this work we assessed the functional properties of a pseudomonas receptor when assembled in signalling complexes with escherichia coli proteins. our results show that the foreign receptor does not confer fully chemotactic abilities upon e. coli cells, but is able to form active ternary complexes that respond to the specific stimuli by modulating the activity of the  associated kinase. the observed responses are subject to adaptation, depending on the presence of the methylation enzymes cher and/or cheb. the ability of foreign  receptors to signal through signalling complexes with non-cognate proteins would  allow the use of the well-studied e. coli system to reveal the detection specificity of uncharacterized chemoreceptors from other micro-organisms.

AB  == the obligate predator bdellovibrio bacteriovorus hd100 shows a large set of proteases and other hydrolases as part of its hydrolytic arsenal needed for its predatory life cycle. we present genetic and biochemical evidence that open reading frame (orf) bd3709 of b. bacteriovorus hd100 encodes a novel medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate (mcl-pha) depolymerase (phaz(bd)). the primary structure of phaz(bd) suggests that this enzyme belongs to the alpha/beta-hydrolase fold family and has a typical serine hydrolase catalytic triad (serine-histidine-aspartic acid) in agreement with other pha depolymerases  and lipases. phaz(bd) has been extracellularly produced using different hypersecretor tol-pal mutants of escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida as recombinant hosts. the recombinant phaz(bd) has been characterized, and its biochemical properties have been compared to those of other pha depolymerases. the enzyme behaves as a serine hydrolase that is inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. it is also affected by the reducing agent dithiothreitol and nonionic detergents like tween 80. phaz(bd) is an endoexohydrolase that cleaves both large and small pha molecules, producing mainly dimers but also monomers and trimers. the enzyme specifically degrades mcl-pha and is inactive toward short-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates (scl-pha) like polyhydroxybutyrate (phb). these studies shed light on the potentiality of these predators as sources of new biocatalysts, such as an mcl-pha depolymerase,  for the production of enantiopure hydroxyalkanoic acids and oligomers as building blocks for the synthesis of biobased polymers.

TI  == genetic bioaugmentation as an effective method for in situ bioremediation: functionality of catabolic plasmids following conjugal transfers.
AB  == genetic bioaugmentation is an in situ bioremediation method that stimulates horizontal transfer of catabolic plasmids between exogenous donor cells and indigenous bacteria to increase the biodegradation potential of contaminants. a critical outcome of genetic bioaugmentation is the expression of an active catabolic phenotype upon plasmid conjugation. using a pww0-derivative tol plasmid, we showed that certain genetic characteristics of the recipient bacteria, including genomic guanine-cytosine (g + c) content and phylogeny, may limit the expression of the transferred catabolic pathway. however, such genetic  limitations observed in transconjugants could be overcome by the presence of an additional carbon source. glucose and luria-bertani broth were shown to enhance the toluene degradation rates of transconjugants; these enhancement effects were  dependent on transconjugant genomic g + c contents. based on these observations,  thorough genetic characterization of the indigenous microbial community in the contaminated environment of interest may provide a predictive tool for assessing  the success of genetic bioaugmentation.

TI  == outer membrane protein alkl boosts biocatalytic oxyfunctionalization of hydrophobic substrates in escherichia coli.
AB  == the outer membrane of microbial cells forms an effective barrier for hydrophobic  compounds, potentially causing an uptake limitation for hydrophobic substrates. low bioconversion activities (1.9 u g(cdw)(-1)) have been observed for the omega-oxyfunctionalization of dodecanoic acid methyl ester by recombinant escherichia coli containing the alkane monooxygenase alkbgt of pseudomonas putida gpo1. using fatty acid methyl ester oxygenation as the model reaction, this study investigated strategies to improve bacterial uptake of hydrophobic substrates. admixture of surfactants and cosolvents to improve substrate solubilization did not result in increased oxygenation rates. addition of edta increased the initial dodecanoic acid methyl ester oxygenation activity 2.8-fold. the use of recombinant pseudomonas fluorescens cha0 instead of e. coli resulted in a similar activity increase. however, substrate mass transfer into cells was still found to be limiting. remarkably, the coexpression of the alkl gene of p. putida gpo1 encoding an outer membrane protein with so-far-unknown function increased the dodecanoic acid methyl ester oxygenation activity of recombinant e. coli 28-fold. in a two-liquid-phase bioreactor setup, a 62-fold increase to a maximal activity  of 87 u g(cdw)(-1) was achieved, enabling the accumulation of high titers of terminally oxyfunctionalized products. coexpression of alkl also increased oxygenation activities toward the natural alkbgt substrates octane and nonane, showing for the first time clear evidence for a prominent role of alkl in alkane  degradation. this study demonstrates that alkl is an efficient tool to boost productivities of whole-cell biotransformations involving hydrophobic aliphatic substrates and thus has potential for broad applicability.

TI  == atp-dependent recg helicase is required for the transcriptional regulator oxyr function in pseudomonas species.
AB  == the oxyr gene appears to reside in an operon with the recg helicase gene in many  bacteria, including pathogenic pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas putida. analysis of p. putida transcriptomes shows that many oxyr-controlled genes are regulated by the atp-dependent recg helicase and that recg alone modulates the expression of many genes. we found that purified recg binds to the promoters of many oxyr-controlled genes and that expression of these genes was not induced under conditions of oxidative stress in recg mutants of p. aeruginosa, p. putida, and escherichia coli. in vitro data revealed that promoters containing palindromic sequences are essential for recg binding and that single-strand binding proteins and atp are also needed for recg to promote transcription, whereas a magnesium ion has the opposite effect. the oxyr tetramer preferentially binds to promoters after recg has generated linear dna in the presence of atp; otherwise, the oxyr dimer has higher affinity. this study provides new insights into the mechanism of bacterial transcription by demonstrating that recg might be required for the induction of the oxyr regulon by unwinding palindromic dna for transcription. this work describes a novel bacterial transcriptional function by  recg helicase with oxyr and may provide new targets for controlling pseudomonas species pathogen.

AB  == a plasmid, pta163, in escherichia coli contained an approximately 34-kb gene fragment from pseudomonas putida jyr-1 that included the genes responsible for the metabolism of trans-anethole to protocatechuic acid. three tn5-disrupted open reading frame 10 (orf 10) mutants of plasmid pta163 lost their abilities to catalyze trans-anethole. heterologously expressed orf 10 (1,047 nucleotides [nt]) under a t7 promoter in e. coli catalyzed oxidative cleavage of a propenyl group of trans-anethole to an aldehyde group, resulting in the production of para-anisaldehyde, and this gene was designated tao (trans-anethole oxygenase). the deduced amino acid sequence of tao had the highest identity (34%) to a hypothetical protein of agrobacterium vitis s4 and likely contained a flavin-binding site. preferred incorporation of an oxygen molecule from water into p-anisaldehyde using (18)o-labeling experiments indicated stereo preference  of tao for hydrolysis of the epoxide group. interestingly, unlike the narrow substrate range of isoeugenol monooxygenase from pseudomonas putida ie27 and pseudomonas nitroreducens jin1, tao from p. putida jyr-1 catalyzed isoeugenol, o-methyl isoeugenol, and isosafrole, all of which contain the 2-propenyl functional group on the aromatic ring structure. addition of nad(p)h to the ultrafiltered cell extracts of e. coli (pta163) increased the activity of tao. due to the relaxed substrate range of tao, it may be utilized for the production  of various fragrance compounds from plant phenylpropanoids in the future.

TI  == implantation of unmarked regulatory and metabolic modules in gram-negative bacteria with specialised mini-transposon delivery vectors.
AB  == engineering of robust and safe microbial cell factories requires genetic tools somewhat different from those traditionally used for laboratory-adapted microorganisms. we took advantage of the properties of broad-host-range mini-tn5  vectors and two regulated expression systems (laci(q)/p(trc) and xyls/pm), together with frt-flanked, excisable antibiotic resistance determinants, to generate a set of vectors for the delivery of gene(s) into the chromosome of gram-negative bacteria. this arrangement of modular elements allows the cloning and subsequent markerless insertion of expression cargoes and leaves behind an antibiotic-sensitive host upon the action of the yeast flp recombinase. we engineered a pseudomonas putida kt2440 pm::gfp strain that displayed strong fluorescence upon exposure to 3-methylbenzoate, a xyls effector, and allowed us to examine the performance of the pm promoter at the single cell level. we also reconstructed a device for sugar transport and phosphorylation in escherichia coli independent of the native phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system by the stable implantation of genes derived from the obligate anaerobe zymomonas mobilis. in both cases, the information carried by the implanted genes  was stably inherited in the absence of any selective pressure. deliverable expression systems such as those described here will enhance the applicability of various gram-negative bacteria in biocatalysis and environmental bioremediation.

AB  == we have cloned a gene encoding an aldehyde oxidase (alod) oxidized glyoxal but not glyoxylic acid from pseudomonas sp. aiu 362. the alod gene contained an open  reading frame consisting of 888 nucleotides corresponding to 295 amino acid residues. the deduced amino acid sequence exhibited a high similarity to those of 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenases (3-hibdhs). we expressed the cloned gene as an active product in escherichia coli bl21 cells. the productivity (total units per culture broth volume) of the recombinant alod expressed in e. coli bl21 was 20,000-fold higher than that of alod in pseudomonas sp. aiu 362. the recombinant  alod exhibited alod activity and 3-hibdh activity. the 3-hibdh from pseudomonas putida kt2440 also exhibited alod activity. thus, the alod from pseudomonas sp. aiu 362 and 3-hibdh from p. putida kt2440 were classified into the same enzyme group.

TI  == production and characterization of poly(3-hydroxypropionate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) with fully controllable structures by recombinant escherichia coli containing an  engineered pathway.
AB  == copolyesters of 3-hydroxypropionate (3hp) and 4-hydroxybutyrate (4hb), abbreviated as p(3hp-co-4hb), was synthesized by escherichia coli harboring a synthetic pathway consisting of five heterologous genes including orfz encoding 4-hydroxybutyrate-coenzyme a transferase from clostridium kluyveri, pcs' encoding the acs domain of tri-functional propionyl-coa ligase (pcs) from chloroflexus aurantiacus, dhat and aldd encoding dehydratase and aldehyde dehydrogenase from pseudomonas putida kt2442, and phac1 encoding pha synthase from ralstonia eutropha. when grown on mixtures of 1,3-propanediol (pdo) and 1,4-butanediol (bdo), compositions of 4hb in microbial p(3hp-co-4hb) were controllable ranging from 12 mol% to 82 mol% depending on pdo/bdo ratios. nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectra clearly indicated the polymers were random copolymers of 3hp and 4hb. their mechanical and thermal properties showed obvious changes depending on  the monomer ratios. morphologically, p(3hp-co-4hb) films only became fully transparent when monomer 4hb content was around 67 mol%. for the first time, p(3hp-co-4hb) with adjustable monomer ratios were produced and characterized.

TI  == novel fiber optic detection method for in situ analysis of fluorescently labeled  biosensor organisms.
AB  == this research presents a novel, time-resolved fiber-optic "optrode" system for accurate real-time in situ detection of fluorescent proteins produced by biosensor organisms. the optrode fluorescence detection system was able to identify, characterize, differentiate, and quantify red and green fluorescently labeled organisms, individually and in mixed aqueous cultures. detection was also possible in sand systems, where a consistent reduction in signal intensity indicates that signal collection volume was reduced by one-third. the optrode was shown to be sensitive enough to detect fluorescently labeled cell concentrations  of 1.9 x 10(4) cfu/ml, indicating it is suitable for detecting typical concentrations of degrader organisms reported in bioremediation trials. the effect of fluorophore photobleaching was characterized for different fluorescent  proteins and demonstrated a linear relationship to cell concentration, meaning the effect can be accounted for within methods of fluorescence collection and analysis. proof of concept is provided for all aspects of this research, which represents an important step toward the goal of achieving a complete, nondestructive, in situ monitoring system to characterize all aspects of microbial activity and gene expression.

TI  == predatory bacteriovorax communities ordered by various prey species.
AB  == the role of predation in altering microbial communities has been studied for decades but few examples are known for bacterial predators. bacteriovorax are halophilic prokaryotes that prey on susceptible gram-negative bacteria. we recently reported novel observations on the differential selection of bacteriovorax phylotypes by two different prey, vibrio parahaemolyticus and vibrio vulnificus. however, the conclusion is restricted by the limited number of prey tested. in this study, we have conducted two independent investigations involving eight species of prey bacteria while using v. vulnificus and v. parahaemolytics as reference strains. water samples collected from dry bar, apalachicola bay were used to establish microcosms which were respectively spiked with prey strains vibrio cholerae, escherichia coli or pseudomonas putida to examine the response of native bacteriovorax to freshwater bacteria. indigenous vibrio sp., pseudoalteromonas sp., photobacterium sp. and a clinical strain of v. vulnificus were also tested for the impact of saltwater prey on the bacteriovorax community. at 24 hour intervals, optical density of the microcosm samples and the abundance of bacteriovorax were measured over five days. the predominant bacteriovorax plaques were selected and analyzed by 16s rrna gene amplification and sequencing. in addition, the impacts of prey on predator population and bacterial community composition were investigated using culture independent denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. strikingly, cluster iv was found consistently as the predominant phylotype produced by the freshwater prey. for all saltwater prey, subgroups of bacteriovorax phylotype ix were the major predators recovered. the results suggest that prey is an important factor along with temperature, salinity and other environmental parameters in shaping bacteriovorax communities in aquatic systems.

AB  == although the tubulysin (tub) biosynthetic gene cluster has been located in two myxobacterial strains, it appears in both cases to be incomplete as obvious candidates for acyl transfer and oxidation functions are lacking. here, we report the engineering of a heterologous expression system for the tub biosynthetic pathway from strain cystobacter sp. sbcb004. the entire tub core cluster was reconstituted from two cosmids using red/et recombineering and heterologous expression achieved in strains pseudomonas putida and myxococcus xanthus. availability of the heterologous expression system and the natural producer strain sbcb004 provided a platform for the functional investigation of various biosynthetic genes by targeted inactivation. in addition, blast analysis of sbcb004 genome data was used to identify multiple candidate monooxygenases, whose involvement in tubulysin assembly was evaluated using a combination of knockout mutagenesis and heterologous expression.

AB  == novel shuttle vectors named pebp were constructed to allow the gene expression in different bacterial hosts including escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas putida. these vectors share the inducible promoters p(t7) and p(xyl)  and a cos site to enable packaging of plasmid dna into phage, and carry different multiple cloning sites and antibiotic resistance genes. vector pebp41 generally replicates episomally while pebp18 replicates episomally in gram-negative bacteria only, but integrates into the chromosome of b. subtilis. plasmid copy numbers determined for e. coli and p. putida were in the range of 5-50 per cell.  the functionality of pebp18 and pebp41 was confirmed by expression of two lipolytic enzymes, namely lipase a from b. subtilis and cutinase from the eukaryotic fungus fusarium solani pisi in three different host strains. additionally, we report here the construction of a t7 rna polymerase-based expression strain of p. putida.

TI  == non-enzymatic palladium recovery on microbial and synthetic surfaces.
AB  == the use of microorganisms as support for reduction of dissolved pd(ii) to immobilized pd(0) nanoparticles is an environmentally friendly approach for pd recovery from waste. to better understand and engineer pd(0) nanoparticle synthesis, one has to consider the mechanisms by which pd(ii) is reduced on microbial surfaces. escherichia coli, shewanella oneidensis, and pseudomonas putida were used as model organisms in order to elucidate the role of microbial cells in pd(ii) reduction under acidic conditions. pd(ii) was reduced by formate  under acidic conditions, and the process occurred substantially faster in the presence of cells as compared to cell-free controls. we found no difference between native (untreated) and autoclaved cells, and could demonstrate that even  a non-enzymatic protein (bovine serum albumin) stimulated pd(ii) reduction as efficiently as bacterial cells. amine groups readily interact with pd(ii), and to specifically test their role in surface-assisted pd(ii) reduction by formate, we  replaced bacterial cells with polystyrene microparticles functionalized with amine or carboxyl groups. amine-functionalized microparticles had the same effect on pd(ii) reduction as bacterial cells, and the effect could be hampered if the amine groups were blocked by acetylation. the interaction with amine groups was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy on whole cells and amine-functionalized microparticles. in conclusion, bio-supported pd(ii) reduction on microbial surfaces is possibly mediated by a non-enzymatic mechanism. we therefore suggest  the use of amine-rich biomaterials rather than intact cells for pd bio-recovery from waste.

TI  == metabolic and regulatory rearrangements underlying efficient d-xylose utilization in engineered pseudomonas putida s12.
AB  == previously, an efficient d-xylose utilizing pseudomonas putida s12 strain was obtained by introducing the d-xylose isomerase pathway from escherichia coli, followed by evolutionary selection. in the present study, systemic changes associated with the evolved phenotype were identified by transcriptomics, enzyme  activity analysis, and inverse engineering. a key element in improving the initially poor d-xylose utilization was the redistribution of 6-phospho-d-gluconate (6-pg) between the entner-doudoroff pathway and the oxidative pentose phosphate (pp) pathway. this redistribution increased the availability of 6-pg for oxidative decarboxylation to d-ribose-5-phosphate, which is essential for the utilization of d-xylose via the nonoxidative pp pathway. the metabolic redistribution of 6-pg was procured by modified hexr regulation, which  in addition appeared to control periplasmic sugar oxidation. because the absence  of periplasmic d-xylonate formation was previously demonstrated to be essential for achieving a high biomass yield on d-xylose, the aberrant hexr control appeared to underlie both the improved growth rate and biomass yield of the evolved d-xylose utilizing p. putida strain. the increased oxidative pp pathway activity furthermore resulted in an elevated nadh/nad(+) ratio that caused the metabolic flux to be redirected from the tca cycle to the glyoxylate shunt, which was also activated transcriptionally. clearly, these findings may serve as an important case in point to engineer and improve the utilization of non-natural carbon sources in a wide range of industrial microorganisms.

TI  == whole-cell hydroxylation of n-octane by escherichia coli strains expressing the cyp153a6 operon.
AB  == cyp153a6 is a well-studied terminal alkane hydroxylase which has previously been  expressed in pseudomonas putida and escherichia coli by using the pcom8 plasmid.  in this study, cyp153a6 was successfully expressed in e. coli bl21(de3) by cloning the complete operon from mycobacterium sp. hxn-1500, also encoding the ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin, into pet28b(+). lb medium with iptg as well  as auto-induction medium was used to express the proteins under the t7 promoter.  a maximum concentration of 1.85 mum of active cyp153a6 was obtained when using auto-induction medium, while with iptg induction of lb cultures, the p450 concentration peaked at 0.6-0.8 mum. since more biomass was produced in auto-induction medium, the specific p450 content was often almost the same, 0.5-1.0 mumol p450 g (dcw)(-)(1), for both methods. analytical scale whole-cell biotransformations of n-octane were conducted with resting cells, and it was found that high p450 content in biomass did not necessarily result in high octanol production. whole cells from lb cultures induced with iptg gave higher specific and volumetric octanol formation rates than biomass from auto-induction  medium. a maximum of 8.7 g octanol l (brm)(-)(1) was obtained within 24 h (0.34 g l (brm)(-)(1) h(-)(1)) with iptg-induced cells containing only 0.20 mumol p450 g  (dcw)(-)(1), when glucose (22 g l (brm)(-)(1)) was added for cofactor regeneration.

TI  == novel, highly specific n-demethylases enable bacteria to live on caffeine and related purine alkaloids.
AB  == the molecular basis for the ability of bacteria to live on caffeine as a sole carbon and nitrogen source is unknown. pseudomonas putida cbb5, which grows on several purine alkaloids, metabolizes caffeine and related methylxanthines via sequential n-demethylation to xanthine. metabolism of caffeine by cbb5 was previously attributed to one broad-specificity methylxanthine n-demethylase composed of two subunits, ndma and ndmb. here, we report that ndma and ndmb are actually two independent rieske nonheme iron monooxygenases with n(1)- and n(3)-specific n-demethylation activity, respectively. activity for both enzymes is dependent on electron transfer from nadh via a redox-center-dense rieske reductase, ndmd. ndmd itself is a novel protein with one rieske [2fe-2s] cluster, one plant-type [2fe-2s] cluster, and one flavin mononucleotide (fmn) per enzyme.  all ndm genes are located in a 13.2-kb genomic dna fragment which also contained  a formaldehyde dehydrogenase. ndma, ndmb, and ndmd were cloned as his(6) fusion genes, expressed in escherichia coli, and purified using a ni-nta column. ndma-his(6) plus his(6)-ndmd catalyzed n(1)-demethylation of caffeine, theophylline, paraxanthine, and 1-methylxanthine to theobromine, 3-methylxanthine, 7-methylxanthine, and xanthine, respectively. ndmb-his(6) plus  his(6)-ndmd catalyzed n(3)-demethylation of theobromine, 3-methylxanthine, caffeine, and theophylline to 7-methylxanthine, xanthine, paraxanthine, and 1-methylxanthine, respectively. one formaldehyde was produced from each methyl group removed. activity of an n(7)-specific n-demethylase, ndmc, has been confirmed biochemically. this is the first report of bacterial n-demethylase genes that enable bacteria to live on caffeine. these genes represent a new class of rieske oxygenases and have the potential to produce biofuels, animal feed, and pharmaceuticals from coffee and tea waste.

TI  == evolution of an alkane-inducible biosensor for increased responsiveness to short-chain alkanes.
AB  == synthetic alkane-inducible biosensors have applications as detectors for environmental hydrocarbon contamination and as novel inducible expression systems with low-cost inducers. here, we have assembled and evolved an alkane-responsive  biosensor with a fluorescence output signal in escherichia coli by utilizing regulatory machinery from pseudomonas putida's alkane metabolism. within our system, the transcriptional regulator, alksp, is activated by the presence of alkanes and binds to the p(alkb) promoter, stimulating transcription of a green fluorescent protein reporter. through two successive rounds of directed evolution via error prone pcr and fluorescence activated cell sorting, we isolated alks mutants enabling up to a 5 fold increase in fluorescence output signal in response to short-chain alkanes such as hexane and pentane. further characterization of selected mutants demonstrated altered responsiveness to a wide range of linear alkanes (pentane to dodecane). sequence analysis highlighted the s470t mutation as a likely candidate responsible for increased effectiveness  of the alks protein for short-chain alkanes. this work represents the first evolution of a synthetic biosensor system for alkanes.

AB  == acinetobacter baumannii harbours a gene cluster similar to the iac locus of pseudomonas putida 1290, which can catabolize the plant hormone indole 3-acetic acid (iaa) as an energy source. however, there has been no evidence showing that  iaa can be utilized by a. baumannii. this study showed that a. baumannii can grow in m9 minimal medium containing iaa as the sole carbon source. a mutagenesis study indicated that iaca, encoded in the iac locus of a. baumannii, is involved  in the catabolism of iaa. as shown by western blotting analysis, the iaca protein was detected in a. baumannii grown in m9 minimal medium with iaa but not with pyruvate, suggesting that the expression of iaca is regulated by the presence of  iaa. in vitro studies have shown that iaca can oxidize indole, an iaa-like molecule, converting it to indoxyl, which spontaneously dimerises to form indigo. in this study, we show that the crude extracts from either wild-type a. baumannii or escherichia coli overexpressing iaca can oxidize iaa. these results imply that the iac gene cluster of a. baumannii is involved in iaa degradation and that the  iaca gene is upregulated when cells encounter iaa in their native environments.

AB  == bacterial genes whose enzymes are either assembled into complex multi-domain proteins or form biosynthetic pathways are frequently organized within large chromosomal clusters. the functional expression of clustered genes, however, remains challenging since it generally requires an expression system that facilitates the coordinated transcription of numerous genes irrespective of their natural promoters and terminators. here, we report on the development of a novel  expression system that is particularly suitable for the homologous expression of  multiple genes organized in a contiguous cluster. the new expression toolkit consists of an omega interposon cassette carrying a t7 rna polymerase specific promoter which is designed for promoter tagging of clustered genes and a small set of broad-host-range plasmids providing the respective polymerase in different bacteria. the uptake hydrogenase gene locus of the photosynthetic non-sulfur purple bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus which consists of 16 genes was used as an example to demonstrate functional expression only by t7 rna polymerase but not by bacterial rna polymerase. our findings clearly indicate that due to its unique properties t7 rna polymerase can be applied for overexpression of large and complex bacterial gene regions.

AB  == a dimeric baeyer-villiger monooxygenase (bvmo) catalyzing the lactonization of 2-oxo-delta(3)-4,5,5-trimethylcyclopentenylacetyl-coenzyme a (coa), a key intermediate in the metabolism of camphor by pseudomonas putida atcc 17453, had been initially characterized in 1983 by ougham and coworkers (h. j. ougham, d. g. taylor, and p. w. trudgill, j. bacteriol. 153:140-152, 1983). here we cloned and  overexpressed the 2-oxo-delta(3)-4,5,5-trimethylcyclopentenylacetyl-coa monooxygenase (otemo) in escherichia coli and determined its three-dimensional structure with bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (fad) at a 1.95-a resolution as  well as with bound fad and nadp(+) at a 2.0-a resolution. otemo represents the first homodimeric type 1 bvmo structure bound to fad/nadp(+). a comparison of several crystal forms of otemo bound to fad and nadp(+) revealed a conformational plasticity of several loop regions, some of which have been implicated in contributing to the substrate specificity profile of structurally related bvmos.  substrate specificity studies confirmed that the 2-oxo-delta(3)-4,5,5-trimethylcyclopentenylacetic acid coenzyme a ester is preferred over the free acid. however, the catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/k(m)) favors 2-n-hexyl cyclopentanone (4.3 x 10(5) m(-1) s(-1)) as a substrate, although its affinity (k(m) = 32 mum) was lower than that of the coa-activated substrate (k(m) = 18 mum). in whole-cell biotransformation experiments, otemo showed a unique enantiocomplementarity to the action of the prototypical cyclohexanone monooxygenase (chmo) and appeared to be particularly useful for the oxidation of 4-substituted cyclohexanones. overall, this work extends our understanding of the molecular structure and mechanistic complexity of the type 1 family of bvmos and expands the catalytic repertoire of one of its original members.

TI  == bacterial chemotaxis toward a napl source within a pore-scale microfluidic chamber.
AB  == chemotaxis toward chemical pollutants provides a mechanism for bacteria to migrate to locations of high contamination, which may improve the effectiveness of bioremediation. a microfluidic device was designed to mimic the dissolution of an organic-phase contaminant from a single pore into a larger macropore representing a preferred pathway for microorganisms that are carried along by groundwater flow. the glass windows of the microfluidic device allowed direct image analysis of bacterial distributions within the vicinity of the organic contaminant. concentrations of chemotactic bacteria p. putida f1 near the organic/aqueous interface were 25% greater than those of a nonchemotactic mutant  in the vicinity of toluene for a fluid velocity of 0.5 m/d. for e. coli responding to phenol, the bacterial concentrations were 60% greater than the controls, also at a velocity of 0.5 m/d. velocities in the macropore were varied  over a range from 0.5 to 10 m/d, the lower end of which is typical of groundwater velocities. the accumulation of chemotactic bacteria near the napl chemoattractant source decreased as the fluid velocity increased. good agreement  between computer-based simulations, generated using reasonable values of the model parameters, and the experimental data for p. putida strains confirmed the contribution due to chemotaxis. the experimental data for e. coli required a larger chemotactic sensitivity coefficient than that for p. putida, which was consistent with parameter values reported in the literature.

TI  == roles of long and short replication initiation proteins in the fate of incp-1 plasmids.
AB  == broad-host-range incp-1 plasmids generally encode two replication initiation proteins, trfa1 and trfa2. trfa2 is produced from an internal translational start site within trfa1. while trfa1 was previously shown to be essential for replication in pseudomonas aeruginosa, its role in other bacteria within its broad host range has not been established. to address the role of trfa1 and trfa2 in other hosts, efficiency of transformation, plasmid copy number (pcn), and plasmid stability were first compared between a mini-incp-1beta plasmid and its trfa1 frameshift variant in four phylogenetically distant hosts: escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, sphingobium japonicum, and cupriavidus necator. trfa2 was sufficient for replication in these hosts, but the presence of trfa1 enhanced transformation efficiency and pcn. however, trfa1 did not contribute to, and even negatively affected, long-term plasmid persistence. when trfa genes were cloned under a constitutive promoter in the chromosomes of the four hosts, strains expressing either both trfa1 and trfa2 or trfa1 alone, again, generally elicited  a higher pcn of an incp1-beta replicon than strains expressing trfa2 alone. when  a single species of trfa was produced at different concentrations in e. coli cells, trfa1 maintained a 3- to 4-fold higher pcn than trfa2 at the same trfa concentrations, indicating that replication mediated by trfa1 is more efficient than that by trfa2. these results suggest that the broad-host-range properties of incp-1 plasmids are essentially conferred by trfa2 and the intact replication origin alone but that trfa1 is nonetheless important to efficiently establish plasmid replication upon transfer into a broad range of hosts.

TI  == fis regulates the competitiveness of pseudomonas putida on barley roots by inducing biofilm formation.
AB  == an important link between the environment and the physiological state of bacteria is the regulation of the transcription of a large number of genes by global transcription factors. one of the global regulators, fis (factor for inversion stimulation), is well studied in escherichia coli, but the role of this protein in pseudomonads has only been examined briefly. according to studies in enterobacteriaceae, fis regulates positively the flagellar movement of bacteria.  in pseudomonads, flagellar movement is an important trait for the colonization of plant roots. therefore we were interested in the role of the fis protein in pseudomonas putida, especially the possible regulation of the colonization of plant roots. we observed that fis reduced the migration of p. putida onto the apices of barley roots and thereby the competitiveness of bacteria on the roots.  moreover, we observed that overexpression of fis drastically reduced swimming motility and facilitated p. putida biofilm formation, which could be the reason for the decreased migration of bacteria onto the root apices. it is possible that the elevated expression of fis is important in the adaptation of p. putida during colonization of plant roots by promoting biofilm formation when the migration of  bacteria is no longer favoured.

TI  == the fe(ii)/alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent taurine dioxygenases from pseudomonas putida and escherichia coli are tetramers.
AB  == fe(ii)/alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenases are versatile catalysts associated with a number of different biological functions in which they use the  oxidizing power of activated dioxygen to convert a variety of substrates. a mononuclear nonheme iron center is used to couple the decarboxylation of the cosubstrate alpha-ketoglutarate with a two-electron oxidation of the substrate, which is a hydroxylation in most cases. although fe(ii)/alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenases have diverse amino acid sequences and substrate specifity, it is assumed that they share a common mechanism. one representative of this enzyme family is the fe(ii)/alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent  taurine dioxygenase that catalyzes the hydroxylation of taurine yielding sulfite  and aminoacetaldehyde. its mechanism has been studied in detail becoming a model  system for the whole enzyme family. however, its oligomeric state and architecture have been disputed. here, we report the biochemical and kinetic characterization of the fe(ii)/alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent taurine dioxygenase  from pseudomonas putida kt2440 (taud(pp) ). we also present three crystal structures of the apo form of this enzyme. comparisons with taurine dioxygenase from escherichia coli (taud(ec) ) demonstrate that both enzymes are quite similar regarding their spectra, structure and kinetics, and only minor differences for the accumulation of intermediates during the reaction have been observed. structural data and analytical gel filtration, as well as sedimentation velocity  analytical ultracentrifugation, show that both taud(pp) and taud(ec) are tetramers in solution and in the crystals, which is in contrast to the earlier description of taurine dioxygenase from e. coli as a dimer. database the atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the brookhaven protein data bank (entry 3pvj, 3v15, 3v17) structured digital abstract * taudpp and taudpp bind by molecular sieving (view interaction) * taudpp and taudpp bind by x-ray crystallography (view interaction) * taudec and taudec bind by molecular sieving (view interaction).

TI  == production and characterization of a recombinant single-chain antibody (scfv) for tracing the sigma54 factor of pseudomonas putida.
AB  == the number of alternative sigma factor molecules per bacterial cell determines either stochasticity or evenness of transcription of cognate promoters. an approach for examining the abundance of sigmas in any sample of bacterial origin  is explained here which relies on the production of a recombinant highly specific, high-affinity single-chain variable fv domain (scfv) targeted towards unique protein sites of the factor. purposely, a super-binder scfv recognizing a  distinct epitope of the less abundant sigma sigma(54) of pseudomonas putida (also known as sigma(n)) was obtained and its properties examined in detail. to this end, an scfv library was generated from mrna extracted from lymphocytes of mice immunized with the purified sigma(54) protein of this bacterium. the library was  displayed on a phage system and subjected to various rounds of panning with purified sigma(54) for capturing extreme binders. the resulting high-affinity anti-sigma(54) phage antibody (phab) clone named c2 strongly attached a small region located between positions 172 and 183 of the primary amino acid sequence of sigma(54) that overlaps its core rna polymerase-binding region. the purified scfv-c2 detected minute amounts of sigma(54) in whole cell protein extracts not only of p. putida but also escherichia coli cells and putatively in other bacteria as well. the affinity constant of the purified antibody was measured by  surface plasmon resonance (spr) and found to have a k(d) (k(off)/k(on)) in the range of 2x10(-9)m. the considerable affinity and specificity of this recombinant antibody makes it a tool of choice for quantitative studies on gene expression of sigma(54)-dependent promoters in p. putida and other gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == engineering whole-cell biosensors with no antibiotic markers for monitoring aromatic compounds in the environment.
AB  == a cornerstone of synthetic biology is the engineering of gene regulatory networks. construction of such biological circuits has been used not only to elucidate the dynamics of gene expression but also for designing whole-cell biosensors that translate environmental signals into quantifiable outputs. to this end, distinct components of given regulatory systems are rationally rewired  in a way that translates an external stimulus (for instance, the presence of one  chemical species) into a measurable readout typically fluorescence or luminescence. various biosensors for btex (a mixture of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes) are based on xylr, the main transcriptional regulator of the tol pathway of pseudomonas putida mt-2. in the presence of its natural effectors (e.g., m-xylene, toluene or 3-methylbenzylalcohol), xylr triggers expression of the upper pathway genes by means of the pu promoter. available biosensors combine the xylr gene and a direct fusion between the cognate pu promoter and the luxcdabe operon, all components stably integrated in the chromosome of p. putida. a versatile development of the same biosensing concept is described, aimed at increasing the sensitivity of the genetic circuit toward xylr inducers. the new platform utilizes mini-transposon vectors tailored for engineering an artificial expression cascade that operates as an amplifier of the signal/response ratio of the biosensor. this strategy was applied to the construction of a strain that carries a transcriptional fusion between the pu promoter and t7 rna polymerase (which becomes under the control of xylr and its effectors), along with a t7 promoter controlling expression of the luxcdabe operon. this simple regulatory architecture produced a dramatic increase of bioluminescence emission in respect to the strain that carries only the direct fusion between the pu promoter and the luxcdabe reporter.

TI  == bacterial dioxygenase- and monooxygenase-catalysed sulfoxidation of benzo[b]thiophenes.
AB  == asymmetric heteroatom oxidation of benzo[b]thiophenes to yield the corresponding  sulfoxides was catalysed by toluene dioxygenase (tdo), naphthalene dioxygenase (ndo) and styrene monooxygenase (smo) enzymes present in p. putida mutant and e.  coli recombinant whole cells. tdo-catalysed oxidation yielded the relatively unstable benzo[b]thiophene sulfoxide; its dimerization, followed by dehydrogenation, resulted in the isolation of stable tetracyclic sulfoxides as minor products with cis-dihydrodiols being the dominant metabolites. smo mainly catalysed the formation of enantioenriched benzo[b]thiophene sulfoxide and 2-methyl benzo[b]thiophene sulfoxides which racemized at ambient temperature. the barriers to pyramidal sulfur inversion of 2- and 3-methyl benzo[b]thiophene sulfoxide metabolites, obtained using tdo and ndo as biocatalysts, were found to  be ca.: 25-27 kcal mol(-1). the absolute configurations of the benzo[b]thiophene  sulfoxides were determined by ecd spectroscopy, x-ray crystallography and stereochemical correlation. a site-directed mutant e. coli strain containing an engineered form of ndo, was found to change the regioselectivity toward preferential oxidation of the thiophene ring rather than the benzene ring.

TI  == whole-cell bio-oxidation of n-dodecane using the alkane hydroxylase system of p.  putida gpo1 expressed in e. coli.
AB  == the alkane-1-monoxygenase (alkb) complex of pseudomonas putida gpo1 has been extensively studied in the past and shown to be capable of oxidising aliphatic c(5)-c(12) alkanes to primary alcohols both in the wild-type organism by growth on c(5)-c(12) alkanes as sole carbon source and in vitro. despite this, successful n-dodecane oxidation for the production of 1-dodecanol or dodecanoic acid has proven elusive in the past when using alkb-expressing recombinants. this article demonstrates, for the first time in vivo, by using the escherichia coli gec137 pgec47deltaj strain, that n-dodecane oxidation using this enzyme for the production of primary alcohols and carboxylic acids is feasible and in fact potentially more promising than n-octane oxidation due to lower product and substrate toxicity. yields are reported of 1-dodecanol of up to 2 g/l(organic) and dodecanoic acid up to 19.7 g/l(organic) in a 2 l stirred tank reactor with 1l aqueous phase and 200 ml of n-dodecane as a second phase. the maximum volumetric  rate of combined alcohol and acid production achieved was 1.9 g/l(organic)/h (0.35 g/l(total)/h). the maximum specific activity of combined alcohol and acid production was 7-fold lower on n-dodecane (3.5 mumol/min/g(dcw)) than on n-octane (21 mumol/min/g(dcw)); similar to the 5-fold difference observed between wild-type growth rates using the two respective alkanes as sole carbon source. despite this, both total volumetric rate and final yield exceeded n-octane oxidation by 3.5-fold under the same conditions, due to the lower toxicity of n-dodecane and its oxidation products to e. coli compared to the 8-carbon equivalents. substrate access limitations and the overoxidation of 1-dodecanol to dodecanoic acid were identified as the most important limitations to be addressed.

TI  == development of a new strategy for production of medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates by recombinant escherichia coli via inexpensive non-fatty acid feedstocks.
AB  == pseudomonas putida kt2440 is capable of producing medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates (mcl-phas) when grown on unrelated carbon sources during nutrient limitation. transcription levels of genes putatively involved in pha biosynthesis were assessed by quantitative real-time pcr (qrt-pcr) in p. putida grown on glycerol as a sole carbon source. the results showed that two genes, phag and the pp0763 gene, were highly upregulated among genes potentially involved in the biosynthesis of mcl-phas from unrelated carbon sources. previous  studies have described phag as a 3-hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein (acp)-coenzyme a (coa) transferase, and based on homology, the pp0763 gene was predicted to encode a medium-chain-fatty-acid coa ligase. high expression levels  of these genes during pha production in p. putida led to the hypothesis that these two genes are involved in pha biosynthesis from non-fatty acid carbon sources, such as glucose and glycerol. the phag(pp) and pp0763 genes from p. putida were cloned and coexpressed with the engineered pseudomonas sp. 61-3 pha synthase gene phacl (stqk)(ps) in recombinant escherichia coli. up to 400 mg liter(-1) mcl-phas was successfully produced from glucose. this study has produced the largest amount of mcl-phas reported from non-fatty acid carbon sources in recombinant e. coli to date and opens up the possibility of using inexpensive feedstocks to produce mcl-pha polymers.

TI  == recombinant production of cathelicidin-derived antimicrobial peptides in escherichia coli using an inducible autocleaving enzyme tag.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides (amps), such as the linear amphipathic cathelicidins, are  produced widely in the natural world and are active against a broad range of pathogenic microorganisms. their potential as a new range of antibiotics has prompted numerous studies of amp structure and function. most such studies are performed with chemically synthesised peptides, but a simple and rapid biosynthetic route would offer a more cost-effective alternative for the production of amps and analysis of their structure/function relationships. the cysteine protease domain (cpd) from vibrio cholerae martx toxin possesses an autocleaving ability that is inducible by inositol hexakisphosphate (ip(6)). when coupled with a hexa-histidine tag and fused to the c-terminus of an amp, this amp-cpd fusion may be expressed in escherichia coli and purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography. a brief on-column induction of cleavage liberates the amp, and subsequent polishing using hydrophobic interaction resin allows for purification of the peptide within a day. we used this system to express and purify several 18-residue cathelicidin variants and tested their activity on e. coli, pseudomonas putida, bacillus subtilis and candida albicans. this approach to linear amp production may aid rapid construction and purification of structural variants for subsequent functional analysis.

TI  == formation of repressor-inducer-operator ternary complex: negative cooperativity of d-camphor binding to camr.
AB  == a repressor composed of homodimeric subunits, as is often found in bacteria, possesses two effector-binding sites per molecule, enabling sophisticated regulation by the cooperative binding of two effector molecules. positive cooperativity generates a narrower region of effector concentration for switching, but little is known about the role of negative cooperativity. d-camphor, an inducer for pseudomonas putida cytochrome p450cam hydroxylase operon (camdcab), binds to the homodimeric cam repressor (camr). here, we report  solid evidence that the complex of camr and an operator dna is not dissociated by the first binding of d-camphor but, at a higher concentration, is dissociated by  the second binding. d-camphor thus binds to the camr in two steps with negative cooperativity, yielding two distinct dissociation constants of k(d1 ) =( ) 0.064  +/- 0.030 and k(d2 ) =( ) 14 +/- 0.3 mum, as well as the hill coefficient of 0.56 +/- 0.05 (<1). the first binding guarantees the high specificity of the inducer by the high affinity, although the second binding turns on the gene expression at a 200-fold higher concentration, a more suitable switching point for the catabolism of d-camphor.

AB  == a good part of the contemporary synthetic biology agenda aims at reprogramming microorganisms to enhance existing functions and/or perform new tasks. moreover,  the functioning of complex regulatory networks, or even a single gene, is revealed only when perturbations are entered in the corresponding dynamic systems and the outcome monitored. these endeavors rely on the availability of genetic tools to successfully modify a la carte the chromosome of target bacteria. key aspects to this end include the removal of undesired genomic segments, systems for the production of directed mutants and allelic replacements, random mutant libraries to discover new functions, and means to stably implant larger genetic networks into the genome of specific hosts. the list of gram-negative species that are appealing for such genetic refactoring operations is growingly expanding. however, the repertoire of available molecular techniques to do so is  very limited beyond escherichia coli. in this chapter, utilization of novel tools is described (exemplified in two plasmids systems: pbam1 and pemg) tailored for facilitating chromosomal engineering procedures in a wide variety of gram-negative microorganisms.

TI  == the crp regulator of pseudomonas putida: evidence of an unusually high affinity for its physiological effector, camp.
AB  == although the genome of pseudomonas putida kt2440 encodes an orthologue of the crp gene of escherichia coli (encoding the camp receptor protein), the regulatory scope of this factor seems to be predominantly co-opted in this bacterium for controlling non-metabolic functions. in order to investigate the reasons for such a functional divergence in otherwise nearly identical proteins, the crp regulator of p. putida (crp(p. putida)) was purified to apparent homogeneity and subject to a battery of in vitro assays aimed at determining its principal physicochemical properties. analytical ultracentrifugation indicated effector-free crp(p. putida) to be a dimer in solution that undergoes a significant change in its hydrodynamic shape in the presence of camp. such a conformational transition was confirmed by  limited proteolysis of the protein in the absence or presence of the inducer. thermodynamic parameters calculated by isothermal titration calorimetry revealed  a tight camp-crp(p. putida) association with an apparent k(d) of 22.5 +/- 2.8 nm, i.e. much greater affinity than that reported for the e. coli's counterpart. the  regulator also bound cgmp, but with a k(d) = 2.6 +/- 0.3 microm. an in vitro transcription system was then set up with purified p. putida's rna polymerase for examining the preservation of the correct protein-protein architecture that makes crp to activate target promoters. these results, along with cognate gel retardation assays indicated that all basic features of the reference crp(e. coli) protein are kept in the p. putida's counterpart, albeit operating under a different set of parameters, the extraordinarily high affinity for camp being the most noticeable.

TI  == growth independent rhamnolipid production from glucose using the non-pathogenic pseudomonas putida kt2440.
AB  == background: rhamnolipids are potent biosurfactants with high potential for industrial applications. however, rhamnolipids are currently produced with the opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa during growth on hydrophobic substrates such as plant oils. the heterologous production of rhamnolipids entails two essential advantages: disconnecting the rhamnolipid biosynthesis from the complex quorum sensing regulation and the opportunity of avoiding pathogenic  production strains, in particular p. aeruginosa. in addition, separation of rhamnolipids from fatty acids is difficult and hence costly. results: here, the metabolic engineering of a rhamnolipid producing pseudomonas putida kt2440, a strain certified as safety strain using glucose as carbon source to avoid cumbersome product purification, is reported. notably, p. putida kt2440 features  almost no changes in growth rate and lag-phase in the presence of high concentrations of rhamnolipids (> 90 g/l) in contrast to the industrially important bacteria bacillus subtilis, corynebacterium glutamicum, and escherichia coli. p. putida kt2440 expressing the rhlab-genes from p. aeruginosa pao1 produces mono-rhamnolipids of p. aeruginosa pao1 type (mainly c(10):c(10)). the metabolic network was optimized in silico for rhamnolipid synthesis from glucose. in addition, a first genetic optimization, the removal of polyhydroxyalkanoate formation as competing pathway, was implemented. the final strain had production  rates in the range of p. aeruginosa pao1 at yields of about 0.15 g/g(glucose) corresponding to 32% of the theoretical optimum. what's more, rhamnolipid production was independent from biomass formation, a trait that can be exploited  for high rhamnolipid production without high biomass formation. conclusions: a functional alternative to the pathogenic rhamnolipid producer p. aeruginosa was constructed and characterized. p. putida kt24c1 pvlt31_rhlab featured the highest yield and titer reported from heterologous rhamnolipid producers with glucose as  carbon source. notably, rhamnolipid production was uncoupled from biomass formation, which allows optimal distribution of resources towards rhamnolipid synthesis. the results are discussed in the context of rational strain engineering by using the concepts of synthetic biology like chassis cells and orthogonality, thereby avoiding the complex regulatory programs of rhamnolipid production existing in the natural producer p. aeruginosa.

TI  == characterization of the chipsi subcomplex of pseudomonas aeruginosa dna polymerase iii.
AB  == background: dna polymerase iii, the main enzyme responsible for bacterial dna replication, is composed of three sub-assemblies: the polymerase core, the beta-sliding clamp, and the clamp loader. during replication, single-stranded dna-binding protein (ssb) coats and protects single-stranded dna (ssdna) and also interacts with the chipsi heterodimer, a sub-complex of the clamp loader. whereas the chi subunits of escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa are about 40% homologous, p. aeruginosa psi is twice as large as its e. coli counterpart, and contains additional sequences. it was shown that p. aeruginosa chipsi together with ssb increases the activity of its cognate clamp loader 25-fold at low salt.  the e. coli clamp loader, however, is insensitive to the addition of its cognate  chipsi under similar conditions. in order to find out distinguishing properties within p. aeruginosa chipsi which account for this higher stimulatory effect, we  characterized p. aeruginosa chipsi by a detailed structural and functional comparison with its e. coli counterpart. results: using small-angle x-ray scattering, analytical ultracentrifugation, and homology-based modeling, we found the n-terminus of p. aeruginosa psi to be unstructured. under high salt conditions, the affinity of the chipsi complexes from both organisms to their cognate ssb was similar. under low salt conditions, p. aeruginosa chipsi, contrary to e. coli chipsi, binds to ssdna via the n-terminus of psi. whereas it  is also able to bind to double-stranded dna, the affinity is somewhat reduced. conclusions: the binding to dna, otherwise never reported for any other psi protein, enhances the affinity of p. aeruginosa chipsi towards the ssb/ssdna complex and very likely contributes to the higher stimulatory effect of p. aeruginosa chipsi on the clamp loader. we also observed dna-binding activity for  p. putida chipsi, making this activity most probably a characteristic of the psi  proteins from the pseudomonadaceae.

AB  == a fluorescent pseudomonad strain p3(4) showing chitinolysis on chitinase detection agar and antagonism against fusarium oxysporum f.sp dianthi causing vascular wilt of carnation was isolated from pea rhizosphere soil. pcr primers specific for glycosyl hydrolase family 5 (gh5) of pseudomonas putida isolate kt2440 amplified a 947 bp fragment of the gh5 gene from p3(4). cloning of this gene into escherichia coli m15 using an expression vector pqe-30ua and screening  on chitin and chitosan detection agar identified one positive clone (pchi(+) ). sequence analysis of the cloned insert revealed an open reading frame of 947 nucleotides corresponding to a protein of 315 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 38.0 kda. the deduced amino acid sequence of the open reading frame (gene product/gh) showed 83-84% homology to the gh5 of p. putida strains f1 and kt2440, respectively. the purified enzyme was homogenous, as examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was visualized as single fluorescent band in native gel assay with 4-methylumbelliferyl-n -acetyl-beta;-d-glucosaminide and glycol chitosan, respectively. for hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl-n -acetyl-beta;-d-glucosaminide (pnp-(glcnac) and colloidal chitosan, the enzyme had an optimal temperature of 40 degrees c, and was stable within the temperature range of 10 degrees c to 40 degrees c. the enzyme showed an optimal ph of 3.5, with maximum stabilities at 5.0 and 5.5 for hydrolysis of pnp-(glcnac) and colloidal chitosan, respectively. fe(3+) and cu(2+) stimulated chitinase and chitosanase activities by 74.2 and 51.4%, respectively. the purified gh displayed 70 and 45% inhibition of spore germination of the pathogenic fungi, fusarium oxysporum f.sp. dianthi and alternaria solani, respectively.

TI  == an efficient design strategy for a whole-cell biosensor based on engineered ribosome binding sequences.
AB  == in prokaryotes, the ribosome binding sequence (rbs), located in the 5' untranslated region (5' utr) of an mrna, plays a critical role in enhancing mrna  translation and stability. to evaluate the effect of the rbs on the sensitivity and signal intensity of an environmental whole-cell biosensor, three escherichia  coli-based biosensors that respond to benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and the xylenes (btex) were constructed; the three biosensors have the same pu promoter and xylr regulator from the pseudomonas putida tol plasmid but differ in the engineered rbs in their reporter genes. the results from time and dose-dependent  induction of luminescence activity by 2-chlorotoluene showed that the btex-se and btex-sd biosensors with engineered rbs had signal intensities approximately 10-35 times higher than the primary btex-w biosensor. the limits of detection (lod) of  the btex-se and btex-sd biosensors were also significantly lower than the lod of  the btex-w biosensor (20 +/- 5 mumol l(-1) and 25 +/- 5 mumol l(-1) vs. 120 +/- 10 mumol l(-1)). moreover, the btex-se and btex-sd biosensors responded three times more rapidly to the analytes. these results suggest that rationally designed rbs in the 5' utr of a reporter gene may be a promising strategy for increasing the sensitivity, signal intensity, and response speed of whole-cell biosensors.

TI  == synergistic action of azoreductase and laccase leads to maximal decolourization and detoxification of model dye-containing wastewaters.
AB  == the azoreductase ppazor from pseudomonas putida shows a broader specificity for decolourization of azo dyes than cota-laccase from bacillus subtilis. however, the final products of ppazor activity exhibited in most cases a 2 to 3-fold higher toxicity than intact dyes themselves. we show that addition of cota-laccase to ppazor reaction mixtures lead to a significant drop in the final  toxicity. a sequential enzymatic process was validated through the use of 18 representative azo dyes and three model wastewaters that mimic real dye-containing effluents. a heterologous escherichia coli strain was successfully constructed co-expressing the genes coding for both ppazor and cota. whole-cell assays of recombinant strain for the treatment of model dye wastewater resulted in decolourization levels above 80% and detoxification levels up to 50%. the high attributes of this strain, make it a promising candidate for the biological treatment of industrial dye containing effluents.

AB  == microbial reduction of arsenate [as(v)] plays an important role in arsenic (as) mobilization in aqueous environments. in this study, we investigated reduction of arsenate by different bacterial isolates such as osbh(1) (gu329913), osbh(2) (gu329914), osbh(3) (gu329915), osbh(4) (gu329916) and osbh(5) (gu329917), isolated from the oil sludge of a sewage treatment plant operated by the china petroleum refinery company in kaohsiung, southern taiwan. bacterial strains of pure culture were identified by 16s rrna analysis (>/=99 % nucleotide similarity). morphological and 16s rrna analysis show that the isolate osbh(1) is similar to e. coli, osbh(2) is similar to p. stutzeri, osbh(3) is similar to p. putida, osbh(4) is similar to p. aeruginosa, and osbh(5) is similar to b. cereus. the as(v) was transformed to as(iii) in the presence of isolates osbh(2) and osbh(5) by a detoxification process. the potential reduction rates of as(v) were  higher in the presence of isolate osbh(5) compared to the isolate osbh(2). the microbial growth (cell/ml) of isolate osbh(5) was significantly higher in culture medium compared to osbh(2). the bacterial isolates such as osbh(1), osbh(3) and osbh(4) were found to be incapable of transforming the as(v). it is concluded that the activity of the oil-degrading bacterial isolates described in this work  contributes to the mobilization of as in the more toxic as(iii) form that affects biotic life.

AB  == mammalian cytochrome p450 enzymes are of special interest as biocatalysts for fine chemical and drug metabolite synthesis. in this study, the potential of different recombinant microorganisms expressing rat and human cyp1a1 genes is evaluated for such applications. the maximum specific activity for 7-ethoxyresorufin o-deethylation and gene expression levels were used as parameters to judge biocatalyst performance. under comparable conditions, e. coli is shown to be superior over the use of s. cerevisiae and p. putida as hosts for  biocatalysis. of all tested e. coli strains, e. coli dh5alpha and e. coli jm101 harboring rat cyp1a1 showed the highest activities (0.43 and 0.42 u g(-)(1)(cdw), respectively). detection of active cyp1a1 in cell-free e. coli extracts was found to be difficult and only for e. coli dh5alpha, expression levels could be determined (41 nmol g(-)(1)(cdw)). the presented results show that efficient expression of mammalian cyp1a1 genes in recombinant microorganisms is troublesome and host-dependent and that enhancing expression levels is crucial in order to obtain more efficient biocatalysts. specific activities currently obtained are not sufficient yet for fine chemical production, but are sufficient for preparative-scale drug metabolite synthesis.

TI  == impacts of gene bioaugmentation with pjp4-harboring bacteria of 2,4-d-contaminated soil slurry on the indigenous microbial community.
AB  == gene bioaugmentation is a bioremediation strategy that enhances biodegradative potential via dissemination of degradative genes from introduced microorganisms to indigenous microorganisms. bioremediation experiments using 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-d)-contaminated soil slurry and strains of pseudomonas putida or escherichia coli harboring a self-transmissible 2,4-d degradative plasmid pjp4 were conducted in microcosms to assess possible effects  of gene bioaugmentation on the overall microbial community structure and ecological functions (carbon source utilization and nitrogen transformation potentials). although exogenous bacteria decreased rapidly, 2,4-d degradation was stimulated in bioaugmented microcosms, possibly because of the occurrence of transconjugants by the transfer of pjp4. terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that, although the bacterial community structure was disturbed immediately after introducing exogenous bacteria to the inoculated  microcosms, it gradually approached that of the uninoculated microcosms. biolog assay, nitrate reduction assay, and monitoring of the amoa gene of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and nirk and nirs genes of denitrifying bacteria showed no irretrievable depressive effects of gene bioaugmentation on the carbon  source utilization and nitrogen transformation potentials. these results may suggest that gene bioaugmentation with p. putida and e. coli strains harboring pjp4 is effective for the degradation of 2,4-d in soil without large impacts on the indigenous microbial community.

TI  == detection of genetically modified microorganisms in soil using the most-probable-number method with multiplex pcr and dna dot blot.
AB  == the principal objective of this study was to detect genetically modified microorganisms (gmms) that might be accidentally released into the environment from laboratories. two methods [plate counting and most-probable-number (mpn)] coupled with either multiplex pcr or dna dot blots were compared using genetically modified escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, and acinetobacter oleivorans harboring an antibiotic-resistance gene with additional gfp and lacz genes as markers. alignments of sequences collected from databases using the perl scripting language (perl api) and from denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that the gfp, lacz and antibiotic-resistance genes (kanamycin,  tetracycline, and ampicillin) in gmms differed from the counterpart genes in many sequenced genomes and in soil dna. thus, specific multiplex pcr primer sets for detection of plasmid-based gfp and lacz antibiotic-resistance genes could be generated. in the plate counting method, many antibiotic-resistant bacteria from  a soil microcosm grew as colonies on antibiotic-containing agar plates. the multiplex pcr verification of randomly selected antibiotic-resistant colonies with specific primers proved ineffective. the mpn-multiplex pcr method and antibiotic-resistant phenotype could be successfully used to detect gmms, although this method is quite laborious. the mpn-dna dot blot method screened more cells at a time in a microtiter plate containing the corresponding antibiotics, and was shown to be a more efficient method for the detection of gmms in soil using specific probes in terms of labor and accuracy.

TI  == kinetic, crystallographic, and mechanistic characterization of tomn: elucidation  of a function for a 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase homologue in the tomaymycin biosynthetic pathway.
AB  == the biosynthesis of the c ring of the antitumor antibiotic agent, tomaymycin, is  proposed to proceed through five enzyme-catalyzed steps from l-tyrosine. the genes encoding these enzymes have recently been cloned and their functions tentatively assigned, but there is limited biochemical evidence supporting the assignments of the last three steps. one enzyme, tomn, shows 58% pairwise sequence similarity with 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-ot), an enzyme found in  a catabolic pathway for aromatic hydrocarbons. the tomn sequence includes three amino acids (pro-1, arg-11, and arg-39) that have been identified as critical catalytic residues in 4-ot. however, the proposed substrate for tomn is very different from that processed by 4-ot. to establish the function and mechanism of tomn and its relationship with 4-ot, we conducted kinetic, mutagenic, and structural studies. the kinetic parameters for tomn, and four alanine mutants, p1a, r11a, r39a, and r61a, were determined using 2-hydroxymuconate, the substrate for 4-ot. the tomn-catalyzed reaction using this substrate compares favorably to  that of 4-ot. in addition, the kinetic parameters for the p1a, r11a, and r39a mutants of tomn parallel the trends observed for the corresponding 4-ot mutants,  implicating an analogous mechanism. a high-resolution crystal structure (1.4 a) of tomn shows that the overall structure and the active site region are highly similar to those of 4-ot with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.81 a. moreover, key active site residues are positionally conserved. the combined results suggest that the tentative assignment for tomn and the proposed sequence of events in the biosynthetic pathway leading to the formation of the c ring of tomaymycin might not be correct. an alternative pathway that awaits biochemical confirmation is proposed.

TI  == response of pseudomonas putida kt2440 to increased nadh and atp demand.
AB  == adenosine phosphate and nad cofactors play a vital role in the operation of cell  metabolism, and their levels and ratios are carefully regulated in tight ranges.  perturbations of the consumption of these metabolites might have a great impact on cell metabolism and physiology. here, we investigated the impact of increased  atp hydrolysis and nadh oxidation rates on the metabolism of pseudomonas putida kt2440 by titration of 2,4-dinitrophenol (dnp) and overproduction of a water-forming nadh oxidase, respectively. both perturbations resulted in a reduction of the biomass yield and, as a consequence of the uncoupling of catabolic and anabolic activities, in an amplification of the net nadh regeneration rate. however, a stimulation of the specific carbon uptake rate was  observed only when p. putida was challenged with very high 2,4-dinitrophenol concentrations and was comparatively unaffected by recombinant nadh oxidase activity. this behavior contrasts with the comparably sensitive performance described, for example, for escherichia coli or saccharomyces cerevisiae. the apparent robustness of p. putida metabolism indicates that it possesses a certain buffering capacity and a high flexibility to adapt to and counteract different stresses without showing a distinct phenotype. these findings are important, e.g., for the development of whole-cell redox biocatalytic processes that impose  equivalent burdens on the cell metabolism: stoichiometric consumption of (reduced) redox cofactors and increased energy expenditures, due to the toxicity  of the biocatalytic compounds.

AB  == a typical 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin (2-cys prx)-like protein (ppprx) that alternatively acts as a peroxidase or a molecular chaperone in pseudomonas putida kt2440 was previously characterized. the dual functions of ppprx are regulated by the existence of an additional cys(112) between the active cys(51) and cys(171) residues. in the present study, additional cys residues (cys(31), cys(112), and cys(192)) were added to ppprx variants to improve their enzymatic function. the optimal position of the additional cys residues for the dual functionality was assessed. the peroxidase activities of the s31c and y192c mutants were increased  3- to 4-fold compared to the wild-type, while the chaperone activity was maintained at > 66% of ppprx. to investigate whether optimization of the dual functions could enhance stress-tolerance in vivo, a complementation study was performed. the s31c and y192c mutants showed a much greater tolerance than other  variants under a complex condition of heat and oxidative stresses. the optimized  dual functions of ppprx could be adapted for use in bioengineering systems and industries, such as to develop organisms that are more resistant to extreme environments.

AB  == the majority of bacteria possess a different set of specialized dna polymerases than those identified in the most common model organism escherichia coli. here, we have studied the ability of specialized dna polymerases to substitute pol i in dna replication in pseudomonas putida. our results revealed that p. putida pol i-deficient cells have severe growth defects in lb medium, which is accompanied by filamentous cell morphology. however, growth of pol i-deficient bacteria on solid rich medium can be restored by reduction of reactive oxygen species in cells. also, mutants with improved growth emerge rapidly. similarly to the initial pol i-deficient p. putida, its adapted derivatives express a moderate mutator phenotype, which indicates that dna replication carried out in the absence of pol i is erroneous both in the original pol i-deficient bacteria and the adapted derivatives. analysis of the spectra of spontaneous rif(r) mutations  in p. putida strains lacking different dna polymerases revealed that the presence of specialized dna polymerases pol ii and pol iv influences the frequency of certain base substitutions in pol i-proficient and pol i-deficient backgrounds in opposite ways. involvement of another specialized dna polymerase dnae2 in dna replication in pol i-deficient bacteria is stimulated by uv irradiation of bacteria, implying that dnae2-provided translesion synthesis partially substitutes the absence of pol i in cells containing heavily damaged dna.

TI  == initial bacterial attachment in slow flowing systems: effects of cell and substrate surface properties.
AB  == bacterial biofilm can have significant effects on the behaviors and/or performance of natural and man-made systems. understanding the factors governing  initial bacterial attachment is critical to biofilm management. in this study, the initial attachment of three bacteria, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida, on two substrates, glass and octadecyltrichlorosilane (ots) modified glass, was examined in flow chambers. the flow chambers were designed and operated to mimic slow moving water bodies and minimize the gravitational settlement of cells. the hydrophobicity of bacterial surface was evaluated by partitioning of cells to the water-hexadecane interface  and the liquid contact angles on cell layers collected on filter papers. on the more hydrophilic glass surface, the attachment trend was found to be e. coli>p. putida>p. aeruginosa, while the opposite trend was observed on the hydrophobic, ots modified surface. the attachment trend on glass could be explained by the magnitude of the negative interaction energy at secondary minima, as predicted by the extended derjaguin-landau-verwey-overbeek (xdlvo) theory. the much higher attachments of p. aeruginosa and p. putida on the ots-modified substrate, on the  other hand, suggested that these cells could overcome the energy barrier between  the primary and secondary minima of interaction energy to become attached to the  primary minimum. the extent of primary-minimum attachment appeared to correlate with the scale of the energy barrier, with higher attachments in the bacteria-substrate combinations of lower energy barriers. the study generated important insights into the effects of cell and substrate surface properties on initial bacterial attachment.

AB  == azo dyes are the major group of synthetic colourants used in industry and are serious environmental pollutants. in this study, pseudomonas putida met94 was selected from 48 bacterial strains on the basis of its superior ability to degrade a wide range of structurally diverse azo dyes. p. putida is a versatile microorganism with a well-recognised potential for biodegradation or bioremediation applications. p. putida met94 removes, in 24 h and under anaerobic growing conditions, more than 80% of the majority of the structurally diverse azo dyes tested. whole cell assays performed under anaerobic conditions revealed up to 90% decolourisation in dye wastewater bath models. the involvement of a fmn dependent nadph: dye oxidoreductase in the decolourisation process was suggested  by enzymatic measurements in cell crude extracts. the gene encoding a putative azoreductase was cloned from p. putida met94 and expressed in escherichia coli. the purified p. putida azoreductase is a 40 kda homodimer with broad substrate specificity for azo dye reduction. the presence of dioxygen leads to the inhibition of the decolourisation activity in agreement with the results of cell  cultures. the kinetic mechanism follows a ping-pong bi-bi reaction scheme and aromatic amine products were detected in stoichiometric amounts by high-performance liquid chromatography. overall, the results indicate that p. putida met94 is a promising candidate for bioengineering studies aimed at generating more effective dye-reducing strains.

TI  == an improved procedure for the purification of catalytically active alkane hydroxylase from pseudomonas putida gpo1.
AB  == bacterial alkane hydroxylases are of high interest for bioremediation applications as they allow some bacteria to grow in oil-contaminated environments. furthermore, they have tremendous biotechnological potential as they catalyse the stereo- and regio-specific hydroxylation of chemically inert alkanes, which can then be used in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other high-cost chemicals. despite their potential, progress on the detailed characterization of these systems has so far been slow mainly due to the lack of  a robust procedure to purify its membrane protein component, monooxygenase alkb,  in a stable and active form. this study reports a new method for isolating milligramme amounts of recombinant pseudomonas putida gpo1 alkb in a folded, catalytically active form to purity levels above 90%. alkb solubilised and purified in the detergent lauryldimethylamine oxide was demonstrated to be active in catalysing the epoxidation reaction of 1-octene with an estimated k (m) value  of 0.2 mm.

TI  == cyclic diguanylate turnover mediated by the sole ggdef/eal response regulator in  pseudomonas putida: its role in the rhizosphere and an analysis of its target processes.
AB  == ggdef and eal/hd-gyp protein domains are responsible for the synthesis and hydrolysis of the bacterial secondary messenger cyclic diguanylate (c-di-gmp) through their diguanylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase activities, respectively. forty-three genes in pseudomonas putida kt2440 are putatively involved in the turnover of c-di-gmp. of them only rup4959 (locus pp4959) encodes a ggdef/eal response regulator, which was identified in a genome wide analysis as preferentially induced while this bacterium colonizes roots and adjacent soil areas (the rhizosphere). by using fusions to reporter genes it was confirmed that the rup4959 promoter is active in the rhizosphere and inducible by corn plant root exudates and microaerobiosis. transcription of rup4959 was strictly dependent on the alternative transcriptional factor sigma(s) . the inactivation of the rup4959-4957 operon altered the expression of 22 genes in the rhizosphere  and had a negative effect upon oligopeptide utilization and biofilm formation. in multicopy or when overexpressed, rup4959 enhanced adhesin lapa-dependent biofilm  formation, the development of wrinkly colony morphology, and increased calcofluor stainable exopolysaccharides (eps). under these conditions the inhibition of swarming motility was total and plant root tip colonization considerably less efficient, whereas swimming was partially diminished. this pleiotropic phenotype, which correlated with an increase in the global level of c-di-gmp, was not acquired with increased levels of rup4959 catalytic mutant at ggdef as a proof of this response regulator exhibiting diguanylate cyclase activity. a screen for mutants in putative targets of c-di-gmp led to the identification of a surface polysaccharide specific to kt2440, which is encoded by the genes cluster pp3133-pp3141, as essential for phenotypes associated with increased c-di-gmp. cellulose and alginate were discarded as the overproduced eps, and lipopolysaccharide (lps) core and o-antigen were found to be essential for the development of wrinkly colony morphology.

AB  == a cost-effective whole cell biosensor based on electrochemical technique to detect toxicities of phenol and nitrophenols has been developed. this method relied on the inhibition effect for respiratory chain activity of microorganism by toxicant, which was measured by chronoamperometry using mediator (ferricyanide). the current signals produced by suspended microorganisms and reoxidation of ferrocyanide were transformed to inhibiting efficiency directly, and 50% inhibiting concentration (ic(50)) was chosen as the quantitative standard of toxicity. the test microorganisms used here consist of three bacilli (escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and alcaligenes faecalis), two pseudomonas (pseudomonas fluorescens and pseucomonas putida) and one fungus (trichosporon cutaneum). 3,5-dichlorophenol (dcp) was taken as the reference toxicant. the results showed that the microorganisms which belong to the same bacterial family had similar trends of inhibitions on respiratory activity and similar ic50 values. by comparing the ic(50) values, p. fluorescens was the most  sensitive one to dcp toxicity, its ic(50) was estimated to be 4.2mg/l. ph 7.0 and together with the standard glucose-glutamic acid (gga) as an exogenous material were taken for optimum conditions in this study. here, p. fluorescens as model test microorganism was employed to assess toxicities of phenol and nitrophenols under the optimum conditions. ic(50) values of 291.4 mg/l for phenol, 64.1mg/l for 2-np, 71.4 mg/l for 3-np and 14.0mg/l for 4-np were determined at 60 min, respectively. comparison with the results of published data has confirmed that this cell biosensor is a sensitive and rapid alternative to toxicity screening of chemicals.

TI  == rapid and flexible biochemical assays for evaluating 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase activity.
AB  == pptases (phosphopantetheinyl transferases) are of great interest owing to their essential roles in activating fatty acid, polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase enzymes for both primary and secondary metabolism, as well as an increasing number of biotechnological applications. however, existing techniques  for pptase characterization and development are cumbersome and technically challenging. to address this, we have developed the indigoidine-synthesizing non-ribosomal peptide synthetase bpsa as a reporter for pptase activity. simple co-transformation allows rapid assessment of the ability of a pptase candidate to activate bpsa in vivo. kinetic parameters with respect to either coa or bpsa as variable substrate can then be derived in vitro by continuously measuring the rate of indigoidine synthesis as the pptase progressively converts bpsa from its  apo into holo form. subsequently, a competition assay, in which bpsa and purified carrier proteins compete for a limited pool of coa, enables elucidation of kinetic parameters for a pptase with those carrier proteins. we used this system  to conduct a rapid characterization of three different pptase enzymes: sfp of bacillus subtilis a.t.c.c.6633, pcps of pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, and the putative pptase pp1183 of ps. putida kt2440. we also demonstrate the utility of this system for discovery and characterization of pptase inhibitors.

TI  == idling time of motile bacteria contributes to retardation and dispersion in sand  porous medium.
AB  == the motility of microorganisms affects their transport in natural systems by altering their interactions with the solid phase of the soil matrix. to assess the effect of these interactions on transport parameters, a series of breakthrough curves (btcs) for motile and nonmotile bacteria, including e. coli and p. putida species, were measured from a homogeneously packed sand column under three different interstitial velocities of 1 m/d, 5 m/d, and 10 m/d. btcs for the nonmotile bacteria were nearly identical for all three flow rates, except that the recovery percentage at 1 m/d was reduced by 5% compared to the higher flow rates. in contrast, for the motile bacteria, the recovery percentages were not affected by flow rate, but their btcs exhibited a higher degree of retardation and dispersion as the flow velocity decreased, which was consistent with increased idling times of the motile strains. the smooth-swimming mutant e.  coli hcb437, which is unable to change its swimming direction after encountering  the solid surfaces and thus has the largest idling time, also exhibited the greatest degree of retardation and dispersion. all of the experimental observations were compared to results from an advection-dispersion transport model with three fitting parameters: retardation factor (r), longitudinal dispersivity (alpha(l)), and attachment rate coefficient (k(att)). in addition, the single-collector efficiency (eta(0)) and collision efficiency (alpha) were calculated according to the colloid filtration theory (cft), and confirmed that motile bacteria had lower collision efficiencies than nonmotile bacteria. this is consistent with previously reported observations that motile bacteria can avoid attachment to a solid surface by their active swimming capabilities. by quantifying the effect of bacterial motility on various transport parameters, more robust fate and transport models can be developed for decision-making related to environmental remediation strategies and risk assessment.

TI  == efficient production of soluble recombinant single chain fv fragments by a pseudomonas putida strain kt2440 cell factory.
AB  == background: recombinant antibody fragments have a wide range of applications in research, diagnostics and therapy. for many of these, small fragments like single chain fragment variables (scfv) function well and can be produced inexpensively in bacterial expression systems. although escherichia coli k-12 production systems are convenient, yields of different fragments, even those produced from codon-optimized expression systems, vary significantly. where yields are inadequate, alternative production systems are needed. pseudomonas putida strain  kt2440 is a versatile biosafety strain known for good expression of heterologous  genes, so we have explored its utility as a cell factory for production of scfvs. results: we have generated new broad host range scfv expression constructs and assessed their production in the pseudomonas putida kt2440 host. two scfvs bind either to human c-reactive protein or to mucin1, proteins of significant medical  diagnostic and therapeutic interest, whereas a third is a model anti-lysozyme scfv. the kt2440 antibody expression systems produce scfvs targeted to the periplasmic space that were processed precisely and were easily recovered and purified by single-step or tandem affinity chromatography. the influence of promoter system, codon optimization for p. putida, and medium on scfv yield was examined. yields of up to 3.5 mg/l of pure, soluble, active scfv fragments were obtained from shake flask cultures of constructs based on the original codon usage and expressed from the ptac expression system, yields that were 2.5-4 times higher than those from equivalent cultures of an e. coli k-12 expression host. conclusions: pseudomonas putida kt2440 is a good cell factory for the production  of scfvs, and the broad host range constructs we have produced allow yield assessment in a number of different expression hosts when yields in one initially selected are insufficient. high cell density cultivation and further optimization and refinement of the kt2440 cell factory will achieve additional increases in the yields of scfvs.

TI  == expression and characterization of (r)-specific enoyl coenzyme a hydratases making a channeling route to polyhydroxyalkanoate biosynthesis in pseudomonas putida.
AB  == we investigated the expression of (r)-specific enoyl coenzyme a hydratase (phaj)  in pseudomonas putida kt2440 accumulating polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) from sodium  octanoate in order to identify biosynthesis pathways of phas from fatty acids in  pseudomonads. from a database search through the p. putida kt2440 genome, an additional phaj gene homologous to phaj4(pa) from pseudomonas aeruginosa, termed  phaj4(pp), was identified. the gene products of phaj1(pp), which was identified previously, and phaj4(pp) were confirmed to be functional in recombinant escherichia coli on pha synthesis from sodium dodecanoate. cytosolic proteins from p. putida grown on sodium octanoate were subjected to anion exchange chromatography and one of the eluted fractions with hydratase activity included phaj4(pp), as revealed by western blot analysis. these results strongly suggest that phaj4(pp) forms a channeling route from beta-oxidation to pha biosynthesis in p. putida. moreover, the substrate specificity of phaj1(pp) was suggested to be different from that of phaj1(pa) from p. aeruginosa although these two proteins share 67% amino acid sequence identity.

AB  == two promoter probe plasmid vectors, designated pipp1 and pipp2, were constructed  from the existing plasmids pxe4 and pset152. pipp1 and 2 use the xyle gene of pseudomonas putida as a reporter and can be transferred to streptomycetes by conjugation from escherichia coli. the function of these plasmids as promoter probes was demonstrated in streptomyces antibioticus and streptomyces coelicolor  using the phenoxazinone synthase and polynucleotide phosphorylase promoters from  s. antibioticus. xyle activity could be detected in colonies on agar plates or via the in vitro assay for catechol dioxygenase. the integration into the s. antibioticus chromosome of the constructs containing the phsa promoter was verified by southern blotting. the presence of the bla locus in pipp1 allows the  recovery of putative promoters by marker rescue.

AB  == ecotoxicity and genotoxicity of widely used veterinary antimicrobials oxytetracycline and flumequine was studied with six model organisms (vibrio fischeri, pseudomonas putida, pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, lemna minor, daphnia magna, escherichia coli). overall median effective concentration (ec50) values ranged from 0.22 mg/l to 86 mg/l. pseudomonas putida was the most sensitive organism (ec50 values for 16-h growth inhibition were 0.22 and 0.82 mg/l for oxytetracycline and flumequine, respectively), followed by duckweed lemna minor (7-d growth inhibition, ec50 2.1 and 3.0 mg/l) and green alga pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (4-d growth inhibition, ec50 3.1 and 2.6 mg/l). the least sensitive organism was daphnia magna (48-h immobilization, lowest-observed-effect concentration [loec] of oxytetracycline of 400 mg/l). oxytetracycline showed limited genotoxicity (sos-chromotest with escherichia coli, minimal genotoxic concentration of 500 mg/l), and flumequine was genotoxic  at 0.25 mg/l. based on the reported measured concentrations (mecs) and predicted  no-effect concentrations (pnecs), oxytetracycline may be concluded to be of ecotoxicological concern (calculated risk quotient = 8), whereas flumequine seems to represent lower risk.

TI  == quantification of ploidy in proteobacteria revealed the existence of monoploid, (mero-)oligoploid and polyploid species.
AB  == bacteria are generally assumed to be monoploid (haploid). this assumption is mainly based on generalization of the results obtained with the most intensely studied model bacterium, escherichia coli (a gamma-proteobacterium), which is monoploid during very slow growth. however, several species of proteobacteria are oligo- or polyploid, respectively. to get a better overview of the distribution of ploidy levels, genome copy numbers were quantified in four species of three different groups of proteobacteria. a recently developed real time pcr approach,  which had been used to determine the ploidy levels of halophilic archaea, was optimized for the quantification of genome copy numbers of bacteria. slow-growing (doubling time 103 minutes) and fast-growing (doubling time 25 minutes) e. coli cultures were used as a positive control. the copy numbers of the origin and terminus region of the chromosome were determined and the results were in excellent agreement with published data. the approach was also used to determine  the ploidy levels of caulobacter crescentus (an alpha-proteobacterium) and wolinella succinogenes (an epsilon-proteobacterium), both of which are monoploid. in contrast, pseudomonas putida (a gamma-proteobacterium) contains 20 genome copies and is thus polyploid. a survey of the proteobacteria with experimentally-determined genome copy numbers revealed that only three to four of 11 species are monoploid and thus monoploidy is not typical for proteobacteria. the ploidy level is not conserved within the groups of proteobacteria, and there  are no obvious correlations between the ploidy levels with other parameters like  genome size, optimal growth temperature or mode of life.

TI  == regulatory exaptation of the catabolite repression protein (crp)-camp system in pseudomonas putida.
AB  == the genome of the soil bacterium pseudomonas putida kt2440 encodes singular orthologues of genes crp (encoding the catabolite repression protein, crp) and cyaa (adenylate cyclase) of escherichia coli. the levels of camp formed by p. putida cells were below detection with a dictyostelium biosensor in vivo. the cyaa(p. putida) gene was transcribed in vivo but failed to complement the lack of maltose consumption of a cyaa mutant of e. coli, thereby indicating that cyaa(p.  putida) was poorly translated or rendered non-functional in the heterologous host. yet, generation of camp by cyaa(p. putida) could be verified by expressing  the cyaa(p. putida) gene in a hypersensitive e. coli strain. on the other hand, the crp(p. putida) gene restored the metabolic capacities of an equivalent crp mutant of e. coli, but not in a double crp/cyaa strain, suggesting that the ability to regulate such functions required camp. in order to clarify the breadth of the crp/camp system in p. putida, crp and cyaa mutants were generated and passed through a battery of phenotypic tests for recognition of gross metabolic properties and stress-endurance abilities. these assays revealed that the loss of each gene led in most (but not all) cases to the same phenotypic behaviour, indicating a concerted functionality. unexpectedly, none of the mutations affected the panel of carbon compounds that can be used by p. putida as growth substrates, the mutants being impaired only in the use of various dipeptides as n sources. furthermore, the lack of crp or cyaa had little influence on the gross growth fingerprinting of the cells. the poor physiological profile of the crp-camp system of p. putida when compared with e. coli exposes a case of regulatory exaptation, i.e. the process through which a property evolved for a particular function is co-opted for a new use.

AB  == tractable plasmids (pac-mv-based plasmids) for escherichia coli were constructed, which carried a mevalonate-utilizing gene cluster, towards an efficient functional analysis of cytochromes p450 involved in sesquiterpene biosynthesis. they included genes coding for a series of redox partners that transfer the electrons from nad(p)h to a p450 protein. the redox partners used were ferredoxin reductases (cama and nsred) and ferredoxins (camb and nsfer), which are derived from pseudomonas putida and cyanobacterium nostoc sp. strain pcc 7120, respectively, as well as three higher-plant nadph-p450 reductases, the arabidopsis thaliana atr2 and two corresponding enzymes derived from ginger (zingiber officinale), named zored1 and zored2. we also constructed plasmids for  functional analysis of two p450s, alpha-humulene-8-hydroxylase (cyp71ba1) from shampoo ginger (zingiber zerumbet) and germacrene a hydroxylase (p450ns; cyp110c1) from nostoc sp. pcc 7120, and co-transformed e. coli with each of the pac-mv-based plasmids. production levels of 8-hydroxy-alpha-humulene with recombinant e. coli cells (for cyp71ba1) were 1.5- to 2.3-fold higher than that of a control strain without the mevalonate-pathway genes. level of the p450ns product with the combination of nsred and nsfer was 2.9-fold higher than that of  the cama and camb. the predominant product of p450ns was identified as 1,2,3,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydro-6-isopropenyl-4,8a-dimethylnaphth-1-ol with nmr analyses.

TI  == stability, bioavailability, and bacterial toxicity of zno and iron-doped zno nanoparticles in aquatic media.
AB  == the stability and bioavailability of nanoparticles is governed by the interfacial properties that nanoparticles acquire when immersed in a particular aquatic media as well as the type of organism or cell under consideration. herein, high-throughput screening (hts) was used to elucidate zno nanoparticle stability, bioavailability, and antibacterial mechanisms as a function of iron doping level  (in the zno nanoparticles), aquatic chemistry, and bacterial cell type. zeta-potential and aggregation state of dispersed zno nanoparticles was strongly  influenced by iron doping in addition to electrolyte composition and dissolved organic matter; however, bacterial inactivation by zno nanoparticles was most significantly influenced by zn(2+) ions dissolution, cell type, and organic matter. nanoparticle ic(50) values determined for bacillus subtilis and escherichia coli were on the order of 0.3-0.5 and 15-43 mg/l (as zn(2+)), while the ic(50) for zn(2+) tolerant pseudomonas putida was always >500 mg/l. tannic acid decreased toxicity of zno nanoparticles more than humic, fulvic, and alginic acid, because it complexed the most free zn(2+) ions, thereby reducing their bioavailability. these results underscore the complexities and challenges regulators face in assessing potential environmental impacts of nanotechnology; however, the high-throughput and combinatorial methods employed promise to rapidly expand the knowledge base needed to develop an appropriate risk assessment framework.

TI  == crystal structure of ttgv in complex with its dna operator reveals a general model for cooperative dna binding of tetrameric gene regulators.
AB  == the majority of bacterial gene regulators bind as symmetric dimers to palindromic dna operators of 12-20 base pairs (bp). multimeric forms of proteins, including tetramers, are able to recognize longer operator sequences in a cooperative manner, although how this is achieved is not well understood due to the lack of complete structural information. models, instead of structures, of complete tetrameric assembly on dna exist in literature. here we present the crystal structures of the multidrug-binding protein ttgv, a gene repressor that controls  efflux pumps, alone and in complex with a 42-bp dna operator containing two ttgv  recognition sites at 2.9 a and 3.4 a resolution. these structures represent the first full-length functional tetrameric protein in complex with its intact dna operator containing two continuous recognition sites. ttgv binds to its dna operator as a highly asymmetric tetramer and induces considerable distortions in  the dna, resulting in a 60 degrees bend. upon binding to its operator, ttgv undergoes large conformational changes at the monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric  levels. the structures here reveal a general model for cooperative dna binding of tetrameric gene regulators and provide a structural basis for a large body of biochemical data and a reinterpretation of previous models for tetrameric gene regulators derived from partial structural data.

TI  == development of microbial engineered whole-cell systems for environmental benzene  determination.
AB  == this paper reports the development of two recombinant bacterial systems that can  be used to monitor environmental benzene contamination based on escherichia coli, which carry genes coding for benzene dioxygenase and benzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase from pseudomonas putida mst. e. coli strains express these two enzymes under the control of the ptac promoter or without any induction. these activities can be detected electrochemically or colorimetrically and used to monitor benzene pollution in environmental air samples collected from an oil refinery assessing benzene by different laboratory experimental procedures. the procedures involving whole-cell bioassays determine the concentration of benzene  through benzene dioxygenase activity, which allows for direct correlation of oxygen consumption, and through the benzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase that causes catechol accumulation and restores nadh necessary for the activity of the first enzyme. oxygen consumption and catechol production deriving from both enzymatic activities are related to benzene concentration and their measurements determined the sensitivity of the system. the results indicated that the sensitivity was enough to detect the benzene vapor at a lower concentration level of 0.01 mm in about 30 min. the possibility for on-line monitoring of benzene concentration by  our new recombinant cells results from the fact that no particular treatment of environmental samples is required. this is a major advantage over other biosensors or assays. moreover, the development of microbial cells that did not require any addition or effectors for the transcription of the specific enzymes,  allowed these systems to be more versatile in automated environmental benzene monitoring.

AB  == from the reaction mechanism and crystal structure analysis, a bacterial alanine racemase is believed to work as a homodimer with a substrate, l-alanine or d-alanine. we analysed oligomerization states of seven alanine racemases, biosynthetic and catabolic, from escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. putida and p. fluorescens, with three different methods, gel filtration chromatography, native page and analytical ultracentrifugation. all alanine racemases were proved to be in a dynamic equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric form with every methods used in this study. in both biosynthetic and catabolic alanine racemases, association constants for dimerization were high for the enzymes with high v(max) values. the enzymes with low v(max) values gave the low association constants. we proposed that alanine racemases are classified into two types; the enzymes with low and high-equilibrium association constants for dimerization.

TI  == physiological relation between respiration activity and heterologous expression of selected benzoylformate decarboxylase variants in escherichia coli.
AB  == background: the benzoylformate decarboxylase (bfd) from pseudomonas putida is a biotechnologically interesting biocatalyst. it catalyses the formation of chiral  2-hydroxy ketones, which are important building blocks for stereoselective syntheses. to optimise the enzyme function often the amino acid composition is modified to improve the performance of the enzyme. so far it was assumed that a relatively small modification of the amino acid composition of a protein does not significantly influence the level of expression or media requirements. to determine, which effects these modifications might have on cultivation and product formation, six different bfd-variants with one or two altered amino acids and the wild type bfd were expressed in escherichia coli sg13009 pkk233-2. the oxygen transfer rate (otr) as parameter for growth and metabolic activity of the  different e. coli clones was monitored on-line in lb, tb and modified pang mineral medium with the respiratory activity monitoring system (ramos). results:  although the e. coli clones were genetically nearly identical, the kinetics of their metabolic activity surprisingly differed in the standard media applied. three different types of otr curves could be distinguished. whereas the first type (clones expressing leu476pro-ser181thr or leu476pro) had typical otr curves, the second type (clones expressing the wild type bfd, ser181thr or his281ala) showed an early drop of otr in lb and tb medium and a drastically reduced maximum otr in modified pang mineral medium. the third type (clone expressing leu476gln)  behaved variable. depending on the cultivation conditions, its otr curve was similar to the first or the second type. it was shown, that the kinetics of the metabolic activity of the first type depended on the concentration of thiamine, which is a cofactor of bfd, in the medium. it was demonstrated that the cofactor  binding strength of the different bfd-variants correlated with the differences in metabolic activity of their respective host strain. conclusions: the bfd-variants with high cofactor binding affinity (wild type, his281ala, ser181thr) obviously extract thiamine from the medium and bind it tightly to the enzyme. this might explain the hampered growth of these clones. in contrast, growth of clones expressing variants with low cofactor binding affinity (leu476his, leu476pro, leu476pro-ser181thr) is not impaired. leu476gln has an intermediate cofactor binding strength, thus, growth of its host strain depends on the specific cultivation conditions. this paper shows that slight differences of the amino acid composition can affect protein expression and cultivation and might require  an adaptation of media components. effects such as the observed are hardly foreseeable and difficult to detect in conventional screening processes. via small scale experiments with on-line measurements in shake flasks such effects influencing the cultivation and product formation can be detected and avoided.

TI  == active community profiling via capillary electrophoresis single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of amplified 16s rrna and 16s rrna genes.
AB  == here, we report the validation and advancement of a high-throughput method for fingerprinting the active members of a microbial community. this method, termed active community profiling (acp), provides information about both the composition and the activity of mixed microbial cultures via comparative measurements of amplified 16s rrna (rna) and 16s rrna genes (dna). capillary electrophoresis is used to resolve single-strand conformation polymorphisms of polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and reverse transcription pcr (rt-pcr) products, producing electropherograms representative of the community structure. active members of the community are distinguished by elevated rna:dna peak area ratios. chemostat experiments with defined populations were conducted to validate the acp approach. using a pure culture of escherichia coli, a direct correlation was found between  the growth rate and the rna:dna peak ratio. in a second validation experiment, a  binary culture of e. coli and pseudomonas putida was subjected to a controlled environmental change consisting of a shift to anaerobic conditions. acp revealed  the expected cessation of growth of p. putida, an obligate aerobe, while the corresponding dna-only analysis indicated no change in the culture. finally, acp  was applied to a complex microbial community, and a novel binning approach was demonstrated for integrating the rna and dna electropherograms. acp thus represents a significant advance from traditional dna-based profiling techniques, which do not distinguish active from inactive or dead cells, and is well suited for high-throughput community analysis.

TI  == growth behaviors of bacteria in biofouling cake layer in a dead-end microfiltration system.
AB  == the growth behaviors of three bacterial species, i.e. escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida and aquabaculum hongkongensis, in biofouling cake layer (attached form) were investigated using an unstirred dead-end continuous microfiltration system, and were compared with those in suspended form. results showed that all the three bacteria had larger average growth rates in suspended form than in attached form under high substrates levels. under oligotrophic conditions, the average growth rates in the attached form were faster than those  in the suspended form, especially for a. hongkongensis. the growth behaviors analysis presented the same results due to all the tested bacteria had higher maximum growth rate and saturation constant in suspended form than attached form, indicating the dominant growth mode would be shifted from attached form to suspended form with substrate concentration increase. finally, total filtration resistance determined in the experiments increased significantly with the bacterial growth in filtration system.

TI  == a mutation in dnak causes stabilization of the heat shock sigma factor sigma32, accumulation of heat shock proteins and increase in toluene-resistance in pseudomonas putida.
AB  == heat shock gene expression is regulated by the cellular level and activity of the stress sigma factor sigma(32) in gram-negative bacteria. a toluene-resistant, temperature-sensitive derivative strain of pseudomonas putida kt2442, designated  kt2442-r2 (r2), accumulated several heat shock proteins (hsps) under non-stress conditions. genome sequencing of strain r2 revealed that its genome contains a number of point mutations, including a cgt to cct change in dnak resulting in an  arg445 to pro substitution in dnak. dna microarray and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed that the mrna levels of representative hsp genes (e.g. dnak, htpg and groel) were upregulated in r2 cells in the stationary phase. wild-type and r2 cells showed similar heat shock responses at hsp mrna and hsp levels; however, the sigma(32) level in the mutant  was not downregulated in the shut-off stage. strain r2 harbouring plasmid-borne dnak grew at 37 degrees c, did not accumulate hsps, and was more sensitive to toluene than strain r2. it is worth to note that that revertant of r2 able to grow at 37 degrees c were isolated and exhibited a replacement of pro445 by ser or leu in dnak. thus, the mutation in dnak causes the temperature-sensitive phenotype, improper stabilization of sigma(32) leading to hsp accumulation and increased toluene resistance in strain r2.

TI  == construction and characterization of escherichia coli whole-cell biosensors for toluene and related compounds.
AB  == the xylr regulatory protein is a transcriptional activator from the tol plasmid of pseudomonas putida mt-2 that is involved in the toluene and benzene degradation pathway. here we describe the construction and laboratory characterization of recombinant biosensors (pglpx plasmids) based on xylr and its cognate promoter (pu). in the pglpx plasmid, the reporter luc gene is under the control of the pu promoter. we evaluated the ability of two distinct nucleotide sequences to function as sd elements and improve sensitivity of bioreporting. we  also evaluated the effect of introducing the t(2)rrnbeta terminator on the specificity of the construct. e. coli transformed with pglpx plasmids were used to sense toluene and its derivatives. the pattern of induction was different for  each derivative. in general, more luciferase activity was induced by toluene and  benzene than by tnt and dnt at most tested concentrations. the bioluminescence response of the reporter strains to the nitrotoluenes was significantly stronger  at lower concentrations (>/= 50 mumol) than at higher concentrations. our results show that the sd sequence (taaggagg) is crucially important for biosensor sensitivity. the presence of the t(2)rrnbeta terminator in the bioreporter plasmid prevents nonspecific responses and also reduces biosensor sensitivity upon exposure to inducers. these data suggest that pglpx strains can be used as whole-cell biosensors to detect toluene and related compounds. further investigation will be required to optimize the application of pglpx biosensors.

TI  == novel tools for the functional expression of metagenomic dna.
AB  == the functional expression of environmental genes in a particular host bacterium is hampered by various limitations including inefficient transcription of target  genes as well as improper assembly of the corresponding enzymes. therefore, the identification of novel enzymes from metagenomic libraries by activity-based screening requires efficient expression and screening systems. in the following chapter, we present two novel tools to improve the functional expression of metagenomic genes. (1) comparative screenings of metagenomic libraries demonstrated that different enzymes were detected when phylogenetically distinct  expression host strains were used. thus, we have developed a strategy, which comprises library construction using a shuttle vector that allows comparative expression and screening of metagenomic dna in escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, and bacillus subtilis. (2) expression studies have revealed that functional expression of environmental genes in heterologous expression hosts is  often limited by insufficient promoter recognition. therefore, a method is described allowing to enhance the expression capacity of e. coli by using the transposon muexpress. this recombinant transposon is able to insert randomly into environmental dna fragments thereby facilitating gene expression from its two inducible promoters.

TI  == transfer of plasmid pjp4 from escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida to bacteria in activated sludge developed under different sludge retention times.
AB  == to add the knowledge on the plasmid-mediated bioaugmentation in the activated sludge process, conjugative transfer of a self-transmissible, broad host range, mercury resistance, and partial 2,4-dichlorophenoxyactic acid (2,4-d)-degrading plasmid pjp4 from escherichia coli hb101 or pseudomonas putida kt2440 to activated sludge bacteria were examined by filter mating. activated sludge samples were collected from an actual wastewater treatment plant and laboratory reactors operated under different sludge retention times (srts) of 5, 10, and 15  days. transfer of pjp4 was observed in all combinations of donor and activated sludge (recipient) with the transfer frequency from 6.5 x 10(-)(8) to 2.5 x 10(-)(4) transconjugants per recipient, except from e. coli hb101 to the activated sludge sample of srt 5 days. although plasmid pjp4 was transferred mainly to dominant bacteria belonging to pseudomonas, the host range of pjp4 in the activated sludge varied depending on the donor strain. phenotypically various transconjugants were isolated from activated sludge sampled from the reactors with longer srt operations. all transconjugants exhibited high mercury resistance equivalent to the donor strains; some were capable of degrading 2,4-d. these results suggest that the behavior of plasmids can be controlled partially through selection of appropriate donor strains and operational conditions of the activated sludge process.

TI  == scale-up of baeyer-villiger monooxygenase-catalyzed synthesis of enantiopure compounds.
AB  == several baeyer-villiger monooxygenases converting a wide spectrum of substrates have been discovered, cloned, and characterized throughout the last few years. still, only a few of them are applicable for large-scale conversion predominantly due to their sensitivity towards high substrate and/or product concentrations. the recently cloned and characterized 4-hydroxyacetophenone monooxygenase from pseudomonas putida jd1 shows excellent enantioselectivity towards 3-phenyl-2-butanone with e > 100 but is inhibited by concentrations >10 mm of both substrate and product. this obstacle could be circumvented by in situ substrate feed and product removal using a hydrophobic lewatit(r) adsorbent resin. thus, the concentration of 3-phenyl-2-butanone could be increased from 1.4 to >26 mm without significant reduction in conversion.

TI  == design and characterization of an aequorin-based bacterial biosensor for detection of toluene and related compounds.
AB  == an aequorin-based escherichia coli strain jm109 biosensor was constructed and characterized for its potential to detect toluene and related compounds in aqueous solutions. the biosensor was constructed based on a pgl2 plasmid carrying the lower pathway promoter (pu) of the xyl operon of pseudomonas putida mt-2, which was incorporated with transcriptional activator xylr and fused to aequorin  cdna named pgl2-aequorin. binding of xylr protein to a subset of toluene-like compounds activates transcription at the pu promoter, thus expression of aequorin is controlled by xylr and pu. in this work we have compared the effect of shine-dalgarno (sd) and t2 rrnbeta terminator sequence in the expression of aequorin. according to the sensitivity of aequorin and increase in the signal-to-noise ratio, this reporter enzyme has reasonable sensitivity compared with other reporter systems. the results indicate higher expression of aequorin in the presence of sd and t2 rrnbeta. the activity of aequorin in recombinant whole-cell biosensor was linear from 1 to 500 mum of toluene. the bioluminescence response was specific for toluene-like molecules, so this biosensor cells would be able to detect toluene derivative contamination in environmental samples, accurately.

TI  == bacterial phenylalanine and phenylacetate catabolic pathway revealed.
AB  == aromatic compounds constitute the second most abundant class of organic substrates and environmental pollutants, a substantial part of which (e.g., phenylalanine or styrene) is metabolized by bacteria via phenylacetate. surprisingly, the bacterial catabolism of phenylalanine and phenylacetate remained an unsolved problem. although a phenylacetate metabolic gene cluster had been identified, the underlying biochemistry remained largely unknown. here we elucidate the catabolic pathway functioning in 16% of all bacteria whose genome has been sequenced, including escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida. this strategy is exceptional in several aspects. intermediates are processed as coa thioesters, and the aromatic ring of phenylacetyl-coa becomes activated to a ring 1,2-epoxide by a distinct multicomponent oxygenase. the reactive nonaromatic epoxide is isomerized to a seven-member o-heterocyclic enol ether, an oxepin. this isomerization is followed by hydrolytic ring cleavage and beta-oxidation steps, leading to acetyl-coa and succinyl-coa. this widespread paradigm differs significantly from the established chemistry of aerobic aromatic catabolism, thus widening our view of how organisms exploit such inert substrates. it provides insight into the natural remediation of man-made environmental contaminants such  as styrene. furthermore, this pathway occurs in various pathogens, where its reactive early intermediates may contribute to virulence.

TI  == pmr, a histone-like protein h1 (h-ns) family protein encoded by the incp-7 plasmid pcar1, is a key global regulator that alters host function.
AB  == histone-like protein h1 (h-ns) family proteins are nucleoid-associated proteins (naps) conserved among many bacterial species. the incp-7 plasmid pcar1 is transmissible among various pseudomonas strains and carries a gene encoding the h-ns family protein, pmr. pseudomonas putida kt2440 is a host of pcar1, which harbors five genes encoding the h-ns family proteins pp_1366 (tura), pp_3765 (turb), pp_0017 (turc), pp_3693 (turd), and pp_2947 (ture). quantitative reverse  transcription-pcr (qrt-pcr) demonstrated that the presence of pcar1 does not affect the transcription of these five genes and that only pmr, tura, and turb were primarily transcribed in kt2440(pcar1). in vitro pull-down assays revealed that pmr strongly interacted with itself and with tura, turb, and ture. transcriptome comparisons of the pmr disruptant, kt2440, and kt2440(pcar1) strains indicated that pmr disruption had greater effects on the host transcriptome than did pcar1 carriage. the transcriptional levels of some genes that increased with pcar1 carriage, such as the mexef-oprn efflux pump genes and  pari, reverted with pmr disruption to levels in pcar1-free kt2440. transcriptional levels of putative horizontally acquired host genes were not altered by pcar1 carriage but were altered by pmr disruption. identification of genome-wide pmr binding sites by chap-chip (chromatin affinity purification coupled with high-density tiling chip) analysis demonstrated that pmr preferentially binds to horizontally acquired dna regions. the pmr binding sites  overlapped well with the location of the genes differentially transcribed following pmr disruption on both the plasmid and the chromosome. our findings indicate that pmr is a key factor in optimizing gene transcription on pcar1 and the host chromosome.

AB  == a novel tightly regulated gene expression system was developed for escherichia coli by applying the regulatory elements of the pseudomonas putida f1 cym and cmt operons to control target gene expression at the transcriptional level by using p-isopropylbenzoate (cumate) as an inducer. this novel expression system, referred to as the cumate gene switch, includes a specific expression vector, pnew, that contains a partial t5 phage promoter combined with the pseudomonas-based synthetic operator and the cymr repressor protein-encoding gene designed to express constitutively in the host strain. the induction of transcription relies on the addition of the exogenous inducer (cumate), which is  nontoxic to the culture, water soluble, and inexpensive. the characteristics and  potential of the expression system were determined. using flow cytometry and fed-batch fermentations, we have shown that, with the newly developed cumate-regulated system, (i) higher recombinant product yields can be obtained than with the pet (isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside [iptg])-induced expression system, (ii) expression is tightly regulated, (iii) addition of cumate quickly results in a fully induced and homogenous protein-expressing population in contrast to the bimodal expression profile of an iptg-induced population, (iv) expression can be modulated by varying the cumate concentration, and (v) the cumate-induced population remains induced and fully expressing even at 8 h following induction, resulting in high yields of the target protein furthermore,  the cumate gene switch described in this article is applicable to a wide range of e. coli strains.

AB  == aims: natural rubber (poly-[cis-1,4-isoprene]) can be cleaved into 12-oxo-4,8-dimethyltrideca-4,8-diene-1-al by rubber oxygenase a (roxa) isolated from xanthomonas sp. roxa is a novel type of dihaem dioxygenase with unknown cleavage mechanism of the rubber carbon backbone. analysis of mutant roxa after mutagenesis could be a way to investigate the function of selected amino acids of roxa during catalysis. unfortunately, expression of functional roxa in recombinant escherichia coli or in recombinant gamma-proteobacteria such as pseudomonas putida was not possible in our hands. therefore, expression of recombinant roxa in the homologous host, xanthomonas, was performed. methods and  results: a transformation system via electroporation was established, and a conjugation system was optimized for xanthomonas sp. inactivation of the chromosomal roxa gene by insertional mutagenesis resulted in inability of xanthomonas sp. to produce active roxa and to utilize rubber as a sole source of  carbon and energy. when an intact copy of roxa was cloned under control of a rhamnose-inducible promoter in a broad host range vector and was transferred to xanthomonas sp., high expression levels of functional roxa in the presence of rhamnose were obtained. conclusions and significance and impact of the study: purification of recombinantly expressed roxa was simplified because of drastically shortened fermentation times and because separation of roxa from remaining rubber latex particles was not necessary with rhamnose-induced cultures. about 6 mg purified roxa were obtained from 1 l of cell-free culture fluid. purified recombinant roxa was highly active and revealed comparable spectral properties as roxa purified from the wild type. the results of our study are the methodical basis for molecular biological manipulation in xanthomonas sp. and will simplify investigation into the biochemical mechanisms by which rubber can be biodegraded in the environment by this novel extracellular dihaem dioxygenase roxa.

TI  == crystal structure of the leucine aminopeptidase from pseudomonas putida reveals the molecular basis for its enantioselectivity and broad substrate specificity.
AB  == the zinc-dependent leucine aminopeptidase from pseudomonas putida (pplap) is an important enzyme for the industrial production of enantiomerically pure amino acids. to provide a better understanding of its structure-function relationships, the enzyme was studied by x-ray crystallography. crystal structures of native pplap at ph 9.5 and ph 5.2, and in complex with the inhibitor bestatin, show that the overall folding and hexameric organization of pplap are very similar to those of the closely related di-zinc leucine aminopeptidases (laps) from bovine lens and escherichia coli. at ph 9.5, the active site contains two metal ions, one identified as mn(2+) or zn(2+) (site 1), and the other as zn(2+) (site 2). by using a metal-dependent activity assay it was shown that site 1 in heterologously expressed pplap is occupied mainly by mn(2+). moreover, it was shown that mn(2+)  has a significant activation effect when bound to site 1 of pplap. at ph 5.2, the active site of pplap is highly disordered and the two metal ions are absent, most probably due to full protonation of one of the metal-interacting residues, lys267, explaining why pplap is inactive at low ph. a structural comparison of the pplap-bestatin complex with inhibitor-bound complexes of bovine lens lap, along with substrate modelling, gave clear and new insights into its substrate specificity and high level of enantioselectivity.

TI  == p450cam visits an open conformation in the absence of substrate.
AB  == p450cam from pseudomonas putida is the best characterized member of the vast family of cytochrome p450s, and it has long been believed to have a more rigid and closed active site relative to other p450s. here we report x-ray structures of p450cam crystallized in the absence of substrate and at high and low [k(+)]. the camphor-free structures are observed in a distinct open conformation characterized by a water-filled channel created by the retraction of the f and g  helices, disorder of the b' helix, and loss of the k(+) binding site. crystallization in the presence of k(+) alone does not alter the open conformation, while crystallization with camphor alone is sufficient for closure  of the channel. soaking crystals of the open conformation in excess camphor does  not promote camphor binding or closure, suggesting resistance to conformational change by the crystal lattice. this open conformation is remarkably similar to that seen upon binding large tethered substrates, showing that it is not the result of a perturbation by the ligand. redissolved crystals of the open conformation are observed as a mixture of p420 and p450 forms, which is converted to the p450 form upon addition of camphor and k(+). these data reveal that p450cam can dynamically visit an open conformation that allows access to the deeply buried active site without being induced by substrate or ligand.

TI  == modelling the interactions between pseudomonas putida and escherichia coli o157:h7 in fish-burgers: use of the lag-exponential model and of a combined interaction index.
AB  == aims: the objective of the current study was to examine the interactions between  pseudomonas putida and escherichia coli o157:h7 in coculture studies on fish-burgers packed in air and under different modified atmospheres (30 : 40 : 30 o(2) : co(2) : n(2), 5 : 95 o(2) : co(2) and 50 : 50 o(2) : co(2)), throughout the storage at 8 degrees c. methods and results: the lag-exponential model was applied to describe the microbial growth. to give a quantitative measure of the occurring microbial interactions, two simple parameters were developed: the combined interaction index (cii) and the partial interaction index (pii). under air, the interaction was significant (p < 0.05) only within the exponential growth phase (cii, 1.72), whereas under the modified atmospheres, the interactions were highly significant (p < 0.001) and occurred both in the exponential and in the stationary phase (cii ranged from 0.33 to 1.18). pii values for e. coli o157:h7 were lower than those calculated for ps. putida. conclusions: the interactions occurring into the system affected both e. coli o157:h7 and pseudomonads subpopulations. the packaging atmosphere resulted in a key element. significance and impact of the study: the article provides some useful information on the interactions occurring between e. coli o157:h7 and ps.  putida on fish-burgers. the proposed index describes successfully the competitive growth of both micro-organisms, giving also a quantitative measure of a qualitative phenomenon.

TI  == rationally engineered biotransformation of p-nitrophenol.
AB  == an operon encoding enzymes responsible for degradation of the epa priority contaminant para-nitrophenol (pnp) from pseudomonas sp. env2030 contains more genes than would appear to be necessary to mineralize pnp. to determine some necessary genes for pnp degradation, the genes encoding the proposed enzymes in the degradation pathway (pnpadec) were assembled into a broad-host-range, biobricks-compatible vector under the control of a constitutive promoter. these were introduced into escherichia coli dh10b and two pseudomonas putida strains, one with a knockout of the aromatic transport ttgb and the parent with the native transporter. the engineered strains were assayed for pnp removal. e. coli dh10b harboring several versions of the refactored pathway was able to remove pnp from  the medium up to a concentration of 0.2 mm; above which pnp was toxic to e. coli. a strain of p. putida harboring the pnp pathway genes was capable of removing pnp from the medium up to 0.5 mm. when p. putida harboring the native pnp degradation cluster was exposed to pnp, pnpadec were induced, and the resulting production of beta-ketoadipate from pnp induced expression of its chromosomal degradation pathway (pcaijf). in contrast, pnpadec were expressed constitutively from the refactored constructs because none of the regulatory genes found in the native pnp degradation cluster were included. although p. putida harboring the refactored construct was incapable of growing exclusively on pnp as a carbon source, evidence that the engineered pathway was functional was demonstrated by the induced expression of chromosomal pcaijf.

TI  == broad-host-range vectors for protein expression across gram negative hosts.
AB  == expression of recombinant proteins across a range of different host organisms is  often necessary in metabolic engineering applications. doing so can be facilitated by the use of vectors having origins of replication with a broad-host-range, the option for antibiotic resistance cassettes that are compatible with a particular host, in addition to sequences allowing for the effective transcription and translation of target proteins. we have created a modular set of broad-host-range expression vectors for protein expression in gram negative bacteria. these vectors use the broad-host-range pbbr1 replicon as well  as the arabinose-inducible p(bad) promoter and are available with six different antibiotic resistance cassettes. we have demonstrated the use of these vectors in escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, and burkholderia cepacia.

AB  == cyp199a2, a bacterial p450 monooxygenase from rhodopseudomonas palustris, was previously reported to oxidize 2-naphthoic acid and 4-ethylbenzoic acid. in this  study, we examined the substrate specificity and regioselectivity of cyp199a2 towards indole- and quinolinecarboxylic acids. the cyp199a2 gene was coexpressed  with palustrisredoxin gene from r. palustris and putidaredoxin reductase gene from pseudomonas putida to provide the redox partners of cyp199a2 in escherichia  coli. following whole-cell assays, reaction products were identified by mass spectrometry and nmr spectroscopy.cyp199a2 did not exhibit any activity towards indole and indole-3-carboxylic acid, whereas this enzyme oxidized indole-2-carboxylic acid, indole-5-carboxylic acid, and indole-6-carboxylic acid. indole-2-carboxylic acid was converted to 5- and 6-hydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acids at a ratio of 59:41. in contrast, the indole-6-carboxylic acid oxidation generated only one product, 2-indolinone-6-carboxylic acid,at a rate of 130 mol (mol p450)(-1) min(-1). furthermore,cyp199a2 also oxidized quinoline-6-carboxylic acid,although this enzyme did not exhibit any activity towards quinoline and its  derivatives with a carboxyl group at the c-2,c-3, or c-4 positions. the oxidation product of quinoline-6-carboxylic acid was identified to be 3-hydroxyquinoline-6-carboxylic acid, which was a novel compound. these results suggest that cyp199a2 may be a valuable biocatalyst for the regioselective oxidation of various aromatic carboxylic acids.

TI  == non-uv germicidal activity of fresh tio2 and ag/tio2.
AB  == fresh tio2 was found to possess a strong germicidal activity even without uv irradiation. live yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells in contact with fresh tio2 were found deformed and dead after 15 min contact. the cause of germicidal activity was discussed from the observed cell deformation, lysis and increased absorption at 1680 cm(-1) in ft-ir spectra of the affected cells, which proved the oxidizing effect of fresh tio2 to cells. the deformation caused by the stretching of cell wall and pressure built-up inside the cell, led to cell burst  and release of intracellular materials. the degree of cell deformation was found  positively related with the wetting property of tio2. cells are negatively charged, for gram-negative cell (thinner cell wall), a higher germicidal effect was observed than gram-positive cells. the germicidal effect of tio2 gradually decreased after exposure to air at room temperature, as the wetting property decreased. this kind of germicidal activity was more effective compared to other  germicidal process such as uva/tio2 or ag+. this shed light on designing new germicidal material either maintained by visible light irradiation, or by oxidation effect generated by reactive oxygen species.

TI  == the sigma-factor flia, ppgpp and dksa coordinate transcriptional control of the aer2 gene of pseudomonas putida.
AB  == here the sigma-factor requirement for transcription of three similar, but differentially regulated, aer genes of pseudomonas putida kt2440 is investigated. previous work has shown that the three aer proteins, like chemoreceptors, colocalize to a single pole in a chea-dependent manner. lack of aer2 - the most abundant of these three proteins - mediates defects in metabolism-dependent taxis and aerotaxis, while lack of aer1 or aer3 has no apparent phenotype. we show, using wild-type and mutant p. putida derivatives combined with p. putida reconstituted flia- (sigma(28)) and sigma(70)-dependent in vitro transcription assays, that transcription of aer2 is coupled to motility through the flagella sigma-factor flia, while sigma(70) is responsible for transcription of aer1 and aer3. by comparing activities of the wild-type and mutant forms of the aer2 promoter, we present evidence (i) that transcription from flia-dependent paer2 is enhanced by changes towards the escherichia coli consensus for flia promoters rather than towards that of p. putida, (ii) that the nature of the at-rich upstream region is important for both output and sigma(70) discrimination of this promoter, and (iii) that paer2 output is directly stimulated by the bacterial alarmone ppgpp and its cofactor dksa.

TI  == expanding small-molecule functional metagenomics through parallel screening of broad-host-range cosmid environmental dna libraries in diverse proteobacteria.
AB  == the small-molecule biosynthetic diversity encoded within the genomes of uncultured bacteria is an attractive target for the discovery of natural products using functional metagenomics. phenotypes commonly associated with the production of small molecules, such as antibiosis, altered pigmentation, or altered colony morphology, are easily identified from screens of arrayed metagenomic library clones. however, functional metagenomic screening methods are limited by their intrinsic dependence on a heterologous expression host. toward the goal of increasing the small-molecule biosynthetic diversity found in functional metagenomic studies, we report the phenotypic screening of broad-host-range environmental dna libraries in six different proteobacteria: agrobacterium tumefaciens, burkholderia graminis, caulobacter vibrioides, escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, and ralstonia metallidurans. clone-specific small molecules found in culture broth extracts from pigmented and antibacterially active clones, as well as the genetic elements responsible for the biosynthesis of these metabolites, are described. the host strains used in this investigation provided  access to unique sets of clones showing minimal overlap, thus demonstrating the potential advantage conferred on functional metagenomics through the use of multiple diverse host species.

TI  == tnpr encoded by an isppu12 isoform regulates transposition of two different isl3-like insertion sequences in pseudomonas stutzeri after conjugative interaction.
AB  == pseudomonas stutzeri an10 has two isl3-like insertion sequences (iss). one of them has been recently described as ispst9. in this study we show that the second is, situated 4.5 kb upstream of ispst9, is an isoform of isppu12 from pseudomonas putida mt-2. although both isl3-like iss are flanked by nearly identical (21/24 conserved residues) inverted repeats (irs) and harbor similar transposases (93% amino acid identity), they differ in their accompanying genes. as described for ispst9, the isoform of isppu12 also transposes by a conservative mechanism, forms circular double-stranded dna (dsdna) transposition intermediates, and is induced  by interaction with the conjugative strain escherichia coli s17-1lambda(pir) (conjugative interaction) but not with the nonconjugative e. coli dh5alpha. in fact, we demonstrate that ispst9 transposition after conjugative interaction occurs only when isppu12 is present, indicating that isppu12 is upregulating transposition of both iss under such conditions. we also demonstrate that this conjugative interaction-mediated induction of isppu12 is not exclusive to the p.  stutzeri an10 strain but is a more general phenomenon, at least in pseudomonas. mutation of tnpr, a merr-like transcriptional regulator present in isppu12 but not in ispst9, reduced the transcription of tnpa (isppu12 transposase-encoding gene) and decreased formation of circular dsdna transposition intermediates after conjugative interaction. complementation of the tnpr mutant restored the phenotype. in addition, the presence of tnpr in an isppu12-free genetic background did not induce ispst9 after conjugative interaction. thus, our results suggest that tnpr, after conjugative interaction, activates transcription of tnpa of isppu12. then, tnpa of isppu12 would bind to irs of both iss, isppu12 and ispst9, causing their transposition.

TI  == molecular characterization of finr, a novel redox-sensing transcriptional regulator in pseudomonas putida kt2440.
AB  == finr is required for the induction of fpr (ferredoxin-nadp(+) reductase) under superoxide stress conditions in pseudomonas putida. many proteobacteria harbour finr homologues in their genome as a putative lysr-type protein. three cysteine residues (at positions 150, 239 and 289 in p. putida finr) are conserved in all finr homologues. when these conserved cysteines, along with two other cysteine residues present in finr, were individually mutated to serines, the finr remained active, unlike soxr and oxyr in escherichia coli. the results of our in vitro dna-binding assay with cellular extracts showed that finr binds directly to the fpr promoter region. in order to identify the finr functional domain for sensing  superoxide stress, we employed random and site-directed mutagenesis of finr. among 18 single amino acid mutants, three mutants (t39a, r194a and e225a) abolished fpr induction without any alteration of their dna-binding ability, whereas other mutants also abrogated their dna-binding abilities. interestingly,  two mutants (l215p and d51a) appeared to be constitutively active, regardless of  superoxide stress conditions. ferrous iron depletion, ferric iron addition and fdxa (ferredoxin) gene deletion also participate in the regulation of fpr. these  data indicate that finr has unusual residues for redox sensing and that the redox-sensing mechanism of finr differs from the well-known mechanisms of oxyr and soxr.

TI  == substitution of glu122 by glutamine revealed the function of the second water molecule as a proton donor in the binuclear metal enzyme creatininase.
AB  == creatininase is a binuclear zinc enzyme and catalyzes the reversible conversion of creatinine to creatine. it exhibits an open-closed conformational change upon  substrate binding, and the differences in the conformations of tyr121, trp154, and the loop region containing trp174 were evident in the enzyme-creatine complex when compared to those in the ligand-free enzyme. we have determined the crystal  structure of the enzyme complexed with a 1-methylguanidine. all subunits in the complex existed as the closed form, and the binding mode of creatinine was estimated. site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the hydrophobic residues that  show conformational change upon substrate binding are important for the enzyme activity. we propose a catalytic mechanism of creatininase in which two water molecules have significant roles. the first molecule is a hydroxide ion (wat1) that is bound as a bridge between the two metal ions and attacks the carbonyl carbon of the substrate. the second molecule is a water molecule (wat2) that is bound to the carboxyl group of glu122 and functions as a proton donor in catalysis. the activity of the e122q mutant was very low and it was only partially restored by the addition of zncl(2) or mncl(2). in the e122q mutant, k(cat) is drastically decreased, indicating that glu122 is important for catalysis. x-ray crystallographic study and the atomic absorption spectrometry analysis of the e122q mutant-substrate complex revealed that the drastic decrease of the activity of the e122q was caused by not only the loss of one zn ion at the metal1 site but also a critical function of glu122, which most likely exists for  a proton transfer step through wat2.

AB  == a biphenyl (bp)-utilizing bacterium, designated b6-2, was isolated from soil and  identified as pseudomonas putida. bp-grown b6-2 cells were capable of transforming dibenzofuran (dbf) via a lateral dioxygenation and meta-cleavage pathway. the ring cleavage product 2-hydroxy-4-(3'-oxo-3'h-benzofuran-2'-yliden)but-2-enoic acid (hobb) was detected as a major metabolite. b6-2 growing cells could also cometabolically degrade dbf  using bp as a primary substrate. a recombinant escherichia coli strain dh10b (puc118bphabc) expressing bp dioxygenase, bp-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, and dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase was shown to be capable of transforming dbf to hobb. using purified hobb that was produced by the recombinant as the substrate for b6-2, we newly identified a series of benzofuran derivatives as metabolites.  the structures of these metabolites indicate that an unreported hobb degradation  pathway is employed by strain b6-2. in this pathway, hobb is proposed to be transformed to 2-oxo-4-(3'-oxobenzofuran-2'-yl)butanoic acid and 2-hydroxy-4-(3'-oxobenzofuran-2'-yl)butanoic acid (d4) through two sequential double-bond hydrogenation steps. d4 is suggested to undergo reactions including decarboxylation and oxidation to produce 3-(3'-oxobenzofuran-2'-yl)propanoic acid (d6). 3-hydroxy-3-(3'-oxobenzofuran-2'-yl)propanoic acid (d7) and 2-(3'-oxobenzofuran-2'-yl)acetic acid (d8) would represent metabolites involved in the processes of beta- and alpha-oxidation of d6, respectively. d7 and d8 are  suggested to be transformed to their respective products 3-hydroxy-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-2-carboxylic acid (d10) and 2-(3'-hydroxy-2',3'-dihydrobenzofuran-2'-yl)acetic acid. d10 is proposed to be transformed to salicylic acid (d14) via 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzofuran, 2-oxo-2-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)acetic acid and 2-hydroxy-2-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)acetic acid. further experimental results revealed that b6-2 was capable of growing with d14 as the sole carbon source. because benzofuran derivatives may have biological, pharmacological, and toxic properties, the elucidation of this new pathway should be significant from both biotechnological and environmental views.

TI  == bacterial ammeline metabolism via guanine deaminase.
AB  == melamine toxicity in mammals has been attributed to the blockage of kidney tubules by insoluble complexes of melamine with cyanuric acid or uric acid. bacteria metabolize melamine via three consecutive deamination reactions to generate cyanuric acid. the second deamination reaction, in which ammeline is the substrate, is common to many bacteria, but the genes and enzymes responsible have not been previously identified. here, we combined bioinformatics and experimental data to identify guanine deaminase as the enzyme responsible for this biotransformation. the ammeline degradation phenotype was demonstrated in wild-type escherichia coli and pseudomonas strains, including e. coli k12 and pseudomonas putida kt2440. bioinformatics analysis of these and other genomes led to the hypothesis that the ammeline deaminating enzyme was guanine deaminase. an  e. coli guanine deaminase deletion mutant was deficient in ammeline deaminase activity, supporting the role of guanine deaminase in this reaction. two guanine  deaminases from disparate sources (bradyrhizobium japonicum usda 110 and homo sapiens) that had available x-ray structures were purified to homogeneity and shown to catalyze ammeline deamination at rates sufficient to support bacterial growth on ammeline as a sole nitrogen source. in silico models of guanine deaminase active sites showed that ammeline could bind to guanine deaminase in a  similar orientation to guanine, with a favorable docking score. other members of  the amidohydrolase superfamily that are not guanine deaminases were assayed in vitro, and none had substantial ammeline deaminase activity. the present study indicated that widespread guanine deaminases have a promiscuous activity allowing them to catalyze a key reaction in the bacterial transformation of melamine to cyanuric acid and potentially contribute to the toxicity of melamine.

AB  == in order to construct high accumulating-phosphate microorganism, the ppk gene from e. coli was inserted to the broad-host-range plasmid pbbr1mcs-2 to form plasmid pbbr1mcs-2-ppk. the complete ppk gene with promoter and terminator sequences from pbbr1mcs-2-ppk was then cloned and inserted to suicide plasmid putmini-tn5 to form plasmid putmini-tn5-ppk, which was transformed into pseudomonas putida kt2440 by triparental conjugation. finally, ppk gene was integrated into the chromosomal dna of kt2440. the results of rt-pcr showed that  the selected genetically engineered bacterium kt2440-ppk expressed ppk efficiently, while kt2440 as control expressed weakly. the results of artificial  wastewater treatment showed after 1h inoculation, the concentration of poly-phosphate in kt2440-ppk came to the maximum approximately 3.05 mg/g, which was 15 times higher than that in kt2440 at the same experimental condition. and kt2440-ppk can remove more than 90% phosphate in artificial wastewater.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of silver-impregnated cellulose: potential for antimicrobial therapy.
AB  == background: silver has long been known to have antimicrobial activity. to incorporate this property into multiple applications, a silver-impregnated cellulose (sic) with low cytotoxicity to human cells was developed. sic differs from other silver treatment methods in that the leaching of silver particles is non-existent and the release of ionic silver is highly controlled. results: candida albicans, micrococcus luteu, pseudomonas putida, and escherichia coli were used for antimicrobial testing. no microbial cells were able to grow in the  presence of sic at concentrations above 0.0035 ag w/v %. even at a concentration  of 0.00035 ag w/v %, p. putida and m. luteu failed to grow, and c. albicans and e. coli exhibited diminished growth. to determine the cytotoxic effect of silver  on human cells, five different concentrations of sic were tested on human fibroblasts. in sic concentrations of 0.035 ag w/v % and below, no cytotoxicity was observed. conclusion: the optimal concentration of sic for a broad range of anti-microbial activity and low or negligible cytotoxicity was 0.0035 ag w/v %. although the highly controlled releasing characteristics of sic would prove a substantial improvement over current technologies, further investigation for genotoxicity and other biocompatibility test will be required.

TI  == identification and characterization of the metal ion-dependent l-alanoyl-d-glutamate peptidase encoded by bacteriophage t5.
AB  == although bacteriophage t5 is known to have lytic proteins for cell wall hydrolysis and phage progeny escape, their activities are still unknown. this is  the first report on the cloning, expression and biochemical characterization of a bacteriophage t5 lytic hydrolase. the endolysin-encoding lys gene of virulent coliphage t5 was cloned in escherichia coli cells, and an electrophoretically homogeneous product of this gene was obtained with a high yield (78% of total activity). the protein purified was shown to be an l-alanoyl-d-glutamate peptidase. the enzyme demonstrated maximal activity in diluted buffers (25-50 mm) at ph 8.5. the enzyme was strongly inhibited by edta and bapta, and fully reactivated by calcium/manganese chlorides. it was found that, along with e. coli peptidoglycan, peptidase of bacteriophage t5 can lyse peptidoglycans of other gram-negative microorganisms (pectobacterium carotovorum, pseudomonas putida, proteus vulgaris, and proteus mirabilis). this endolysin is the first example of  an l-alanoyl-d-glutamate peptidase in a virulent phage infecting gram-negative bacteria. there are, however, a great many sequences in databases that are highly similar to that of bacteriophage t5 hydrolase, indicating a wide distribution of  endolytic l-alanoyl-d-glutamate peptidases. the article discusses how an enzyme with such substrate specificity could be fixed in the process of evolution.

TI  == integrated bioprocessing for the ph-dependent production of 4-valerolactone from  levulinate in pseudomonas putida kt2440.
AB  == enzymes are powerful biocatalysts capable of performing specific chemical transformations under mild conditions, yet as catalysts they remain subject to the laws of thermodynamics, namely, that they cannot catalyze chemical reactions  beyond equilibrium. here we report the phenomenon and application of using extracytosolic enzymes and medium conditions, such as ph, to catalyze metabolic pathways beyond their intracellular catalytic limitations. this methodology, termed "integrated bioprocessing" because it integrates intracellular and extracytosolic catalysis, was applied to a lactonization reaction in pseudomonas  putida for the economical and high-titer biosynthesis of 4-valerolactone from the inexpensive and renewable source levulinic acid. mutant paraoxonase i (pon1) was  expressed in p. putida, shown to export from the cytosol in escherichia coli and  p. putida using an n-terminal sequence, and demonstrated to catalyze the extracytosolic and ph-dependent lactonization of 4-hydroxyvalerate to 4-valerolactone. with this production system, the titer of 4-valerolactone was enhanced substantially in acidic medium using extracytosolically expressed lactonase versus an intracellular lactonase: from <0.2 g liter(-1) to 2.1 +/- 0.4 g liter(-1) at the shake flask scale. based on these results, the production of 4-hydroxyvalerate and 4-valerolactone was examined in a 2-liter bioreactor, and titers of 27.1 g liter(-1) and 8.2 g liter(-1) for the two respective compounds were achieved. these results illustrate the utility of integrated bioprocessing as a strategy for enabling production from novel metabolic pathways and enhancing product titers.

TI  == micro-scale water potential gradients visualized in soil around plant root tips using microbiosensors.
AB  == water availability and movement in soil are critical determinants of resource availability to, and interactions among, members of the soil community. however,  it has been impossible to observe gradients in soil water potential empirically at millimetre spatial scales. here we describe progress towards that goal using output from two microbial biosensors, pantoea agglomerans brt98/ppprogreen and pseudomonas putida kt2442/ppprogreen, engineered with a reporter system based on  the osmotically sensitive prou promoter from escherichia coli. the prou-gfp construct in both microbiosensors produced green fluorescent protein (gfp) as a function total water potential in nonsterile soil. controlled experiments in liquid culture showed that dramatically different microbiosensor growth rates (resulting from exposure to different salts as osmolytes) did not alter the gfp output as a function of water potential in either sensor, but p. agglomerans' gfp levels at a given water potential were strongly influenced by the type of carbon  (energy) source available to the microbes. in non-sterile rhizosphere soil along  zea mays l. roots, though gfp expression was quite variable, microbiosensors reported statistically significantly more negative soil water potentials as a function of axial distance from root tips, reflecting the gradient in soil water  potential hypothesized to develop during transpiration.

TI  == phosphoproteomic analysis reveals the multiple roles of phosphorylation in pathogenic bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == recent phosphoproteomic characterizations of bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis, pseudomonas putida, and pseudomonas aeruginosa have suggested that protein phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues is a major regulatory post-translational modification in bacteria. in this study, we carried out a global and site-specific phosphoproteomic analysis on the gram-positive pathogenic bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae. one hundred and two  unique phosphopeptides and 163 phosphorylation sites with distributions of 47%/44%/9% for ser/thr/tyr phosphorylations from 84 s. pneumoniae proteins were identified through the combined use of tio(2) enrichment and lc-ms/ms determination. the identified phosphoproteins were found to be involved in various biological processes including carbon/protein/nucleotide metabolisms, cell cycle and division regulation. a striking characteristic of s. pneumoniae phosphoproteome is the large number of multiple species-specific phosphorylated sites, indicating that high level of protein phosphorylation may play important roles in regulating many metabolic pathways and bacterial virulence.

TI  == carbon nanotube clusters as universal bacterial adsorbents and magnetic separation agents.
AB  == the magnetic susceptibility and high bacterial affinity of carbon nanotube (cnt)  clusters highlight their great potential as a magnetic bio-separation agent. this article reports the cnt clusters' capability as "universal" bacterial adsorbents  and magnetic separation agents by designing and testing a multiwalled carbon nanotube (mwnt) cluster-based process for bacterial capturing and separation. the reaction system consisted of large clusters of mwnts for bacterial capture and an external magnet for bio-separation. the designed system was tested and optimized  using escherichia coli as a model bacterium, and further generalized by testing the process with other representative strains of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. for all strains tested, bacterial adsorption to mwnt clusters occurred spontaneously, and the estimated mwnt clusters' adsorption capacities were nearly the same regardless of the types of strains. the bacteria-bound mwnt clusters also responded almost instantaneously to the magnetic field by a rare-earth magnet (0.68 tesla), and completely separated from the bulk aqueous phase and retained in the system. the results clearly demonstrate their excellent potential as highly effective "universal" bacterial adsorbents for the spontaneous adsorption of any types of bacteria to the clusters and as paramagnetic complexes for the rapid and highly effective magnetic separations.

AB  == industrial wastewater from the production of sulfur containing esters and the resulting products of this synthesis, 2-ethylhexylthioglycolic acid (ehtg) and iso-octylthioglycolic acid (iotg), were deployed in this study to enrich novel bacterial strains, since no wastewater and ehtg or iotg degrading microorganisms  were hitherto described or available. in addition, nothing is known about the biodegradation of these thiochemicals. the effect of this specific wastewater on  the growth behaviour of microorganisms was investigated using three well-known gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, and ralstonia eutropha). concentrations of 5% (v/v) wastewater in complex media completely inhibited growth of these three bacterial strains. six bacterial strains were successfully isolated, characterized and identified by sequencing their 16s rrna  genes. two isolates referred to as achromobacter sp. strain mt-e3 and pseudomonas sp. strain mt-i1 used ehtg or iotg, respectively, as well as the wastewater as sole source of carbon and energy for weak growth. more notably, both isolates removed these sulfur containing esters in remarkable amounts from the cultures supernatant. one further isolate was referred to as klebsiella sp. strain 58 and  exhibited an unusual high tolerance against the wastewater's toxicity without utilizing the contaminative compounds. if cultivated with gluconic acid as additional carbon source, the strain grew even in presence of more than 40% (v/v) wastewater. three other isolates belonging to the genera bordetella and pseudomonas tolerated these organic sulfur compounds but showed no degradation abilities.

TI  == the escherichia coli rhamnose promoter rhap(bad) is in pseudomonas putida kt2440  independent of crp-camp activation.
AB  == we developed an expression vector system based on the broad host range plasmid pbbr1mcs2 with the escherichia coli rhamnose-inducible expression system for applications in pseudomonas. for validation and comparison to e. coli, enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) was used as a reporter. for further characterization, we also constructed plasmids containing different modifications of the rhap(bad) promoter. induction experiments after the successful transfer of these plasmids into pseudomonas putida kt2440 wild-type and different knockout strains revealed significant differences. in pseudomonas, we observed no catabolite repression of the rhap(bad) promoter, and in contrast to e. coli, the  binding of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp) receptor protein (crp)-camp to this promoter is not necessary for induction as shown by deletion of the crp binding site. the crp(-) mutant of p. putida kt2440 lacked egfp expression, but this is likely due to problems in rhamnose uptake, since this defect was complemented by the insertion of the l-rhamnose-specific transporter rhat into its genome via transposon mutagenesis. other global regulators like crc, ptsn, and cyob had no or minor effects on rhamnose-induced egfp expression. therefore,  this expression system may also be generally useful for pseudomonas and other gamma-proteobacteria.

TI  == metabolomics data exploration guided by prior knowledge.
AB  == in metabolomics research, it is often important to focus the data analysis to specific areas of interest within the metabolome. in this paper, we describe the  application of consensus principal component analysis (cpca) and canonical correlation analysis (cca) as a means to explore the relation between metabolome  data and (i) biochemically related metabolites and (ii) an amino acid biosynthesis pathway. cpca searches for major trends in the behavior of metabolite concentrations that are in common for the metabolites of interest and  the remainder of the metabolome. cca identifies the strongest correlations between the metabolites of interest and the remainder of the metabolome. cpca and cca were applied to two different microbial metabolomics data sets. the first data set, derived from pseudomonas putida s12, was relatively simple as it contained metabolomes obtained under four environmental conditions only. the second data set, obtained from escherichia coli, was much more complex as it consisted of metabolomes obtained under 28 different environmental conditions. in case of the simple and coherent p. putida s12 data set, cca and cpca gave similar results as the variation in the subset of the selected metabolites and the remainder of the metabolome was similar. in contrast, cca and cpca yielded different results in case of the e. coli data set. with cpca the trends in the selected subset--the phenylalanine biosynthesis pathway--dominated the results. the main trends were related to high and low phenylalanine productivity, and the  metabolites showing a similar behavior in concentration were metabolites regulating the phenylalanine biosynthesis route in the subset and metabolites related to general amino acid metabolism in the remainder of the metabolome. with cca, neither subset truly dominated the data analysis. cca described the differences between the wild type and the overproducing strain and the differences between the succinate and glucose grown cells. for the difference between the wild type and the overproducing strain, metabolites from the beginning and the end of aromatic amino acid pathways like erythrose-4-phosphate, tryptophan, and phenylalanine were important for the selected metabolites. cca and cpca proved to be complementary data analysis tools that enable the focusing  of the data analysis on groups of metabolites that are of specific interest in relation to the remainder of the metabolome. compared to an ordinary pca, focusing the data analysis on biologically relevant metabolites lead especially for the complex e. coli data to a better biological interpretation of the data.

AB  == cytochrome p450 (cyp) enzymes of the cyp101 and cyp111 families from novosphingobium aromaticivorans are heme monooxygenases that catalyze the hydroxylation of a range of terpenoid compounds. cyp101d1 and cyp101d2 oxidized camphor to 5-exo-hydroxycamphor. cyp101b1 and cyp101c1 oxidized beta-ionone to predominantly 3-r-hydroxy-beta-ionone and 4-hydroxy-beta-ionone, respectively. cyp111a2 oxidized linalool to 8-hydroxylinalool. physiologically, these cyp enzymes could receive electrons from arx, a [2fe-2s] ferredoxin equivalent to putidaredoxin from the cyp101a1 system from pseudomonas putida. a putative ferredoxin reductase (arr) in the n. aromaticivorans genome, with high amino acid sequence homology to putidaredoxin reductase, has been over-produced in escherichia coli and found to support substrate oxidation by these cyp enzymes via arx with both high activity and coupling of product formation to nadh consumption. the arr/arx electron-transport chain has been co-expressed with the  cyp enzymes in an e. coli host to provide in vivo whole-cell substrate oxidation  systems that could produce up to 6.0 g l(-1) of 5-exo-hydroxycamphor at rates of  up to 64 microm (gram of cell dry weight)(-1) min(-1). these efficient biocatalytic systems have potential uses in preparative scale whole-cell biotransformations.

AB  == the pseudomonas sp. strain adp atzdef operon encodes the enzymes involved in cyanuric acid mineralization, the final stage of the s-triazine herbicide atrazine degradative pathway. we have previously shown that atzdef is under nitrogen control in both its natural host and pseudomonas putida kt2442. expression of atzdef requires the divergently encoded lysr-type transcriptional regulator atzr. here, we take advantage of the poor induction of atzdef in escherichia coli to identify pseudomonas factors involved in nitrogen control of  atzdef expression. simultaneous production of p. putida ntrc and glnk, along with atzr, restored the normal atzdef regulatory pattern. gene expression analysis in  e. coli and p. putida indicated that ntrc activates atzr expression, while the role of glnk is to promote atzr activation of atzdef under nitrogen limitation. activation of atzdef in a mutant background deficient in glnk uridylylation suggests that post-translational modification is not strictly required for transduction of the nitrogen limitation signal to atzr. the present data and our  previous results are integrated in a regulatory circuit that describes all the known responses of the atzdef operon.

TI  == transverse bacterial migration induced by chemotaxis in a packed column with structured physical heterogeneity.
AB  == the significance of chemotaxis in directing bacterial migration toward contaminants in natural porous media was investigated under groundwater flow conditions. a laboratory-scale column, with a coarse-grained sand core surrounded by a fine-grained annulus, was used to simulate natural aquifers with strata of different hydraulic conductivities. a chemoattractant source was placed along the central axis of the column to model contaminants trapped in the heterogeneous subsurface. chemotactic bacterial strains, escherichia coli hcb1 and pseudomonas  putida f1, introduced into the column by a pulse injection, were found to alter their transport behaviors under the influence of the attractant chemical emanating from the central source. for e. coil hcb1, approximately 18% more of the total population relative to the control without attractant exited the column from the coarse sand layer due to the chemotactic effects of alpha-methylaspartate under an average fluid velocity of 5.1 m/d. although p. putida f1 demonstrated no observable changes in migration pathways with the model contaminant acetate under the same flow rate, when the flow rate was reduced to 1.9 m/d, approximately 6-10% of the population relative to the control migrated from the fine sand layer toward attractant into the coarse sand layer. microbial  transport properties were further quantified by a mathematical model to examine the significance of bacterial motility and chemotaxis under different hydrodynamic conditions, which suggested important considerations for strain selection and practical operation of bioremediation schemes.

AB  == we report here the identification and characterization of mrdh, a novel chromosomal metal resistance determinant, located in the genomic island 55 of pseudomonas putida kt2440. it encodes for mrdh, a predicted protein of approximately 40 kda with a chimeric domain organization derived from the rcna and rnd (for resistance-nodulation-cell division) metal efflux proteins. the metal resistance function of mrdh was identified by the ability to confer nickel  resistance upon its complementation into rcna mutant (a nickel- and cobalt-sensitive mutant) of escherichia coli. however, the disruption of mrdh in  p. putida resulted in an increased sensitivity to cadmium and zinc apart from nickel. expression studies using quantitative reverse transcription-pcr showed the induction of mrdh by cadmium, nickel, zinc, and cobalt. in association with mrdh, we also identified a conserved hypothetical gene mrea whose encoded protein showed significant homology to nrea and nrea-like proteins. expression of the mrea gene in rcna mutant of e. coli enhanced its cadmium and nickel resistance. transcriptional studies showed that both mrdh and mrea underwent parallel changes in gene expression. the mobile genetic elements tn4652 and is1246, flanking mrdh  and mrea were found to be induced by cadmium, nickel, and zinc, but not by cobalt. this study is the first report of a single-component metal efflux transporter, mrdh, showing chimeric domain organization, a broad substrate spectrum, and a location amid metal-inducible mobile genetic elements.

TI  == ntrc-dependent regulatory network for nitrogen assimilation in pseudomonas putida.
AB  == pseudomonas putida kt2440 is a model strain for studying bacterial biodegradation processes. however, very little is known about nitrogen regulation in this strain. here, we show that the nitrogen regulatory ntrc proteins from p. putida and escherichia coli are functionally equivalent and that substitutions leading to partially active forms of enterobacterial ntrc provoke the same phenotypes in  p. putida ntrc. p. putida has only a single p(ii)-like protein, encoded by glnk,  whose expression is nitrogen regulated. two contiguous ntrc binding sites located upstream of the sigma(n)-dependent glnk promoter have been identified by footprinting analysis. in vitro experiments with purified proteins demonstrated that glnk transcription was directly activated by ntrc and that open complex formation at this promoter required integration host factor. transcription of genes orthologous to enterobacterial codb, dppa, and ured genes, whose transcription is dependent on sigma(70) and which are activated by nac in e. coli, has also been analyzed for p. putida. whereas dppa does not appear to be regulated by nitrogen via ntrc, the codb and ured genes have sigma(n)-dependent promoters and their nitrogen regulation was exerted directly by ntrc, thus avoiding the need for nac, which is missing in this bacterial species. based upon these results, we propose a simplified nitrogen regulatory network in p. putida (compared to that in enterobacteria), which involves an indirect-feedback autoregulation of glnk using ntrc as an intermediary.

TI  == variations in mic value caused by differences in experimental protocol.
AB  == the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of an antibiotic for a microorganism quantifies the effectiveness in reducing growth or the bactericidal ability of the compound. measurements of mic's carried out using different protocols should  be comparable. several of the factors that influence the outcome of the measurement vary between protocols. variations in the mic estimate were examined  for e. coli and amoxicillin as well as tetracycline and for pseudomonas putida and enrofloxacin. duration of the measurement, density of the starting culture, the use of optical density or cell counts to determine growth and the induction of resistance can cause differences of a factor of up to 8 in the mic value. while this does not hamper the reporting of trends by researchers adhering to the same protocol, it may affect assessments based on the absolute value of the mic of a given combination of microorganism and antibiotic.

TI  == effect of cell-surface hydrophobicity on bacterial conversion of water-immiscible chemicals in two-liquid-phase culture systems.
AB  == the effect of bacterial cell-surface hydrophobicity on the bioconversion of water-immiscible chemicals in an aqueous-organic (a/o) two-liquid-phase culture system was investigated. escherichia coli jm109 and rhodococcus opacus b-4 were used as hydrophilic and hydrophobic whole-cell catalysts, respectively. hydroxylation reactions of monoaromatics, including toluene (log p(ow)=2.9), ethylbenzene (3.1), n-propylbenzene (3.4), and sec-butylbenzene (3.7), were employed as model conversions. when the todc1c2ba genes encoding pseudomonas putida toluene dioxygenase were expressed in e. coli jm109, the yield of hydroxylated monoaromatics decreased with increasing substrate hydrophobicity. by contrast, r. opacus transformants, which expressed the todc1c2ba genes, showed high performance in the hydroxylation of monoaromatics, irrespective of substrate hydrophobicity. when the r. opacus transformants were examined for their ability  to hydroxylate monoaromatics in an aqueous single-liquid-phase culture, the reaction velocity was markedly lower than that observed in the a/o two-liquid-phase culture. these results suggested that r. opacus b-4 accessed the hydrophobic substrates in the oil phase, thus making it more effective for the bioconversion reactions.

TI  == regioselective biooxidation of (+)-valencene by recombinant e. coli expressing cyp109b1 from bacillus subtilis in a two-liquid-phase system.
AB  == background: (+)-nootkatone (4) is a high added-value compound found in grapefruit juice. allylic oxidation of the sesquiterpene (+)-valencene (1) provides an attractive route to this sought-after flavoring. so far, chemical methods to produce (+)-nootkatone (4) from (+)-valencene (1) involve unsafe toxic compounds, whereas several biotechnological approaches applied yield large amounts of undesirable byproducts. in the present work 125 cytochrome p450 enzymes from bacteria were tested for regioselective oxidation of (+)-valencene (1) at allylic c2-position to produce (+)-nootkatone (4) via cis- (2) or trans-nootkatol (3). the p450 activity was supported by the co-expression of putidaredoxin reductase (pdr) and putidaredoxin (pdx) from pseudomonas putida in escherichia coli. results: addressing the whole-cell system, the cytochrome cyp109b1 from bacillus  subtilis was found to catalyze the oxidation of (+)-valencene (1) yielding nootkatol (2 and 3) and (+)-nootkatone (4). however, when the in vivo biooxidation of (+)-valencene (1) with cyp109b1 was carried out in an aqueous milieu, a number of undesired multi-oxygenated products has also been observed accounting for approximately 35% of the total product. the formation of these byproducts was significantly reduced when aqueous-organic two-liquid-phase systems with four water immiscible organic solvents - isooctane, n-octane, dodecane or hexadecane - were set up, resulting in accumulation of nootkatol (2 and 3) and (+)-nootkatone (4) of up to 97% of the total product. the best productivity of 120 mg l-1 of desired products was achieved within 8 h in the system comprising 10% dodecane. conclusion: this study demonstrates that the identification of new p450s capable of producing valuable compounds can basically be achieved by screening of recombinant p450 libraries. the biphasic reaction system described in this work presents an attractive way for the production of (+)-nootkatone (4), as it is safe and can easily be controlled and scaled up.

TI  == metagenomics reveals diversity and abundance of meta-cleavage pathways in microbial communities from soil highly contaminated with jet fuel under air-sparging bioremediation.
AB  == the extradiol dioxygenase diversity of a site highly contaminated with aliphatic  and aromatic hydrocarbons under air-sparging treatment was assessed by functional screening of a fosmid library in escherichia coli with catechol as substrate. the 235 positive clones from inserts of dna extracted from contaminated soil were equivalent to one extradiol dioxygenase-encoding gene per 3.6 mb of dna screened, indicating a strong selection for genes encoding this function. three subfamilies were identified as being predominant, with 72, 55 and 43 fosmid inserts carrying  genes, related to those encoding tbue of ralstonia pickettii pk01 (exdo-d), ipbc  of pseudomonas sp. jr1 (exdo-k2) or dbtc of burkholderia sp. dbt1 (exdo-dbt), respectively, whereas genes encoding enzymes related to xyle of pseudomonas putida mt-2 were not observed. genes encoding oxygenases related to isopropylbenzene dioxygenases were usually colocalized with genes encoding exdo-k2 dioxygenases. functional analysis of representative proteins indicated a  subcluster of exdo-d proteins to show exceptional high affinity towards different catecholic substrates. based on v(max)/k(m) specificity constants, a task-sharing between different extradiol dioxygenases in the community of the contaminated site can be supposed, attaining a complementary and community-balanced catalytic  power against diverse catecholic derivatives, as necessary for effective degradation of mixtures of aromatics.

TI  == in vitro evolution of styrene monooxygenase from pseudomonas putida ca-3 for improved epoxide synthesis.
AB  == the styab genes from pseudomonas putida ca-3, which encode styrene monooxygenase, were subjected to three rounds of in vitro evolution using error-prone polymerase chain reaction with a view to improving the rate of styrene oxide and indene oxide formation. improvements in styrene monooxygenase activity were monitored using an indole to indigo conversion assay. each round of random mutagenesis generated variants improved in indigo formation with third round variants improved nine- to 12-fold over the wild type enzyme. each round of in vitro evolution resulted in two to three amino acid substitutions in styrene monooxygenase. while the majority of mutations occurred in stya (oxygenase), mutations were also observed in styb (reductase). a mutation resulting in the substitution of valine with isoleucine at amino acid residue 303 occurred near the styrene and flavin adenine dinucleotide binding site of styrene monooxygenase. one mutation caused a shift in the reading frame in stya and resulted in a stya variant that is 19 amino acids longer than the wild-type protein. whole cells expressing the best styrene monooxygenase variants (round 3) exhibited eight- and 12-fold improvements in styrene and indene oxidation rates compared to the wild-type enzyme. in all cases, a single enantiomer, (s)-styrene  oxide, was formed from styrene while (1s,2r)-indene oxide was the predominant enantiomer (e.e. 97%) formed from indene. the average yield of styrene oxide and  indene oxide from their respective alkene substrates was 65% and 90%, respectively.

TI  == discovery of 2-naphthoic acid monooxygenases by genome mining and their use as biocatalysts.
AB  == the large pool of cytochrome p450 (p450) open-reading frames identified in genome sequences has attracted much attention as a resource for new oxidation biocatalysts. p450 genes were cloned from genome-sequenced bacteria and coexpressed with putidaredoxin and its reductase genes to provide the redox partners of p450 in escherichia coli. whole-cell assays were performed with 2-naphthoic acid as a substrate. hydroxylated naphthoic acid products were rapidly detected with two reagents showing different colors in the presence of the products. two p450s, cyp199a1 and cyp199a2, were found to hydroxylate the substrate to 7- and 8-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acids. the cyp199a1 whole-cell biocatalyst converted 1 mm 2-naphthoic acid to 0.27 mm 7-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid and 0.53 mm 8-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid. cyp199a2 exhibited similar regioselectivity to cyp199a1. furthermore, we found that 8-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid emits near-white fluorescence when exposed to uv light. these p450s will provide a facile and environmentally friendly synthetic approach to the hydroxynaphthoic acids.

TI  == competition triggers plasmid-mediated enhancement of substrate utilisation in pseudomonas putida.
AB  == competition between species plays a central role in the activity and structure of communities. stable co-existence of diverse organisms in communities is thought to be fostered by individual tradeoffs and optimization of competitive strategies along resource gradients. outside the laboratory, microbes exist as multispecies  consortia, continuously interacting with one another and the environment. survival and proliferation of a particular species is governed by its competitive fitness. therefore, bacteria must be able to continuously sense their immediate environs for presence of competitors and prevailing conditions. here we present results of our investigations on a novel competition sensing mechanism in the rhizosphere-inhabiting pseudomonas putida kt2440, harbouring gfpmut3b-modified kan(r) tol plasmid. we monitored benzyl alcohol (ba) degradation rate, along with gfp expression profiling in mono species and dual species cultures. interestingly, enhanced plasmid expression (monitored using gfp expression) and consequent ba degradation were observed in dual species consortia, irrespective of whether the competitor was a ba degrader (pseudomonas aeruginosa) or a non-degrader (e. coli). attempts at elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of induction indicated the role of physical interaction, but not of any diffusible compounds emanating from the competitors. this contention is supported by the observation that greater induction took place in presence of increasing number of competitors. inert microspheres mimicking competitor cell size and concentration  did not elicit any significant induction, further suggesting the role of physical cell-cell interaction. furthermore, it was also established that cell wall compromised competitor had minimal induction capability. we conclude that p. putida harbouring pww0 experience a competitive stress when grown as dual-species consortium, irrespective of the counterpart being ba degrader or not. the immediate effect of this stress is a marked increase in expression of tol, leading to rapid utilization of the available carbon source and massive increase  in its population density. the plausible mechanisms behind the phenomenon are hypothesised and practical implications are indicated and discussed.

AB  == purpose: to determine the ability of the limulus amoebocyte lysate (lal) assay and the in vitro pyrogen test (ipt) to detect pyrogens adsorbed to intraocular lenses (iols). setting: berlin eye research institute, berlin, germany. methods:  fifteen of each of the following iols were used: microsil ms 612 asp, acrysof sa60at, superflex, sensar, xact, and ls-106 iols. the challenge organism suspensions were 10(3) cfu/ml and 10(4) cfu/ml escherichia coli, 10(3) cfu/ml and 10(4) cfu/ml pseudomonas putida, and 10(5) cfu/ml and 10(6) cfu/ml staphylococcus epidermidis. two iols of each model were incubated at room temperature for at least 2 days in 0.6 ml of 1 of the suspensions. they were then gamma sterilized.  the extract of 1 iol was tested with the lal assay; the other iol was tested with the ipt. results: the lal was negative for all incubated iols. the ipt was positive for all iols incubated in e coli and p putida suspensions, with the microsil ms 612 asp, acrysof sa60at, xact, and ls-106 iols showing a severe reaction. the superflex and sensar iols had a slight to moderate response for lower bacterial concentrations and a moderate to severe response for higher concentrations. for s epidermidis, all iols showed a slight ipt response except xact iols, which showed a nonpyrogenic response. conclusions: results indicate that the lal test may fail to detect pyrogens adsorbed to iols and the ipt reliably detects pyrogens with a dose-dependent response. this has relevance in the investigation of toxic anterior segment syndrome outbreaks.

AB  == the facultatively phototrophic purple bacterium rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 harbors a lov (light, oxygen and voltage) domain protein, which shows a particular structure. lov domains perceive blue light by a noncovalently bound flavin and transmit the signal to various coupled output domains. proteins, that  harbor a lov core, function e.g. as phototropins or circadian clock regulators. jalpha helices, which act as linker between the lov core and the output domain, were shown to be involved in the light-dependent activation of the output domain. like ppsb2 from pseudomonas putida, the lov domain protein of r. sphaeroides is not coupled to an effector domain and harbors an extended c-terminal alpha helix. we expressed the r. sphaeroides lov domain recombinantly in escherichia coli. the protein binds an fmn as a cofactor and shows a photocycle typical for lov domain  containing proteins. in r. sphaeroides, we detected the protein as well in the cytoplasm as in the membrane fraction, which was not reported for other bacterial lov domain proteins.

TI  == siccanin rediscovered as a species-selective succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor.
AB  == to identify antibiotics targeting to respiratory enzymes, we carried out matrix screening of a structurally varied natural compound library with pseudomonas aeruginosa membrane-bound respiratory enzymes. we identified a succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor, siccanin (ic(50), 0.9 microm), which is a potent antibiotic against some pathogenic fungi like trichophyton mentagrophytes and inhibits their mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase. we found that siccanin was  effective against enzymes from p. aeruginosa, p. putida, rat and mouse mitochondria but ineffective or less effective against escherichia coli, corynebacterium glutamicum, and porcine mitochondria enzyme. action mode was mixed-type for quinone-dependent activity and noncompetitive for succinate-dependent activity, indicating the proximity of the inhibitor-binding site to the quinone-binding site. species-selective inhibition by siccanin is unique among succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors, and thus siccanin is a potential lead compound for new chemotherapeutics.

TI  == inactivation of the pseudomonas putida kt2440 dsba gene promotes extracellular matrix production and biofilm formation.
AB  == to identify genes essential to biofilm formation in pseudomonas putida kt2440, 12 mutants defective in oxidative stress-related or metabolic pathway-related genes  were evaluated. of them, only the dsba mutant lacking the disulfide bond isomerase exhibited significantly increased attachment to the polystyrene surface. visual evaluation by extracellular matrix staining and scanning electron microscopy indicated that the kt2440-deltadsba strain displays enhanced extracellular matrix production, rugose colony morphology on agar plates and floating pellicles in static culture. accordingly, we propose that deletion of the dsba gene may stimulate production of the extracellular matrix, resulting in  those phenotypes. in addition, the lack of detectable fluorescence in the kt2440-deltadsba under uv light as well as in both the wild type and the kt2440-deltadsba when grown on luria-bertani plates containing ferrous iron suggests that the fluorescent molecule may be a fluorescent siderophore with its  synthesis/secretion controlled by dsba in kt2440. these phenotypic defects observed in the dsba mutant were complemented by the full-length kt2440 and escherichia coli dsba genes. in contrast to the role of dsba in other bacteria, our results provide the first evidence that disruption of p. putida kt2440 dsba gene overproduces the extracellular matrix and thus promotes biofilm formation.

AB  == alternative microbial hosts have been engineered as biocatalysts for butanol biosynthesis. the butanol synthetic pathway of clostridium acetobutylicum was first re-constructed in escherichia coli to establish a baseline for comparison to other hosts. whereas polycistronic expression of the pathway genes resulted in the production of 34 mg/l butanol, individual expression of pathway genes elevated titers to 200 mg/l. improved titers were achieved by co-expression of saccharomyces cerevisiae formate dehydrogenase while overexpression of e. coli glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase to elevate glycolytic flux improved titers to 580 mg/l. pseudomonas putida and bacillus subtilis were also explored as alternative production hosts. polycistronic expression of butanol biosynthetic genes yielded butanol titers of 120 and 24 mg/l from p. putida and b. subtilis, respectively. production in the obligate aerobe p. putida was dependent upon expression of bcd-etfab. these results demonstrate the potential of engineering butanol biosynthesis in a variety of heterologous microorganisms, including those cultivated aerobically.

TI  == straining phenomena in bacteria transport through natural porous media.
AB  == background, aim, and scope: transport of bacteria through natural porous media is an issue of increasing concern arising in several very important environmental processes. these include the percolation of bacteria from fecal waste to drinking water reservoirs, thus leading to a risk for human health, or the bioremediation  of contaminated soils in which the bacteria are expected to travel long distances underground in order to reach contaminated areas and degrade chemicals originating from accidental spills. an understanding of bacterial retention and transport mechanisms in porous media would be of great help in the development of models able to predict the distance covered by bacterial suspensions in these situations. materials and methods: experiments were carried out preparing columns filled of soil and sand, introducing bacteria culture (escherichia coli, pseudomona putida, and listeria innocua) solutions by the top of the column. breakthrough curves were obtained to see the transport of the bacteria in the column. results: the transport of different bacteria in the two soils aimed at establishing the relative importance of straining in different conditions. this has enabled us to obtain certain parameters, such as the sticking coefficients derived from the filtration theory or bacterial recoveries after multi-step elution, which aid our understanding of how bacteria are retained by mechanisms different to those usually included in the physico-chemical filtration theory. discussion: several indicators may be used to determine the degree of relevance of straining as a mechanism acting during bacterial transport through porous media. usually, in natural media, neither straining nor physico-chemical filtration is the sole mechanism contributing to bacterial retention. the retention of bacteria by straining mechanisms can be assessed by means of elution profiles under varying conditions. the inversion of flow in our experiments gave  rise to secondary elution peaks, probably originating from bacteria retained in narrow pores conclusions: according to experimental observations, straining was shown to contribute highly to bacterial retention in all the soils tested, in particular in the soils with a broader grain size distribution and more irregular shape. in both media, an increase in ionic strength did not lead to significant differences in bacterial retention, possibly due to the lack of relevance of ionic repulsion as a barrier to physico-chemical attachment of particles recommendation and perspectives: the study of bacteria transport in natural soil  is an important step in the development of decontamination processes. the importance of the straining in the transport process has been revealed in the work carried out in this paper.

TI  == linear alkylbenzene sulfonate tolerance in bacteria isolated from sediment of tropical water bodies polluted with detergents.
AB  == the discharge of untreated detergent-bearing waste introduces linear alklcylbenzene sulfonates (las) to the aquatic environment. the surfactant persists in some streams and rivers in nigeria, some is adsorbed to suspended materials and end in the sediment of the receiving water bodies. in this study, bacteria isolated from sediments of some tropical detergent-effluent-polluted streams were tested for tolerance to las using the media dilution technique. las-tolerance was indicated by growth of the bacteria in the presence of the surfactant. the ph, concentrations of surfactant, population of heterotrophic bacteria and population of las-tolerant bacteria in the sediments were determined. a direct relationship (r = 0.9124) was found between the alkaline conditions (ph= 8.2-12.0) and high surfactant concentrations (45-132 mg/g) in the sediment. the sediments harboured a high population and a wide variety of bacteria; the populations of viable heterotrophic bacteria (vhb: 2.9 x 10(5) to 1.2 x 10(7) cfu/g) and las tolerant bacteria (ltb: 1.5 x 10(4) to 1.2 x 10(6) cfu/g) had a direct relationship (r = 0.9500). an inverse relationship resulted between each of them and the concentration of surfactant in the sediment, r(vhb/las) = -0.9303 and r(ltb/las) = -0.9143, respectively. twelve bacteria species were isolated from the sediment: alcaligenes odorans, bacillus subtilis,  burkholderia cepacia, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter diversus, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, micrococcus albus, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas stutzeri, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcusfaecalis. most of them were adapted to the surfactant with their maximum acceptable concentrations ranging between 0.03 and >1.0% (w/v). the sediments could serve as source of adapted organisms which can be used in bio-treatment of las-bearing waste.

TI  == a novel nicotine catabolic plasmid pmh1 in pseudomonas sp. strain hf-1.
AB  == attempts were made to acquire a plasmid-loss mutant via various methods (spontaneous mutation, sds, and mitomycin c), among which the method involving mitomycin c (10 microg/ml) has been proven successful. concomitant with the loss  of the plasmid in pseudomonas sp. strain hf-1, the cured derivative was identified as having a nicotine-negative (nic-) phenotype, named mutant strain 6-13 (nic-). after plasmids were transferred from strain hf-1 (named plasmid pmh1) to the mutant strain 6-13, the mutant strain acquired nicotine-degrading ability, called 6-13 transformant (nic+). there were no differences in growth or  nicotine-degrading efficiency between strain hf-1 (wild-type strain) and strain 6-13 transformant. after pmh1 was transferred to escherichia coli strain top10 (nic-), a distant relative of pseudomonas, it also gained nicotine-degrading ability, showing the highest nicotine degradation efficiency at ph 7.0, the optimal ph for growth of e. coli. the hsp gene, which encodes 6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine hydroxylase, is involved in nicotine degradation in pseudomonas putida strain s16 and was present in pmh1 but not in pao1, the well-known nicotine degradation plasmid in arthrobacter nicotinovorans. it was demonstrated that plasmid pmh1 is a novel nicotine-degrading plasmid.

TI  == genetic and biochemical analyses of chlorobenzene degradation gene clusters in pandoraea sp. strain mcb032.
AB  == pandoraea sp. strain mcb032 was isolated as an emerging chlorobenzene degrader from a functionally stable bioreactor where species succession had occurred. in this study, two gene clusters encoding chlorobenzene metabolic functions have been cloned. within the cbs gene cluster, cbsa and cbsb are similar to the chlorobenzene dioxygenase and the cis-chlorobenzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase in  ralstonia sp. js705 and shown to transform chlorobenzene to 3-chlorocatechol. the clc gene cluster shows strong similarity to the clc genes of ralstonia sp. js705  and encodes chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase (clca) and other enzymes, which catalyze the conversion of chlorocatechol to 3-oxoadipate. the michaelis constants (k (m)) values of clca for catechol, 3-methylcatechol and 3-chlorocatechol were determined as 10.0, 8.9 and 3.4 mum, respectively. cbsx, a  putative transport protein present in the cbs cluster of strain mcb032 but not in those of other chlorobenzene degraders, shows 76 and 53% identities to two previously identified transport proteins involved in toluene degradation, tbux from ralstonia pickettii pko1 and todx from pseudomonas putida f1. the presence of the transport protein in strain mcb032 likely provides a mechanistic explanation for its higher chlorobenzene affinity and may well be the basis for the competitive advantage of this strain in the bioreactor.

TI  == heterologous production of polyketides in bacteria.
AB  == polyketide natural products are among the most important microbial metabolites in human medicine and are widely used to treat both acute and degenerative diseases. the need to develop new drugs has prompted the idea of using heterologous systems for the expression of polyketide biosynthetic pathways. the basic idea behind this approach is to use heterologous bacterial systems with better growth and genetic characteristics that could support better production of a certain compound than the original host or that could allow the generation of novel analogues through combinatorial biosynthesis. moreover, these hosts could be used to express "cryptic" secondary metabolic pathways or serve as surrogate hosts in  metagenomics experiments in order to find potential new bioactive compounds. in this chapter we discuss recent advances in the heterologous production of polyketides in bacteria and describe some methodological improvements of the systems.

AB  == predation by bdellovibrio-like organisms (blos) results in bacterial community succession in aquatic ecosystems. the effects of nutrient loading on the distribution and phylogeny of blos remain largely unknown. to this end, we present our findings on blo diversity from four north-indian lakes that are variable in their trophic status; nainital is eutrophic, both, bhimtal and naukuchiatal are mesotrophic and sattal remains oligotrophic, respectively. initially, total heterotrophic bacteria and blos were quantified by most probable number (mpn) analyses using pseudomonas putida and escherichia coli as prey bacteria. total bacterial numbers were at least two-logs higher in the eutrophic  lake samples compared with oligotrophic lake. similarly, blo numbers were approximately 39-fold higher using pseudomonas sp., which is likely the preferred prey within these lakes. conversely, significant differences were not observed between mesotrophic and oligotrophic blo numbers when e. coli was used as the prey. pcr-rflp of small subunit rdna (ssu rdna) of blos, followed by cloning, sequencing, and taxonomic categorization revealed distinct differences such that, eutrophic lake consisted of higher blo diversity compared with mesotrophic and oligotrophic lake, most likely due to both, higher numbers and availability of a  diverse population of prey bacteria resulting from nutrient loading in this ecosystem.

TI  == microbial conversion of glucose to a novel chemical building block, 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylic acid.
AB  == 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylic acid (pdc) is a catabolic intermediate in sphingobium sp. syk-6 (previously characterized as sphingomonas paucimobilis syk-6), which is a degrader of lignin-derived aromatic compounds. recently, pdc has been also characterized as a novel starting material for several potentially useful synthetic polymers. in a previous study, we constructed a biosynthetic system in  which pdc was generated efficiently from a chemically synthesized compound, protocatechuate. in order to develop an alternative system for production of pdc, we tried to generate it from glucose, which is a low-cost sugar that can be obtained from abundant cellulosic wastes and biomass crops. we designed a metabolic bypass to pdc from the shikimate pathway in recombinant escherichia coli cells. pdc accumulated in the medium of recombinant e. coli cells that had been transformed with genes isolated from emericella niger, e. coli, pseudomonas  putida, and sphingobium sp. syk-6. the yield of pdc depended on the combination of genes that we introduced into the cells and on the specific of host strain. under optimal conditions, the yield and titer of pdc were, respectively, 17.3% and 0.35 mg/l when the concentration of glucose was 2 g/l and the culture volume  was 50 ml. our results open up the possibility of novel utilization of biomass as the source of a useful chemical building block.

TI  == cloning, expression, characterization, and biocatalytic investigation of the 4-hydroxyacetophenone monooxygenase from pseudomonas putida jd1.
AB  == while the number of available recombinant baeyer-villiger monooxygenases (bvmos)  has grown significantly over the last few years, there is still the demand for other bvmos to expand the biocatalytic diversity. most bvmos that have been described are dedicated to convert efficiently cyclohexanone and related cyclic aliphatic ketones. to cover a broader range of substrate types and enantio- and/or regioselectivities, new bvmos have to be discovered. the gene encoding a bvmo identified in pseudomonas putida jd1 converting aromatic ketones (hapmo; 4-hydroxyacetophenone monooxygenase) was amplified from genomic dna using sitefinding-pcr, cloned, and functionally expressed in escherichia coli. furthermore, four other open reading frames could be identified clustered around  this hapmo. it has been suggested that these proteins, including the hapmo, might be involved in the degradation of 4-hydroxyacetophenone. substrate specificity studies revealed that a large variety of other arylaliphatic ketones are also converted via baeyer-villiger oxidation into the corresponding esters, with preferences for para-substitutions at the aromatic ring. in addition, oxidation of aldehydes and some heteroaromatic compounds was observed. cycloketones and open-chain ketones were not or poorly accepted, respectively. it was also found that this enzyme oxidizes aromatic ketones such as 3-phenyl-2-butanone with excellent enantioselectivity (e >>100).

AB  == bacterial membranes constitute the first physical barrier against different environmental stresses. pseudomonas putida dot-t1e accumulates cyclopropane fatty acids (cfas) in the stationary phase of growth. in this strain the cfab gene encodes the main cyclopropane synthase responsible of the synthesis of cfas, and  its expression is mediated by rna polymerase with sigma factor sigma(38). we generated a cfab mutant of p. putida dot-t1e and studied its response to solvents, acid ph and other stress conditions such as temperature changes, high osmolarity and the presence of antibiotics or heavy metals in the culture medium. a cfab knockout mutant was more sensitive to solvent stress than the wild-type strain, but in contrast to escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, the p. putida cfab mutant was as tolerant to acid shock as the wild-type strain. the cfab mutant was also as tolerant as the parental strain to a number of drugs, antibiotics and other damaging agents.

AB  == the phna gene that encodes the carbon-phosphorus bond cleavage enzyme phosphonoacetate hydrolase is widely distributed in the environment, suggesting that its phosphonate substrate may play a significant role in biogeochemical phosphorus cycling. surprisingly, however, no biogenic origin for phosphonoacetate has yet been established. to facilitate the search for its natural source we have constructed a whole-cell phosphonoacetate biosensor. the gene encoding the lysr-type transcriptional activator phnr, which controls expression of the phosphonoacetate degradative operon in pseudomonas fluorescens  23f, was inserted in the broad-host-range promoter probe vector pprobe-nt, together with the promoter region of the structural genes. cells of escherichia coli dh5alpha that contained the resultant construct, ppant3, exhibited phosphonoacetate-dependent green fluorescent protein fluorescence in response to  threshold concentrations of as little as 0.5 microm phosphonoacetate, some 100 times lower than the detection limit of currently available non-biological analytical methods; the ppant3 biosensor construct in pseudomonas putida kt2440 was less sensitive, although with shorter response times. from a range of other phosphonates and phosphonoacetate analogues tested, only phosphonoacetaldehyde and arsonoacetate induced green fluorescent protein fluorescence in the e. coli dh5alpha (ppant3) biosensor, although at much-reduced sensitivities (50 microm phosphonoacetaldehyde and 500 microm arsonoacetate).

TI  == identification and characterization of catabolic para-nitrophenol 4-monooxygenase and para-benzoquinone reductase from pseudomonas sp. strain wbc-3.
AB  == pseudomonas sp. strain wbc-3 utilizes para-nitrophenol (pnp) as a sole source of  carbon, nitrogen, and energy. in order to identify the genes involved in this utilization, we cloned and sequenced a 12.7-kb fragment containing a conserved region of nad(p)h:quinone oxidoreductase genes. of the products of the 13 open reading frames deduced from this fragment, pnpa shares 24% identity to the large  component of a 3-hydroxyphenylacetate hydroxylase from pseudomonas putida u and pnpb is 58% identical to an nad(p)h:quinone oxidoreductase from escherichia coli. both pnpa and pnpb were purified to homogeneity as his-tagged proteins, and they  were considered to be a monomer and a dimer, respectively, as determined by gel filtration. pnpa is a flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent single-component pnp  4-monooxygenase that converts pnp to para-benzoquinone in the presence of nadph.  pnpb is a flavin mononucleotide-and nadph-dependent p-benzoquinone reductase that catalyzes the reduction of p-benzoquinone to hydroquinone. pnpb could enhance pnpa activity, and genetic analyses indicated that both pnpa and pnpb play essential roles in pnp mineralization in strain wbc-3. furthermore, the pnpcdef gene cluster next to pnpab shares significant similarities with and has the same  organization as a gene cluster responsible for hydroquinone degradation (hapcdef) in pseudomonas fluorescens acb (m. j. moonen, n. m. kamerbeek, a. h. westphal, s. a. boeren, d. b. janssen, m. w. fraaije, and w. j. van berkel, j. bacteriol. 190:5190-5198, 2008), suggesting that the genes involved in pnp degradation are physically linked.

TI  == studying the mechanism of rna separations using rna chromatography and its application in the analysis of ribosomal rna and rna:rna interactions.
AB  == dna/rna chromatography presents a versatile platform for the analysis of nucleic  acids. although the mechanism of separation of double stranded (ds) dna fragments is largely understood, the mechanism by which rna is separated appears more complicated. to further understand the separation mechanisms of rna using ion pair reverse phase liquid chromatography, we have analysed a number of dsrna and  single stranded (ss) rna fragments. the high-resolution separation of dsrna was observed, in a similar manner to dsdna under non-denaturing conditions. moreover, the high-resolution separation of ssrna was observed at high temperatures (75 degrees c) in contrast to ssdna. it is proposed that the presence of duplex regions/secondary structures within the rna remain at such temperatures, resulting in high-resolution rna separations. the retention time of the nucleic acids reflects the relative hydrophobicity, through contributions of the nucleic  sequence and the degree of secondary structure present. in addition, the analysis of rna using such approaches was extended to enable the discrimination of bacterial 16s rrna fragments and as an aid to conformational analysis of rna. rna:rna interactions of the human telomerase rna component (htr) were analysed in conjunction with the incorporation of mg2+ during chromatography. this novel chromatographic procedure permits analysis of the temperature dependent formation of dimeric rna species.

TI  == transcriptional wiring of the tol plasmid regulatory network to its host involves the submission of the sigma54-promoter pu to the response regulator ppra.
AB  == implantation of the regulatory circuit of the degradation pathway of tol plasmid  pww0 in the native transcriptional network of the host pseudomonas putida involves interplay between plasmid- and chromosome-encoded factors. we have employed a reverse genetics approach to investigate such a molecular wiring by identifying host proteins that form stable complexes with pu, the sigma(54)-dependent promoter of the upper tol operon of pww0. this approach revealed that the pu upstream activating sequences (uas), the target sites of the cognate activator xylr, form a specific complex with a host protein which, following dna affinity purification and mass spectrometry analysis, was identified as the lyttr-type two-component response regulator ppra. directed inactivation of ppra resulted in the upregulation of the pu promoter in vivo, while expression of the same gene from a plasmid vector strongly repressed pu activity. such a downregulation of pu by ppra could be faithfully reproduced both in vitro with purified components and in an in vivo reporter system assembled in  escherichia coli. the overlap of the ppra and xylr binding sites suggested that the basis for the inhibitory effect on pu was a mutual exclusion mechanism between the two proteins to bind the uas. we argue that the binding of the response regulator ppra to pu (a case without precedents in sigma(54)-dependent transcription) helps to anchor the tol regulatory subnetwork to the wider context of the host transcriptome, thereby allowing the entry of physiological signals that modulate the outcome of promoter activity.

TI  == ferredoxin-nadp+ reductase from pseudomonas putida functions as a ferric reductase.
AB  == pseudomonas putida harbors two ferredoxin-nadp(+) reductases (fprs) on its chromosome, and their functions remain largely unknown. ferric reductase is structurally contained within the fpr superfamily. interestingly, ferric reductase is not annotated on the chromosome of p. putida. in an effort to elucidate the function of the fpr as a ferric reductase, we used a variety of biochemical and physiological methods using the wild-type and mutant strains. in  both the ferric reductase and flavin reductase assays, fpra and fprb preferentially used nadph and nadh as electron donors, respectively. two fprs prefer a native ferric chelator to a synthetic ferric chelator and utilize free flavin mononucleotide (fmn) as an electron carrier. fprb has a higher k(cat)/k(m) value for reducing the ferric complex with free fmn. the growth rate of the fprb  mutant was reduced more profoundly than that of the fpra mutant, the growth rate  of which is also lower than the wild type in ferric iron-containing minimal media. flavin reductase activity was diminished completely when the cell extracts of the fprb mutant plus nadh were utilized, but not the fpra mutant with nadph. this indicates that other nadph-dependent flavin reductases may exist. interestingly, the structure of the nad(p) region of fprb, but not of fpra, resembled the ferric reductase (fre) of escherichia coli in the homology modeling. this study demonstrates, for the first time, the functions of fprs in p. putida as flavin and ferric reductases. furthermore, our results indicated that fprb may perform a crucial role as a nadh-dependent ferric/flavin reductase  under iron stress conditions.

TI  == the use of oxygen uptake rate to monitor discovery of microbial and enzymatic biocatalysts.
AB  == arising from the requirement for discovery of novel biocatalysts with unusual properties, a process was developed which uniquely combines aspects of continuous culture with the measurement of oxygen uptake. this adaptation of the chemostat can be used to facilitate the isolation of a number of microorganisms with desirable properties, particularly those with useful metabolic capabilities and/or enzymes. the technique was also used to provide feedback on the metabolic  status of a microbial population and increase the feed flow rate (i.e., dilution  rate) thereby enabling the isolation of microorganisms with enhanced 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase activity. the use of oxygen uptake as an indicator  of cellular activity enables indirect measurement of substrate utilization and provides a real-time online assessment of the status of microbial enrichment or evolutionary processes and provides an opportunity, through the use of feedback systems, to control these processes. to demonstrate the utility of the technique, oxygen uptake rate (our) was compared with a range of conventional analytical techniques that are typically used to monitor enrichment/evolutionary processes and showed good correlation. further validation was demonstrated by monitoring a  characterizable microbial population shift using our. the population change was confirmed using off-line analytical techniques that are traditionally used to determine microbial activity. our was then used to monitor the enrichment of microorganisms capable of using a solvent (1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone) as the sole  source of carbon for energy and biomass formation from a heterogeneous microbial  population. after purification the microorganisms taken from the enrichment process were able to completely utilize 1 g l(-1) 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone within 24 h demonstrating that the technique had correctly indicated the enriched population was capable of growth on 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone. the technique improves on conventional microbial enrichment that utilizes continuous culture by providing a real-time assessment of the enrichment process and the opportunity to use the our output for automated control and variation of one or more growth parameters.

TI  == methionine depletion with recombinant methioninase: in vitro and in vivo efficacy against neuroblastoma and its synergism with chemotherapeutic drugs.
AB  == methionine starvation can modulate gene methylation, cell cycle transition and pathways related to survival following dna damage. methionine depletion by recombinant methioninase (rmetase) may have in vitro and in vivo efficacy against neuroblastoma (nb), especially when combined with chemotherapeutic drugs. rmetase from pseudomonas putida was produced in escherichia coli and purified by ion-exchange chromatography. rmetase alone inhibited the proliferation of 15/15 nb cell lines in vitro. among these 15 cell lines, only 66n demonstrated rmetase-induced apoptosis. rmetase alone suppressed lan-1 and nmb-7 xenografts (p < 0.01) and no toxicities were noted other than reversible weight loss. in vitro  efficacy experiments combining rmetase and chemotherapeutic agents were carried out using sk-n-ld and sk-n-be (1)n established at diagnosis, as well as lan-1, sk-n-be (2)c and nmb-7 established at relapse. microtubule depolymerization agents including vincristine, vinorelbine, vinblatine and mebendazole showed synergism when tested in combination with rmetase in all 5 cell lines. among dna  damaging agents, synergy with rmetase was observed only in cell lines established at diagnosis and not at relapse. cell cycle analysis showed that rmetase arrested g2 phase and not m phase. in vivo efficacy experiments using lan-1 and nmb-7 xenografts showed that rmetase rendered vincristine more effective than vincristine alone in tumor growth suppression (p < 0.001). in conclusion, methionine depletion inhibited nb proliferation and arrested tumor cells at g2 phase. rmetase synergized with microtubule depolymerization agents. moreover, synergism between rmetase and dna damaging agents was dependent on whether cell lines were established at diagnosis or at relapse.

TI  == using directed evolution to probe the substrate specificity of mandelamide hydrolase.
AB  == mandelamide hydrolase (mah), a member of the amidase signature family, catalyzes  the hydrolysis of mandelamide to mandelate and ammonia. x-ray structures of several members of this family, but not that of mah, have been reported. these reveal nearly superimposable conformations of the unusual ser-cisser-lys catalytic triad. conversely, the residues involved in substrate recognition are not conserved, implying that the binding pocket could be modified to change the substrate specificity, perhaps by directed evolution. here we show that mah is able to hydrolyze small aliphatic substrates such as lactamide, albeit with low efficiency. a selection method to monitor changes in mandelamide/lactamide preference was developed and used to identify several mutations affecting substrate binding. a homology model places some of these mutations close to the catalytic triad, presumably in the mah active site. in particular, gly202 appears to control the preference for aromatic substrates as the g202a variant showed three orders of magnitude decrease in k(cat)/k(m) for (r)- and (s)-mandelamide. this reduction in activity increased to six orders of magnitude for the g202v variant.

AB  == uronate dehydrogenase has been cloned from pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain dc3000, pseudomonas putida kt2440, and agrobacterium tumefaciens strain c58. the  genes were identified by using a novel complementation assay employing an escherichia coli mutant incapable of consuming glucuronate as the sole carbon source but capable of growth on glucarate. a shotgun library of p. syringae was screened in the mutant e. coli by growing transformed cells on minimal medium containing glucuronic acid. colonies that survived were evaluated for uronate dehydrogenase, which is capable of converting glucuronic acid to glucaric acid. in this manner, a 0.8-kb open reading frame was identified and subsequently verified to be udh. homologous enzymes in p. putida and a. tumefaciens were identified based on a similarity search of the sequenced genomes. recombinant proteins from each of the three organisms expressed in e. coli were purified and  characterized. for all three enzymes, the turnover number (k(cat)) with glucuronate as a substrate was higher than that with galacturonate; however, the  michaelis constant (k(m)) for galacturonate was lower than that for glucuronate.  the a. tumefaciens enzyme was found to have the highest rate constant (k(cat) = 1.9 x 10(2) s(-1) on glucuronate), which was more than twofold higher than those  of both of the pseudomonad enzymes.

TI  == oxyr is involved in the expression of thioredoxin reductase trxb in pseudomonas putida.
AB  == oxyr regulates the expression of a peroxiredoxin (ahpc) and two catalases (kata and katb), which play roles in peroxide protection, at the transcription level in pseudomonas putida kt2442. proteome analysis indicated significantly increased amounts of the enzymes ahpc, kata, katb, and a peroxiredoxin reductase (ahpf) in  the oxyr1 mutant cells; these increases reflected the upregulation of the expression of the genes encoding these enzymes. additionally, although the effect of oxyr1 mutation on the trxb transcript level was not clearly evident, it increased the amount of thioredoxin reductase (trxb) by fivefold. primer extension analysis revealed that trxb was constitutively transcribed from the p1  site; however, hydrogen peroxide treatment lowered the transcription of trxb from p1 but induced its transcription from p2. adjacent to the -35 base of the p2 initiation site, sequences similar to those involved in the proposed oxyr binding in escherichia coli were found in a region to which oxyr was shown to bind. these observations suggest that in p. putida, oxyr regulates trxb expression by promoting trxb transcription from the p2 site when oxidative stresses lowered the transcription from the constitutive p1 site.

TI  == sigma54-promoter discrimination and regulation by ppgpp and dksa.
AB  == the sigma(54)-factor controls expression of a variety of genes in response to environmental cues. much previous work has implicated the nucleotide alarmone ppgpp and its co-factor dksa in control of sigma(54)-dependent transcription in the gut commensal escherichia coli, which has evolved to live under very different environmental conditions than pseudomonas putida. here we compared ppgpp/dksa mediated control of sigma(54)-dependent transcription in these two organisms. our in vivo experiments employed p. putida mutants and manipulations of factors implicated in ppgpp/dksa mediated control of sigma(54)-dependent transcription in combination with a series of sigma(54)-promoters with graded affinities for sigma(54)-rna polymerase. for in vitro analysis we used a p. putida-based reconstituted sigma(54)-transcription assay system in conjunction with dna-binding plasmon resonance analysis of native and heterologous sigma(54)-rna polymerase holoenzymes. in comparison with e. coli, ppgpp/dksa responsive sigma(54)-transcription in the environmentally adaptable p. putida was found to be more robust under low energy conditions that occur upon nutrient depletion. the mechanism behind this difference can be traced to reduced promoter discrimination of low affinity sigma(54)-promoters that is conferred by the strong dna binding properties of the p. putida sigma(54)-rna polymerase holoenzyme.

TI  == a comparison of various methods to predict bacterial predilection for organic solvents used as reaction media.
AB  == bacterial predilection for organic solvents is important in whole-cell biocatalysis in organic media. although various methods of measuring bacterial hydrophobicity have been proposed, it is not fully determined whether they are applicable to the assessment of bacterial predilection for organic solvents in whole-cell biocatalytic processes. in this study, bacterial predilection for organic solvents was assessed by bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbon (bath), contact angle measurement (cam), hydrophobic interaction chromatography (hic), and glass adhesion test (gat). these methods were applied to the cultures of four bacterial species of industrial importance, namely, rhodococcus opacus b-4, r. erythropolis pr4, pseudomonas putida t-57, and escherichia coli jm109, in organic media. experimental results revealed that cam assays could be used to predict the dispersibility of bacterial cells in anhydrous organic solvents. however, when bacteria were suspended in aqueous-organic (a/o) two-phase media, the results of  bath assays provided the most reliable assessment of bacterial predilection for organic solvents. this discrepancy noted between cam and bath assays was attributed to the effect of electrostatic interaction between bacteria and oil droplets. in a/o two-phase media, the accessibility of a water-immiscible dye, nile red, to the bacterial cell surface, correlated well with bath assay results.

TI  == speciation of selenite and selenate using living bacteria.
AB  == in this work, a reliable method is described for speciation of soluble inorganic  selenium ions, se(iv) and se(vi), which combines an uptake process by using living bacterial cells and electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (etaas). a selective retention of either se(iv) or se(iv) plus se(vi) can be carried out by using the uptake system made up of either pseudomonas putida or escherichia coli strains cultivated in a culture medium based on glucose (p. putida) and glucose plus dipotassium phosphate (e. coli) mixed together with the original sample solution containing the selenium species. discrimination between inorganic selenium species is possible by combining the optimization of the bacterial cell, the growth conditions and the relative rates of their retention from the sample.  in the general procedure, an equilibrium between the analyte in the solution and  the uptake system is allowed to be established, and then the concentration of selenium is determined directly in the biomass by slurry sampling etaas. nonetheless, a theoretical model is proposed to describe the retention process by the living bacterial cells, which also provides a feasible quantification of the  extraction process before the adsorption equilibrium is reached and whenever the  agitation conditions and the sampling time are under control. the detection limits for the inorganic selenium species at the best retention conditions are of 5.7 ng se(iv) ml(-1) for p. putida and 6.1 ng se(iv) ml(-1) and 6.3 ng se(vi) ml(-1) for e. coli. the relative standard deviations of the adsorption/determination process are 2.9-6.3%.

AB  == hydroxyacids represent an important class of compounds that see application in the production of polyesters, biodegradable plastics and antibiotics, and that serve as useful chiral synthetic building blocks for other fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. an economical, high-titer method for the production of 4-hydroxyvalerate (4hv) and 3-hydroxyvalerate (3hv) from the inexpensive and renewable carbon source levulinic acid was developed. these hydroxyvalerates were produced by periodically feeding levulinate to pseudomonas putida kt2440 expressing a recombinant thioesterase ii (tesb) gene from escherichia coli k12. the titer of 4hv in shake flask culture reached 13.9+/-1.2 g l(-1) from p. putida tesb(+) cultured at 32 degrees c in lb medium periodically supplemented with glucose and levulinate. the highest 3hv titer obtained was 5.3+/-0.1 g l(-1) in m9 minimal medium supplemented with glucose and levulinate.

TI  == transfer of antibiotic multiresistant plasmid rp4 from escherichia coli to activated sludge bacteria.
AB  == in situ transfer of a self-transmissible, antibiotic-multiresistant plasmid rp4 from a laboratory escherichia coli strain c600 to indigenous activated sludge bacteria was investigated using filter mating. the transfer frequency of rp4 from the donor e. coli to the bacteria that was sampled from two wastewater treatment  plants was 5.1x10(-2) to 7.5x10(-1) and 4.6x10(-3) to 1.3x10(-2)/potential recipient. the isolated transconjugants showed resistance to ap, km, and tc and the presence of a plasmid with a similar size to rp4. the trag gene on rp4 was also detected from all transconjugants. reverse-transfer experiments from the transconjugants to e. coli hb101 indicated that rp4 maintained self-transmissibility in the transconjugants. the transconjugant strains were dominant bacteria in activated sludge including pseudomonas fluorescens, p. putida, and ochrobactrum anthropi and minor populations of enteric bacterial strains including citrobacter freundii, e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, e. asburiae, and klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae. the transconjugant strains k. pneumoniae ssp. pneumonia, e. cloacae, and e. asburiae had several naturally occurring plasmids. these results suggest that in situ transfer of plasmids and the exchange of antibiotic-resistant genes can occur between released and indigenous bacteria in activated sludge.

AB  == a phage mu-driven two-plasmid system for dna integration in escherichia coli genome has been adjusted for methylophilus methylotrophus. constructed helper plasmids with broad-host-range replicons carry thermo-inducible genes for transposition factors mua and mub. integrative plasmids that are only replicated  in e. coli could be mobilized to m. methylotrophus and contained mini-mu unit with a short terminus of mu dna, mu-attl/r. mini-mu unit was integrated in the m. methylotrophus genome via mobilization of the integrative plasmid to the cells carrying the helper in conditions of thermo-induced expression of mua and mub. in this system, mini-mu unit was mainly integrated due to replicative transposition, and the integrated copy could be amplified in the m. methylotrophus chromosome in the presence of helper plasmid. a kan-gene flanked by frt sites was inserted in one of the mini-mu units, and it could be readily excised by yeast flp recombinase that is encoded by the designed plasmid. the multiple mu-driven gene  insertion was carried out by integration of the bacillus amyloliquefaciens alpha-amylase gene followed by curing the kmr marker before integration of the second mini-mu unit with pseudomonas putida xyle gene encoding catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (c23o).

TI  == spring constants and adhesive properties of native bacterial biofilm cells measured by atomic force microscopy.
AB  == bacterial biofilms were imaged by atomic force microscopy (afm), and their elasticity and adhesion to the afm tip were determined from a series of tip extension and retraction cycles. though the five bacterial strains studied included both gram-negative and -positive bacteria and both environmental and laboratory strains, all formed simple biofilms on glass surfaces. cellular spring constants, determined from the extension portion of the force cycle, varied between 0.16+/-0.01 and 0.41+/-0.01 n/m, where larger spring constants were measured for gram-positive cells than for gram-negative cells. the nonlinear regime in the extension curve depended upon the biomolecules on the cell surface: the extension curves for the smooth gram-negative bacterial strains with the longest lipopolysaccharides on their surface had a larger nonlinear region than the rough bacterial strain with shorter lipopolysaccharides on the surface. adhesive forces between the retracting silicon nitride tip and the cells varied between cell types in terms of the force components, the distance components, and the number of adhesion events. the gram-negative cells' adhesion to the tip showed the longest distance components, sometimes more than 1 microm, whereas the shortest distance adhesion events were measured between the two gram-positive cell types and the tip. fixation of free-swimming planktonic cells by nhs and edc perturbed both the elasticity and the adhesive properties of the cells. here we consider the biochemical meaning of the measured physical properties of simple biofilms and implications to the colonization of surfaces in the first stages of  biofilm formation.

TI  == biosynthesis of the vitamin e compound delta-tocotrienol in recombinant escherichia coli cells.
AB  == the biosynthesis of natural products in a fast growing and easy to manipulate heterologous host system, such as escherichia coli, is of increasing interest in  biotechnology. this procedure allows the investigation of complex natural product biosynthesis and facilitates the engineering of pathways. here we describe the cloning and the heterologous expression of tocochromanol (vitamin e) biosynthesis genes in e. coli. tocochromanols are synthesized solely in photosynthetic organisms (cyanobacteria, algae, and higher green plants). for recombinant tocochromanol biosynthesis, the genes encoding hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase  (hpd), geranylgeranylpyrophosphate synthase (crte), geranylgeranylpyrophosphate reductase (ggh), homogentisate phytyltransferase (hpt), and tocopherol-cyclase (cyc) were cloned in a stepwise fashion and expressed in e. coli. recombinant e.  coli cells were cultivated and analyzed for tocochromanol compounds and their biosynthesis precursors. the expression of only hpd from pseudomonas putida or crte from pantoea ananatis resulted in the accumulation of 336 mg l(-1) homogentisate and 84 microg l(-1) geranylgeranylpyrophosphate in e. coli cultures. simultaneous expression of hpd, crte, and hpt from synechocystis sp. under the control of single tac-promoter resulted in the production of methyl-6-geranylgeranyl-benzoquinol (67.9 microg g(-1)). additional expression of the tocopherol cyclase gene vte1 from arabidopsis thaliana resulted in the novel  formation of a vitamin e compound-delta-tocotrienol (15 microg g(-1))-in e. coli.

AB  == a central part (amino-acid position 268-397 of 458 amino-acid residues) of the biphenyl dioxygenase large (alpha) subunit, bpha1, from pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes strain kf707 was exchanged with the corresponding part of bpha1 from another biphenyl-degrading bacterium, pseudomonas putida strain kf715, to construct hybrid bpha1, bpha1 (715-707). when expressed in escherichia coli together with the bpha2a3a4bc genes from strain kf707, this enzyme was shown to possess activity for degrading both 1-phenylnaphthalene and 2-phenylnaphthalene.  between central parts of bpha1 from strains kf707 and kf715, the difference of amino-acid residues resided only in position 324-325. an attempt was made to improve the substrate preference of bpha1 by applying random amino-acid substitutions at these positions to bpha1 (715-707). after screening the mutant library to bioconvert several flavonoids, bpha1 (1-22; t324a and i325l) and bpha1 (2-2; t324l and i325i) were selected. when expressed in e. coli together with bpha2a3a4b from strain kf707, both bpha1 (1-22) and bpha1 (2-2) bioconverted the  refractory flavonoids, 7-hydroxyflavone and 5,7-dihydroxyflavone (chrysin), which were hardly converted by any unmodified and artificially-modified shuffled biphenyl dioxygeneses, into their vicinal diol forms, i.e., 2-(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)-7-hydroxy-chromen-4-one and 2-(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)-5,7-dihydroxy-chromen-4-one, respectively. in addition, trans-chalcone was converted into 3-(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)-1-phenylpropan-1-one and further into 1,3-bis-(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)-propan-1-one. the antioxidative activity of these generated compounds was markedly higher than that of the original substrates used.

TI  == solution structure of the pseudomonas putida protein ppputa45 and its dna complex.
AB  == proline utilization a (puta) is a membrane-associated multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of proline to glutamate in a two-step process. in certain, gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas putida, puta also acts as an  auto repressor in the cytoplasm, when an insufficient concentration of proline is available. here, the n-terminal residues 1-45 of puta from p. putida (ppputa45) are shown to be responsible for dna binding and dimerization. the solution structure of ppputa45 was determined using nmr methods, where the protein is shown to be a symmetrical homodimer (12 kda) consisting of two ribbon-helix-helix (rhh) structures. dna sequence recognition by ppputa45 was determined using dna gel mobility shift assays and nmr chemical shift perturbations (csps). ppputa45 was shown to bind a 14 base-pair dna oligomer (5'-gcggttgcaccttt-3'). a model of  the ppputa45-dna oligomer complex was generated using haddock 2.1. the antiparallel beta-sheet that results from ppputa45 dimerization serves as the dna recognition binding site by inserting into the dna major groove. the dimeric core of four alpha-helices provides a structural scaffold for the beta-sheet from which residues thr5, gly7, and lys9 make sequence-specific contacts with the dna. the structural model implies flexibility of lys9 which can make hydrogen bond contacts with either guanine or thymine. the high sequence and structure conservation of the puta rhh domain suggest interdomain interactions play an important role in the evolution of the protein.

TI  == a novel and complete gene cluster involved in the degradation of aniline by delftia sp. an3.
AB  == a recombinant strain, escherichia coli jm109-an1, was obtained by constructing of a genomic library of the total dna of delftia sp. an3 in e. coli jm109 and screening for catechol 2,3-dioxygenase activity. this recombinant strain could grow on aniline as sole carbon, nitrogen and energy source. enzymatic assays revealed that the exogenous genes including aniline dioxygenase (ad) and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (c230) genes could well express in the recombinant strain with the activities of ad and c230 up to 0.31 u/mg wet cell and 1.92 u/mg crude proteins, respectively. the ad or c230 of strain an3 could only catalyze aniline  or catechol but not any other substituted substrates. this recombinant strain contained a recombinant plasmid, pkc505-an1, in which a 29.7-kb dna fragment from delftia sp. an3 was inserted. sequencing and open reading frame (orfs) analysis of this 29.7 kb fragment revealed that it contained at least 27 orfs, among them  a gene cluster (consisting of at least 16 genes, named danqta1a2brdcefg1hijkg2) was responsible for the complete metabolism of aniline to tca-cycle intermediates. this gene cluster could be divided into two main parts, the upper  sequences consisted of 7 genes (danqtaia2brd) were predicted to encode a multi-component aniline dioxygenase and a lysr-type regulator, and the central genes (dancefgihijkg2) were expected to encode meta-cleavage pathway enzymes for  catechol degradation to tca-cycle intermediates. unlike clusters tad from delftia tsuruhatensis ad9 and tdn from pseudomonas putida ucc22, in this gene cluster, all the genes were in the same transcriptional direction. there was only one set  of c230 gene (danc) and ferredoxin-like protein gene (dand). the presence of only one set of these two genes and specificity of ad and c230 might be the reason for strain an3 could only degrade aniline. the products of danqtaia2brdc showed 99%-100% identity to those from delftia acidovorans 7n, and 50%-85% identity to those of tad cluster from d. tsuruhatensis ad9 in amino acid residues. besides this dan cluster, the 29.7 kb fragment also contained genes encoding the trans-membrane transporter and transposases which might be needed for transposition of the gene cluster. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and plasmid curing experiments suggested that the dan cluster might be encoded on the chromosome of strain an3. the genbank accession number for the dan cluster of delftia sp. an3 is dq661649.

TI  == bacterial partitioning proteins affect the subcellular location of broad-host-range plasmid rk2.

TI  == a phylogenomic analysis of the shikimate dehydrogenases reveals broadscale functional diversification and identifies one functionally distinct subclass.
AB  == the shikimate dehydrogenases (sdh) represent a widely distributed enzyme family with an essential role in secondary metabolism. this superfamily had been previously subdivided into 4 enzyme groups (aroe, ydib, sdhl, and rifi), which show clear biochemical and functional differences ranging from amino acid biosynthesis to antibiotic production. despite the importance of this group, little is known about how such essential enzymatic functions can evolve and diversify. we dissected the enzyme superfamily with a phylogenomic analysis of approximately 250 fully sequenced genomes, making use of previously characterized representatives from each enzyme class, and the key substrate-binding residues known to distinguish substrate specificity. we identified 5 major evolutionary and functional sdh subgroups and several other potentially unique functional classes within this complex enzyme family and then validated the functional distinctiveness of each group by characterizing the 5 sdh homologs found in pseudomonas putida kt2440 biochemically. we identified an entirely novel functionally distinct subgroup, which we designated ael1 (aroe-like1) and also delineated a new group of shikimate/quinate dehydrogenases (ydib2), which is phylogenetically distinct from the previously described escherichia coli ydib. the combination of biochemical, phylogenetic, and genomic approaches has revealed the broad extent to which the sdh enzyme superfamily has diversified. five functional groups were validated with the potential for at least 5 additional subgroups. our analysis also identified a new sdh functional group, which appears to have evolved recently from an ancestral aroe, illustrating a very prominent role of horizontal transmission and neofunctionalizaton in the evolutionary and functional diversification of this enzyme family.

AB  == the solvent-tolerant bacterium pseudomonas putida s12 was engineered to utilize xylose as a substrate by expressing xylose isomerase (xyla) and xylulokinase (xylb) from escherichia coli. the initial yield on xylose was low (9% [g cdw g substrate(-1)], where cdw is cell dry weight), and the growth rate was poor (0.01 h(-1)). the main cause of the low yield was the oxidation of xylose into the dead-end product xylonate by endogenous glucose dehydrogenase (gcd). subjecting the xylab-expressing p. putida s12 to laboratory evolution yielded a strain that  efficiently utilized xylose (yield, 52% [g cdw g xylose(-1)]) at a considerably improved growth rate (0.35 h(-1)). the high yield could be attributed in part to  gcd inactivity, whereas the improved growth rate may be connected to alterations  in the primary metabolism. surprisingly, without any further engineering, the evolved d-xylose-utilizing strain metabolized l-arabinose as efficiently as d-xylose. furthermore, despite the loss of gcd activity, the ability to utilize glucose was not affected. thus, a p. putida s12-derived strain was obtained that  efficiently utilizes the three main sugars present in lignocellulosic hydrolysate: glucose, xylose, and arabinose. this strain will form the basis for  a platform host for the efficient production of biochemicals from renewable feedstock.

AB  == bacterial biodegradation of hydrocarbons, an important process for environmental  remediation, requires the passage of hydrophobic substrates across the cell membrane. here, we report crystal structures of two outer membrane proteins, pseudomonas putida todx and ralstonia pickettii tbux, which have been implicated  in hydrocarbon transport and are part of a subfamily of the fadl fatty acid transporter family. the structures of todx and tbux show significant differences  with those previously determined for escherichia coli fadl, which may provide an  explanation for the substrate-specific transport of todx and tbux observed with in vivo transport assays. the todx and tbux structures revealed 14-stranded beta-barrels with an n-terminal hatch domain blocking the barrel interior. a hydrophobic channel with bound detergent molecules extends from the extracellular surface and is contiguous with a passageway through the hatch domain, lined by both hydrophobic and polar or charged residues. the todx and tbux structures support a mechanism for transport of hydrophobic substrates from the extracellular environment to the periplasm via a channel through the hatch domain.

TI  == modelling the simultaneous processes occurring during the bod(5) test using synthetic waters as a pattern.
AB  == synthetic waters imitating bod(5) test conditions have been studied to model the  progress curves of cell growth, organic matter consumption and oxygen demand. glucose and glutamic acid were used as organic matter and bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida as microorganisms. the concentrations of  all the products were measured simultaneously over time and were fitted to the logistic and monod models. following this, the goodness of fit was analysed. discrimination between models allowed us to conclude that the logistic model has  acceptable accuracy to describe the kinetic behaviour inside a bod(5) bottle, while the extra parameter in the monod model would not be statistically justified. thus, the logistic parameters were determined under different conditions by non-linear regression and their biological meaning was interpreted.

TI  == attachment of ampicillin to expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene): surface reactions leading to inhibition of microbial growth.
AB  == the broad spectrum antibiotic, ampicillin (am), was reacted to expanded poly (tetrafluoroethylene) (eptfe) surfaces and resulted in the formation of antimicrobial surfaces effective against gram-positive, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus thuringiensis, and enterococcus faecalis, and gram-negative, escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, and salmonella enterica bacteria. these eptfe surface modifications were accomplished by utilization of microwave maleic anhydride (ma) plasma reactions leading to the formation of acid groups, followed by amidation reactions of heterofunctional nh 2/cooh-terminated polyethylene glycol (peg). the final step, the attachment of am to the peg spacer, was achieved by amidation reactions between cooh-terminated peg and nh 2 groups of am. this approach protects the cooh-am functionality and diminishes the possibility of hydrolysis of the antimicrobial active portion of am. these studies also show that approximately 90% of am molecules are still covalently attached to peg-ma-eptfe surfaces after exposure to the bacteria solutions. even after a 24 h period, the  am volume concentration changes only from 2.25 to 2.04 microg/m3, and depending upon the bacteria type, the bacteria suspensions containing am-peg-ma-eptfe specimens retain 85-99% of their initial optical density.

TI  == novel auto-inducing expression systems for the development of whole-cell biocatalysts.
AB  == novel expression systems for the development of whole-cell biocatalysts were generated. their novelty consists both in the host, pseudomonas putida, and in the ability to auto-induce the expression of genes of interest at the exhaustion  of the carbon source used for the biomass growth. the auto-induction relies on new expression vectors developed in this study and based on the activator tour from pseudomonas sp. ox1, which was shown to mediate the activation of target promoters in an effector-independent growth-phase-dependent manner when the carbon source is exhausted at the onset of the stationary phase. we validated the suitability of these expression systems through the production of (s)-styrene oxide by the styrene monooxygenase from pseudomonas fluorescens st. the yields of epoxides produced by these biocatalysts in flask experiments showed to be as efficient as those currently available based on inducible escherichia coli systems. in addition, a larger scale of biomass production showed no reduction of biocatalysis efficiency. therefore, the systems developed in this study constitute a valid alternative to current expression systems to use in bioconversion processes.

TI  == transcription factors cysb and sfnr constitute the hierarchical regulatory system for the sulfate starvation response in pseudomonas putida.
AB  == pseudomonas putida ds1 is able to utilize dimethyl sulfone as a sulfur source. expression of the sfnfg operon responsible for dimethyl sulfone oxygenation is directly regulated by a sigma(54)-dependent transcriptional activator, sfnr, which is encoded within the sfnecr operon. we investigated the transcription mechanism for the sulfate starvation-induced expression of these sfn operons. using an in vivo transcription assay and in vitro dna-binding experiments, we revealed that sfnr negatively regulates the expression of sfnecr by binding to the downstream region of the transcription start point. additionally, we demonstrated that a lysr-type transcriptional regulator, cysb, directly activates the expression of sfnecr by binding to its upstream region. cysb is a master regulator that controls the sulfate starvation response of the sfn operons, as is the case for the sulfonate utilization genes of escherichia coli, although cysb(ds1) appeared to differ from that of e. coli cysb in terms of the effect of  o-acetylserine on dna-binding ability. furthermore, we investigated what effector molecules repress the expression of sfnfg and sfnecr in vivo by using the disruptants of the sulfate assimilatory genes cysnc and cysi. the measurements of mrna levels of the sfn operons in these gene disruptants suggested that the expression of sfnfg is repressed by sulfate itself while the expression of sfnecr is repressed by the downstream metabolites in the sulfate assimilatory pathway, such as sulfide and cysteine. these results indicate that sfnr plays a role independent of cysb in the sulfate starvation-induced expression of the sfn operons.

AB  == monomers of microbial polyhydroxyalkanoates, mainly 3-hydroxyhexanoic acid (3hhx) and 3-hydroxyoctanoic acid (3ho), were produced by overexpressing polyhydroxyalkanoates depolymerase gene phaz, together with putative long-chain fatty acid transport protein fadl of pseudomonas putida kt2442 and acyl-coa synthetase (fadd) of escherichia coli mg1655 in p. putida kt2442. fadl(pp), which is responsible for free fatty acid transportation from the extracellular environment to the cytoplasm, and fadd(ec), which activates fatty acid to acyl-coa, jointly reinforce the fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway. pseudomonas putida kt2442 (pyzpst01) harboring polyhydroxyalkanoates depolymerase gene phaz of pseudomonas stutzeri 1317 produced 1.37 g l(-1) extracellular 3hhx and 3ho in  shake flask studies after 48 h in the presence of sodium octanoate as a sole carbon source, while p. putida kt2442 (pyzpst06) harboring phaz(pst), fadd(ec) and fadl(pp) achieved 2.32 g l(-1) extracellular 3hhx and 3ho monomer production  under the same conditions. in a 48-h fed-batch fermentation process conducted in  a 6-l fermentor with 3 l sodium octanoate mineral medium, 5.8 g l(-1) extracellular 3hhx and 3ho were obtained in the fermentation broth. this is the first time that medium-chain-length 3-hydroxyalkanoic acids (mcl-3ha) were produced using fadl(pp) and fadd(ec) genes combined with the polyhydroxyalkanoates depolymerase gene phaz.

TI  == distribution of the partitioning protein korb on the genome of incp-1 plasmid rk2.
AB  == the parb family partitioning protein, korb, of plasmid rk2 is central to a regulatory network coordinating replication, maintenance and transfer genes. previous immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that the majority of korb is localized in plasmid foci. the 12 identified korb binding sites on rk2 are differentiated by: position relative to promoters; binding strength; and cooperativity with other repressors and so the distribution of korb may be sequestered around a sub-set of sites. however, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that while rk2 dna molecules appear to sequester korb to create a higher local concentration, cooperativity between dna binding proteins does not result in major differences in binding site occupancy. thus under steady state conditions all operators are close to fully occupied and this correlates with gene expression on the plasmid being highly repressed.

AB  == transmission electron and fluorescence microscopy was used to study the character of the interaction of free-living ultramicrobacterial (umb) strains nf1 and nf3,  affiliated with the genus kaistia, and seven species of gram-positive and gram-negative heterotrophic bacteria. strains nf1 and nf3 were found to exhibit parasitic activity against gram-positive bacillus subtilis and gram-negative acidovorax delafildii. umb cells are tightly attached to the envelopes of the victim cells and induce their lysis, thus demonstrating the features of typical ectoparasitism. the selectivity of parasitism of the studied umb to the victim bacteria has been shown: only two soil microorganisms of the seven test objects,  b. subtilis atcc 6633 and an aerobic gram-negative bacterium a. delafildii 39, were found to be sensitive to umb attack. other bacteria (micrococcus luteus vkm  ac-2230, staphylococcus aureus 209-p, pseudomonas putida bs394, escherichia coli  c 600, and pantoea agglomerans atcc 27155) were not attacked by umb. it was established for the first time that free-living umb may be facultative parasites  not only of phototrophic bacteria, as we have previously demonstrated, but of heterotrophic bacteria as well. the umb under study seem to play an important role in the regulation of the quantity of microorganisms and in the functioning of microbial communities in some natural ecotopes.

TI  == solubility enhancement of aggregation-prone heterologous proteins by fusion expression using stress-responsive escherichia coli protein, rpos.
AB  == background: the most efficient method for enhancing solubility of recombinant proteins appears to use the fusion expression partners. although commercial fusion partners including maltose binding protein and glutathione-s-transferase have shown good performance in enhancing the solubility, they cannot be used for  the proprietory production of commercially value-added proteins and likely cannot serve as universal helpers to solve all protein solubility and folding issues. thus, novel fusion partners will continue to be developed through systematic investigations including proteome mining presented in this study. results: we analyzed the escherichia coli proteome response to the exogenous stress of guanidine hydrochloride using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and found that rpos (rna polymerase sigma factor) was significantly stress responsive. while under the stress condition the total number of soluble proteins decreased by about 7 %, but a 6-fold increase in the level of rpos was observed, indicating that rpos is a stress-induced protein. as an n-terminus fusion expression partner, rpos increased significantly the solubility of many aggregation-prone heterologous proteins in e. coli cytoplasm, indicating that rpos is a very effective solubility enhancer for the synthesis of many recombinant proteins. rpos was also well suited for the production of a biologically active fusion mutant of pseudomonas putida cutinase. conclusion: rpos is highly effective as a  strong solubility enhancer for aggregation-prone heterologous proteins when it is used as a fusion expression partner in an e. coli expression system. the results  of these findings may, therefore, be useful in the production of other biologically active industrial enzymes, as successfully demonstrated by cutinase.

TI  == a novel gene, encoding 6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine hydroxylase, involved in nicotine degradation by pseudomonas putida strain s16.
AB  == previous research suggested that pseudomonas spp. may attack the pyrrolidine ring of nicotine in a way similar to mammalian metabolism, resulting in the formation  of pseudooxynicotine, the direct precursor of a potent tobacco-specific lung carcinogen. in addition, the subsequent intermediates, 6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine (hsp) and 2,5-dihydroxypyridine (dhp) in the pseudomonas nicotine degradation pathway are two important precursors for drug syntheses. however, there is little information on the molecular mechanism for nicotine degradation via the pyrrolidine pathway until now. in this study we cloned and sequenced a 4,879-bp gene cluster involved in nicotine degradation. intermediates n-methylmyosmine, pseudooxynicotine, 3-succinoylpyridine, hsp, and  dhp were identified from resting cell reactions of the transformant containing the gene cluster and shown to be identical to those of the pyrrolidine pathway reported in wild-type strain pseudomonas putida s16. the gene for 6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine hydroxylase (hsp hydroxylase) catalyzing hsp directly to dhp was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in escherichia coli, and the purified hsp hydroxylase (38 kda) is nadh dependent. dna sequence analysis of this 936-bp fragment reveals that the deduced amino acid shows no similarity with any protein of known function.

AB  == in pseudomonas putida u two different pathways (pea, ped) are required for the conversion of 2-phenylethylamine and 2-phenylethanol into phenylacetic acid. the  2-phenylethylamine pathway (peaabcdefghr) catalyses the transport of this amine,  its deamination to phenylacetaldehyde by a quinohaemoprotein amine dehydrogenase  and the oxidation of this compound through a reaction catalysed by a phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase. another catabolic route (peds(1)r(1)abcs(2)r(2)defghi) is needed for the uptake of 2-phenylethanol and for its oxidation to phenylacetic acid via phenylacetaldehyde. this implies the participation of two different two-component signal-transducing systems, two quinoprotein alcohol dehydrogenases, a cytochrome c, a periplasmic binding protein, an aldehyde dehydrogenase, a pentapeptide repeat protein and an abc efflux system. additionally, two accessory sets of elements (pqqabcdef and ccmabcdefghi) are necessary for the operation of the main pathways (pea and ped). pqqabcdef is required for the biosynthesis of pyrroloquinoline quinone (pqq), a prosthetic group of certain alcohol dehydrogenases that transfers electrons to an independent cytochrome c; whereas ccmabcdefghi is required for cytochrome c maturation. our data show that the degradation of phenylethylamine and phenylethanol in p. putida u is quite different from that reported in escherichia coli, and they demonstrate that peaabcdefghr and peds(1)r(1)abcs(2)r(2)defghi are two upper routes belonging to the phenylacetyl-coa catabolon.

TI  == pseudomonas syringae bett is a low-affinity choline transporter that is responsible for superior osmoprotection by choline over glycine betaine.
AB  == the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae derives better osmoprotection from choline than from glycine betaine, unlike most bacteria that have been characterized. in this report, we identified a betaine/carnitine/choline family transporter (bcct) in p. syringae pv. tomato strain dc3000 that mediates the transport of choline and acetylcholine. this transporter has a particularly low affinity (k(m) of 876 microm) and high capacity (v(max) of 80 nmol/min/mg of protein) for choline transport relative to other known bccts. although bett activity increased in response to hyperosmolarity, bett mediated significant uptake under low-osmolarity conditions, suggesting a role in transport for both osmoprotection and catabolism. growth studies with mutants deficient in bett and  other choline transporters demonstrated that bett was responsible for the superior osmoprotection conferred to p. syringae by choline over glycine betaine  when these compounds were provided at high concentrations (>100 microm). these results suggest that p. syringae has evolved to survive in relatively choline-rich habitats, a prediction that is supported by the common association of p. syringae with plants and the widespread production of choline, but genus- and species-specific production of glycine betaine, by plants. among the three putative bcct family transporters in pseudomonas aeruginosa and six in pseudomonas putida, different transporters were predicted to function based on similarity to escherichia coli bett than to p. syringae bett. functional p. putida and p. aeruginosa transporters were identified, and their possession of a  long c-terminal tail suggested an osmoregulatory function for this tail; this function was confirmed for p. syringae bett using deletion derivatives.

AB  == soj is a member of the para family of atpases involved in plasmid and chromosomal segregation. it binds nonspecifically and cooperatively to dna although the function of this binding is unknown. here, we show that mutation of conserved arginine residues that map to the surface of bacillus subtilis soj caused only minimal effects on nucleotide-dependent dimerization but had dramatic effects on  dna binding. using a model plasmid partitioning system in escherichia coli, we find that soj dna-binding mutants are deficient in plasmid segregation. the location of the arginines on the soj structure explains why dna binding depends on dimerization and was used to orient the soj dimer on the dna, revealing the axis of soj polymerization. the arginine residues are conserved among other chromosomal homologues, including the paras from caulobacter crescentus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, streptomyces coelicolor, and chromosome i of vibrio cholerae indicating that dna binding is a common feature of members of this family.

AB  == using two forest soils, we previously constructed two fosmid libraries containing 113,700 members in total. the libraries were screened to select active antifungal clones using saccharomyces cerevisiae as a target fungus. one clone from the yuseong pine tree rhizosphere soil library, peaf66, showed s. cerevisiae growth inhibition. despite an intensive effort, active chemicals were not isolated. dna  sequence analysis and transposon mutagenesis of peaf66 revealed 39 open reading frames (orfs) and indicated that eight orfs, probably in one transcriptional unit, might be directly involved in the expression of antifungal activity in escherichia coli. the deduced amino acid sequences of eight orfs were similar to  those of the core genes encoding type ii family polyketide synthases, such as the acyl carrier protein (acp), acp synthases, aminotransferase, and acp reductase. the gene cluster involved in antifungal activity was similar in organization to the putative antibiotic production locus of pseudomonas putida kt2440, although we could not select a similar active clone from the kt2440 genomic dna library in e. coli. orfs encoding atp binding cassette transporters and membrane proteins were located at both ends of the antifungal gene cluster. upstream orfs encoding  an iclr family response regulator and a lysr family response regulator were involved in the positive regulation of antifungal gene expression. our results suggested the metagenomic approach as an alternative to search for novel antifungal antibiotics from unculturable soil bacteria. this is the first report  of an antifungal gene cluster obtained from a soil metagenome using s. cerevisiae as a target fungus.

(2006). biochem. biophys. res. commun. 339, 1246-1254]. in the genome of p. putida kt2440, another fpr homolog (fprb) has a 35.3% amino acid identity with fpr. the fprb gene was cloned and expressed  in escherichia coli. the diaphorase activity assay was conducted using purified fprb to identify the function of fprb. in contrast to the fpr gene, the induction of fprb was not affected by oxidative stress agents, such as paraquat, menadione, h2o2 and t-butyl hydroperoxide. however, a higher level of fprb induction was observed under osmotic stress. targeted disruption of fprb by homologous recombination resulted in a growth defect under high osmotic conditions. recovery of oxidatively damaged aconitase activity was faster for the fprb mutant than for the fpr mutant, yet still slower than that for the wild type. therefore, these data suggest that the catalytic function of fprb may have evolved to augment the  function of fpr in p. putida kt2440.

TI  == isolation and ars detoxification of arsenite-oxidizing bacteria from abandoned arsenic-contaminated mines.
AB  == the ecosystems of certain abandoned mines contain arsenic-resistant bacteria capable of performing detoxification when an ars gene is present in the bacterial genome. the ars gene has already been isolated from pseudomonas putida and identified as a member of the membrane transport regulatory deoxyribonucleic acid family. the arsenite-oxidizing bacterial strains isolated in the present study were found to grow in the presence of 66.7 mm sodium arsenate (v; na2haso4.7h2o), yet experienced inhibited growth when the sodium arsenite (iii; naaso2) concentration was higher than 26 mm. batch experiment results showed that pseudomonas putida strain os-5 completely oxidized 1 mm of as(iii) to as(v) within 35 h. an arsb gene encoding a membrane transport regulatory protein was observed in arsenite-oxidizing pseudomonas putida strain os-5, whereas arsb, arsh, and arra were detected in strain os-19, arsd and arsb were isolated from strain rw-18, and arsr, arsd, and arsb were found in e. coli strain os-80. the leader gene of arsr, -arsd, was observed in a weak acid position. thus, for bacteria exposed to weak acidity, the ars system may cause changes to the ecosystems of as-contaminated mines. accordingly, the present results suggest that arsr, arsd, arsab, arsa, arsb, arsc, arsh, arra, arrb, aoxa, aoxb, aoxc, aoxd, aroa, and arob may be useful for arsenite-oxidizing bacteria in abandoned arsenic-contaminated mines.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of flavonoids extracted from bergamot (citrus bergamia risso) peel, a byproduct of the essential oil industry.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of flavonoid-rich fractions derived from bergamot peel, a byproduct from the citrus fruit processing industry and the influence of enzymatic deglycosylation on their activity against different bacteria and yeast. methods and results: bergamot ethanolic fractions were tested against gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, salmonella enterica), gram-positive bacteria (listeria innocua, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, lactococcus lactis) and the yeast saccharomyces  cerevisiae. bergamot fractions were found to be active against all the gram-negative bacteria tested, and their antimicrobial potency increased after enzymatic deglycosylation. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of the fractions and the pure flavonoids, neohesperidin, hesperetin (aglycone), neoeriocitrin, eriodictyol (aglycone), naringin and naringenin (aglycone), were found to be in the range 200 to 800 microg ml(-1). the interactions between three bergamot flavonoids were also evaluated. conclusion: the enzyme preparation pectinase 62l  efficiently converted common glycosides into their aglycones from bergamot extracts, and this deglycosylation increased the antimicrobial potency of citrus  flavonoids. pairwise combinations of eriodictyol, naringenin and hesperetin showed both synergistic and indifferent interactions that were dependent on the test indicator organism. significance and impact of the study: bergamot peel is a potential source of natural antimicrobials that are active against gram-negative  bacteria.

TI  == transport proteins potd and crr of escherichia coli, novel fusion partners for heterologous protein expression.
AB  == the escherichia coli proteome response to the stressor gdnhcl was analyzed through 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-de). we identified potd (spermidine/putrescine-binding periplasmic protein) and crr [glucose-specific phosphotransferase (pts) enzyme iia component] as a stress-responsive protein. even under a stress situation where the total number of soluble proteins decreased by about 10%, 3.5- and 2.2-fold increase was observed in the synthesis  of potd and crr, respectively. as fusion partners, potd and crr dramatically increased the solubility of many aggregation-prone heterologous proteins [e.g. human minipro-insulin (mp-ins), human epidermal growth factor (egf), human prepro-ghrelin (ppgrn), human interleukin-2(hil-2), human activation induced cytidine deaminase (aid), human glutamate decarboxylase (gad(448-585)), pseudomonas putida cutinase (cut), human ferritin light chain (hftn-l), human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (g-csf), and cold autoinflammatory syndrome1 protein (nalp3) nacht domain (nacht)] in the e. coli cytoplasm. presumably potd and crr were very effective in shielding interactive surfaces of  heterologous proteins associated with non-specific protein-protein interactions leading to the formation of inclusion bodies most likely due to intrinsic high folding efficiency, chaperone-like activity, or a combination of both factors. both the stress-induced proteins were well suited for the production of a biologically active fusion mutant of p. putida cutinase that can be expected to be of biotechnological and commercial interest.

AB  == the proteome profile of escherichia coli bl21(de3) generated in response to heat  shock stress was analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-de), wherein we identified a fkbp-type peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerse (ppiases), slyd, as a stress-responsive (i.e. aggregation-resistant) protein. even under an imposed severe stress condition where 29 out of 858 soluble proteins were totally eliminated and the synthesis levels of 171 proteins decreased over 5-fold, a 3.37-fold increase induced by heat shock treatment was observed in the synthesis  level of slyd compared with a non-stress condition. as a fusion partner, as well  as solubility enhancer, slyd facilitated folding and significantly increased the  solubility of many aggregation-prone heterologous proteins in e. coli cytoplasm.  slyd was very effective in sequestering interactive surfaces of heterologous proteins associated with non-specific protein-protein interactions and the formation of inclusion bodies, most likely as a result of intrinsic folding efficiencies and/or chaperone-like activities. slyd was also shown to be suitable for the production of a biologically active fusion mutant of pseudomonas putida cutinase that is of considerable biotechnological and commercial interest.

TI  == non-uv based germicidal activity of metal-doped tio2 coating on solid surfaces.
AB  == a stain-based screening method was developed to screen different catalyst coatings for their germicidal activity. a baclight dead/live bacteria viability kit (invitrogen, molecular probes) was used for staining the cell. the screening  was carried out following a standard procedure. this included loading cell suspension to solid surface and maintaining contact for 30 min, then staining with a mixture containing dyes. the stained cells were observed using an epifluorescent microscope and photographed with a ccd camera under uv. metal-doped tio2 coatings on al plates were prepared and tested for non-uv germicidal activity without using uv. it was tested using model microorganisms such as bakers yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae), bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas putida, and escherichia coli. on the basis of the germicidal activity of catalyst and the degree of damage caused to the cells, the stained cells may appear green  (viable), green with red or yellow nuclei and yellow (compromised) or red (nonviable). according to their stained color, cells were counted to calculate the percentage of dead, live, and compromised cells. compromised cells are cells  that grow very slowly after reculturing indicating a degree of reversible cell damage. screening the germicidal activity using this staining method is accurate  and efficient, and requires less time than the culture-based method. a modification to the procedure for measuring germicidal activity of rough surfaces or fibrous coatings was developed. both tio2 and metal-doped tio2 (ag, pt, au, cu) possess non-uv based germicidal activity. the germicidal activity of tio2 was found to be related with its wetting property and can be improved by uv irradiation before testing. it is not greatly affected by contact time, indicating a fast acting germicidal activity.

TI  == cosubstrate-induced dynamics of d-3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase from pseudomonas putida.
AB  == d-3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase from pseudomonas putida belongs to the family of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases. we have determined x-ray structures of  the d-3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase from pseudomonas putida, which was recombinantly expressed in escherichia coli, in three different crystal forms to  resolutions between 1.9 and 2.1 a. the so-called substrate-binding loop (residues 187-210) was partially disordered in several subunits, in both the presence and absence of nad(+). however, in two subunits, this loop was completely defined in  an open conformation in the apoenzyme and in a closed conformation in the complex structure with nad(+). structural comparisons indicated that the loop moves as a  rigid body by about 46 degrees . however, the two small alpha-helices (alphafg1 and alphafg2) of the loop also re-orientated slightly during the conformational change. probably, the interactions of val185, thr187 and leu189 with the cosubstrate induced the conformational change. a model of the binding mode of the substrate d-3-hydroxybutyrate indicated that the loop in the closed conformation, as a result of nad(+) binding, is positioned competent for catalysis. gln193 is the only residue of the substrate-binding loop that interacts directly with the substrate. a translation, libration and screw (tls) analysis of the rigid body movement of the loop in the crystal showed significant librational displacements, describing the coordinated movement of the substrate-binding loop in the crystal. nad(+) binding increased the flexibility of the substrate-binding loop and shifted the equilibrium between the open and closed forms towards the closed form. the finding that all nad(+) -bound subunits are present in the closed form  and all nad(+) -free subunits in the open form indicates that the loop closure is induced by cosubstrate binding alone. this mechanism may contribute to the sequential binding of cosubstrate followed by substrate.

TI  == cohabitation of two different lexa regulons in pseudomonas putida.
AB  == in contrast to the vast majority of the members of the domain bacteria, several pseudomonas and xanthomonas species have two lexa genes, whose products have been shown to recognize different lexa binding motifs, making them an interesting target for studying the interplay between cohabiting lexa regulons in a single species. here we report an analysis of the genetic composition of the two lexa regulons of pseudomonas putida kt2440 performed with a genomic microarray. the data obtained indicate that one of the two lexa proteins (lexa1) seems to be in control of the conventional escherichia coli-like sos response, while the other lexa protein (lexa2) regulates only its own transcriptional unit, which includes  the imua, imub, and dnae2 genes, and a gene (pp_3901) from a resident p. putida prophage. furthermore, pp_3901 is also regulated by lexa1 and is required for dna damage-mediated induction of several p. putida resident prophage genes. in silico searches suggested that this marked asymmetry in regulon contents also occurs in  other pseudomonas species with two lexa genes, and the implications of this asymmetry in the evolution of the sos network are discussed.

TI  == ultrasound-mediated dna transfer for bacteria.
AB  == in environmental microbiology, the most commonly used methods of bacterial dna transfer are conjugation and electroporation. however, conjugation requires physical contact and cell-pilus-cell interactions; electroporation requires low-ionic strength medium and high voltage. these limitations have hampered broad applications of bacterial dna delivery. we have employed a standard low frequency 40 khz ultrasound bath to successfully transfer plasmid pbbr1mcs2 into pseudomonas putida uwc1, escherichia coli dh5alpha and pseudomonas fluorescens sbw25 with high efficiency. under optimal conditions: ultrasound exposure time of 10 s, 50 mm cacl(2), temperature of 22 degrees c, plasmid concentration of 0.8 ng/microl, p. putida uwc1 cell concentration of 2.5 x 10(9) cfu (colony forming unit)/ml and reaction volume of 500 microl, the efficiency of ultrasound dna delivery (udd) was 9.8 +/- 2.3 x 10(-6) transformants per cell, which was nine times more efficient than conjugation, and even four times greater than electroporation. we have also transferred pbbr1mcs2 into e. coli dh5alpha and p.  fluorescens sbw25 with efficiencies of 1.16 +/- 0.13 x 10(-6) and 4.33 +/- 0.78 x 10(-6) transformants per cell, respectively. low frequency udd can be readily scaled up, allowing for the application of udd not only in laboratory conditions  but also on an industrial scale.

AB  == 1h-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline 2,4-dioxygenase (qdo) from pseudomonas putida 33/1 catalyses the oxygenolysis of 1h-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline to form n-formylanthranilic acid and carbon monoxide without the aid of cofactors. both n-terminally his6-tagged and native qdo were overexpressed in escherichia coli and purified by conventional chromatographic procedures. untagged qdo, but not his6-tagged qdo, was crystallized by the vapour-diffusion method, giving hexagonal bipyramid crystals belonging to space group p6(1)22. selenomethionine-containing native qdo was prepared and crystallized under identical conditions. the unit-cell parameters were a = b = 90.1, c = 168.6 a, alpha = beta = 90, gamma = 120 degrees. using synchrotron radiation, these crystals diffract to 2.5 a. the expression, purification and crystallization of qdo are reported here.

TI  == identification and properties of an inducible phenylacyl-coa dehydrogenase in pseudomonas putida kt2440.
AB  == a novel acyl-coa dehydrogenase that initiates beta-oxidation of the side chains of phenylacyl-coa compounds by pseudomonas putida was induced by growth with phenylhexanoate as carbon source. it was identified as the product of gene pp_0368, which was cloned and overexpressed in escherichia coli. this phenylacyl-coa dehydrogenase was found to be dimeric with a subunit molecular mass of 66 kda, to contain fad and to be active with phenylacyl-coa substrates having side chains from four to at least 11 carbon atoms. the same enzyme was induced by the aliphatic alkanoate octanoate. the optimal aliphatic substrates for the enzyme were palmitoyl-coa and stearoyl-coa, a property shared with mammalian very-long-chain acyl-coa dehydrogenases. the fad in the enzyme was reduced by aromatic and aliphatic substrates, with changes to the oxidation-reduction potential. chemical reduction by dithionite ion and oxidation by ferricyanide ion showed that the enzyme can accept four electrons: two to reduce the flavin and two to slowly reduce an unknown acceptor, which in its reduced form interacts with the oxidized flavin in a charge-transfer complex. the experiments identify for the first time an acyl-coa dehydrogenase that oxidizes the activated forms of aromatic acids similar to those used to first demonstrate  the biological beta-oxidation of fatty acids.

TI  == escherichia coli malate dehydrogenase, a novel solubility enhancer for heterologous proteins synthesized in escherichia coli.
AB  == using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the escherichia coli proteome response to a heat-shock stress was analyzed and a 1.6-fold increase of malate dehydrogenase was observed even under the heat-shock condition where the total number of soluble proteins decreased by about 5%. we subsequently demonstrated that, as an n-terminus fusion expression partner, malate dehydrogenase facilitated the folding of, and dramatically increased the solubility of, many aggregation-prone heterologous proteins in e. coli cytoplasm. therefore, malate dehydrogenase is well suited for production of a biologically active fusion mutant of cutinase (pseudomonas putida origin) that is currently of considerable  to biotechnology and commercial industries.

AB  == a gene-encoding imidase was isolated from pseudomonas putdia yz-26 genomic dna using a combination of polymerase chain reaction and activity screening the recombinant. analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed that an open reading frame (orf) of 879 bp encoded a protein of 293 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 33712.6 kda. the deduced amino-acid sequence showed 78% identity with the imidase from alcaligenes eutrophus 112r4 and 80% identity with  n-terminal 20 amino-acid imidase from blastobacter sp. a17p-4. next, the orf was  subcloned into vector pet32a to form recombinant plasmid pei. the enzyme was overexpressed in escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity by ni(2+)-nta column, with 75% activity recovery. the subunit molecular mass of the recombinant imidase as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was approximately 36 kda, whereas its functional unit was approximately 141 kda with four identical subunits determined by size-exclusion chromatography. the purified enzyme showed the highest activity and affinity toward succinimide, and  some other substrates, such as dihydrouracil, hydantoin, succinimide, and maleimde, were investigated.

AB  == a novel method eliminating dna-mediated pcr product formation in reverse transcription pcr (rt-pcr) amplification of specific rna sequences is described.  the method exploits the higher melting temperature values of peptide nucleic acid (pna)/dna duplexes compared with dna/dna duplexes by binding a sequence-specific  pna probe to a genomic sequence immediately overlapping one of the pcr-primer attachment sites within the sequence of interest. hybridization of the blocking probe precludes primer attachment to dna without affecting attachment of the same primer to the reverse transcription-generated cdna sequence. a four-step pcr cycle is used that allows the pna probe to hybridize to the dna strand at a higher temperature just prior to the primer annealing step.

TI  == model-based characterization of an amino acid racemase from pseudomonas putida dsm 3263 for application in medium-constrained continuous processes.
AB  == the amino acid racemase with broad substrate specificity from pseudomonas putida  dsm 3263 was overproduced and characterized with respect to application in an integrated multi-step process (e.g., dynamic kinetic resolution) that--theoretically--would allow for 100% chemical yield and 100% enantiomeric excess. overexpression of the racemase gene in escherichia coli delivered cell free extract with easily sufficient activity (20-50 u mg(-1) total protein) for application in an enzyme membrane reactor (emr) setting. model-based experimental analysis of a set of enzyme assays clearly indicated that racemization of the model substrates d- or l-methionine could be accurately described by reversible michaelis-menten kinetics. the corresponding kinetic parameters were determined from progress curves for the entire suitable set of aqueous-organic mixtures (up  to 60% methanol and 40% acetonitrile) that are eligible for an integrated process scheme. the resulting kinetic expression could be successfully applied to describe enzyme membrane reactor performance under a large variety of settings. model-based calculations suggested that a methanol content of 10% and an acetonitrile content of 20% provide maximum productivity in emr operations. however product concentrations were decreased in comparison to purely aqueous operation due to decreasing solubility of methionine with increasing organic solvent content. finally, biocatalyst stability was investigated in different solvent compositions following a model-based approach. buffer without organic content provided excellent stability at moderate temperatures (20-35 degrees c) while addition of 20% acetonitrile or methanol drastically reduced the half-life  of the racemase.

TI  == the transcriptional repressor ttgv recognizes a complex operator as a tetramer and induces convex dna bending.
AB  == the ttgv repressor belongs to the large but infrequently investigated iclr family of transcriptional regulators. although members of this family usually exhibit high effector specificity, ttgv possesses multidrug binding properties. the ttgv  protein regulates the expression of the ttgghi operon encoding the main solvent extrusion pump of the extremophile pseudomonas putida dot-t1e strain. here we used a multidisciplinary approach to study the functional oligomeric state of ttgv during repression and derepression events, as well as the molecular basis of ttgv-dna operator interactions. analytical ultracentrifugation studies (auc) show that ttgv is a tetramer in solution and that this oligomeric state does not change in the presence of effectors. we also show that the binding of effectors leads to the dissociation of ttgv as a tetramer from the dna-ttgv complex. previous dimethyl sulfate and dnase i footprints revealed that ttgv protected a 42 bp region. based on auc, electrophorectic mobility shift assays and isothermal titration calorimetry analyses we show that ttgv recognition specificity is restricted within this operator to a 34-nucleotide stretch and that ttgv may interact with intercalated inverted repeats that share no significant dna sequence similarities within this short 34-nucleotide segment. binding stoichiometry is one ttgv tetramer per operator, and affinity for its target dna  is around 200 nm. circular dichroism analysis reveals that ttgv binding causes dna distortion and atomic force microscopy imaging of ttgv-dna operator complexes shows that ttgv induces a 57 degrees convex bend in its operator dna. we propose  that the mechanism of ttgv repression is based on the steric occlusion of the rna polymerase binding site reinforced by dna-bending of the ttgv-ttgg promoter region.

TI  == isolation and endotoxin activities of lipopolysaccharides from cyanobacterial cultures and complex water blooms and comparison with the effects of heterotrophic bacteria and green alga.
AB  == massive cyanobacterial water blooms are serious environmental and health problems worldwide. while some cyanobacterial toxins such as peptide microcystins have been investigated extensively, other toxic components of cyanobacteria (e.g. lipopolysaccharides, lps) are poorly understood. the present study characterized  endotoxin activities of lps isolated from (i) laboratory cyanobacterial cultures, (ii) cyanobacterial water bloom samples dominated by microcystis sp., planktothrix sp., aphanizomenon sp. and anabaena sp., (iii) heterotrophic gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, kluyvera intermedia, pseudomonas putida  and pseudomonas fluorescens and (iv) green alga pseudokirchneriella subcapitata.  toxicity results derived with limulus amebocyte lysate assay (lal-test) showed that endotoxin activities of lps from both cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria were comparable and the values were within a similar range (1 x 10(3)-1  x 10(6) endotoxin units, eu, per mg of isolated lps). the highest activities among the cyanobacterial samples were observed in the aphanizomenon sp. dominated water bloom. the results also suggest generally higher endotoxin activities in complex natural samples than in laboratory cyanobacterial cultures. further, experiments with the eukaryotic green alga p. subcapitata demonstrated a need for careful purification of the lps extracts prior to testing with the lal assay as several contaminants may overestimate endotoxin activities. this study shows relatively high pyrogenicity of lps from various cyanobacteria. further research  should focus on detailed toxicological and ecotoxicological characterization of lps in massive cyanobacterial water blooms.

TI  == evaluation of genotoxicity and pro-oxidant effect of the azo dyes: acids yellow 17, violet 7 and orange 52, and of their degradation products by pseudomonas putida mt-2.
AB  == acids yellow 17, violet 7 and orange 52, very important commercial azo dyes used  in the textile, food, paper and cosmetic industries, were degraded by pseudomonas putida mt-2 at concentrations up to 100mg/l. the culture media was completely decolorized under static incubation for 60 h, this faster than under continuous shaking incubation. sos chromotest using escherichia coli pq37, with and without  metabolic activation (s-9 preparations), was used to assess genotoxicity potential of these dyes before and after biodegradation. none of these dyes or their metabolites was found to be genotoxic in the absence of "araclor-induced rat liver microsome" preparations (s-9). however, in presence of the preparation  s-9, the genotoxicity of the biodegradation products was highlighted. metabolites resulting from static cultures were more genotoxic than those obtained in shaken  conditions. in addition to genotoxic effects, metabolites have shown a significant ability to induce the formation of superoxide free radical anion (o(2)(*-)). the toxicities generated by the pure azo dyes and the pure azo-reduction products (sulfanilic acid, n,n'-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine and 4'-aminoacetanilid) were compared. these results suggest that p. putida mt-2 degrades the studied azo dyes in two steps: an azo-reduction followed by an oxygen-dependent metabolization. some of the derived metabolites would be responsible of genotoxicity and metabolic toxicity.

TI  == sampling for metabolome analysis of microorganisms.
AB  == in the present work we investigated the most commonly applied methods used for sampling of microorganisms in the field of metabolomics in order to unravel potential sources of error previously ignored but of utmost importance for accurate metabolome analysis. to broaden the significance of our study, we investigated different gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, i.e., bacillus subtilis, corynebacterium glutamicum, escherichia coli, gluconobacter oxydans, pseudomonas putida, and zymononas mobilis, and analyzed metabolites from different catabolic and anabolic intracellular pathways. quenching of cells with  cold methanol prior to cell separation and extraction led to drastic loss (>60%)  of all metabolites tested due to unspecific leakage. using fast filtration, gram-negative bacteria also revealed a significant loss (>80%) when inappropriate washing solutions with low ionic strength were applied. adapting the ionic strength of the washing solution to that of the cultivation medium could almost completely avoid this problem. gram-positive strains did not show significant leakage independent of the washing solution. fast filtration with sampling times  of several seconds prior to extraction appears to be a suitable approach for metabolites with relatively high intracellular level and low turnover such as amino acids or tca cycle intermediates. comparison of metabolite levels in the culture supernatant and the cell interior revealed that the common assumption of  whole broth quenching protocols attributing the metabolites found exclusively to  the intracellular pools may not be valid in many cases. in such cases a differential approach correcting for medium-contained metabolites is required.

AB  == our study focused on a mesorhizobium sp. that is phylogenetically affiliated by 16s rrna gene sequence to other marine and saline bacteria of this genus. liquid  chromatography-mass spectrometry investigations of the extract obtained from solid-phase extraction of cultures of this bacterium indicated the presence of several n-acyl homoserine lactones (ahls), with chain lengths of c(10) to c(16).  chromatographic separation of the active bacterial extract yielded extraordinarily large amounts of two unprecedented acylated homoserine lactones,  5-cis-3-oxo-c(12)-homoserine lactone (5-cis-3-oxo-c(12)-hsl) (compound 1) and 5-cis-c(12)-hsl (compound 2). quorum-sensing activity of compounds 1 and 2 was shown in two different biosensor systems [escherichia coli mt102(psb403) and pseudomonas putida f117(pkr-c12)]. furthermore, it was shown that both compounds  can restore protease and pyoverdin production of an ahl-deficient pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 lasi rhli double mutant, suggesting that these signal molecules maybe used for intergenus signaling. in conclusion, these data indicate that the  quorum-sensing activity of compounds 1 and 2 is modulated by the chain length and functional groups of the acyl moiety. additionally, compound 1 showed antibacterial and cytotoxic activities.

TI  == degradation of alkyl methyl ketones by pseudomonas veronii mek700.
AB  == pseudomonas veronii mek700 was isolated from a biotrickling filter cleaning 2-butanone-loaded waste air. the strain is able to grow on 2-butanone and 2-hexanol. the genes for degradation of short chain alkyl methyl ketones were identified by transposon mutagenesis using a newly designed transposon, mini-tn5495, and cloned in escherichia coli. dna sequence analysis of a 15-kb fragment revealed three genes involved in methyl ketone degradation. the deduced  amino acid sequence of the first gene, meka, had high similarity to baeyer-villiger monooxygenases; the protein of the second gene, mekb, had similarity to homoserine acetyltransferases; the third gene, mekr, encoded a putative transcriptional activator of the arac/xyls family. the three genes were  located between two gene groups: one comprising a putative phosphoenolpyruvate synthase and glycogen synthase, and the other eight genes for the subunits of an  atpase. inactivation of meka and mekb by insertion of the mini-transposon abolished growth of p. veronii mek700 on 2-butanone and 2-hexanol. the involvement of mekr in methyl ketone degradation was observed by heterologous expression of meka and mekb in pseudomonas putida. a fragment containing meka and mekb on a plasmid was not sufficient to allow p. putida kt2440 to grow on 2-butanone. not until all three genes were assembled in the recombinant p. putida was it able to use 2-butanone as carbon source. the baeyer-villiger monooxygenase activity of meka was clearly demonstrated by incubating a mekb transposon insertion mutant of p. veronii with 2-butanone. hereby, ethyl acetate was accumulated. to our knowledge, this is the first time that ethyl acetate by gas chromatographic analysis has been definitely demonstrated to be an intermediate of mek degradation. the mekb-encoded protein was heterologously expressed in e. coli and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. the protein exhibited high esterase activity towards short chain esters like ethyl acetate and 4-nitrophenyl acetate.

AB  == in the present study, samples of pond water, sediment and farmed species were collected at 12 fish and shrimp farms in malaysia, thailand and vietnam to determine the biodiversity and environmental distribution of chloramphenicol-resistant (cmr) mesophilic heterotrophs in southeast asian aquaculture sites. following isolation on iso-sensitest agar supplemented with 35mug ml(-1) cm and dereplication using (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprinting, 557 genotypically unique cmr strains were subjected to polyphasic identification. the 557 mesophilic heterotrophic cmr isolates represented 18 different genera largely dominated by the genera escherichia (40.2%), pseudomonas (11.7%), acinetobacter (11.1%), klebsiella (7.5%) and bacillus (5.9%). a total of 439 cmr isolates were  further assigned to 31 described species or species groups, mainly including organisms that have been associated with various human opportunistic infections such as escherichia coli (n=219), pseudomonas putida (n=47), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=38) and acinetobacter baumannii (n=23). strains of escherichia, and most notably, of e. coli, were the only common group of cmr heterotrophs irrespective of country, sample type or farm type. together with other predominant but less widespread groups such as acinetobacters and pseudomonads, the results of this biodiversity study suggest that e. coli can be regarded as a  potential indicator of cm resistance in southeast asian aquaculture environments.

TI  == characterization of a pseudomonad 2-nitrobenzoate nitroreductase and its catabolic pathway-associated 2-hydroxylaminobenzoate mutase and a chemoreceptor involved in 2-nitrobenzoate chemotaxis.
AB  == pseudomonas fluorescens strain ku-7 is a prototype microorganism that metabolizes 2-nitrobenzoate (2-nba) via the formation of 3-hydroxyanthranilate (3-haa), a known antioxidant and reductant. the initial two steps leading to the sequential  formation of 2-hydroxy/aminobenzoate and 3-haa are catalyzed by a nadph-dependent 2-nba nitroreductase (nbaa) and 2-hydroxylaminobenzoate mutase (nbab), respectively. the 216-amino-acid protein nbaa is 78% identical to a plasmid-encoded hypothetical conserved protein of polaromonas strain js666; structurally, it belongs to the homodimeric nadh:flavin mononucleotide (fmn) oxidoreductase-like fold family. structural modeling of complexes with the flavin, coenzyme, and substrate suggested specific residues contributing to the nbaa catalytic activity, assuming a ping-pong reaction mechanism. mutational analysis supports the roles of asn40, asp76, and glu113, which are predicted to form the binding site for a divalent metal ion implicated in fmn binding, and a role in nadph binding for the 10-residue insertion in the beta5-alpha2 loop. the  181-amino-acid sequence of nbab is 35% identical to the 4-hydroxylaminobenzoate lyases (pnbbs) of various 4-nitrobenzoate-assimilating bacteria, e.g., pseudomonas putida strain tw3. coexpression of nbab with nbaa in escherichia coli produced a small amount of 3-haa from 2-nba, supporting the functionality of the  nbab gene. we also showed by gene knockout and chemotaxis assays that nbay, a chemoreceptor nahy homolog located downstream of the nbaa gene, is responsible for strain ku-7 being attracted to 2-nba. nbay is the first chemoreceptor in nitroaromatic metabolism to be identified, and this study completes the gene elucidation of 2-nba metabolism that is localized within a 24-kb chromosomal locus of strain ku-7.

TI  == signal transduction pathway of tonb-dependent transporters.
AB  == transcription of the ferric citrate import system is regulated by ferric citrate  binding to the outer membrane transporter feca. a signal indicating transporter occupancy is relayed across the outer membrane to energy-transducing and regulatory proteins embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane. because transcriptional activation is not coupled to ferric citrate import, an allosteric mechanism underlies this complex signaling mechanism. using evolution-based statistical analysis we have identified a sparse but structurally connected network of residues that links distant functional sites in feca. functional analyses of these positions confirm their involvement in the mechanism that regulates transcriptional activation in response to ferric citrate binding at the cell surface. this mechanism appears to be conserved and provides the structural basis for the allosteric signaling of tonb-dependent transporters.

TI  == biochemical evidence that phaz gene encodes a specific intracellular medium chain length polyhydroxyalkanoate depolymerase in pseudomonas putida kt2442: characterization of a paradigmatic enzyme.
AB  == polyhydroxyalkanoates (phas) can be catabolized by many microorganisms using intra- or extracellular pha depolymerases. most of our current knowledge of these intracellular enzyme-coding genes comes from the analysis of short chain length pha depolymerases, whereas medium chain length pha (mcl-pha) intracellular depolymerization systems still remained to be characterized. the phaz gene of some pseudomonas putida strains has been identified only by mutagenesis and complementation techniques as putative intracellular mcl-pha depolymerase. however, none of their corresponding encoded phaz enzymes have been characterized in depth. in this study the phaz depolymerase from p. putida kt2442 has been purified and biochemically characterized after its overexpression in escherichia  coli. to facilitate these studies we have developed a new and very sensitive radioactive method for detecting pha hydrolysis in vitro. we have demonstrated that phaz is an intracellular depolymerase that is located in pha granules and that hydrolyzes specifically mcl-phas containing aliphatic and aromatic monomers. the enzyme behaves as a serine hydrolase that is inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. we have modeled the three-dimensional structure of phaz complexed with a 3-hydroxyoctanoate dimer. using this model, we found that the enzyme appears to be built up from a corealpha/beta hydrolase-type domain capped with a lid structure with an active site containing a catalytic triad buried near the connection between domains. all these data constitute the first biochemical characterization of phaz and allow us to propose this enzyme as the paradigmatic representative of intracellular endo/exo-mcl-pha depolymerases.

TI  == characterization of alkylphenol degradation gene cluster in pseudomonas putida mt4 and evidence of oxidation of alkylphenols and alkylcatechols with medium-length alkyl chain.
AB  == alkylphenols (aps) are ubiquitous contaminants in aquatic environments and have endocrine disrupting and toxic effects on aquatic organisms. to investigate biodegradation mechanisms of aps, an ap degradation gene cluster was cloned from  a butylphenol (bp)-degrading bacterium, pseudomonas putida mt4. the gene cluster  consisted of 13 genes named bupba1a2a3a4a5a6cehifg. from the nucleotide sequences, bupa1a2a3a4a5a6 were predicted to encode a multicomponent phenol hydroxylase (ph), whereas bupbcehifg were expected to encode meta-cleavage pathway enzymes. a partial sequence of a putative ntrc-type regulatory gene, bupr, was also found upstream of the gene bupb. this result indicates that aps can be initially oxidized into alkylcatechols (acs), followed by the meta-cleavage of the aromatic rings. to confirm this pathway, ap degradation tests were carried out using the recombinant p. putida kt2440 harboring the ph genes (bupa1a2a3a4a5a6). the recombinant strain oxidized 4-n-aps with an alkyl chain of up to c7 (< or = c7) efficiently and also several bps including those with an alkyl chain with some degree of branching. therefore, it was found that ph had a broad substrate specificity for aps with a medium-length alkyl chain (c3-c7). moreover, the cell extract of a recombinant escherichia coli harboring bupb (a catechol 2,3-dioxygenase gene) converted 4-n-acs with an alkyl chain of < or = c9 into yellow meta-cleavage products with a maximum absorbance at 379 nm, indicating that the second step enzyme in this pathway is also responsible for the degradation of acs with a medium-length alkyl chain. these results suggest that mt4 is a very useful strain in the biodegradation of a wide range of aps with a medium-length alkyl chain, which known nonylphenol-degrading sphingomonas  strains have never degraded.

AB  == four adjacent open reading frames, cytc1-c4, were cloned from a cytotrienin-producing strain of a streptomyces sp. by using primers derived from  the conserved region of a gene encoding a nonheme iron halogenase, cmab, in coronamic acid biosynthesis. cytc1-3 were active after expression in escherichia  coli, and cytc4 was active after expression in pseudomonas putida. cytc1, a relatively promiscuous adenylation enzyme, installs the aminoacyl moieties on the phosphopantetheinyl arm of the holo carrier protein cytc2. cytc3 is a nonheme iron halogenase that will generate both gamma-chloro- and gamma,gamma-dichloroaminobutyryl-s-cytc2 from aminobutyryl-s-cytc2. cytc4, a thioesterase, hydrolytically releases the dichloroaminobutyrate, a known streptomycete antibiotic. thus, this short four-protein pathway is likely the biosynthetic source of this amino acid antimetabolite. this four-enzyme system analogously converts the pros-methyl group of valine to the dichloromethyl product regio- and stereospecifically.

TI  == oxyr regulated the expression of two major catalases, kata and katb, along with peroxiredoxin, ahpc in pseudomonas putida.
AB  == oxyr is known to activate/repress the expression of the oxyr regulon, which consists of several genes, which play important antioxidant role in escherichia coli. to elucidate the role of oxyr in pseudomonas putida kt2442, the oxyr1 mutation that caused the upregulation of ahpc in a toluene-resistant variant strain was introduced, because no null mutants in oxyr were isolated. this mutation was shown to cause the accumulation of a catalase (kata) along with ahpc throughout the growth, and of a rpos-dependent catalase/peroxidase (katb) in the  stationary phase. following the identification of the transcription start site of two catalase genes, sequences similar to those involved in the proposed oxyr binding for e. coli were found upstream from each of the promoter regions of kata and katb, as well as ahpc. purified oxyr was shown to bind to these sequences, under both reduced and oxidized states. moreover, the oxyr1 mutation increased the transcription levels of these genes. these results are consistent with the conclusion, distinct from those observed in an opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa, that oxyr controlled expression of all the principal peroxide-degrading enzymes in p. putida. the mutation did not cause any notable changes in the transcriptional levels of several antioxidant genes, including those of glutathione reductase, glutaredoxins and thioredoxins, which would involve maintenance of the cellular thiol-disulfide balance, suggesting that the  transcriptional regulation of these antioxidant genes should be different from that of kata, katb and ahpc in p. putida.

TI  == effects of stress and other environmental factors on horizontal plasmid transfer  assessed by direct quantification of discrete transfer events.
AB  == selection pressure may affect the horizontal transfer of plasmids. the inability  to distinguish between gene transfer and the growth of transconjugants complicates testing. we have developed a method that enables the quantification of discrete transfer events. it uses large numbers of replicate matings (192 or 384) in microtiter wells and the counting of transfer-positive and transfer-negative wells. we applied the method to study the transfer of the incp1 plasmid pro103 between escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida strains. pro103 encodes resistance to mercury and tetracycline and partial degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-d). the results showed positive correlation between transfer and donor metabolic activity, and an optimal temperature for transfer of 29 degrees c. on stimulation of donor activity, the optimal temperature was decreased to 24.5 degrees c. hgcl(2) above 1.0 microg l(-1) negatively affected transfer, whereas 2,4-d up to 0.3 mm had no effect. the negative effect of mercury was shown to be a result of stressing of the recipient. no effects of mercury on transfer could be detected by traditional filter mating. thus, the method is superior to filter mating and, as the experimental design allows the manipulation of individual parameters, it is ideal for the assessment and comparison of effects of environmental factors on plasmid  transfer.

TI  == analysis of novel soluble chromate and uranyl reductases and generation of an improved enzyme by directed evolution.
AB  == most polluted sites contain mixed waste. this is especially true of the u.s. department of energy (doe) waste sites which hold a complex mixture of heavy metals, radionuclides, and organic solvents. in such environments enzymes that can remediate multiple pollutants are advantageous. we report here evolution of an enzyme, chrr6 (formerly referred to as y6), which shows a markedly enhanced capacity for remediating two of the most serious and prevalent doe contaminants,  chromate and uranyl. chrr6 is a soluble enzyme and reduces chromate and uranyl intracellularly. thus, the reduced product is at least partially sequestered and  nucleated, minimizing the chances of reoxidation. only one amino acid change, (tyr)128(asn), was responsible for the observed improvement. we show here that chrr6 makes pseudomonas putida and escherichia coli more efficient agents for bioremediation if the cellular permeability barrier to the metals is decreased.

TI  == biocatalytic conversion of avermectin into 4''-oxo-avermectin: discovery, characterization, heterologous expression and specificity improvement of the cytochrome p450 enzyme.
AB  == 4''-oxo-avermectin is a key intermediate in the manufacture of the insecticide emamectin benzoate from the natural product avermectin. seventeen streptomyces strains with the ability to oxidize avermectin to 4''-oxo-avermectin in a regioselective manner have been discovered, and the enzymes responsible for this  reaction were found to be cyps (cytochrome p450 mono-oxygenases). the genes for these enzymes have been cloned, sequenced and compared to reveal a new subfamily  of cyps. the biocatalytic enzymes have been overexpressed in escherichia coli, streptomyces lividans and solvent-tolerant pseudomonas putida strains using different promoters and vectors. fds (ferredoxins) and fres (ferredoxin:nadp(+) reductases) were also cloned from streptomyces coelicolor and biocatalytic streptomyces strains, and tested in co-expression systems to optimize the electron transport. subsequent studies showed that increasing the biocatalytic conversion levels to commercial relevance results in the production of several side products in significant amounts. chimaeric ema cyps were created by sequential rounds of genereassembly, a proprietary directed evolution method, and selected for improved substrate specificity by high-throughput screening.

TI  == proteins with ggdef and eal domains regulate pseudomonas putida biofilm formation and dispersal.
AB  == microbial biofilm formation often causes problems in medical and industrial settings, and knowledge about the factors that are involved in biofilm development and dispersion is useful for creating strategies to control the processes. in this report, we present evidence that proteins with ggdef and eal domains are involved in the regulation of biofilm formation and biofilm dispersion in pseudomonas putida. overexpression in p. putida of the escherichia  coli yedq protein, which contains a ggdef domain, resulted in increased biofilm formation. overexpression in p. putida of the e. coli yhjh protein, which contains an eal domain, strongly inhibited biofilm formation. induction of yhjh expression in p. putida cells situated in established biofilms led to rapid dispersion of the biofilms. these results support the emerging theme that ggdef-domain and eal-domain proteins are involved in regulating the transition of bacteria between a roaming lifestyle and a sessile biofilm lifestyle.

TI  == structure and function of the 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme from  the protocatechuate degradative pathway of agrobacterium radiobacter s2.
AB  == 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzymes participate in the protocatechuate branch of the 3-oxoadipate pathway of various aerobic bacteria. the gene encoding a 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme (pcab1s2) was cloned from a gene  cluster involved in protocatechuate degradation by agrobacterium radiobacter strain s2. this gene encoded for a 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme  of 353 amino acids - significantly smaller than all previously studied 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzymes. this enzyme, arcmle1, was produced in escherichia coli and shown to convert not only 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate but also 3-sulfomuconate. arcmle1 was purified as a his-tagged enzyme variant, and the basic catalytic constants for the conversion of 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate and 3-sulfomuconate were determined. in contrast, agrobacterium tumefaciens 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme 1 could not, despite 87% sequence identity to arcmle1, use 3-sulfomuconate as substrate.  the crystal structure of arcmle1 was determined at 2.2 a resolution. consistent with the sequence, it showed that the c-terminal domain, present in all other members of the fumarase ii family, is missing in arcmle1. nonetheless, both the tertiary and quaternary structures, and the structure of the active site, are similar to those of pseudomonas putida 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme. one principal difference is that arcmle1 contains an arg, as opposed to a trp, in the active site. this indicates that activation of the carboxylic nucleophile by a hydrophobic environment is not required for lactonization, unlike earlier proposals [yang j, wang y, woolridge em, arora v, petsko ga, kozarich jw & ringe d (2004) biochemistry43, 10424-10434]. we identified citrate  and isocitrate as noncompetitive inhibitors of arcmle1, and found a potential binding pocket for them on the enzyme outside the active site.

TI  == role of eukaryotic microbiota in soil survival and catabolic performance of the 2,4-d herbicide degrading bacteria cupriavidus necator jmp134.
AB  == cupriavidus necator (formerly ralstonia eutropha) jmp134, harbouring the catabolic plasmid pjp4, is the best-studied 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-d) herbicide degrading bacterium. a study of the survival and catabolic performance of strain jmp134 in agricultural soil microcosms exposed to high levels of 2,4-d was carried out. when c. necator jmp134 was introduced into soil  microcosms, the rate of 2,4-d removal increased only slightly. this correlated with the poor survival of the strain, as judged by 16s rrna gene terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) profiles, and the semi-quantitative detection of the pjp4-borne tfda gene sequence, encoding the first step in 2,4-d degradation. after 3 days of incubation in irradiated soil microcosms, the survival of strain jmp134 dramatically improved and the herbicide was completely removed. the introduction of strain jmp134 into native soil microcosms did not produce detectable changes in the structure of the bacterial community, as judged by 16s rrna gene t-rflp profiles, but provoked a transient increase of signals putatively corresponding to protozoa, as indicated by 18s rrna gene t-rflp profiling. accordingly, a ciliate able to feed on c. necator jmp134 could be isolated after soil enrichment. in native soil microcosms, c. necator jmp134 survived better than escherichia coli dh5alpha (pjp4) and similarly to pseudomonas putida kt2442 (pjp4), indicating that species specific factors control the survival of strains harbouring pjp4. the addition of cycloheximide to soil microcosms strongly improved survival of these three strains, indicating that the eukaryotic microbiota has a strong negative effect in bioaugmentation with catabolic bacteria.

TI  == biofilm formation and cellulose expression among diverse environmental pseudomonas isolates.
AB  == the ability to form biofilms is seen as an increasingly important colonization strategy among both pathogenic and environmental bacteria. a survey of 185 plant-associated, phytopathogenic, soil and river pseudomonas isolates resulted in 76% producing biofilms at the air-liquid (a-l) interface after selection in static microcosms. considerable variation in biofilm phenotype was observed, including waxy aggregations, viscous and floccular masses, and physically cohesive biofilms with continuously varying strengths over 1500-fold. calcofluor  epifluorescent microscopy identified cellulose as the matrix component in biofilms produced by pseudomonas asplenii, pseudomonas corrugata, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas marginalis, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas savastanoi and pseudomonas syringae isolates. cellulose expression and biofilm formation could be induced by the constitutively active wspr19 mutant of the cyclic-di-gmp-associated, ggdef domain-containing response regulator involved in  the p. fluorescens sbw25 wrinkly spreader phenotype and cellular aggregation in pseudomonas aeruginosa pa01. wspr19 could also induce p. putida kt2440, which otherwise did not produce a biofilm or express cellulose, as well as escherichia  coli k12 and salmonella typhimurium lt2, both of which express cellulose yet lack wspr homologues. statistical analysis of biofilm parameters suggest that biofilm  development is a more complex process than that simply described by the production of attachment and matrix components and bacterial growth. this complexity was also seen in multivariate analysis as a species-ecological habitat effect, underscoring the fact that in vitro biofilms are abstractions of those surface and volume colonization processes used by bacteria in their natural environments.

TI  == identification of novel benzoylformate decarboxylases by growth selection.
AB  == a growth selection system was established using pseudomonas putida, which can grow on benzaldehyde as the sole carbon source. these bacteria presumably metabolize benzaldehyde via the beta-ketoadipate pathway and were unable to grow  in benzoylformate-containing selective medium, but the growth deficiency could be restored by expression in trans of genes encoding benzoylformate decarboxylases.  the selection system was used to identify three novel benzoylformate decarboxylases, two of them originating from a chromosomal library of p. putida atcc 12633 and the third from an environmental-dna library. the novel p. putida enzymes bfdb and bfdc exhibited 83% homology to the benzoylformate decarboxylase  from p. aeruginosa and 63% to the enzyme mdlc from p. putida atcc 12633, whereas  the metagenomic bfdm exhibited 72% homology to a putative benzoylformate decarboxylase from polaromonas naphthalenivorans. bfdc was overexpressed in escherichia coli, and the enzymatic activity was determined to be 22 u/ml using benzoylformate as the substrate. our results clearly demonstrate that p. putida kt2440 is an appropriate selection host strain suitable to identify novel benzoylformate decarboxylase-encoding genes. in principle, this system is also applicable to identify a broad range of different industrially important enzymes, such as benzaldehyde lyases, benzoylformate decarboxylases, and hydroxynitrile lyases, which all catalyze the formation of benzaldehyde.

TI  == kinetics of 1,4-dioxane biodegradation by monooxygenase-expressing bacteria.
AB  == 1,4-dioxane is a probable human carcinogen, and an important emerging water contaminant. in this study, the biodegradation of dioxane by 20 bacterial isolates was evaluated, and 13 were found to be capable of transforming dioxane.  dioxane served as a growth substrate for pseudonocardia dioxanivorans cb1190 and  pseudonocardia benzenivorans b5, with yields of 0.09 g protein g dioxane(-1) and  0.03 g protein g dioxane(-1), respectively. cometabolic transformation of dioxane was observed for monooxygenase-expressing strains that were induced with methane, propane, tetrahydrofuran, or toluene including methylosinus trichosporium ob3b, mycobacterium vaccae job5, pseudonocardia k1, pseudomonas mendocina kr1, ralstonia pickettii pko1, burkholderia cepacia g4, and rhodococcus rr1. product toxicity resulted in incomplete dioxane degradation for many of the cometabolic reactions. brief exposure to acetylene, a known monooxygenase inhibitor, prevented oxidation of dioxane in all cases, supporting the hypothesis that monooxygenase enzymes participated in the transformation of dioxane by these strains. further, escherichia coli tg1/pbs(kan) containing recombinant plasmids derived from the toluene-2- and toluene-4-monooxygenases of g4, kr1 and pko1 were also capable of cometabolic dioxane transformation. dioxane oxidation rates measured at 50 mg/l ranged from 0.01 to 0.19 mg hr(-1) mg protein(-1) for the metabolic processes, 0.1-0.38 mg hr(-1) mg protein(-1) for cometabolism by the monooxygenase-induced strains, and 0.17-0.60 mg hr(-1) mg protein(-1) for the recombinant strains. dioxane was not degraded by m. trichosporium ob3b expressing particulate methane monooxygenase, pseudomonas putida mt-2 expressing a toluene side-chain monooxygenase, and pseudomonasjs150 and pseudomonas putida f1 expressing toluene-2,3-dioxygenases. this is the first study to definitively show the role of monooxygenases in dioxane degradation using several independent lines of evidence and to describe the kinetics of metabolic and cometabolic dioxane degradation.

TI  == necrotrophic growth of legionella pneumophila.
AB  == this study examined whether legionella pneumophila is able to thrive on heat-killed microbial cells (necrotrophy) present in biofilms or heat-treated water systems. quantification by means of plate counting, real-time pcr, and flow cytometry demonstrated necrotrophic growth of l. pneumophila in water after 96 h, when at least 100 dead cells are available to one l. pneumophila cell. compared to the starting concentration of l. pneumophila, the maximum observed necrotrophic growth was 1.89 log units for real-time pcr and 1.49 log units for plate counting. the average growth was 1.57 +/- 0.32 log units (n = 5) for real-time pcr and 1.14 +/- 0.35 log units (n = 5) for plate counting. viability staining and flow cytometry showed that the fraction of living cells in the l. pneumophila population rose from the initial 54% to 82% after 96 h. growth was measured on heat-killed pseudomonas putida, escherichia coli, acanthamoeba castellanii, saccharomyces boulardii, and a biofilm sample. gram-positive organisms did not result in significant growth of l. pneumophila, probably due to their robust cell wall structure. although necrotrophy showed lower growth yields compared to replication within protozoan hosts, these findings indicate that it may be of major importance in the environmental persistence of l. pneumophila. techniques aimed at the elimination of protozoa or biofilm from water systems will not necessarily result in a subsequent removal of l. pneumophila unless the  formation of dead microbial cells is minimized.

TI  == oxidative stress by biphenyl metabolites induces inhibition of bacterial cell separation.
AB  == cell-cell separation of a polychlorinated biphenyl (pcb)-degrading bacterium comamonas testosteroni tk102 was monitored by flow cytometry. when monohydroxy metabolites of biphenyl (bp) (2-hydroxybiphenyl and 3-hydroxybiphenyl) were added to the culture, cell-cell separation of strain tk102 was inhibited at stationary  phase. this inhibition was reproduced on non-pcb degrading bacteria such as pseudomonas putida ppy101 and escherichia coli mv1184, but was not observed on pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1. an opportunistic pathogen, p. aeruginosa pao1, produces exopolysaccharide, which is known to scavenge damaging chemicals such as reactive oxygen species (ros). the higher level of ros and lipid peroxidants were detected in the cells treated by monohydroxybiphenyls. fat-soluble vitamin e, which is a lipid radical scavenger, maintained bacterial cell separation during monohydroxybiphenyls treatment. our results demonstrated that intracellular oxidative stress played an important role in the inhibition of bacterial cell separation during bp metabolism. this study shows that metabolites of environmental pollutants, such as monohydroxylated bp, inhibit bacterial cell separation by oxidative stress.

TI  == genomic and functional analysis of the incp-9 naphthalene-catabolic plasmid nah7  and its transposon tn4655 suggests catabolic gene spread by a tyrosine recombinase.
AB  == the naphthalene-catabolic (nah) genes on the incompatibility group p-9 (incp-9) self-transmissible plasmid nah7 from pseudomonas putida g7 are some of the most extensively characterized genetic determinants for bacterial aerobic catabolism of aromatic hydrocarbons. in contrast to the detailed studies of its catabolic cascade and enzymatic functions, the biological characteristics of plasmid nah7 have remained unclear. our sequence determination in this study together with the previously deposited sequences revealed the entire structure of nah7 (82,232 bp). comparison of nah7 with two other completely sequenced incp-9 catabolic plasmids, pdtg1 and pww0, revealed that the three plasmids share very high nucleotide similarities in a 39-kb region encoding the basic plasmid functions (the incp-9 backbone). the backbone of nah7 is phylogenetically more related to that of pdtg1 than that of pww0. these three plasmids carry their catabolic gene clusters at different positions on the incp-9 backbone. all of the nah7-specified nah genes are located on a class ii transposon, tn4655. our analysis of the tn4655-encoded  site-specific recombination system revealed that (i) a novel tyrosine recombinase, tnpi, catalyzed both the intra- and intermolecular recombination between two copies of the atti site, (ii) the functional atti site was located within a 119-bp segment, and (iii) the site-specific strand exchange occurred within a 30-bp segment in the 41-bp core site. our results and the sequence data  of other naphthalene-catabolic plasmids, pdtg1 and pnd6-1, suggest a potential role of the tnpi-atti recombination system in the establishment of these catabolic plasmids.

TI  == in vivo drafting of single-chain antibodies for regulatory duty on the sigma54-promoter pu of the tol plasmid.
AB  == the identification of single-chain antibodies (scfvs) that interfere in vivo with the building of the complex that activate the prokaryotic, sigma54-dependent promoter pu of the catabolic tol plasmid pww0 is reported. to this end, a phage m13 library of scfvs was raised against the cognate prokaryotic enhancer-binding  activator, xylr. the scfv pool was then expressed intracellularly in a reporter pu-lacz strain of escherichia coli designed to permit formation of intramolecular disulphide bonds in cytoplasmic proteins. this strain allowed the assembly of functional scfvs and the direct testing of their activity on the pu promoter in vivo. specifically, genetic screening for lacz-minus colonies yielded a number of scfvs able to downregulate transcriptional output in live cells. two antibody clones were purified and shown to inhibit the activity of the same promoter in vitro as well. these scfvs targeted the dna-binding domain of xylr and its atp binding site respectively. this work provides a proof of principle that mimetic regulatory factors can be derived from an antibody repertoire that specifically interact with given transcriptional activators. as assembly of initiation complexes is stimulated or inhibited by regulatory proteins we argue that anti-xylr scfvs operate as bona fide transcriptional inhibitors of the pu promoter.

TI  == characterization of genes involved in the initial reactions of 4-chloronitrobenzene degradation in pseudomonas putida zwl73.
AB  == the genes encoding enzymes involved in the initial reactions during degradation of 4-chloronitrobenzene (4cnb) were characterized from the 4cnb utilizer pseudomonas putida zwl73, in which a partial reductive pathway was adopted. a dna fragment containing genes coding for chloronitrobenzene nitroreductase (cnba) and hydroxylaminobenzene mutase (cnbb) were pcr-amplified and subsequently sequenced. these two genes were actively expressed in escherichia coli, and recombinant e. coli cells catalyzed the conversion of 4cnb to 2-amino-5-chlorophenol, which is the ring-cleavage substrate in the degradation of 4cnb. phylogenetic analyses on  sequences of chloronitrobenzene nitroreductase and hydroxylaminobenzene mutase revealed that these two enzymes are closely related to the functionally identified nitrobenzene nitroreductase and hydroxylaminobenzene mutase from pseudomonas strains js45 and hs12. the nitroreductase from strain zwl73 showed a  higher specific activity toward 4cnb than nitrobenzene (approximately at a ratio  of 1.6:1 for the recombinant or 2:1 for the wild type), which is in contrast to the case where the nitroreductase from nitrobenzene utilizers pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes js45 with an apparently lower specific activity against 4cnb than nitrobenzene (0.16:1) [kadiyala et al. appl environ microbiol 69:6520-6526,  2003]. this suggests that the nitroreductase from 4-chloronitrobenzene utilizer p. putida zwl73 may have evolved to prefer chloronitrobenzene to nitrobenzene as  its substrate.

TI  == [cloning, sequence analysis and expression of alanine racemase gene in pseudomonas putida].
AB  == two distinct alanine racemase genes from pseudomonas putida 200 were cloned and sequenced. dadx encodes a peptide of 357 amino acids with a calculated molecular  weight of 38.82kda. the putative product of alr gene is a peptide of 409 amino acids with molecular weight of 44.182kda. a homology comparison revealed identities of 96.64%, 71.99%, 44.88% and 47.37% of the dadx alanine racemase to those from p. putida kt2440, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli, respectively. the amino acids sequence deduced from alr gene showed the homologies of 94.38%, 22.89%, 25.72% and 26.44% to those from the microorganisms above, respectively. two motifs believed essential to the enzyme activity are found both in dadx and alr, such as pyridoxal-5'-phosphate binding site. both dadx and alr were expressed in e. coli tg1. neither alanine racemase activity or serine racemase activity was detected in the host strain. only alanine racemase activity was found in e. coli tg1/pctd. but both e. coli tg1/pcta and tg1/pcba exhibit activity toward l-alanine and l-serine. transcription of alr gene in e. coli is independent from extraneous promoter, a result confirmed by the significant enzyme activity observed in the e. coli tg1/pcba, which indicates the presence of a possible promoter upstream the structure gene.

AB  == the acid-base and zn sorption properties of three bacteria, cupriavidus metallidurans ch34, pseudomonas putida atcc12633, and escherichia coli k12dh5alpha, were investigated through an original combination of extended x-ray  absorption fine structure (exafs) spectroscopy and equilibrium titration studies. acid-base titration curves of the three strains were fitted with a model accounting for three conceptual reactive sites: an acidic (carboxyl and/or phosphodiester), a neutral (phosphomonoester), and a basic (amine and/or hydroxyl) group. calculated proton and zn equilibrium constants and site densities compare with literature data. the nature of zn binding sites was studied by exafs spectroscopy. phosphoester, carboxyl, and unexpectedly sulfhydryl ligands were identified. their proportions depended on zn loading and  bacterial strain and were consistent with the titration results. these findings were compared to the structure and site density of the major cell wall components. it appeared that the cumulated theoretical site density of these structures (<2 zn nm(-2)) was much lower than the total site density of the investigated strains (16-56 zn nm(-2)). these results suggest a dominant role of  extracellular polymeric substances in zn retention processes, although zn binding to inner cell components cannot be excluded.

TI  == expression, crystallization and preliminary diffraction studies of the pseudomonas putida cytochrome p450cam operon repressor camr.
AB  == the pseudomonas putida cam repressor (camr) is a homodimeric protein that binds to the camo dna operator to inhibit the transcription of the cytochrome p450cam operon camdcab. camr has two functional domains: a regulatory domain and a dna-binding domain. the binding of the inducer d-camphor to the regulatory domain renders the dna-binding domain unable to bind camo. native camr and its selenomethionyl derivative have been overproduced in escherichia coli and purified. native camr was crystallized under the following conditions: (i) 12-14% peg 4000, 50 mm na pipes, 0.1 m kcl, 1% glycerol ph 7.3 at 288 k with and without camphor and (ii) 1.6 m p(i), 50 mm na pipes, 2 mm camphor ph 6.7 at 278 k. the selenomethionyl derivative camr did not crystallize under either of these conditions, but did crystallize using 12.5% peg mme 550, 25 mm na pipes, 2.5 mm mgcl2 ph 7.3 at 298 k. preliminary x-ray diffraction studies revealed the space group to be orthorhombic (p2(1)2(1)2), with unit-cell parameters a = 48.0, b = 73.3, c = 105.7 a. native and selenomethionyl derivative data sets were collected to 3 a resolution at spring-8 and the photon factory.

TI  == the upstream-activating sequences of the sigma54 promoter pu of pseudomonas putida filter transcription readthrough from upstream genes.
AB  == although the m-xylene-responsive sigma54 promoter pu of pseudomonas putida mt-2,  borne by the tol plasmid pwwo, is one of the strongest known promoters in vivo, its base-line level in the absence of its aromatic inducer is below the limit of  any detection procedure. this is unusual because regulatory networks (such as the one to which pu belongs) can hardly escape the noise caused by intrinsic fluctuations in background transcription, including that transmitted from upstream promoters. this study provides genetic evidence that the upstream-activating sequences (uas), which serve as the binding sites for the pww0-encoded xylr protein (the m-xylene-responsive sigma54-dependent activator of pu), isolate expression of the upper tol genes from any adventitious transcriptional flow originating further upstream. an in vivo test system was developed in which different segments of the pu promoter were examined for the inhibition of incoming transcription products from an upstream promoter in p. putida and escherichia coli. minimal transcription filter ability was located within a 105-bp fragment encompassing the uas of pu. although s1 nuclease assays  showed that the uas prevented the buildup of downstream transcripts, the mechanism seems to diverge from a typical termination system. this was shown by the fact that the uas did not halt transcription in vitro and that the filter effect could not be relieved by the anti-termination system of lambda phage. because the pu promoter lies adjacent to the edge of a transposon in pww0, the preset transcriptional filter in the uas may isolate the upper tol operon from undue expression after random insertion of the mobile genetic element in a new replicon.

TI  == a quantitative assay for linking microbial community function and structure of a  naphthalene-degrading microbial consortium.
AB  == a comprehensive culture-independent assay, called q-fast, was developed for concurrent identification and quantification of active microorganisms involved a  specific function in a given microbial community. the development of q-fast was achieved by integrating the concept of stable isotope probing technique into a new quantitative fingerprinting assay called real-time-t-rflp for microbial community structure analysis. the q-fast was successfully validated by using a three-member artificial microbial community containing a known naphthalene-utilizing bacterium (pseudomonas putida g7) and two nonnaphthalene-degrading bacteria (escherichia coli and bacillus thuringiensis).  the application of q-fast to identify and quantify a guild of naphthalene-utilizing microorganisms in soils revealed the involvement of eight members, with six members relating to several phylogenetic groups of eubacteria (three in beta-proteobacteria, two in gamma-proteobacteria, and one in genera intrasporangium of gram-positive bacteria) and two members showing no close phylogenetic affiliation to any known bacterial sequences deposited in genbank. the quantity of three members belonging to beta-proteobacteria accounted for 34%  of total 16s rdna copies measured from the "heavier" fraction of dna that was contributed from the dna of microorganisms capable of incorporating 13c-labeled naphthalene into their genetic biomarkers. the other five members composed 66% of total 16s rdna copies of active naphthalene-utilizing populations measured. offering a powerful tool for studying microbial ecology, q-fast thus opens a new  avenue for deeper exploration of microbial-mediated processes, mainly the quantitative relationship between microbial diversity and microbial activity in a given environment.

TI  == reconstitution of the enzyme aroa and its glyphosate tolerance by fragment complementation.
AB  == 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (epsp) synthase (aroa) is a key enzyme in the  aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathway in microorganisms and plants, and is the target of the herbicide glyphosate. glyphosate tolerance activity of the enzyme could be obtained by natural occurrence or by site-directed mutagenesis. a functional pseudomonas putida aroa was obtained by co-expression of two protein fragments aroa(p. putida)-n210 and aroa(p. putida)-c212 in escherichia coli aroa  mutant strain ab2829. from sequence analysis, the equivalent split site on e. coli aroa was chosen for further study. the result indicated that functional e. coli aroa could also be reconstituted from two protein fragments aroa(e. coli)-n218 and aroa(e. coli)-c219, under both in vivo and in vitro conditions. this result suggested that the fragment complementation property of this family of enzyme may be general. additional experiments indicated that the glyphosate tolerance property of aroa could also be reconstituted in parallel with its enzyme activity. the implication of this finding is discussed.

TI  == metabolic engineering of the e. coli l-phenylalanine pathway for the production of d-phenylglycine (d-phg).
AB  == d-phenylglycine (d-phg) is an important side chain building block for semi-synthetic penicillins and cephalosporins such as ampicillin and cephalexin.  to produce d-phg ultimately from glucose, metabolic engineering was applied. starting from phenylpyruvate, which is the direct precursor of l-phenylalanine, an artificial d-phg biosynthesis pathway was created. this three-step route is composed of the enzymes hydroxymandelate synthase (hmas), hydroxymandelate oxidase (hmo), and the stereoinverting hydroxyphenylglycine aminotransferase (hpgat). together they catalyse the conversion of phenylpyruvate via mandelate and phenylglyoxylate to d-phg. the corresponding genes were obtained from amycolatopsis orientalis, streptomyces coelicolor, and pseudomonas putida. combined expression of these activities in e. coli strains optimized for the production of l-phenylalanine resulted in the first completely fermentative production of d-phg.

TI  == cloning and functional characterization of the stye gene, involved in styrene transport in pseudomonas putida ca-3.
AB  == a 1.5-kb region immediately downstream of the styabcd operon involved in styrene  degradation in pseudomonas putida ca-3 has been cloned. sequence analysis revealed a 1,296-bp open reading frame, designated stye, and blast p database comparisons of the deduced stye amino acid sequence revealed 33 to 98% identity with several membrane-associated atpase-dependent kinase proteins involved in the active transport of aromatic hydrocarbons across bacterial membranes and also with fadl, an outer membrane protein necessary for the uptake of long-chain fatty acids in escherichia coli. transcription of stye is styrene dependent, and the gene is cotranscribed with the styabcd structural genes. stye appears to be membrane associated, with a corresponding 45.9-kda band being identified following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of membrane preparations from styrene-grown cells. p. putida ca-3 cells in which the stye gene had been interrupted were no longer capable of growth on styrene. in contrast, overexpression of stye in p. putida ca-3 resulted in a 4.2-fold increase in styrene monooxygenase activity compared with wild-type cells grown on styrene, with a concomitant 8-fold increase in stya mrna transcript levels. experiments with the classic, atpase inhibitor vanadate revealed that growth of wild-type cells on styrene was inhibited at a concentration of 1 mm, while 1.75 mm was required to achieve a similar effect in the stye overexpression strain. growth of either strain on citrate was not inhibited in the presence of up to 7 mm vanadate. these findings suggest a role for stye in the active transport of styrene in pseudomonas putida ca-3 and identify styrene transport as a potentially limiting factor with respect to mrna transcript levels and associated enzymatic activity of the styrene degradative pathway.

AB  == a cytochrome p450cam monooxygenase (p450cam) system from the soil bacterium pseudomonas putida requires electron transfer among three different proteins and  a cofactor, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nadh), for oxygenation of its natural substrate, camphor. herein, we report a facile way to significantly enhance the catalytic efficiency of the p450cam system by the coupling of its native electron transfer system with enzymatic nadh regeneration catalyzed by glycerol dehydrogenase (gld) in escherichia coli whole cell biocatalysts. recombinant e. coli harboring the p450cam system, but lacking gld, exhibited little activity for camphor hydroxylation. in contrast, coexpression of gld with  the proteinaceous electron transfer components of p450cam resulted in about tenfold improvement in the substrate conversion, implying that the whole cell biocatalyst utilized molecular oxygen, endogenous nadh, and glycerol in the cell  for catalysis. the addition of glycerol to the reaction media further promoted camphor hydroxylation, suggesting that exogenous glycerol is also available for gld in the host cell and actively participates in the catalytic cycle. these results clearly show the utility of gld towards functional reconstruction of the  native p450cam system. the present approach may also be useful for e. coli whole  cell biocatalysts with the other nadh-dependent oxygenases and oxidoreductases.

TI  == regulation of superoxide stress in pseudomonas putida kt2440 is different from the soxr paradigm in escherichia coli.
AB  == in escherichia coli, the soxr regulon orchestrates genes for defense against certain types of oxidative stress through the soxr-regulated synthesis of the soxs transcription activator. the pseudomonas putida genome did not reveal a clear soxs homolog. the p. putida soxr protein appears to be functional: its expression in an e. coli deltasoxr strain restored the paraquat inducibility of soxs. of nine candidate p. putida oxidative stress genes, which are known to be soxr regulon in e. coli, tested for response to superoxide or nitric oxide, fumc-1, soda, zwf-1, and particularly fpr, encoding ferredoxin:nadp(+) reductase, were induced, all independent of p. putida soxr. disruption of the fpr and finr,  a regulatory protein that is required for paraquat-dependent expression of the fpr, resulted in more oxidative stress sensitivity. however, a p. putida soxr-deletion strain had normal resistance to the superoxide-generating agent paraquat. the data presented here show that the genetic responses to superoxide stress in p. putida differ markedly from those seen in e. coli and salmonella, and the role of p. putida soxr remains to be established.

TI  == biofilm formation by escherichia coli is stimulated by synergistic interactions and co-adhesion mechanisms with adherence-proficient bacteria.
AB  == laboratory strains of escherichia coli do not show significant ability to attach  to solid surfaces and to form biofilms. we compared the adhesion properties of the e. coli phl565 laboratory strain to eight environmental e. coli isolates: only four isolates displayed adhesion properties to glass significantly higher than phl565. the ability of the adhesion-proficient isolates to attach to glass tubes strongly correlated with their ability to express curli (thin aggregative fimbriae), thus suggesting that curli are a common adhesion determinant in environmental strains. despite its inability to attach to solid surfaces, growth  of e. coli phl565 in mixed cultures with pseudomonas putida mt2 resulted in co-adhesion and in formation of a mixed e. coli/p. putida biofilm, which was able to colonize glass surfaces with dramatic efficiency compared to p. putida alone.  e. coli/p. putida interactions stimulate initial adhesion to glass, and the presence of both bacterial species in the mature biofilm was confirmed by quantitative pcr. in contrast, no synergistic biofilm formation was observed in mixed cultures of e. coli with the gram-positive bacterium staphylococcus epidermidis. interestingly, e. coli phl565 also stimulated biofilm formation by bacterial communities isolated from drinking water distribution systems. our results strongly suggest that co-adhesion and synergistic interaction with biofilm-forming species might represent an important mechanism, and a possible alternative strategy to production of adhesion determinants, for persistence and  propagation of e. coli in the environment.

(r)-phenyl ethyl acetate was successfully produced with 41.9% conversion and an enantiomeric excess of more than 99% in a 36-h reaction. these  results suggest that the oprf anchor can be used for efficient display of proteins in p. putida kt2442 and consequently for various biocatalytic applications.

AB  == cyp175a1 is a thermostable p450 monooxygenase from thermus thermophilus hb27, demonstrating in vivo activity towards beta-carotene. activity of cyp175a1 was reconstituted in vitro using artificial electron transport proteins. first results were obtained in the mixture with a crude escherichia coli cell extract at 37 degrees c. in this system, beta-carotene was hydroxylated to beta-cryptoxanthin. the result indicated the presence of electron transport enzymes among the e. coli proteins, which are suitable for cyp175a1. however, upon in vitro reconstitution of cyp175a1 activity with purified recombinant flavodoxin and flavodoxin reductase from e. coli, only very low beta-cryptoxanthin production was observed. remarkably, with another artificial electron transport system, putidaredoxin and putidaredoxin reductase from pseudomonas putida, purified cyp175a1 enzyme hydroxylated beta-carotene at 3- and also 3'-positions, resulting in beta-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin. under the optimal reaction conditions, the turnover rate of the enzyme reached 0.23 nmol beta-cryptoxanthin produced per nmol p450 per min.

TI  == vitellogenin is a novel player in defense reactions.

TI  == quenched autoligation probes allow discrimination of live bacterial species by single nucleotide differences in rrna.
AB  == quenched autoligation (qual) probes are a class of self-reacting nucleic acid probes that give strong fluorescence signal in the presence of fully complementary rnas and selectivity against single nucleotide differences in solution. here, we describe experiments designed to test whether qual probes can  discriminate between bacterial species by the detection of small differences in their 16s rrna sequences. probes were introduced into live cells using small amounts of detergent, thus eliminating the need for fixation, and fluorescence signal was monitored both by microscopy and by flow cytometry without any washing steps. the effects of probe length, modified backbone, probe concentration and growth state of the bacteria were investigated. the data demonstrate specific fluorescence discrimination between three closely related bacteria, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica and pseudomonas putida, based on single nucleotide differences in their 16s rrna. discrimination was possible with cells in mid-log  phase or in lag phase. these results suggest that qual probes may be useful for rapid identification of microorganisms in laboratory and clinical settings.

TI  == survival curves for microbial species stored by freeze-drying.
AB  == the survival of a variety of species of microorganism following storage for up to 20 years has been analyzed. the organisms were freeze-dried, sealed in ampoules under vacuum (<1 pa) and stored in the dark at 5 degrees c. the yeast that was tested, saccharomyces cerevisiae, showed only 8% survival when recovered shortly  after freeze-drying, but subsequent loss during storage was the least among all the tested microorganisms. the decrease in the logarithm of survival per year (log survival) was -0.010, which corresponds to a survival rate of 97.7% per year. the gram-negative bacteria tested, escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, and enterobacter cloacae, showed 42.6, 33.5, and 50.8% survival shortly after freeze-drying, which was higher than the corresponding survival of s. cerevisiae, but the subsequent loss during storage was greater than s. cerevisiae, the log survival figures being -0.041, -0.058, and -0.073 per year. these values correspond to survival rates of 91.0, 87.5, and 84.5% each year. the gram-positive bacteria tested, lactobacillus acidophilus and enteroccoccus faecium, showed 62.5 and 85.2% survival shortly after freeze-drying, which was even higher than that of the gram-negative species, and these organisms also showed better survival during storage than gram-negative bacteria; their log survival rates were -0.018 and -0.016 per year, which corresponded to survival rates of almost 96% per year. comparison of these results with other published data for different drying conditions suggests that survival during storage is strongly influenced by the degree of vacuum under which the ampoules were sealed. the excellent survival after freeze-drying of each species might be attributable  to the high level of desiccation and to sealing under vacuum.

TI  == suitability of recombinant escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida strains for selective biotransformation of m-nitrotoluene by xylene monooxygenase.
AB  == escherichia coli jm101(pspz3), containing xylene monooxygenase (xmo) from pseudomonas putida mt-2, catalyzes specific oxidations and reductions of m-nitrotoluene and derivatives thereof. in addition to reactions catalyzed by xmo, we focused on biotransformations by native enzymes of the e. coli host and their effect on overall biocatalyst performance. while m-nitrotoluene was consecutively oxygenated to m-nitrobenzyl alcohol, m-nitrobenzaldehyde, and m-nitrobenzoic acid by xmo, the oxidation was counteracted by an alcohol dehydrogenase(s) from the e. coli host, which reduced m-nitrobenzaldehyde to m-nitrobenzyl alcohol. furthermore, the enzymatic background of the host reduced  the nitro groups of the reactants resulting in the formation of aromatic amines,  which were shown to effectively inhibit xmo in a reversible fashion. host-intrinsic oxidoreductases and their reaction products had a major effect on  the activity of xmo during biocatalysis of m-nitrotoluene. p. putida dot-t1e and  p. putida pps81 were compared to e. coli jm101 as alternative hosts for xmo. these promising strains contained an additional dehydrogenase that oxidized m-nitrobenzaldehyde to the corresponding acid but catalyzed the formation of xmo-inhibiting aromatic amines at a significantly lower level than e. coli jm101.

AB  == the influence of incubation time on the electrokinetic properties of escherichia  coli, pseudomonas putida, alcaligenes faecalis, and alcaligenes sp., was examined by electrophoretic mobility measurements and the results were discussed based on  ohshima's soft particle theory. the electrophoretic mobility of e. coli plotted against incubation time revealed that the mobility gradually increased from the outset of incubation to 7 h, which corresponded to the exponential growth and early stationary phase, and then decreased. for all strains, electrophoretic mobility leveled off to nonzero values in accordance with the increase in ionic concentration, which was a characteristic feature of soft particles. soft particle analysis was carried out at the outset of incubation and the time when mobility reached a maximum in order to obtain the spatial charge density (zn) and cell surface softness (1/lambda). zn at the maximum electrophoretic mobility was  more negative than that at the outset of incubation for e. coli, p. putida, and a. faecalis, while the zn of alcaligenes sp. almost remained unchanged. 1/lambda  decreased for e. coli, but increased for alcaligenes sp. and a. faecalis. these findings indicated that the cell growth phase affects both zn and 1/lambda, although the dependencies of these parameters are unique to each bacterial strain.

TI  == rna polymerase holoenzymes can share a single transcription start site for the pm promoter. critical nucleotides in the -7 to -18 region are needed to select between rna polymerase with sigma38 or sigma32.
AB  == the pm promoter of the benzoate meta-cleavage pathway is transcribed with e sigma32 or e sigma38 according to the growth phase, with an identical transcriptional start site. to investigate sequence determinants in the interaction between either of the two rna polymerases and pm, all possible single mutants between positions -7 and -18 were generated, and the activity in the exponential and stationary phases of the resulting mutant promoters was compared. the results precisely delimited a -10 element between positions -7 and -12 (taggct), which defined a promoter sharing nucleotides with both sigma38 and sigma32 consensus. the first two and the last positions of this hexamer were crucial for recognition by both polymerases. position -10 was the only one specifically recognized by e sigma38, whereas positions -8, -9, and the c-track between positions -14 and -17 were important for specific e sigma32 recognition.  western blots showed that sigma32 was only detectable in the exponential phase, and sigma38 appeared in the early stationary phase. in the rpoh mutant ky1429, sigma38 was already present in the exponential growth phase both free and bound to the rna polymerase core, in good correlation with the transcription levels found. pm seems to be optimized for recognition by sigma32 as an initial response to the addition of effector to the medium and allows binding of the adaptable sigma38-dependent rna polymerase in the stationary phase. xyls is always required for pm transcription. therefore, the mechanism that controls pm expression involves specific nucleotide sequences, the abundance of free and core-bound sigma32 and sigma38 factors during growth, and the presence of the regulator activated by an effector.

AB  == reporter gene-based transcriptional fusions are increasingly being used to address questions in microbial ecology, with constitutively expressed fusions enabling microbe tracking and inducible fusions reporting the presence of environmental signals. to more readily apply this technology to a variety of bacterial species, we examined species specificity in the expression of three promoters of interest. a comparison of two potentially constitutive promoters, each fused to the reporter gene gfp, showed that the nptii promoter (p(nptii)) was expressed in a broader range of species (100% of 11 tested) than the lacz promoter (p(lacz)) (75% of 11 tested), and thus has broader applicability for marking bacteria than p(lacz). for the species that expressed p(lacz), however,p(lacz) was expressed 3-fold more than p(nptii), on average. the escherichia coli prou promoter, which is induced by low water potential in e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, pantoea agglomerans, and pseudomonas syringae, was  shown to be similarly responsive to water potential in strains of clavibacter michiganensis, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, and sinorhizobium meliloti, as well as mildly osmoresponsive in agrobacterium tumefaciens, supporting its broad use as a reporter of water potential. surprisingly, this promoter was not regulated by water potential in strains of staphylococcus aureus and erwinia amylovora, illustrating heretofore unrecognized species specificity in prou inducibility, as well as potential limitations in the species that can serve as bioreporters of water potential.

TI  == transmembrane transcriptional control (surface signalling) of the escherichia coli fec type.
AB  == the ferric citrate transport system of escherichia coli is the first example of a transcription initiation mechanism that starts at the cell surface. the inducer,  ferric citrate, binds to an outer membrane transport protein, and without further transport elicits a signal that is transmitted across the outer membrane, the periplasm, and the cytoplasmic membrane into the cytoplasm. signal transfer across the three subcellular compartments is mediated by the outer membrane transport protein that interacts in the periplasm with a cytoplasmic transmembrane protein. the latter is required for activation of a sigma factor which belongs to the extracytoplasmic function sigma factor family. a similar kind of transcription regulation has been demonstrated in pseudomonas putida, p.  aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, aerobacter aerogenes, bordetella pertussis, b. bronchseptica, b. avium, and ralstonia solanacearum. the genomes of p. putida, p. aeruginosa, nitrosomonas europaea, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and caulobacter crescentus predict the existence of many more such transcriptional regulatory devices.

TI  == crystal structure of nitrogen regulatory protein iiantr from neisseria meningitidis.
AB  == background: the nmb0736 gene of neisseria meningitidis serogroup b strain mc58 encodes the putative nitrogen regulatory protein, iiantr (abbreviated to nm-iiantr). the homologous protein present in escherichia coli is implicated in the control of nitrogen assimilation. as part of a structural proteomics approach to the study of pathogenic neisseria spp., we have selected this protein for structure determination by x-ray crystallography. results: the nm-iiantr was over-expressed in e. coli and was shown to be partially mono-phosphorylated, as assessed by mass spectrometry of the purified protein. crystals of un-phosphorylated protein were obtained and diffraction data collected to 2.5 a resolution. the structure of nm-iiantr was solved by molecular replacement using  the coordinates of the e. coli nitrogen regulatory protein iiantr [pdb: 1a6j] as  the starting model. the overall fold of the neisseria enzyme shows a high degree  of similarity to the iiantr from e. coli, and the position of the phosphoryl acceptor histidine residue (h67) is conserved. the orientation of an adjacent arginine residue (r69) suggests that it may also be involved in coordinating the  phosphate group. comparison of the structure with that of e. coli iiamtl complexed with hpr [pdb: 1j6t] indicates that nm-iiantr binds in a similar way to the hpr-like enzyme in neisseria. conclusion: the structure of nm-iiantr confirms its assignment as a homologue of the iiantr proteins found in a range of other gram-negative bacteria. we conclude that the nm- iiantr protein functions as part of a phosphorylation cascade which, in contrast to e. coli, shares the upstream phosphotransfer protein with the sugar uptake phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (pts), but in common with e. coli has a distinct downstream effector mechanism.

TI  == an artificial electron donor supported catalytic cycle of pseudomonas putida cytochrome p450cam.
AB  == putidaredoxin (pdx), the physiological effector of cytochrome p450cam (p450cam),  serves to gate electron transfer into oxy-p450cam during the catalytic cycle of the enzyme. redox-linked structural changes in pdx are necessary for the effective p450cam turnover reaction. pdx is believed to be difficult to be replaced by an artificial electron donor in the reaction pathway of p450cam. we demonstrate that the catalytic cycle of wild-type p450cam can be supported in the presence of an artificial reductant, potassium ferrocyanide. upon rapid mixing of ferrocyanide ion with p450cam, we observed an intermediate with spectral features characteristic of compound i. the rate constant for the formation of compound i in the presence of ferrocyanide supported reaction cycle was found to be comparable to the ones observed for h2o2 supported compound i formation in wild-type p450cam, but was much lower than those observed for classical peroxidases. the results presented in this paper form the first kinetic analysis  of this intermediate for an artificial electron-driven p450cam catalytic pathway  in solution.

TI  == reaction mechanisms of non-heme diiron hydroxylases characterized in whole cells.
AB  == whole cells expressing the non-heme diiron hydroxylases alkb and toluene 4-monooxygenase (t4mo) were used to probe enzyme reaction mechanisms. alkb catalyzes the hydroxylation of the radical clock substrates bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane (norcarane), spirooctane and 1,1-diethylcyclopropane, and does not catalyze the hydroxylation of the radical clocks 1,1-dimethylcyclopropane or 1,1,2,2-tetramethylcyclopropane. the hydroxylation of norcarane yields a distribution of products consistent with an "oxygen-rebound" mechanism for the enzyme in both the wild type pseudomonas putida gpo1 and alkb from p. putida gpo1 expressed in escherichia coli. evidence for the presence of a substrate-based radical during the reaction mechanism is clear. with norcarane, the lifetime of that radical varies with experimental conditions. experiments with higher substrate concentrations yield a shorter radical lifetime (approximately 1 ns), while experiments with lower substrate concentrations yield a longer radical lifetime (approximately 19 ns). consistent results were obtained using either wild type or alkb-equipped host organisms using either "resting cell" or "growing cell" approaches. t4mo expressed in e. coli also catalyzes the hydroxylation of norcarane with a radical lifetime of approximately 0.07 ns. no radical lifetime dependence on substrate concentration was seen. results from experiments with diethylcyclopropane, spirooctane, dimethylcyclopropane, and diethylcyclopropane are consistent with a restricted active site for alkb.

TI  == ability of incp-9 plasmid pm3 to replicate in escherichia coli is dependent on both rep and par functions.
AB  == incp-9 plasmids are common in pseudomonas species and can be transferred to other gram-negative eubacteria but tend not to be stably maintained outside their natural host genus. a 1.3 kb ori v-rep fragment from incp-9 plasmid pm3 was sufficient for autonomous replication in pseudomonas putida but not in escherichia coli. replication of ori v-rep in e. coli was restored when additional rep was provided in trans, suggesting that the replication defect resulted from insufficient rep expression from its natural promoter. a promoter deficiency in e. coli was confirmed by reporter gene assays, transcriptional start point mapping and mutation of the promoter recognition elements. dissection of the pm3 mini-replicon, pmt2, showed that this replication deficiency in e. coli is suppressed by additional determinants from its par operon: parb, which can be supplied in trans, and its target, the par operon promoter, required in cis to ori v-rep. we propose that parb binding to its target either changes plasmid dna and thus promoter conformation or by spreading or looping contacts rnap at the rep promoter so that rep expression is sufficient to activate ori v.

TI  == an improved method for single cell isolation of prokaryotes from meso-, thermo- and hyperthermophilic environments using micromanipulation.
AB  == this study presents an improved system that enables isolation of single viable prokaryotic cells from a mixture of cells. the system is based on an inverted microscope, a microinjector and a micromanipulator. the isolated cell is captured in a microcapillary from a volume of 400 mul and transferred to an appropriate growth medium. validation of the system was performed using two fluorescent strains: pseudomonas putida expressing red fluorescent protein (dsred), and escherichia coli expressing green fluorescent protein (gfp). a mixture (100:1) of the constructed fluorescent strains was subjected to isolation experiments and nine out of ten individually isolated cells yielded axenic cultures of e. coli. upon construction and validation, the system was used to isolate and subsequently cultivate axenic cultures of the thermophilic archaeon metallosphaera sedula and  the hyperthermophilic archaeon sulfolobus solfataricus from enriched hot spring samples. the high efficiency of single-cell isolation and cultivation demonstrated over a range of temperatures-90% (30 degrees c), 85% (70 degrees c)  and 95% (80 degrees c)-from different environments is probably due to the elimination of osmotic stress and limitation of temperature fluctuations during the isolation process, as a result of the large sample volume from which the cells are isolated.

TI  == a dna polymerase v homologue encoded by tol plasmid pww0 confers evolutionary fitness on pseudomonas putida under conditions of environmental stress.
AB  == plasmids in conjunction with other mobile elements such as transposons are major  players in the genetic adaptation of bacteria in response to changes in environment. here we show that a large catabolic tol plasmid, pww0, from pseudomonas putida carries genes (rulab genes) encoding an error-prone dna polymerase pol v homologue which increase the survival of bacteria under conditions of accumulation of dna damage. a study of population dynamics in stationary phase revealed that the presence of pww0-derived rulab genes in the bacterial genome allows the expression of a strong growth advantage in stationary phase (gasp) phenotype of p. putida. when rulab-carrying cells from an 8-day-old  culture were mixed with pol v-negative cells from a 1-day-old culture, cells derived from the aged culture out-competed cells from the nonaged culture and overtook the whole culture. at the same time, bacteria from an aged culture lacking the rulab genes were only partially able to out-compete cells from a fresh overnight culture of the parental p. putida strain. thus, in addition to conferring resistance to dna damage, the plasmid-encoded pol v genes significantly increase the evolutionary fitness of bacteria during prolonged nutritional starvation of a p. putida population. the results of our study indicate that reca is involved in the control of expression of the pww0-encoded pol v.

TI  == molecular characterization of the gallate dioxygenase from pseudomonas putida kt2440. the prototype of a new subgroup of extradiol dioxygenases.
AB  == in this work we have characterized the gala gene product from pseudomonas putida  kt2440, a ring-cleavage dioxygenase that acts specifically on gallate to produce  4-oxalomesaconate. the protein is a trimer composed by three identical subunits of 47.6 kda (419 amino acids) that uses fe2+ as the main cofactor. the gallate dioxygenase showed maximum activity at ph 7.0, and the km and vmax values for gallate were 144 microm and 53.2 micromol/min/mg of protein, respectively. a phylogenetic study suggests that the gallate dioxygenase from p. putida kt2440 is the prototype of a new subgroup of type ii extradiol dioxygenases that share a common ancestor with protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenases and whose two-domain architecture might have evolved from the fusion of the large and small subunits of the latter. a three-dimensional model for the n-terminal domain (residues 1-281) and c-terminal domain (residues 294-420) of the gallate dioxygenase from p. putida kt2440 was generated by comparison with the crystal structures of the large (ligb) and small (liga) subunits of the protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase from sphingomonas paucimobilis syk-6. the expression of the gala gene was specifically induced when p. putida kt2440 cells grew in the presence of gallate. a p. putida kt2440 gala mutant strain was unable to use gallate as the sole carbon source and it did not show gallate dioxygenase activity, suggesting that the gala protein is the only dioxygenase involved in gallate cleavage in this bacterium. this work points to the existence of a new pathway that is devoted to  the catabolism of gallic acid and that remained unknown in the paradigmatic p. putida kt2440 strain.

TI  == the protein coded by the pp2216 gene of pseudomonas putida kt2440 is an acyl-coa  dehydrogenase that oxidises only short-chain aliphatic substrates.
AB  == a gene (pp2216) that codes for an acyl-coa dehydrogenase was cloned from pseudomonas putida strain kt2240 and over-expressed in escherichia coli, and the  recombinant enzyme purified and characterised. the enzyme is tetrameric with one  fad per subunit of molecular mass 40,500 da. an anaerobic titration with sodium dithionite showed that the enzyme accepts two electrons. a similar titration with butyryl-coa showed that reduction by this substrate was incomplete with 4.5 mol butyryl-coa added per mol enzyme fad; the equilibrium was used to calculate that  the oxidation-reduction potential of the enzyme at ph 7 and 25 degrees c is 5+/-5 mv versus the standard hydrogen electrode. the enzyme shows catalytic activity with butyryl-coa, valeryl-coa and hexanoyl-coa, and very low activity with heptanoyl-coa and octanoyl-coa; it fails to oxidise propionyl-coa. these properties resemble those of short-chain acyl-coa dehydrogenases from other sources. the enzyme is inactive with the coa derivatives of all phenylalkanoates  that were tested (side chains 3-8 carbon atoms) indicating that in contrast to an earlier suggestion, the enzyme is not involved in the beta-oxidation of aromatic  compounds.

TI  == pnra, a new nitroreductase-family enzyme in the tnt-degrading strain pseudomonas  putida jlr11.
AB  == nitroreductases are a group of proteins that catalyse pyridine nucleotide-dependent reduction of nitroaromatics compounds, showing significant human health and environmental implications. in this study we have identified the nitroreductase-family enzymes pnra and pnrb from the tnt-degrading strain pseudomonas putida. the enzyme encoded by the pnra gene was expressed in escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity and shown to be a flavoprotein that used 2 mol of nadph to reduce 1 mol of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt) to 4-hydroxylamine-2,6-dinitrotoluene, using a ping-pong bi-bi mechanism. the pnra enzyme also recognized as substrates as a number of other nitroaromatic compounds, i.e. 2,4-dinitrotoluene, 3-nitrotoluene, 3- and 4-nitrobenzoate, 3,5-dinitrobenzamide and 3,5-dinitroaniline expanding the substrates profile from previously described nitroreductases. however, tnt resulted to be the most efficient substrate examined according to the vmax/km parameter. expression analysis of pnra- and pnrb-mrna isolated from cells growing on different nitrogen sources suggested that expression of both genes was constitutive and that its level of expression was relatively constant regardless of the growth substrate. this is in agreement with enzyme-specific activity determined with cells growing  with different n-sources.

TI  == biodegradation of p-nitrophenol by p. putida.
AB  == a strain of pseudomonas putida was found capable of metabolizing p-nitrophenol (pnp) as a sole source of carbon, nitrogen and energy. to explore the applicability of this strain for bioremediation for controlling environmental pnp pollution, its degradation potential at 300 and 500 ppm was examined in a medium  devoid of carbon and nitrogen source (minimal medium). at a600, 0.5 od inoculum,  the strain metabolized 300 and 500 ppm within 36 and 72 h, respectively. the degradation was accompanied by release of stoichiometric amount of nitrite. effect of glucose and nitrogen on pnp degradation under similar conditions revealed that (i) glucose (0.4 g/l) at 20 and 50 ppm pnp did not accelerate the rate of pnp degradation, while glucose (0.4 g/l) at 300 ppm pnp inhibited its degradation, (ii) nitrogen supplement viz. sodium nitrate and ammonium sulphate (0.04 and 0.4 g/l) in minimal medium with pnp (300 ppm) showed no effect on pnp degradation, while glutamate alone (0.04 and 0.4 g/l) showed mere rise in biomass (from 0.5 to 1.6 od units), and (iii) acidic ph (4.0-6.5) did not support pnp degradation, while alkaline ph (7.5-9.5) significantly enhanced the rate of pnp degradation. the complete degradation of pnp at high concentration (300 ppm) was  confirmed by hptlc analysis. in order to probe root cause of higher pnp degradation, preliminary studies on genetic analysis of p. putida were undertaken, which revealed the prevalence of a degradative plasmid of approximately 15 kb, while cured derivatives of p. putida (pnp-) did not show ability to degrade pnp. further conjugal transfer of pnp+ phenotype from p. putida to standard strain of e. coli nova blue (pnp-) confirmed the degradative type of plasmid.

TI  == aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon consumption and transformation by the styrene  degrading strain pseudomonas putida ca-3.
AB  == pseudomonas putida ca-3 is capable of consuming a number of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons. with the exception of styrene none of the alkenes tested  are capable of supporting the growth of p. putida ca-3 as sole sources of carbon  and energy. the highest rate of alkene consumption was observed with styrene as the substrate. a 6.5- and 15.5-fold lower rate of substrate consumption was observed with indene and indole with the concomitant formation of 2-indanone and  indigo, respectively. the presence of a sulphur (benzothiopene) or oxygen (benzofuran) in the cyclopentene ring resulted in further decreases in the rate of substrate consumption by whole cells of p. putida ca-3. p. putida ca-3 is incapable of consuming benzene and consumes toluene at a low rate. no detectable  products were observed in supernatants of cultures incubated with benzothiopene,  benzofuran or toluene. the aliphatic alkenes 1-octene and 1,7-octadiene were both consumed by whole cells of p. putida ca-3 at a rate equivalent to indene consumption. the consumption of (r) styrene oxide was 1.7- and 1.25-fold higher than that of the s isomer and the racemic mix, respectively. the rate of racemic  indene oxide, 1,2-epoxyoctane and 1,2-epoxy-7-octene consumption was lower than their equivalent alkene and 55-, 11.8-, and 27.5-fold lower than the rate of racemic styrene oxide consumption. a transposon mutant incapable of growth with styrene or styrene oxide failed to transform indole to indigo. the ratio of styrene utilisation relative to other substrates changes in the mutant strain compared to the wild-type strain, e.g., indene biotransformation by mutant af5 is 1.9-fold higher than styrene consumption compared to the wild-type strain ca-3 where the rate of styrene consumption is 6.7-fold higher than indene consumption. this trend is also observed for other alkenes and epoxides.

TI  == l: -stereoselective amino acid amidase with broad substrate specificity from brevundimonas diminuta: characterization of a new member of the leucine aminopeptidase family.
AB  == brevundimonas diminuta tpu 5720 produces an amidase acting l-stereoselectively on phenylalaninamide. the enzyme (laaa(bd)) was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by ammonium sulfate fractionation and four steps of column chromatography. the final preparation gave a single band on sds-page with a molecular weight of approximately 53,000. the native molecular weight of the enzyme was about 288,000 based on gel filtration chromatography, suggesting that  the enzyme is active as a homohexamer. it had maximal activity at 50 degrees c and ph 7.5. laaa(bd) lost its activity almost completely on dialysis against potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.0), and the amidase activity was largely restored by the addition of co(2+) ions. the enzyme was, however, inactivated in  the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid even in the presence of co(2+), suggesting that laaa(bd) is a co(2+)-dependent enzyme. laaa(bd) had hydrolyzing activity toward a broad range of l-amino acid amides including l-phenylalaninamide, l-glutaminamide, l-leucinamide, l-methioninamide, l-argininamide, and l-2-aminobutyric acid amide. using information on the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme, the gene encoding laaa(bd) was cloned from the chromosomal dna of the strain and sequenced. analysis of 4,446 bp of the cloned dna revealed the presence of seven open-reading frames (orfs), one  of which (laaa ( bd )) encodes the amidase. laaa(bd) is composed of 491 amino acid residues (calculated molecular weight 51,127), and the deduced amino acid sequence exhibits significant similarity to that of orfs encoding hypothetical cytosol aminopeptidases found in the genomes of caulobacter crescentus, bradyrhizobium japonicum, rhodopseudomonas palustris, mesorhizobium loti, and agrobacterium tumefaciens, and leucine aminopeptidases, pepa, from rickettsia prowazekii, pseudomonas putida atcc 12633, and escherichia coli k-12. the laaa (  bd ) gene modified in the nucleotide sequence upstream from its start codon was overexpressed in an e. coli transformant. the activity of the recombinant laaa(bd) in cell-free extracts of the e. coli transformant was 25.9 units mg(-1)  with l-phenylalaninamide as substrate, which was 50 times higher than that of b.  diminuta tpu 5720.

TI  == the incp-6 plasmid rms149 consists of a small mobilizable backbone with multiple  large insertions.
AB  == plasmid rms149, the archetype of pseudomonas plasmid incompatibility group incp-6, was identified in pseudomonas aeruginosa as an agent conferring resistance to streptomycin, sulfanilamide, gentamicin, and carbenicillin in 1975. it has been classed as a broad-host-range plasmid due to its ability to replicate in both escherichia coli (where it is designated incg) and pseudomonas species, although both species are gamma-proteobacteria. to provide reference information  on this inc group, we have determined the complete sequence of rms149 and found that, although the genome comprises 57,121 bp, it is essentially a small mobilizable plasmid carrying multiple mobile elements, which make up 79% (>45 kb) of its genome. a replicon has been identified which encodes a single polypeptide  with moderate identity to other replication proteins. the region encoding this protein can replicate in pseudomonas putida and e. coli. this sequence is directly downstream of a putative partitioning region highly similar to that of pra2. a functional incq-type mobilization region is also present. thus, the backbone appears to be a novel combination of modules already identified in other plasmid systems. analysis of the segments that fall outside this core of stable inheritance and transfer functions show that this plasmid has been subject to multiple insertion events and that the plasmid appears to carry a considerable load of dna that no longer should be phenotypically advantageous. the plasmid therefore functions not just as a vehicle for spread of selective traits but also as a store for dna that is not currently under selection.

TI  == colonization of the arabidopsis rhizosphere by fluorescent pseudomonas spp. activates a root-specific, ethylene-responsive pr-5 gene in the vascular bundle.
AB  == plants of which the roots are colonized by selected strains of non-pathogenic, fluorescent pseudomonas spp. develop an enhanced defensive capacity against a broad spectrum of foliar pathogens. in arabidopsis thaliana, this rhizobacteria-induced systemic resistance (isr) functions independently of salicylic acid but requires responsiveness to jasmonic acid and ethylene. in contrast to pathogen-induced systemic acquired resistance (sar), isr is not associated with systemic changes in the expression of genes encoding pathogenesis-related (pr) proteins. to identify genes that are specifically expressed in response to colonization of the roots by isr-inducing pseudomonas fluorescens wcs417r bacteria, we screened a collection of arabidopsis enhancer trap and gene trap lines containing a transposable element of the ac/ds system and the gus reporter gene. we identified an enhancer trap line (wet121) that specifically showed gus activity in the root vascular bundle upon colonization of the roots by wcs417r. fluorescent pseudomonas spp. strains p. fluorescens wcs374r and p. putida wcs358r triggered a similar expression pattern, whereas isr-non-inducing escherichia coli bacteria did not. exogenous application of the  ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (acc) mimicked the rhizobacteria-induced gus expression pattern in the root vascular bundle, whereas methyl jasmonic acid and salicylic acid did not, indicating that the ds element in wet121 is inserted in the vicinity of an ethylene-responsive gene. analysis of the expression of the genes in the close vicinity of the ds element revealed attlp1 as the gene responsible for the in cis activation of the gus reporter gene in the root vascular bundle. attlp1 encodes a thaumatin-like protein that belongs to the pr-5 family of pr proteins, some of which possess antimicrobial properties. attlp1 knockout mutant plants showed normal levels of wcs417r-mediated isr against the bacterial leaf pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000, suggesting that expression of attlp1 in the roots is not required  for systemic expression of isr in the leaves. together, these results indicate that induction of attlp1 is a local response of arabidopsis roots to colonization by non-pathogenic fluorescent pseudomonas spp. and is unlikely to play a role in  systemic resistance.

TI  == elucidation of dominant effect on initial bacterial adhesion onto polymer surfaces prepared by radiation-induced graft polymerization.
AB  == surface-modified polyethylene (pe) membrane sheets were prepared by the radiation-induced graft polymerization (rigp) of an epoxy-group-containing monomer, glycidyl methacrylate (gma). the epoxy ring of gma was opened by introducing diethylamine (dea) or sodium sulfite (ss). we examined the properties of these sheets by measuring the amount of grafting polymer, surface roughness and membrane potential, and also investigated the adhesion of five gram-negative  bacteria, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas fluorescens and paracoccus denitrificans, onto the prepared sheet surfaces. a linear relationship between the degree of grafting (dg) and surface roughness was observed. moreover, membrane potential was dependent on the amount  of dea or ss as the ionizable group. these results indicate that rigp enables the control of the physicochemical properties of such a sheet surface by adjusting dg and the subsequent conversion of functional groups. a batch test on bacterial adhesion onto the sheets clarified that the dea-containing sheet (dea sheet) exhibited an adhesion rate constant, k, significantly greater than those of other types of sheet. clearly, the adhesion rate constant of the dea sheet increased with dg, indicating that electrostatic interaction is the most decisive factor for bacterial adhesion when it works as an attractive force. furthermore, the densities of bacteria adhering onto the gma-containing sheet (gma sheet) and the  ss-containing sheet (ss sheet) were almost the same as that onto a pe sheet, whereas that onto a dea sheet significantly increased. thus, the introduction of  the gma- and ss-containing graft chain did not have much influence on bacterial adhesion onto the surfaces, supporting the conclusion that the promotion of bacterial adhesion onto the gma and ss sheets was due to an increase in surface area resulting from rigp. moreover, the scanning electron microscopy images of the sheet surfaces indicate that the conditions and morphologies of initial bacterial adhesion are dependent on surface properties, particularly membrane potential.

TI  == characterization of copabcd operon from a copper-sensitive pseudomonas putida strain.
AB  == we describe an operon, copabcd, that encodes copper-binding and sequestering proteins for copper homeostasis in the copper-sensitive strain pseudomonas putida pnl-mk25. this is the second operon characterized as being involved in copper homeostasis, in addition to a p1-type atpase encoded by cuear, which was previously shown to be active in the same strain. in this study, 3 copper-responsive mutants were obtained through mini-tn5::gfp mutagenesis and were found to exhibit reduced tolerance to copper. sequencing analysis of the transposon-tagged region in the 3 mutants revealed insertions in 2 genes of an operon homologous to the copabcd of p. syringae and pcoabcd of escherichia coli.  gene expression studies demonstrated that the p. putida copabcd is inducible starting from 3 micromol/l copper levels. copper-sensitivity studies revealed that the tolerance of the mutant strains was reduced only marginally (only 0.16-fold) in comparison to a 6-fold reduced tolerance of the cuear mutant. thus, the cop operon in this strain has a minimal role when compared with its role both in other copper-resistant strains, such as p. syringae pv. syringae, and in the cuear operon of the same strain. we propose that the reduced function of the copabcd operon is likely to be due to the presence of fewer metal-binding domains in the encoded proteins.

TI  == plasmid host-range: restrictions to f replication in pseudomonas.
AB  == host-range, a fundamental property of a bacterial plasmid, is primarily determined by the plasmid replication system. to investigate the basis of the restricted host-range of the well-studied f-plasmid of escherichia coli, we characterized in vitro the interactions of the host dnaa initiation protein and dnab helicase from pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas putida with the replication origin, oris, and initiation protein, repe, of the repfia replicon. the results presented here show that a pre-priming complex can form at the f-origin with the replication proteins from the non-native hosts in the presence  of repe. however, repe cannot form a stable complex with dnab of p. aeruginosa or p. putida but does stably interact with e. coli dnab. this unstable association may affect the ability of f to replicate in pseudomonas. in addition, replication studies in vivo suggest that inefficient expression of the repe initiation protein from its native promoter in pseudomonas is a factor in restricting its host-range. this, however, is not the only barrier to f replication, as mini-f derivatives with an alternative promoter for repe expression do not replicate in  p. putida and are not stably maintained in p. aeruginosa.

TI  == a two-component hydroxylase involved in the assimilation of 3-hydroxyphenyl acetate in pseudomonas putida.
AB  == the complete catabolic pathway involved in the assimilation of 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (3-oh-phac) in pseudomonas putida u has been established. this pathway is integrated by the following: (i) a specific route (upper pathway), which catalyzes the conversion of 3-oh-phac into 2,5-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (2,5-dioh-phac) (homogentisic acid, hmg), and (ii) a central route (convergent route), which catalyzes the transformation of the hmg generated from 3-oh-phac, l-phe, and l-tyr into fumarate and acetoacetate (hmgabc). thus, in a first step the degradation of 3-oh-phac requires the uptake  of 3-oh-phac by means of an active transport system that involves the participation of a permease (mhac) together with phosphoenolpyruvate as the energy source. once incorporated, 3-oh-phac is hydroxylated to 2,5-dioh-phac through an enzymatic reaction catalyzed by a novel two-component flavoprotein aromatic hydroxylase (mhaab). the large component (mhaa, 62,719 da) is a flavoprotein, and the small component (mhab, 6,348 da) is a coupling protein that is essential for the hydroxylation of 3-oh-phac to 2,5-dioh-phac. sequence analyses and molecular biology studies revealed that homogentisic acid synthase (mhaab) is different from the aromatic hydroxylases reported to date, accounting  for its specific involvement in the catabolism of 3-oh-phac. additionally, an abc transport system (hmgdefghi) involved in the uptake of homogentisic acid and two  regulatory elements (mhasr and hmgr) have been identified. furthermore, the cloning and the expression of some of the catabolic genes in different microbes presented them with the ability to synthesize hmg (mhaab) or allowed them to grow in chemically defined media containing 3-oh-phac as the sole carbon source (mhaab and hmgabc).

TI  == production and x-ray crystallographic analysis of fully deuterated cytochrome p450cam.
AB  == neutron protein crystallography allows h-atom positions to be located in biological structures at the relatively modest resolution of 1.5-2.0 a. a difficulty of this technique arises from the incoherent scattering from hydrogen, which considerably reduces the signal-to-noise ratio of the data. this can be overcome by preparing fully deuterated samples. efficient protocols for routine and low-cost production of in vivo deuterium-enriched proteins have been developed. here, the overexpression and crystallization of highly (>99%) deuterium-enriched cytochrome p450cam for neutron analysis is reported. cytochrome p450cam from pseudomonas putida catalyses the hydroxylation of camphor from haem-bound molecular o(2) via a mechanism that is thought to involve a proton-shuttle pathway to the active site. since h atoms cannot be visualized in  available x-ray structures, neutron diffraction is being used to determine the protonation states and water structure at the active site of the enzyme. analysis of both hydrogenated and perdeuterated p450cam showed no significant changes between the x-ray structures determined at 1.4 and 1.7 a, respectively. this work demonstrates that the fully deuterated protein is highly isomorphous with the native (hydrogenated) protein and is appropriate for neutron protein crystallographic analysis.

TI  == expression of pha polymerase genes of pseudomonas putida in escherichia coli and  its effect on pha formation.
AB  == poly-3-hydroxyalkanoates (phas) are synthesized by many bacteria as intracellular storage material. the final step in pha biosynthesis is catalyzed by two pha polymerases (phac) in pseudomonas putida. the expression of these two phac genes  (phac1 and phac2)was studied in escherichia coli, either under control of the native promoter or under control of an external promoter. it was found that the two phac genes are not expressed in e. coli without an external promoter. during  heterologous expression of phac from plac on a high copy number plasmid, a rapid  reduction of the number of colony forming units was observed, especially for phac2. it appears that the plasmid instability was partially caused by high-level production of pha polymerase. subsequently, tightly regulated phac2 expression systems on a low copy number vector were applied in e. coli. this resulted in pha yields of over 20 of total cell dry weight, which was 2 fold higher than that obtained from the system where phac2 is present on a high copy number vector. in  addition, the pha monomer composition differed when different gene expression systems or different phac genes were applied.

AB  == the nagr protein is a response regulatory protein found in the bacterium ralstonia sp. u2 that is involved in sensing for salicylic acid and the subsequent induction of the operon just upstream of its gene. the genes encoded for in this operon are involved in the degradation of salicylic acid. escherichia coli strain rfm443 carrying a fusion of the photorhabdus luminescens luxcdabe operon with the nagr gene and upstream region of the nagaa gene was constructed and characterized with respect to its optimum temperature, its response time and  kinetics, and its ability to detect numerous benzoic acid derivatives. although capable of detecting 0.5 mm salicylic acid at any temperature between 28 and 40 degrees c, this e. coli strain, labeled dnt5, showed its greatest relative activity at 30 degrees c, i.e., the temperature at which the largest induction was seen. furthermore, experiments done with numerous benzoic acid derivatives found the nagr protein to be responsive to only a few of the compounds tested, including salicylic acid and 3-methyl salicylic acid, and acetyl salicylic acid was the strongest inducer. the lower limits of detection for these compounds with e. coli strain dnt5 were also established, with the native inducer, salicylic acid, giving the most sensitive response and detectable down to a concentration of about 2 microm. a second lux fusion plasmid was also constructed and transformed into an nahr background, pseudomonas putida kctc1768. within this strain, nagk-1768, the supplemental activity of the nahr protein on the nagaa promoter, was shown to extend both the range of chemicals detected and the sensitivity.

TI  == the multidrug efflux regulator ttgv recognizes a wide range of structurally different effectors in solution and complexed with target dna: evidence from isothermal titration calorimetry.
AB  == ttgv modulates the expression of the ttgghi operon, which encodes an efflux pump  that extrudes a wide variety of chemicals including mono- and binuclear aromatic  hydrocarbons, aliphatic alcohols, and antibiotics of dissimilar chemical structure. using a 'lacz fusion to the ttgg promoter, we show that the most efficient in vivo inducers were 1-naphthol, 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene, 4-nitrotoluene, benzonitrile, and indole. the thermodynamic parameters for the binding of different effector molecules to purified ttgv were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. for the majority of effectors, the interaction  was enthalpy-driven and counterbalance by unfavorable entropy changes. the ttgv-effector dissociation constants were found to vary between 2 and 890 mum. there was a relationship between ttgv affinity for the different effectors and their potential to induce gene expression in vivo, indicating that the effector binding constant is a major determinant for efficient efflux pump gene expression. equilibrium dialysis and isothermal titration calorimetry studies indicated that a ttgv dimer binds one effector molecule. no evidence for the simultaneous binding of multiple effectors to ttgv was obtained. the binding of ttgv to a 63-bp dna fragment containing its cognate operator was tight and entropy-driven (k(d) = 2.4 +/- 0.35 nm, deltah = 5.5 +/- 0.04 kcal/mol). the ttgv-dna complex was shown to bind 1-napthol with an affinity comparable with the free soluble ttgv protein, k(d) = 4.8 +/- 0.19 and 3.0 +/- 0.15 mum, respectively. the biological relevance of this finding is discussed.

TI  == escherichia coli orf ybhe is pgl gene encoding 6-phosphogluconolactonase (ec 3.1.1.31) that has no homology with known 6pgls from other organisms.
AB  == the pentose-phosphate pathway (ppp) is an important part of central metabolism in many organisms. a pgl(-) mutation that decreases the efficiency of the second stage of ppp has been described and mapped at approx. 17.2 min of the escherichia coli chromosome more than 30 years ago. although it has recently been shown that  deletion of orf ybhe leads to earlier detected pgl(-) phenotype for e. coli mutant strain, 6-phosphogluconolactonase from this organism has not been characterized. in the present, independent investigation we show that the pgl(-)  phenotype of deltaybhe mg1655 could be complemented by insertion of the well-characterized pgl gene from pseudomonas putida whose protein product has no  visible homology with e. coli ybhe. moreover, a final confirmation that ybhe actually encodes 6pgl in e. coli was obtained through overexpression of the cloned gene, purification of the protein product, followed by direct determination of its enzymatic activity in vitro.

TI  == p-cresol methylhydroxylase: alteration of the structure of the flavoprotein subunit upon its binding to the cytochrome subunit.
AB  == the structures of two forms of a recombinant flavoprotein have been determined at high resolution and compared. these proteins are (1) the flavocytochrome c p-cresol methylhydroxylase (rpcmh, 1.85 a resolution) and (2) the cytochrome-free flavoprotein subunit of rpcmh (pchf, 1.30 a resolution). a significant conformational difference is observed in a protein segment that is in contact with the re face of the isoalloxazine ring of fad when the structure of pchf is compared to the subunit in the intact flavocytochrome. this structural change is  important for optimum catalytic function of the flavoprotein, which has been shown to be dependent on the presence of the cytochrome subunit. this change results in different protein-flavin and apparently different protein-substrate interactions that have a "tuning effect" on the electronic and redox properties of bound p-cresol and the covalently bound fad. the conformational change in the  segment in the cofactor-binding site is induced by a small rearrangement in the flavoprotein-cytochrome interface region of the flavoprotein.

AB  == chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase from pseudomonas putida (pp 1,2-ccd) is a dioxygenase responsible for ring cleavage during the degradation of recalcitrant  aromatic compounds. we determined the zero-field splitting of the fe(iii) cofactor (|d| = 1.3 +/- 0.2 cm(-1)) by electron paramagnetic resonance (epr) experiments that along with other structural data allowed us to infer the fe(iii) coordination environment. the epr spectrum of the ion shows a significantly decrease of the g = 4.3 resonance upon substrate binding. this result is rationalized in terms of a mechanism previously proposed, where catechol substrate is activated by fe(iii), yielding an exchange-coupled fe(ii)-semiquinone (pair). the pp 1,2-ccd capacity of binding amphipatic molecules and the effects of such binding on protein activity are also investigated. epr spectra of spin labels show a protein-bound component, which was characterized by means of spectral simulations. our results indicate that pp  1,2-ccd is able to bind amphipatic molecules in a channel with the headgroup pointing outwards into the solvent, whereas the carbon chain is held inside the tunnel. protein assays show that the enzyme activity is significantly lowered in  the presence of stearic-acid molecules. the role of the binding of those molecules as an enzyme activity modulator is discussed.

AB  == most heterotrophic bacteria assimilate co(2) in various carboxylation reactions during biosynthesis. in this study, assimilation of (14)co(2) by heterotrophic bacteria was used for isotope labeling of active microorganisms in pure cultures  and environmental samples. labeled cells were visualized by microautoradiography  (mar) combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) to obtain simultaneous information about activity and identity. cultures of escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida assimilated sufficient (14)co(2) during growth on various organic substrates to obtain positive mar signals. the mar signals were comparable with the traditional mar approach based on uptake of (14)c-labeled organic substrates. experiments with e. coli showed that (14)co(2) was assimilated during both fermentation and aerobic and anaerobic respiration. the new mar approach, hetco(2)-mar, was evaluated by targeting metabolic active filamentous bacteria, including "candidatus microthrix parvicella" in activated sludge. "ca. microthrix parvicella" was able to take up oleic acid under anaerobic conditions, as shown by the traditional mar approach with [(14)c]oleic  acid. however, the new hetco(2)-mar approach indicated that "ca. microthrix parvicella," did not significantly grow on oleic acid under anaerobic conditions  with or without addition of no(2)(-), whereas the addition of o(2) or no(3)(-) initiated growth, as indicated by detectable (14)co(2) assimilation. this is a metabolic feature that has not been described previously for filamentous bacteria. such information could not have been derived by using the traditional mar procedure, whereas the new hetco(2)-mar approach differentiates better between substrate uptake and substrate metabolism that result in growth. the hetco(2)-mar results were supported by stable isotope analysis of (13)c-labeled phospholipid fatty acids from activated sludge incubated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the presence of (13)co(2). in conclusion, the novel hetco(2)-mar approach expands the possibility for studies of the ecophysiology of uncultivated microorganisms.

TI  == aerobic biodegradation of n-nitrosodimethylamine (ndma) by axenic bacterial strains.
AB  == the water contaminant n-nitrosodimethylamine (ndma) is a probable human carcinogen whose appearance in the environment is related to the release of rocket fuel and to chlorine-based disinfection of water and wastewater. although  this compound has been shown to be biodegradable, there is minimal information about the organisms capable of this degradation, and little is understood of the  mechanisms or biochemistry involved. this study shows that bacteria expressing monooxygenase enzymes functionally similar to those demonstrated to degrade ndma  in eukaryotes have the capability to degrade ndma. specifically, induction of the soluble methane monooxygenase (smmo) expressed by methylosinus trichosporium ob3b, the propane monooxygenase (pmo) enzyme of mycobacterium vaccae job-5, and the toluene 4-monooxygenases found in ralstonia pickettii pko1 and pseudomonas mendocina kr1 resulted in ndma degradation by these strains. in each of these cases, brief exposure to acetylene gas, a suicide substrate for certain monooxygenases, inhibited the degradation of ndma. further, escherichia coli tg1/pbs(kan) containing recombinant plasmids derived from the toluene monooxygenases found in strains pko1 and kr1 mimicked the behavior of the parent  strains. in contrast, m. trichosporium ob3b expressing the particulate form of mmo, burkholderia cepacia g4 expressing the toluene 2-monooxygenase, and pseudomonas putida mt-2 expressing the toluene sidechain monooxygenase were not capable of ndma degradation. in addition, bacteria expressing aromatic dioxygenases were not capable of ndma degradation. finally, rhodococcus sp. rr1 exhibited the ability to degrade ndma by an unidentified, constitutively expressed enzyme that, unlike the confirmed monooxygenases, was not inhibited by  acetylene exposure.

TI  == analysis of column tortuosity for mncl2 and bacterial diffusion using magnetic resonance imaging.
AB  == subsurface bacteria often have to travel significant distances through tortuous porous media for purposes of groundwater remediation. in modeling such processes, motile bacteria are often represented as suspended colloids, ignoring their individual swimming or diffusive properties. in fact, bacterial migration is much more profoundly affected by the presence of porous media than is that of a chemical contaminant. in this study, we use magnetic resonance imaging (mri) to perform noninvasive measurements of changes in bacterial concentration distributions across a packed column at a spatial resolution of 330 microm as a function of time. we analyze the diffusive behavior of pseudomonas putida f1 under static conditions and compare that behavior to the diffusion of a chemical  solute and of escherichia coli nr50. results indicate that p. putida cells experience a column tortuosity 50 times higher than that predicted from solute diffusion experiments. e. coli cells, which display shorter swimming run lengths  in bulk solution than p. putida, seem to be less affected by the constricted pore space. knudsen diffusion, or reductions in run length because of interactions between the diffusing bacteria and the porous media, may help to explain some of  this discrepancy.

AB  == nahr, a member of the lysr regulator family, is a positive transcriptional regulator for genes of the naphthalene degradation pathway in pseudomonas sp. to  study nahr binding properties, five single and six double mutants were made at residues 169 and/or 248, which are located in the central inducer recognition domain and the c-terminal multimerization domain of the protein, respectively. the effects of these mutations were examined by monitoring the expression of a firefly luciferase (luc) reporter gene under the control of nahr. we found that all mutants responded to induction by both salicylate and benzoate, whereas the wild-type nahr responded only to salicylate. mutants n169e, n169e/r248c, and n169e/r248k showed low basal activities with high-level inducer responses, whereas mutant n169d/r248k showed high basal activity with inducer-independent responses. a gel retardation assay demonstrated that the different basal activities might be related to altered binding affinities of the nahr mutants to  the psal promoter. together, these data suggest that nahr residues 169 and 248 might be involved in dna binding as well as inducer recognition/binding.

TI  == use of pseudomonas putida esta as an anchoring motif for display of a periplasmic enzyme on the surface of escherichia coli.
AB  == the functional expression of proteins on the surface of bacteria has proven important for numerous biotechnological applications. in this report, we investigated the n-terminal fusion display of the periplasmic enzyme beta-lactamase (bla) on the surface of escherichia coli by using the translocator domain of the pseudomonas putida outer membrane esterase (esta), which is a member of the lipolytic autotransporter enzymes. to find out the transport function of a c-terminal domain of esta, we generated a set of bla-esta fusion proteins containing n-terminally truncated derivatives of the esta c-terminal domain. the surface exposure of the bla moiety was verified by whole-cell immunoblots, protease accessibility, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. the investigation of growth kinetics and host cell viability showed that the presence of the esta translocator domain in the outer membrane neither inhibits cell growth nor affects cell viability. furthermore, the surface-exposed bla moiety was shown to be enzymatically active. these results demonstrate for the first time that the translocator domain of a lipolytic autotransporter enzyme is an effective anchoring motif for the functional display of heterologous passenger protein on the surface of e. coli. this investigation also provides a possible topological model of the esta translocator domain, which might serve as a basis for the construction of fusion proteins containing heterologous passenger domains.

AB  == a pseudomonas putida atcc12633 gene, dpka, encoding a putative protein annotated  as malate/l-lactate dehydrogenase in various sequence data bases was disrupted by homologous recombination. the resultant dpka(-) mutant was deprived of the ability to use d-lysine and also d-proline as a sole carbon source. the dpka gene was cloned and overexpressed in escherichia coli, and the gene product was characterized. the enzyme showed neither malate dehydrogenase nor lactate dehydrogenase activity but catalyzed the nadph-dependent reduction of such cyclic imines as delta(1)-piperideine-2-carboxylate and delta(1)-pyrroline-2-carboxylate to form l-pipecolate and l-proline, respectively. nadh also served as a hydrogen  donor for both substrates, although the reaction rates were less than 1% of those with nadph. the reverse reactions were also catalyzed by the enzyme but at much lower rates. thus, the enzyme has dual metabolic functions, and we named the enzyme delta(1)-piperideine-2-carboxylate/delta(1)-pyrroline-2-carboxylate reductase, the first member of a novel subclass in a large family of nad(p)-dependent oxidoreductases.

TI  == monitoring aromatic hydrocarbons by whole cell electrochemical biosensors.
AB  == in this article, we describe a bacterial whole cell electrochemical biosensors system that can be used for monitoring aromatic hydrocarbons. these bacterial biosensors are based on fusions of a promoter that is sensitive to aromatic compounds (the promoter region of the xyls gene and the xylr gene coding for the  transcriptional regulator of the xyl operon) to reporter genes that can be monitored electrochemically at real-time and on-line. the xyls promoter was fused upstream of two promoterless genes coding the lacz gene and phoa. these constructs reacted specifically to aromatic compounds but not to nonaromatic compounds, and we could detect, within minutes, micromolar concentrations of different aromatic hydrocarbons such as xylene and toluene. the use of two different reporter genes allows the future construction of a multianalyte detection system for simultaneous monitoring of several pollutants. these whole cell biosensors are potentially useful for on-line and in situ detection of aromatic compounds and as early warning systems of environmental hazards.

TI  == transcriptional regulation of pww0 transfer genes in pseudomonas putida kt2440.
AB  == the conjugative incp-9 plasmid pww0 (tol) carries transfer genes, many of whose functions can be predicted from sequence similarities to the well-studied incw and incp-1 plasmids, and that are clustered with the replication and maintenance  genes of the plasmid core. in this study we show that the incp-9 transfer genes are transcribed from at least three promoter regions. the promoters for traa and  trad act divergently from the region found to encode the origin of transfer, orit. these promoters regulate expression of traa, b, and perhaps trac in one direction and trad in the other, all of whose gene products are predicted to be involved in relaxasome formation and dna processing during transfer, and they are repressed by traa. the third promoter region, upstream of mpfr, is responsible for transcription of mpfr and mpfa to mpfj, encoding proteins involved in mating  pair formation. transcription from this region is negatively autoregulated by mpfr. thus the pww0 transfer genes, like those of the incp-1 plasmids, are expressed at all times, but kept in control by a negative feed back loop to limit the metabolic burden on the host. although many of the related mating pair formation systems are, as in pww0, transcribed divergently from an operon for replication and/or stable inheritance functions, mpfr is not related to the known regulatory proteins of these other transfer systems outside those of the incp-9 family and indeed the regulators tend to be specific for each plasmid family. this suggests that the general pattern of genetic organisation exhibited by these systems has arisen a number of times independently and must therefore be highly favourable to plasmid survival and spread.

TI  == biocatalytic synthesis of polycatechols from toxic aromatic compounds.
AB  == a process is described in which toxic aromatic compounds are converted by toluene dioxygenase and in turn toluene cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase to catechols which  are further polymerized by peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation producing polycatechols. three approaches for obtaining catechols were employed: (1) addition of halogenated aromatics to p. putida f1, resulting in the accumulation  of halogenated catechols; (2) inhibition of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase of p. putida f1 by known aromatic and aliphatic inhibitors; and (3) overexpression of toluene  dioxygenase and toluene cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase genes in e. coli jm109. the process is suitable for producing novel catechols that upon oxidation may yield polymers with unique properties, presenting a tool for producing tailor-made biopolymers. formation of 3-chlorocatechol from chlorobenzene, 3,4-dichlorocatechol from 1,2-dichlorobenzene, and catechol from benzene and their subsequent oxidation and polymerization was demonstrated. oxidation of catechol yielded polymers with molecular weights of up to 4000 daltons. their apparently high water solubility eliminates the need for water-miscible solvents. in aqueous solution oxidation of catechols was rapid, yet the presence of 20%, 30%, and 40% ethanol, resulted in a rate decrease of 31%, 95%, and 93%, respectively. the advantage is that significantly less peroxidase is required for performing the reactions if miscible solvents are not employed. furthermore, water-soluble polymers may be desirable for many applications.

TI  == design of new promoters and of a dual-bioreporter based on cross-activation by the two regulatory proteins xylr and hbpr.
AB  == the hbpr protein is the sigma54-dependent transcription activator for 2-hydroxybiphenyl degradation in pseudomonas azelaica. the ability of hbpr and xylr, which share 35% amino acid sequence identity, to cross-activate the phbpc and pu promoters was investigated by determining hbpr- or xylr-mediated luciferase expression and by dna binding assays. xylr measurably activated the phbpc promoter in the presence of the effector m-xylene, both in escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida. hbpr weakly stimulated the pu promoter in e. coli but not in p. azelaica. poor hbpr-dependent activation from pu was caused by a weak binding to the operator region. to create promoters efficiently activated by both regulators, the hbpr binding sites on phbpc were gradually changed into the xylr  binding sites of pu by site-directed mutagenesis. inducible luciferase expression from mutated promoters was tested in e. coli on a two plasmid system, and from mono copy gene fusions in p. azelaica and p. putida. some mutants were efficiently activated by both hbpr and xylr, showing that promoters can be created which are permissive for both regulators. others achieved a higher xylr-dependent transcription than from pu itself. mutants were also obtained which displayed a tenfold lower uninduced expression level by hbpr than the wild-type phbpc, while keeping the same maximal induction level. on the basis of  these results, a dual-responsive bioreporter strain of p. azelaica was created, containing both xylr and hbpr, and activating luciferase expression from the same single promoter independently with m-xylene and 2-hydroxybiphenyl.

TI  == parb of pseudomonas aeruginosa: interactions with its partner para and its target pars and specific effects on bacterial growth.
AB  == the par genes of pseudomonas aeruginosa have been studied to increase the understanding of their mechanism of action and role in the bacterial cell. key properties of the parb protein have been identified and are associated with different parts of the protein. the parb- parb interaction domain was mapped in vivo and in vitro to the c-terminal 56 amino acids (aa); 7 aa at the c terminus play an important role. the dimerization domain of p. aeruginosa parb is interchangeable with the dimerization domain of korb from plasmid rk2 (incp1 group). the c-terminal part of parb is also involved in parb-para interactions. purified parb binds specifically to dna containing a putative pars sequence based on the consensus sequence found in the chromosomes of bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas putida, and streptomyces coelicolor. the overproduction of parb was shown to inhibit the function of genes placed near pars. this "silencing" was dependent on the pars sequence and its orientation. the overproduction of p. aeruginosa parb or its n-terminal part also causes inhibition of the growth of p. aeruginosa and p. putida but not escherichia coli cells. since this inhibitory determinant is located well away from parb segments required for dimerization or  interaction with the para counterpart, this result may suggest a role for the n terminus of p. aeruginosa parb in interactions with host cell components.

TI  == functional and phylogenetic analysis of a plant-inducible oligoribonuclease (orn) gene from an indigenous pseudomonas plasmid.
AB  == application of a promoter-trapping strategy to identify plant-inducible genes carried on an indigenous pseudomonas plasmid, pqbr103, revealed the presence of a putative oligoribonuclease (orn) gene that encodes a highly conserved 3' to 5' exoribonuclease specific for small oligoribonucleotides. the deduced amino acid sequence of the plasmid-derived orn (orn(pl)) showed three conserved motifs characteristic of orn from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. deletion of orn(pl) generated no observable phenotype, but inactivation of the chromosomal copy caused slow growth in pseudomonas putida kt2440. this defect was fully restored by complementation with orn from escherichia coli (orn(e.coli)). plasmid-derived  orn(pl) was capable of partially complementing the p. putida orn mutant, demonstrating functionality of orn(pl). phylogenetic analysis showed that plasmid-encoded orn was distinct from orn encoded by the chromosome of proteobacteria. a survey of orn(pl) from related pseudomonas plasmids showed a sporadic distribution but no sequence diversity. these data suggest that the orn(pl) was acquired by pqbr103 in a single gene-transfer event: the donor is unknown, but is unlikely to be a member of the proteobacteria.

TI  == cell density-dependent gene contributes to efficient seed colonization by pseudomonas putida kt2440.
AB  == we have characterized the expression pattern of a gene, ddca, involved in initial colonization of corn seeds by pseudomonas putida kt2440. the ddca gene codes for  a putative membrane polypeptide belonging to a family of conserved proteins of unknown function. members of this family are widespread among prokaryotes and include the products of a salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium gene expressed  during invasion of macrophages and psie, an escherichia coli phosphate starvation-inducible gene. although its specific role is undetermined, the presence of ddca in multicopy restored the seed adhesion capacity of a kt2440 ddca mutant. expression of ddca is growth phase regulated, being maximal at the beginning of stationary phase. it is independent of rpos, nutrient depletion, or  phosphate starvation, and it is not the result of changes in the medium ph during growth. expression of ddca is directly dependent on cell density, being also stimulated by the addition of conditioned medium and of seed exudates. this is the first evidence suggesting the existence of a quorum-sensing system in p. putida kt2440. the potential implication of such a signaling process in seed adhesion and colonization by the bacterium is discussed.

TI  == cloning and expression of afpa, a gene encoding an antifreeze protein from the arctic plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium pseudomonas putida gr12-2.
AB  == the arctic plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium pseudomonas putida gr12-2 secretes an antifreeze protein (afp) that promotes survival at subzero temperatures. the afp is unusual in that it also exhibits a low level of ice nucleation activity. a dna fragment with an open reading frame encoding 473 amino acids was cloned by pcr and inverse pcr using primers designed from partial amino acid sequences of the isolated afp. the predicted gene product, afpa, had a molecular mass of 47.3 kda, a pi of 3.51, and no previously known function. although afpa is a secreted protein, it lacked an n-terminal signal peptide and was shown by sequence analysis to have two possible secretion systems: a hemolysin-like, calcium-binding secretion domain and a type v autotransporter domain found in gram-negative bacteria. expression of afpa in escherichia coli yielded an intracellular 72-kda protein modified with both sugars and lipids that exhibited lower levels of antifreeze and ice nucleation activities than the native protein. the 164-kda afp previously purified from p. putida gr12-2 was a lipoglycoprotein, and the carbohydrate was required for ice nucleation activity.  therefore, the recombinant protein may not have been properly posttranslationally modified. the afpa sequence was most similar to cell wall-associated proteins and less similar to ice nucleation proteins (inps). hydropathy plots revealed that the amino acid sequence of afpa was more hydrophobic than those of the inps in the domain that forms the ice template, thus suggesting that afps and inps interact differently with ice. to our knowledge, this is the first gene encoding  a protein with both antifreeze and ice nucleation activities to be isolated and characterized.

TI  == effect of oxygen limitation and medium composition on escherichia coli fermentation in shake-flask cultures.
AB  == shake-flask cultures are widely used for screening of high producing strains. to  select suitable strains for production scale, cultivation parameters should be applied that provide optimal growth conditions. a novel method of measuring respiratory activity in shake-flask cultures was employed to analyze escherichia  coli fermentation under laboratory conditions. our results suggest that the length of fermentation, choice of medium, and aeration do not normally satisfy the requirements for unlimited growth in shake flasks. using glycerol rather than glucose as a carbon source greatly reduced the accumulation of overflow and fermentative metabolites when oxygen supply was unlimited. a rich buffered medium, terrific broth (tb), yielded 5 times more biomass compared to lb medium but also caused oxygen limitation in standard shake-flask cultures at shaking frequencies below 400 rpm. these results were used to optimize the production of  benzoylformate decarboxylase from pseudomonas putida in e. coli sg13009, resulting in a 10-fold increase in volumetric enzyme production. this example demonstrates how variation of medium composition and oxygen supply can be evaluated by the measurement of the respiratory activity. this can help to efficiently optimize screening conditions for e. coli.

AB  == seven strains of sulfate-reducing bacteria (srb) were tested for the accumulation of polyhydroxyalkanoates (phas). during growth with benzoate desulfonema magnum accumulated large amounts of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) [poly(3hb)]. desulfosarcina  variabilis (during growth with benzoate), desulfobotulus sapovorans (during growth with caproate), and desulfobacterium autotrophicum (during growth with caproate) accumulated poly(3hb) that accounted for 20 to 43% of cell dry matter.  desulfobotulus sapovorans and desulfobacterium autotrophicum also synthesized copolyesters consisting of 3-hydroxybutyrate and 3-hydroxyvalerate when valerate  was used as the growth substrate. desulfovibrio vulgaris and desulfotalea psychrophila were the only srb tested in which phas were not detected. when total dna isolated from desulfococcus multivorans and specific primers deduced from highly conserved regions of known pha synthases (phac) were used, a pcr product homologous to the central region of class iii pha synthases was obtained. the complete pha locus of desulfococcus multivorans was subsequently obtained by inverse pcr, and it contained adjacent phae(dm) and phac(dm) genes. phac(dm) and  phae(dm) were composed of 371 and 306 amino acid residues and showed up to 49 or  23% amino acid identity to the corresponding subunits of other class iii pha synthases. constructs of phac(dm) alone (pbbrmcs-2::phac(dm)) and of phae(dm)c(dm) (pbbrmcs-2::phae(dm)c(dm)) in various vectors were obtained and transferred to several strains of escherichia coli, as well as to the pha-negative mutants phb(-)4 and gpp104 of ralstonia eutropha and pseudomonas putida, respectively. in cells of the recombinant strains harboring phae(dm)c(dm) small but significant amounts (up to 1.7% of cell dry matter) of poly(3hb) and of pha synthase activity (up to 1.5 u/mg protein) were detected. this indicated that the cloned genes encode functionally active proteins. hybrid synthases consisting of phac(dm) and phae of thiococcus pfennigii or synechocystis sp. strain pcc 6308 were also constructed and were shown to be functionally active.

TI  == distinct classes of glyoxalase i: metal specificity of the yersinia pestis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and neisseria meningitidis enzymes.
AB  == the metalloisomerase glyoxalase i (glxi) catalyses the conversion of methylglyoxal-glutathione hemithioacetal and related derivatives into the corresponding thioesters. in contrast with the previously characterized glxi enzymes of homo sapiens, pseudomonas putida and saccharomyces cerevisiae, we recently determined that escherichia coli glxi surprisingly did not display zn2+-activation, but instead exhibited maximal activity with ni2+. to investigate whether non-zn2+ activation defines a distinct, previously undocumented class of  glxi enzymes, or whether the e. coli glxi is an exception to the previously established zn2+-activated glxi, we have cloned and characterized the bacterial glxi from yersinia pestis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and neisseria meningitidis. the metal-activation profiles for these additional glxis firmly establish the existence of a non-zn2+-dependent grouping within the general category of glxi enzymes. this second, established class of metal activation was formerly unidentified for this metalloenzyme. amino acid sequence comparisons indicate a more extended peptide chain in the zn2+-dependent forms of glxi (h. sapiens, p. putida and s. cerevisiae), compared with the glxi enzymes of e. coli, y. pestis,  p. aeruginosa and n. meningitidis. the longer sequence is due in part to the presence of additional regions situated fairly close to the metal ligands in the  zn2+-dependent forms of the lyase. with respect to sequence alignments, these inserts may potentially contribute to defining the metal specificity of glxi at a structural level.

TI  == mechanism of chromate reduction by the escherichia coli protein, nfsa, and the role of different chromate reductases in minimizing oxidative stress during chromate reduction.
AB  == chromate [cr(vi)] is a serious environmental pollutant, which is amenable to bacterial bioremediation. nfsa, the major oxygen-insensitive nitroreductase of escherichia coli, is a flavoprotein that is able to reduce chromate to less soluble and less toxic cr(iii). we show that this process involves single-electron transfer, giving rise to a flavin semiquinone form of nfsa and cr(v) as intermediates, which redox cycle, generating more reactive oxygen species (ros) than a divalent chromate reducer, yief. however, nfsa generates less ros than a known one-electron chromate reducer, lipoyl dehydrogenase (lpdh), suggesting that nfsa employs a mixture of uni- and di-valent electron transfer steps. the presence of yief, chrr (another chromate reductase we previously characterized), or nfsa in an lpdh-catalysed chromate reduction reaction decreased ros generation by c. 65, 40, or 20%, respectively, suggesting that these enzymes can pre-empt ros generation by lpdh. we previously showed that chrr protects pseudomonas putida against chromate toxicity; here we show that nfsa or  yief overproduction can also increase the tolerance of e. coli to this compound.

TI  == mandelamide hydrolase from pseudomonas putida: characterization of a new member of the amidase signature family.
AB  == a recently discovered enzyme in the mandelate pathway of pseudomonas putida, mandelamide hydrolase (mah), catalyzes the hydrolysis of mandelamide to mandelic  acid and ammonia. sequence analysis suggests that mah is a member of the amidase  signature family, which is widespread in nature and contains a novel ser-cis-ser-lys catalytic triad. here we report the expression in escherichia coli, purification, and characterization of both wild-type and his(6)-tagged mah. the recombinant enzyme was stable, exhibited a ph optimum of 7.8, and was able to hydrolyze both enantiomers of mandelamide with little enantiospecificity. the his-tagged variant showed no significant change in kinetic constants. phenylacetamide was found to be the best substrate, with changes in chain length  or replacement of the phenyl group producing greatly decreased values of k(cat)/k(m). as with another member of this family, fatty acid amide hydrolase, mah has the uncommon ability to hydrolyze esters and amides at similar rates. mah is even more unusual in that it will only hydrolyze esters and amides with little steric bulk. ethyl and larger esters and n-ethyl and larger amides are not substrates, suggesting that the mah active site is very sterically hindered. mutation of each residue in the putative catalytic triad to alanine resulted in total loss of activity for s204a and k100a, while s180a exhibited a 1500-fold decrease in k(cat) and significant increases in k(m) values. overall, the mah data are similar to those of fatty acid amide hydrolase and support the suggestion that there are two distinct subgroups within the amidase signature family.

AB  == the ability of numerous diverse compounds and ions to cross the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane by diffusion and active transport is highly dependent on cytoplasmic membrane fluidity, which can be measured using fluorescent probes to  estimate membrane polarization values. however, membrane polarization data are lacking for most bacterial species. the cytoplasmic membrane polarization values  for arthrobacter sp. atcc 21908, bacillus cereus nrc 3045, pseudomonas fluorescens r2f, pseudomonas putida nrc 2986 and escherichia coli c600 bacterial  cells were spectrofluorometrically measured over a temperature range from 10 to 50 degrees c, and in the absence and presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline, using  the fluorescent probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (dph) to obtain new information on their membrane fluidity. at an assay temperature of 10 degrees c,  e. coli cells grown in the absence of tetracycline exhibited the highest cytoplasmic membrane polarization value (least fluid membrane) of 0.446, followed by values of 0.392, 0.371, 0.344 and 0.293, respectively, for b. cereus, arthrobacter sp., p. fluorescens and p. putida. at an assay temperature of 30 degrees c, the polarization values ranged from 0.357 to 0.288 for cells grown in  the absence of tetracycline, regardless of the species. b. cereus grown in the presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline had lower polarization values than when grown in the absence of this antibiotic at all assay temperatures. regardless of  the absence or presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline in the growth medium, all bacterial species generally exhibited a more fluid membrane as the assay temperature increased from 10 to 50 degrees c. to our knowledge, these are some of the first cytoplasmic membrane polarization values reported for these gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria over a broad temperature range and also  for cells grown in the presence of tetracycline.

TI  == crystal structure of putidaredoxin reductase from pseudomonas putida, the final structural component of the cytochrome p450cam monooxygenase.
AB  == the crystal structure of recombinant putidaredoxin reductase (pdr), an fad-containing nadh-dependent flavoprotein component of the cytochrome p450cam monooxygenase from pseudomonas putida, has been determined to 1.90 a resolution.  the protein has a fold similar to that of disulfide reductases and consists of the fad-binding, nad-binding, and c-terminal domains. compared to homologous flavoenzymes, the reductase component of biphenyl dioxygenase (bpha4) and apoptosis-inducing factor, pdr lacks one of the arginine residues that compensates partially for the negative charge on the pyrophosphate of fad. this uncompensated negative charge is likely to decrease the electron-accepting ability of the flavin. the aromatic side-chain of the "gatekeeper" tyr159 is in the "out" conformation and leaves the nicotinamide-binding site of pdr completely open. the presence of electron density in the nad-binding channel indicates that  nad originating from escherichia coli is partially bound to pdr. a structural comparison of pdr with homologous flavoproteins indicates that an open and accessible nicotinamide-binding site, the presence of an acidic residue in the middle part of the nad-binding channel that binds the nicotinamide ribose, and multiple positively charged arginine residues surrounding the entrance of the nad-binding channel are the special structural elements that assist tighter and more specific binding of the oxidized pyridine nucleotide by the bpha4-like flavoproteins. the crystallographic model of pdr explains differences in the electron transfer mechanism in the pdr-putidaredoxin redox couple and their mammalian counterparts, adrenodoxin reductase and adrenodoxin.

AB  == bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a predatory bacterium that is capable of invading a number of gram-negative bacteria. the life cycle of this predator can be divided  into a nonreproductive phase outside the prey bacteria and a multiplication phase in their periplasm. it was suggested that during the reproduction phase, b. bacteriovorus reutilizes unmodified components of the prey's cell wall. we therefore examined the outer membranes of b. bacteriovorus strains hd100 (dsm 50701) and hd114 (dsm 50705) by using escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica,  and pseudomonas putida as prey organisms. the combined sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometric analyses revealed novel and innate major outer membrane proteins (omps) of b. bacteriovorus strains. an incorporation of prey-derived proteins into the cell wall of b. bacteriovorus was not observed. the corresponding genes of the b. bacteriovorus strains were elucidated by a reverse-genetics approach, and a leader peptide was deduced from the gene sequence and confirmed by edman degradation. the host-independent mutant strain b. bacteriovorus hi100 (dsm 12732) growing in the absence of prey organisms possesses an omp similar to the major omps of the host-dependent strains. the similarity of the primary structure of the omps produced by the three bdellovibrio strains is between 67 and 89%. the leader peptides of all omps have a length of 20 amino acids and are highly conserved. the molecular sizes of the mature proteins range from 34.9 to 37.6 kda. secondary-structure predictions indicate preferential alpha-helices and little beta-barrel structures.

TI  == genetically modified bacterial strains and novel bacterial artificial chromosome  shuttle vectors for constructing environmental libraries and detecting heterologous natural products in multiple expression hosts.
AB  == the enormous diversity of uncultured microorganisms in soil and other environments provides a potentially rich source of novel natural products, which  is critically important for drug discovery efforts. our investigators reported previously on the creation and screening of an escherichia coli library containing soil dna cloned and expressed in a bacterial artificial chromosome (bac) vector. in that initial study, our group identified novel enzyme activities and a family of antibacterial small molecules encoded by soil dna cloned and expressed in e. coli. to continue our pilot study of the utility and feasibility  of this approach to natural product drug discovery, we have expanded our technology to include streptomyces lividans and pseudomonas putida as additional  hosts with different expression capabilities, and herein we describe the tools we developed for transferring environmental libraries into all three expression hosts and screening for novel activities. these tools include derivatives of s. lividans that contain complete and unmarked deletions of the act and red endogenous pigment gene clusters, a derivative of p. putida that can accept environmental dna vectors and integrate the heterologous dna into the chromosome, and new bac shuttle vectors for transferring large fragments of environmental dna from e. coli to both s. lividans and p. putida by high-throughput conjugation. finally, we used these tools to confirm that the three hosts have different expression capabilities for some known gene clusters.

TI  == a novel r-stereoselective amidase from pseudomonas sp. mci3434 acting on piperazine-2-tert-butylcarboxamide.
AB  == a novel amidase acting on (r,s)-piperazine-2-tert-butylcarboxamide was purified from pseudomonas sp. mci3434 and characterized. the enzyme acted r-stereoselectively on (r,s)-piperazine-2-tert-butylcarboxamide to yield (r)-piperazine-2-carboxylic acid, and was tentatively named r-amidase. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme showed high sequence identity with that deduced from a gene named pa3598 encoding a hypothetical hydrolase in pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1. the gene encoding r-amidase was cloned from the genomic dna of pseudomonas sp. mci3434 and sequenced. analysis of 1332 bp of the  genomic dna revealed the presence of one open reading frame (rama) which encodes  the r-amidase. this enzyme, rama, is composed of 274 amino acid residues (molecular mass, 30 128 da), and the deduced amino acid sequence exhibits homology to a carbon-nitrogen hydrolase protein (pp3846) from pseudomonas putida  strain kt2440 (72.6% identity) and pa3598 protein from p. aeruginosa strain pao1  (65.6% identity) and may be classified into a new subfamily in the carbon-nitrogen hydrolase family consisting of aliphatic amidase, beta-ureidopropionase, carbamylase, nitrilase, and so on. the amount of r-amidase in the supernatant of the sonicated cell-free extract of an escherichia coli transformant overexpressing the rama gene was about 30 000 times higher than that of pseudomonas sp. mci3434. the intact cells of the e. coli transformant could be used for the r-stereoselective hydrolysis of racemic piperazine-2-tert-butylcarboxamide. the recombinant enzyme was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from cell-free extract of the e. coli transformant overexpressing the rama gene. on gel-filtration chromatography, the enzyme appeared to be a monomer. it had maximal activity at 45 degrees c and ph 8.0, and was completely inactivated in the presence of p-chloromercuribenzoate, n-ethylmaleimide, mn2+, co2+, ni2+, cu2+, zn2+, ag+, cd2+, hg2+, or pb2+. rama had hydrolyzing activity toward the carboxamide compounds, in which amino or imino group is connected to beta- or gamma-carbon, such as beta-alaninamide, (r)-piperazine-2-carboxamide (r)-piperidine-3-carboxamide, d-glutaminamide and (r)-piperazine-2-tert-butylcarboxamide. the enzyme, however, did not act on the other amide substrates for the aliphatic amidase despite its sequence similarity  to rama.

AB  == an amidase acting on (r,s)-piperazine-2-tert-butylcarboxamide was purified from pseudomonas azotoformans iam 1603 and characterized. the enzyme acted s-stereoselectively on (r,s)-piperazine-2-tert-butylcarboxamide to yield (s)-piperazine-2-carboxylic acid. n-terminal and internal amino acid sequences of the enzyme were determined. the gene encoding the s-stereoselective piperazine-2-tert-butylcarboxamide amidase was cloned from the chromosomal dna of the strain and sequenced. analysis of 2.1 kb of genomic dna revealed the presence of two orfs, one of which (laaa) encodes the amidase. this enzyme, laaa is composed of 310 amino acid residues (molecular mass 34 514 da), and the deduced amino acid sequence exhibits significant similarity to hypothetical and functionally characterized proline iminopeptidases from several bacteria. the laaa gene modified in the nucleotide sequence upstream from its start codon was overexpressed in escherichia coli. the activity of the recombinant laaa enzyme in cell-free extracts of e. coli was 13.1 units.mg(-1) with l-prolinamide as substrate. this enzyme was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by ammonium sulfate fractionation and two column chromatography steps. on gel-filtration chromatography, the enzyme appeared to be a monomer with a molecular mass of 32 kda. it had maximal activity at 45 degrees c and ph 9.0, and was completely inactivated in the presence of phenylhydrazine, zn2+, ag+, cd2+ or hg2+. laaa had hydrolyzing activity toward l-amino acid amides such as l-prolinamide, l-proline-p-nitroanilide, l-alaninamide and l-methioninamide, but did not act on  the peptide substrates for the proline iminopeptidases despite their sequence similarity to laaa. the enzyme also acted s-stereoselectively on (r,s)-piperidine-2-carboxamide, (r,s)-piperazine-2-carboxamide and (r,s)-piperazine-2-tert-butylcarboxamide. based on its specificity towards l-amino acid amides, the enzyme was named l-amino acid amidase. e. coli transformants overexpressing the laaa gene could be used for the s-stereoselective hydrolysis of (r,s)-piperazine-2-tert-butylcarboxamide.

TI  == high survival and stability rates of escherichia coli dried in hydroxyectoine.
AB  == the tetrahydropyramidine hydroxyectoine acts as an osmolyte in a range of bacterial species, but its use as a desiccation protectant is less well explored. recently, it was demonstrated that hydroxyectoine provides effective stabilisation of the gram-negative species pseudomonas putida, which is only relatively poorly preserved by the better-characterised protectant, trehalose. it is now shown that hydroxyectoine also protects the paradigmatic bacterium, escherichia coli: osmotically-preconditioned e. coli dried in hydroxyectoine exhibited a high degree of desiccation tolerance, similar to that achieved using  trehalose in this species. hydroxyectoine is apparently accumulated from hypersaline medium in preference to trehalose biosynthesis, but e. coli loaded with hydroxyectoine in this way showed reduced stability in the dry state. this suggests that, although both hydroxyectoine and trehalose perform equally well as extracellular protectants, trehalose is preferred for intracellular protection.

TI  == ligand-induced conformational changes and a reaction intermediate in branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase (e1) from thermus thermophilus hb8, as revealed by x-ray crystallography.
AB  == the alpha(2)beta(2) tetrameric e1 component of the branched-chain 2-oxo acid (bcoa) dehydrogenase multienzyme complex is a thiamin diphosphate (thdp)-dependent enzyme. e1 catalyzes the decarboxylation of a bcoa concomitant with the formation of the alpha-carbanion/enamine intermediate, 2-(1-hydroxyalkyl)-thdp, followed by transfer of the 1-hydroxyalkyl group to the  distal sulfur atom on the lipoamide of the e2 component. in order to elucidate the catalytic mechanism of e1, the alpha- and beta-subunits of e1 from thermus thermophilus hb8 have been co-expressed in escherichia coli, purified and crystallized as a stable complex, and the following crystal structures have been  analyzed: the apoenzyme (e1(apo)), the holoenzyme (e1(holo)), e1(holo) in complex with the substrate analogue 4-methylpentanoate (mpa) as an es complex model, and  e1(holo) in complex with 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate (mopa) as the alpha-carbanion/enamine intermediate (e1(ceim)). binding of cofactors to e1(apo)  induces a disorder-order transition in two loops adjacent to the active site. furthermore, upon binding of mpa to e1(holo), the loop comprised of gly121beta-gln131beta moves close to the active site and interacts with mpa. the  carboxylate group of mpa is recognized mainly by tyr86beta and n4' of thdp. the hydrophobic moiety of mpa is recognized by phe66alpha, tyr95alpha, met128alpha and his131alpha. as an intermediate, mopa is decarboxylated and covalently linked to thdp, and the conformation of the protein loop is almost the same as in the substrate-free (holoenzyme) form. these results suggest that e1 undergoes an open-closed conformational change upon formation of the es complex with a bcoa, and the mobile region participates in the recognition of the carboxylate group of the bcoa. es complex models of e1(holo).mopa and of e1(ceim).lipoamide built from the above structures suggest that his273alpha and his129beta' are potential proton donors to the carbonyl group of a bcoa and to the proximal sulfur atom on  the lipoamide, respectively.

TI  == production of 3-hydroxydecanoic acid by recombinant escherichia coli hb101 harboring phag gene.
AB  == heterogenous expression of (r)-3-hydroxydecanoyl-acp:coa transacylase gene (phag) isolated from pseudomonas putida in escherichia coli hb101 led to the extracellular production of 3-hydroxydecanoic acid (3hd) in a growth medium consisting of carbon source non-related to 3hd structure, while no 3hd was detected in the growth media inoculated with wild type e. coli hb101 and recombinant e. coli hb101 harboring vector pbluescript sk- only. 3hd production by e. coli hb101 (plzzgpp) harboring phag from fructose was 587 mg/l, approximately three times that from cultivation in glucose under same culture conditions. 3hd production was affected by timing of fructose addition and fructose concentration in the culture. as an inhibitor of fatty acid de novo synthesis, the presence of triclosan in the culture could increase 3hd production by e. coli hb101 (plzzgpp) by about 20-40%. the results further confirmed that (r)-3-hydroxydecanoyl-acp:coa transacylase (phag) provides 3hd precursors for medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis. at the same time, this phenomenon showed that recombinant organisms can be used for production of certain fine chemicals such as hydroxyalkanoic acids.

AB  == tributyltin (tbt) is a toxic agent used in marine antifouling paints. among the bacterial flora of a polluted harbor, tbt-resistant strains of pseudomonas stutzeri have been isolated. in the strain 5mp1 (tbt minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) > or =1000 mg l(-1)), tbt resistance was found to be associated with the presence of the operon tbtabm, homologous to the resistance-nodulation-cell division (rnd) efflux pump family, as demonstrated by  cloning in escherichia coli. tbtabm exhibited the greatest homology (60.9-84.9%)  with the ttgdef and srpabc systems, both involved in aromatic compound tolerance  in p. putida. tbtabm conferred multidrug resistance (mdr) including to n-hexane,  nalidixic acid, chloramphenicol, and sulfamethoxazole (antibiotic micsx4 for the  e. coli host strain carrying the operon). by polymerase chain reaction amplification and hybridization experiments, the presence of tbtabm was detected  in the tbt-sensitive p. stutzeri 3mp1 (tbt mic 25 mg l(-1)). however, the latter  strain did not seem to express tbtabm. this is the first description of a mdr efflux pump in p. stutzeri, and of a new kind of substrate, tbt, for the rnd family of transporters.

TI  == chromate-reducing properties of soluble flavoproteins from pseudomonas putida and escherichia coli.
AB  == cr(vi) (chromate) is a toxic, soluble environmental contaminant. bacteria can reduce chromate to the insoluble and less toxic cr(iii), and thus chromate bioremediation is of interest. genetic and protein engineering of suitable enzymes can improve bacterial bioremediation. many bacterial enzymes catalyze one-electron reduction of chromate, generating cr(v), which redox cycles, generating excessive reactive oxygen species (ros). such enzymes are not appropriate for bioremediation, as they harm the bacteria and their primary end product is not cr(iii). in this work, the chromate reductase activities of two electrophoretically pure soluble bacterial flavoproteins--chrr (from pseudomonas  putida) and yief (from escherichia coli)-were examined. both are dimers and reduce chromate efficiently to cr(iii) (kcat/km = approximately 2 x 10(4) m(-1) x s(-1)). the chrr dimer generated a flavin semiquinone during chromate reduction and transferred >25% of the nadh electrons to ros. however, the semiquinone was formed transiently and ros diminished with time. thus, chrr probably generates cr(v), but only transiently. studies with mutants showed that chrr protects against chromate toxicity; this is possibly because it preempts chromate reduction by the cellular one-electron reducers, thereby minimizing ros generation. chrr is thus a suitable enzyme for further studies. during chromate reduction by yief, no flavin semiquinone was generated and only 25% of the nadh electrons were transferred to ros. the yief dimer may therefore be an obligatory  four-electron chromate reducer which in one step transfers three electrons to chromate and one to molecular oxygen. as a mutant lacking this enzyme could not be obtained, the role of yief in chromate protection could not be directly explored. the results nevertheless suggest that yief may be an even more suitable candidate for further studies than chrr.

TI  == recombinant escherichia coli for the biomonitoring of benzene and its derivatives in the air.
AB  == for protection against environmental deterioration, pollutants should be reduced  as much as possible. therefore, a sensitive detection method for air pollutants is required, particularly for benzene, a compound with mutagenic, teratogenic, and carcinogenic properties. some microorganisms have a number of enzymes that degrade organic compounds. the genetic information for many of these enzymes is codified in plasmids that usually comprise some elements such as proteins and rna for their replication, and proteins for cell division control. some plasmids have been obtained from pseudomonas putida, a ubiquitous microorganism that is able to degrade biologic and inorganic compounds. p. putida contains the tol plasmid, responsible for the degradation of benzene and its derivatives. the tol plasmid has been fused with the gene for firefly luciferase (ptns316 plasmid) to produce  a luminescent bacterium (escherichia coli hb101), which can be applied to the environmental monitoring of these chemicals. the recombinant e. coli transformed  with the plasmid (e. coli hb101-ptns316) was applied to the environmental biosensing of benzene and its derivatives. measurement of bacteria-generated photons was done using a color-coded device to estimate quantitatively the pollutant concentration. the expression of luciferase was induced in the presence of aromatic compounds but the e. coli sensitivity has a detection limit: this bacterium dies if the benzene concentration is higher than 0.5 ppm and at this concentration the luminescence decreases so it is impossible to detect. another limit for this biodevice is that the microorganism, very likely, accumulates the  benzene and its derivatives, and therefore it is very important to consider the time of exposure. this biomonitor potentially offers a rapid, inexpensive, and sensitive technique for environmental detection of aromatic pollutant compounds.

TI  == influence of polyphenols on bacterial biofilm formation and quorum-sensing.
AB  == many bacteria utilize sophisticated regulatory systems to ensure that some functions are only expressed when a particular population density has been reached. the term 'quorum-sensing' has been coined to describe this form of density-dependent gene regulation which relies on the production and perception of small signal molecules by bacterial cells. as in many pathogenic bacteria the  production of virulence factors is quorum-sensing regulated, it has been suggested that this form of gene regulation allows the bacteria to remain invisible to the defence systems of the host until the population is sufficiently large to successfully establish the infection. here we present first evidence that polyphenolic compounds can interfere with bacterial quorum-sensing. since polyphenols are widely distributed in the plant kingdom, they may be important for promoting plant fitness.

(b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == novel physiological modulation of the pu promoter of tol plasmid: negative regulatory role of the tura protein of pseudomonas putida in the response to suboptimal growth temperatures.
AB  == from crude protein extracts of pseudomonas putida kt2440, we identified a small protein, tura, able to bind to dna fragments bearing the entire pu promoter sequence of the tol plasmid. the knock-out inactivation of the tura gene resulted in enhanced transcription initiation from the pu promoter, initially suggesting a negative regulatory role of tura on pu expression. ectopic expression of tura both in p. putida and in escherichia coli reporter strains and transcription in vitro of the pu promoter in the presence of purified tura confirmed the tura repressor role on pu activity. tura gene inactivation did not significantly alter two well characterized physiological regulations of the pu expression in routine  conditions of cultivation, exponential silencing, and carbon-mediated repression, respectively. however, the growth at suboptimal temperatures resulted in a tura-dependent increase of pu repression. these results strongly suggest that a physiological significance of the negative role of tura on pu activity could be limitation of the expression of the toluene-degrading enzymes at suboptimal growth temperatures. therefore, the identification of tura as pu-binding protein  revealed a novel physiological modulation of pu promoter that is different from those strictly nutritional described previously.

TI  == characterization of a new solvent-responsive gene locus in pseudomonas putida f1  and its functionalization as a versatile biosensor.
AB  == a new gene cluster, designated sepabc and a divergently transcribed sepr, was found downstream of the two-component todst phosphorelay system that regulates toluene degradation (the tod pathway) in pseudomonas putida f1 (ppf1). the deduced amino acid sequences encoded by sepabc show a high homology to bacterial  proteins known to be involved in solvent efflux or multidrug pumps. sepa, sepb and sepc are referred to be periplasmic, inner membrane and outer membrane efflux proteins respectively. effects on growth of various ppf1 mutants compared to that of the wild type in the presence of toluene indicated a possible protective role  of the solvent efflux system in a solvent-stressed environment. growth tests with the complemented mutants confirmed the involvement of the sep proteins in conferring solvent tolerance. the sepr gene encodes a 260-residue polypeptide that is a member of the e. coli iclr repressor protein family. the repressor role of sepr was established by conducting tests with a sep-lacz transcriptional fusion in escherichia coli and ppf1, expression of sepr as a maltose-binding fusion protein in a dna binding assay, and mrna analysis. southern hybridization  experiments and analysis of the p. putida kt2440 genome sequence indicated that sepr is a relatively rare commodity compared to homologues of the sepabc genes. we developed a whole-cell bioluminescent biosensor, ppf1g4, which contains a chromosomally based sep-lux transcriptional fusion. the biosensor showed significant induction of the sepabc genes by a wide variety of aromatic molecules, including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and all three isomers of xylene (btex), naphthalene, and complex mixtures of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. ppf1g4 represents a second-generation biosensor that is not based on a catabolic promoter but is nonetheless inducible by aromatic pollutants and moreover functional under nutrient-rich conditions.

AB  == sigma54 is unique among the bacterial sigma factors. besides not being related in sequence with the rest of such factors, its mechanism of transcription initiation is completely different and requires the participation of a transcription activator. in addition, whereas the rest of the alternative sigma factors use to  be involved in transcription of somehow related biological functions, this is not the case for sigma54 and many different and unrelated genes have been shown to be transcribed from sigma54-dependent promoters, ranging from flagellation, to utilization of several different carbon and nitrogen sources, or alginate biosynthesis. these genes have been characterized in many different bacterial species and, only until recently with the arrival of complete genome sequences, we have been able to look at the sigma54 functional role from a genomic perspective. aided by computational methods, the sigma54 regulon has been studied both in escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium and several species of the rhizobiaceae. here we present the analysis of the sigma54 regulon (sigmulon) in the complete genome of pseudomonas putida kt2440. we have developed an improved method for the prediction of sigma54-dependent promoters which combines the scores of sigma54-rnap target sequences and those of activator binding sites. in  combination with other evidence obtained from the chromosomal context and the similarity with closely related bacteria, we have been able to predict more than  80% of the sigma54-dependent promoters of p. putida with high confidence. our analysis has revealed new functions for sigma54 and, by means of comparative analysis with the previous studies, we have drawn a potential mechanism for the evolution of this regulatory system.

AB  == selective grazing by protists can profoundly influence bacterial community structure, and yet direct, quantitative observation of grazing selectivity has been difficult to achieve. in this investigation, flow cytometry was used to study grazing by the marine heterotrophic flagellate paraphysomonas imperforata on live bacterial cells genetically modified to express the fluorescent protein markers green fluorescent protein (gfp) and red fluorescent protein (rfp). broad-host-range plasmids were constructed that express fluorescent proteins in three bacterial prey species, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, and pseudomonas putida. micromonas pusilla, an alga with red autofluorescence, was also used as prey. predator-prey interactions were quantified by using a facscan  flow cytometer and analyzed by using a perl program described here. grazing preference of p. imperforata was influenced by prey type, size, and condition. in competitive feeding trials, p. imperforata consumed algal prey at significantly lower rates than fp (fluorescent protein)-labeled bacteria of similar or different size. within-species size selection was also observed, but only for p.  putida, the largest prey species examined; smaller cells of p. putida were grazed preferentially. no significant difference in clearance rate was observed between  gfp- and rfp-labeled strains of the same prey species or between wild-type and gfp-labeled strains. in contrast, the common chemical staining method, 5-(4,6-dichloro-triazin-2-yl)-amino fluorescein hydrochloride, depressed clearance rates for bacterial prey compared to unlabeled or rfp-labeled cells.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == crystal structure of putidaredoxin, the [2fe-2s] component of the p450cam monooxygenase system from pseudomonas putida.
AB  == stability of the [2fe-2s]-containing putidaredoxin (pdx), the electron donor to cytochrome p450cam in pseudomonas putida, was improved by mutating non-ligating cysteine residues, cys73 and cys85, to serine singly and in combination. the increasing order of stability is cys73ser/cys85ser>cys73ser>cys85ser>wt pdx. crystal structures of cys73ser/cys85ser and cys73ser mutants of pdx, solved by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing using the [2fe-2s] iron atoms to 1.47 a and 1.65 a resolution, respectively, are nearly identical and very similar to those of bovine adrenodoxin (adx) and escherichia coli ferredoxin. however, unlike the adx structure, no motion between the core and interaction domains of pdx is observed. this higher conformational stability of pdx might be due to the  presence of a more extensive hydrogen bonding network at the interface between the two structural domains around the conserved his49. in particular, formation of a hydrogen bond between the side-chain of tyr51 and the carbonyl oxygen atom of glu77 and the presence of two well-ordered water molecules linking the interaction domain and the c-terminal peptide to the core of the molecule are unique to pdx. the folding topology of the nmr model is similar to that of the x-ray structure of pdx. the overall rmsd of calpha positions between the two models is 1.59 a. the largest positional differences are observed for residues 18-21 and 33-37 in the loop regions and the c terminus. the latter two peptides display conformational heterogeneity in the crystal structures. owing to flexibility, the aromatic ring of the c-terminal trp106 can closely approach the  side-chains of asp38 and thr47 (3.2-3.9 a) or move away and leave the active site solvent-exposed. therefore, trp106, previously shown to be important in the pdr-to-pdx and pdx-to-p450cam electron transfer reactions is in a position to regulate and/or mediate electron transfer to or from the [2fe-2s] center of pdx.

TI  == direct detection and quantification of horizontal gene transfer by using flow cytometry and gfp as a reporter gene.
AB  == a new cultivation-independent method for studying conjugal gene transfer between  bacteria was evaluated. the method was based on direct detection and enumeration  of donor and transconjugant bacterial cells by flow cytometry. specific detection of transconjugants was obtained by using a conjugative plasmid tagged with a reporter gene (gfp) encoding green fluorescent protein. a chromosomal encoded repressor (laci(ql)) repressed expression of gfp in the donor bacteria. enumeration of the donor cells was performed after induction of gfp expression by the addition of inducer isopropyl-thio-beta-d-galactoside (iptg). the method presented here provided simple and precise quantification of horizontal gene transfer between both escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida strains.

TI  == catalytic mechanism of dichloromethane dehalogenase from methylophilus sp. strain dm11.
AB  == the glutathione (gsh)-dependent dichloromethane dehalogenase from methylophilus sp. strain dm11 catalyzes the dechlorination of ch(2)cl(2) to formaldehyde via a  highly reactive, genotoxic intermediate, s-(chloromethyl)glutathione (gs-ch(2)cl). the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme toward a series of dihalomethane and monohaloethane substrates suggests that the initial addition of gsh to the alkylhalides is fast and that the rate-limiting step in turnover is the release of either the peptide product or formaldehyde. with the exception of  ch(2)clf, which forms a relatively stable gs-ch(2)f intermediate, the turnover numbers for a series of dihalomethanes fall in a very narrow range (1-3 s(-1)). the pre-steady-state kinetics of the dm11-catalyzed addition of gsh to ch(3)ch(2)br exhibits a burst of s-(ethyl)-glutathione (k(b) = 96 +/- 56 s(-1)) followed by a steady state with k(cat) = 0.13 +/- 0.01 s(-1). the turnover numbers for ch(3)ch(2)cl, ch(3)ch(2)br, and ch(3)ch(2)i are identical, indicating a common rate-limiting step. the turnover numbers of the enzyme with ch(3)ch(2)br and ch(3)ch(2)i are dependent on viscosity and are very close to the measured off-rate of gset. the turnover number with ch(2)i(2) is also dependent on viscosity, suggesting that a diffusive step is rate-limiting with dihaloalkanes as well. the rate constants for solvolysis of ch(3)sch(2)cl, a model for gs-ch(2)cl, range between 1 s(-1) (1:1 dioxane/water) and 64 s(-1) (1:10 dioxane/water). solvolysis of the s-(halomethyl)glutathione intermediates may also occur in the active site of the enzyme preventing the release of the genotoxic species. together, the results indicate that dissociation of the gs-ch(2)x or gs-ch(2)oh intermediates from the enzyme may be a relatively rare event.

TI  == a specific region in the n terminus of a replication initiation protein of plasmid rk2 is required for recruitment of pseudomonas aeruginosa dnab helicase to the plasmid origin.
AB  == broad host range plasmid rk2 encodes two versions of its essential replication initiation protein, trfa, using in-frame translational starts spaced 97 amino acids apart. the smaller protein, trfa-33, is sufficient for plasmid replication  in many bacterial hosts. efficient replication in pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, specifically requires the larger trfa-44 protein. with the aim of identifying sequences of trfa-44 required for stable replication of rk2 in p. aeruginosa, specific deletions and a substitution mutant within the n terminus sequence unique to trfa-44 were constructed, and the mutant proteins were tested  for activity. deletion mutants were targeted to three of the four predicted helical regions in the first 97 amino acids of trfa-44. deletion of trfa-44 amino acids 21-32 yielded a mutant protein, trfa-44delta2, that had lost the ability to bind and load the dnab helicase of p. aeruginosa or pseudomonas putida onto the rk2 origin in vitro and did not support stable replication of an rk2 mini-replicon in p. aeruginosa in vivo. a substitution of amino acid 22 within this essential region resulted in a protein, trfa-44e22a, with reduced activity in vitro, particularly with the p. putida helicase. deletion of amino acids 37-55 (trfa-44delta3) slightly affected protein activity in vitro with the p. aeruginosa helicase and significantly with the p. putida helicase, whereas deletion of amino acids 71-88 (trfa-44delta4) had no effect on trfa activity in vitro with either helicase. these results identify regions of the trfa-44 protein that are required for recruitment of the pseudomonas dnab helicases in the initiation of rk2 replication.

TI  == genetic characterization of a novel metallo-beta-lactamase gene, blaimp-13, harboured by a novel tn5051-type transposon disseminating carbapenemase genes in  europe: report from the sentry worldwide antimicrobial surveillance programme.
AB  == objective: in 2001, as part of the sentry worldwide antimicrobial surveillance programme, pseudomonas aeruginosa 86-14571a was isolated at a hospital in rome from a cancer patient with a bloodstream infection. the isolate was resistant to  all antibiotics except amikacin, and displayed an imipenem mic of 64 mg/l that decreased to 8 mg/l in the presence of edta. the resistance determinant was investigated. methods: the resistant determinant was cloned in escherichia coli using a shotgun cloning approach. results: sequence analysis revealed the presence of a novel imp-type metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl) gene, blaimp-13. this encoded a protein displaying most identity to imp variants: 93% and 92.3% identity, respectively, to imp-8 and imp-2 (previously identified in italy). the  protein had 19 amino acid changes from imp-2 and 17 amino acid changes from imp-8. the blaimp-13 gene was found as a gene cassette in the first position of a class 1 integron. a 25 bp inverted repeat sequence iri was identified 174 bp upstream of the class i integrase, which suggests that the integron is found on a tn402-like transposon, or defective transposon derivative. this element, in turn, is located in the transposition locus (tnp region) of a tn21 subfamily transposon that showed most identity to tn5051, a transposon recently identified from a strain of pseudomonas putida isolated in new york. interestingly, the insertion point of the tn402-like transposon and the sequence of the tn5051-like genes were identical to those of the genetic element harbouring blavim-2 recently identified in poland. conclusions: the resistance determinant of p. aeruginosa 86-14571a is  a novel imp-type mbl carried on a composite transposon responsible for wide geographical dissemination of mbl genes in europe.

TI  == characterization of hybrid toluate and benzoate dioxygenases.
AB  == toluate dioxygenase of pseudomonas putida mt-2 (tado(mt2)) and benzoate dioxygenase of acinetobacter calcoaceticus adp1 (bado(adp1)) catalyze the 1,2-dihydroxylation of different ranges of benzoates. the catalytic component of  these enzymes is an oxygenase consisting of two subunits. to investigate the structural determinants of substrate specificity in these ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases, hybrid oxygenases consisting of the alpha subunit of one enzyme and the beta subunit of the other were prepared, and their respective specificities were compared to those of the parent enzymes. reconstituted bado(adp1) utilized four of the seven tested benzoates in the following order of apparent specificity: benzoate > 3-methylbenzoate > 3-chlorobenzoate > 2-methylbenzoate. this is a significantly narrower apparent specificity than for tado(mt2) (3-methylbenzoate > benzoate approximately 3-chlorobenzoate > 4-methylbenzoate approximately 4-chlorobenzoate >> 2-methylbenzoate approximately 2-chlorobenzoate [y. ge, f. h. vaillancourt, n. y. agar, and l. d. eltis, j. bacteriol. 184:4096-4103, 2002]). the apparent substrate specificity of the alphabbetat hybrid oxygenase for these benzoates corresponded to that of bado(adp1), the parent from which the alpha subunit originated. in contrast, the apparent substrate specificity of the alphatbetab hybrid oxygenase differed slightly from  that of tado(mt2) (3-chlorobenzoate > 3-methylbenzoate > benzoate approximately 4-methylbenzoate > 4-chlorobenzoate > 2-methylbenzoate > 2-chlorobenzoate). moreover, the alphatbetab hybrid catalyzed the 1,6-dihydroxylation of 2-methylbenzoate, not the 1,2-dihydroxylation catalyzed by the tado(mt2) parent.  finally, the turnover of this ortho-substituted benzoate was much better coupled  to o2 utilization in the hybrid than in the parent. overall, these results support the notion that the alpha subunit harbors the principal determinants of specificity in ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases. however, they also demonstrate that the beta subunit contributes significantly to the enzyme's function.

AB  == in bacteria, polynucleotide phosphorylase (pnpase) is one of the main exonucleolytic activities involved in rna turnover and is widely conserved. in spite of this, pnpase does not seem to be essential for growth if the organisms are not subjected to special conditions, such as low temperature. we identified the pnpase-encoding gene (pnp) of pseudomonas putida and constructed deletion mutants that did not exhibit cold sensitivity. in addition, we found that the transcription pattern of pnp upon cold shock in p. putida was markedly different  from that in escherichia coli. it thus appears that pnp expression control and the physiological roles in the cold may be different in different bacterial species.

TI  == role of pseudomonas putida tol-oprl gene products in uptake of solutes through the cytoplasmic membrane.
AB  == proteins of the tol-pal (tol-oprl) system play a key role in the maintenance of outer membrane integrity and cell morphology in gram-negative bacteria. here we describe an additional role for this system in the transport of various carbon sources across the cytoplasmic membrane. growth of pseudomonas putida tol-oprl mutant strains in minimal medium with glycerol, fructose, or arginine was impaired, and the growth rate with succinate, proline, or sucrose as the carbon source was lower than the growth rate of the parental strain. assays with radiolabeled substrates revealed that the rates of uptake of these compounds by mutant cells were lower than the rates of uptake by the wild-type strain. the pattern and amount of outer membrane protein in the p. putida tol-oprl mutants were not changed, suggesting that the transport defect was not in the outer membrane. consistently, the uptake of radiolabeled glucose and glycerol in spheroplasts was defective in the p. putida tol-oprl mutant strains, suggesting that there was a defect at the cytoplasmic membrane level. generation of a proton motive force appeared to be unaffected in these mutants. to rule out the possibility that the uptake defect was due to a lack of specific transporter proteins, the putp symporter was overproduced, but this overproduction did not enhance proline uptake in the tol-oprl mutants. these results suggest that the tol-oprl system is necessary for appropriate functioning of certain uptake systems at the level of the cytoplasmic membrane.

AB  == a new variant type of regulatory activator and relevant promoters (designated capr, pr and po) involved in the metabolism of phenolic compounds were cloned from pseudomonas putida kctc1452 by using pcr. the deduced amino acid sequence of capr revealed a difference in nine amino acids from the effector binding domain of dmpr. to measure effector specificity, plasmids were constructed in such a way that the expression of luc gene for firefly luciferase or lacz for beta-galactosidase as a reporter was under the control of capr. when escherichia  coli transformed with the plasmids was exposed to phenol, dramatic increases in the activity of luciferase or beta-galactosidase were observed in a range of 0.01-1 mm. among various phenolic compounds tested, other effective compounds included catechol, 2-methylphenol, 3-methylphenol, 4-methylphenol, 2-chlorophenol, 4-chlorophenol, 2-nitrophenol, resorcinol, and 2, 5-dimethylphenol. the results indicate that capr has effector specificity different from other related activators, catr and dmpr. waste water and soil potentially containing phenolic compounds were also tested by this system and the results were compared with chemical and gc data. the present results indicate that the biosensor consisting of capr and the promoters may be utilized for the development of a phenolic compounds-specific biosensor in monitoring the environmental pollutant.

TI  == co-operative interactions control conjugative transfer of broad host-range plasmid rk2: full effect of minor changes in trba operator depends on korb.
AB  == a network of circuits, with korb and trba as key regulators, controls genes for conjugative transfer of broad host range plasmid rk2. to assess the importance of the trba regulon, mutational analysis was applied to the trba operator at the trbb promoter and then to other trba-regulated promoters in the tra region. all identified trba operators are submaximal; in the case of trbbp, a g to a transition that made the operator core a perfect palindrome increased repression  by about 50% compared to the wild type. when this change was introduced into the  rk2 genome, decreases in transfer frequency of up to three orders of magnitude were observed, with bigger effects when escherichia coli was the donor compared to pseudomonas putida. western blotting showed a significant decrease in trb protein levels. these effects were much greater than the effect of the mutation on repression by trba alone. when korb was introduced into the reporter system, the effects were closer to those observed in the whole rk2 context. these results indicate that co-operativity, previously observed between trba and korb, allows big changes in transfer gene expression to result from small changes in individual regulator activities.

AB  == 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (kdpg) aldolase from pseudomonas putida is a key enzyme in the entner-doudoroff pathway which catalyses the cleavage of kdpg via a class i schiff-base mechanism. the crystal structure of this enzyme has been refined to a crystallographic residual r = 17.1% (r(free) = 21.4%). the n-terminal helix caps one side of the torus of the (betaalpha)(8)-barrel and the  active site is located on the opposite, carboxylic side of the barrel. the schiff-base-forming lys145 is coordinated by a sulfate (or phosphate) ion and two solvent water molecules. the interactions that stabilize the trimer are predominantly hydrophobic, with the exception of the cyclically permuted bonds formed between glu132 oe1 of one molecule and thr129 og1 of a symmetry-equivalent molecule. except for the n-terminal helix, the structure of kdpg aldolase from p. putida closely resembles the structure of the homologous enzyme from escherichia  coli.

TI  == a multifunctional plasmid-encoded replication initiation protein both recruits and positions an active helicase at the replication origin.
AB  == the dnaa replication initiation protein has been shown to be essential for dna strand opening at the at-rich region of the replication origin of the escherichia coli chromosome as well as serving to recruit and position the dnab replicative helicase at this open region. homologues of the dnaa gene of e. coli have been found in most bacterial species, and the dnaa protein has been shown to be required for the initiation of replication of both chromosomal and plasmid dna. for several plasmid elements it has been found that a plasmid-encoded initiation  protein is required along with the dnaa protein to bring about opening of the at-rich region at the replication origin. the broad host range plasmid rk2 encodes two forms of its replication initiation protein (trfa-33 and trfa-44) that differ by an additional 98 aa at the n terminus of the larger (trfa-44) form. both forms initiate replication of rk2 in e. coli in vitro by a dnaa-dependent mechanism. however, as shown in this study, trfa-44 specifically interacts with the dnab replicative helicase of pseudomonas putida and pseudomonas aeruginosa and initiates the formation of a prepriming open complex in the absence of dnaa protein. thus, the trfa-44 initiation protein has the multifunctional properties of recruiting and positioning an active form of the dnab helicase at the rk2 replication origin by a dnaa-independent process. this unique property for a replication initiation protein undoubtedly plays an important role in extending the host range of the rk2 antibiotic resistance plasmid.

TI  == control of rpos transcription in escherichia coli and pseudomonas: why so different?
AB  == in escherichia coli, the stationary phase alternative sigma factor sigmas controls the expression of genes involved cell survival in response to cessation  of growth (stationary phase) and provides cross-protection to various stresses. levels of sigmas increase dramatically at the onset of stationary phase and are regulated at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational level, making this one of the most complex regulatory systems in bacteria. the basic mechanisms for the control of translation and sigmas proteolysis have been  understood. however, studies on the transcriptional control in e. coli lag behind and are controversial. the camp-crp complex and the two component bara/uvry system have been implicated and, ppgpp and polyphosphate appear to have a signalling role. sigmas has also been reported to be a general stress regulator in the fluorescent pseudomonads (pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. fluorescens and p. putida) and recent studies on sigmas regulation highlight that transcriptional regulation in these bacteria apparently plays a major role. global regulatory systems, the gaca/gacs two component system and quorum sensing all affect rpos expression, as does the tetr family psra regulator that directly binds to- and activates the rpos promoter in stationary phase. this striking difference in regulation between e. coli and pseudomonas can be partly attributed to the differences in the functional role of sigmas in the two bacterial species. this report will review mainly recent studies on rpos transcriptional regulation and will try to rationalize the current knowledge into a working model.

AB  == the non-heme diiron enzyme xylene monooxygenase (xylm) has been shown to hydroxylate hydrocarbons via a hydrogen abstraction-carbon radical recombination  mechanism (oxygen rebound). using the radical clock bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane (norcarane) in a whole-cell assay, and observing the ratio of rearranged 3-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexene and unrearranged 2-norcaranol products, the lifetime of the substrate radical was determined to be approximately 0.2 ns. the wild-type organism pseudomonas putida mt-2 and two separate escherichia coli clones expressing xylma genes gave similar results. one clone produced the pseudomonas putida mt-2 xylma hydroxylase and the other produced sphingomonas yanoikuyae b1 xylma hydroxylase. clones were constructed by inserting genes for xylene monooxygenase and xylene monooxygenase reductase downstream from an iptg-inducible t7 promoter. mechanistic investigations using whole-cell assays will facilitate more rapid screening of structure-function relationships and the  identification of novel oxygenases. this approach should enable the construction  of a picture of the key metalloenzymes and the mechanisms they use in selected parts of the global carbon cycle without requiring the isolation of every protein involved.

AB  == unstable variants of green fluorescent protein (gfp) tagged with c-terminal extensions, which are targets for a tail specific protease, have been described in escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida [appl. envir. microbiol. 64 (1998) 2240]. we investigated whether similar modifications to flow cytometer optimised  gfp (gfpmut2) could be used to generate unstable variants of gfp for gene expression studies in mycobacteria. we constructed gfp variants in a mycobacterial shuttle vector under the control of the regulatory region of the inducible mycobacterium smegmatis acetamidase gene. gfp expression was induced by the addition of acetamide and the stability of the gfp variants in m. smegmatis,  following the removal of the inducer to switch off their expression, was determined using spectrofluorometry and flow cytometry. we demonstrate that, compared to the gfpmut2 (half-lives>7 days), the modified gfp variants exhibit much lower half-lives (between 70 and 165 min) in m. smegmatis. to investigate their utility in the measurement of mycobacterial gene expression, we cloned the  promoter region of a putative amino acid efflux pump gene, lyse (rv1986), from mycobacterium tuberculosis together with the divergently transcribed, putative lysr-type regulator gene (rv1985c) upstream of one of the unstable gfp variants.  we found that the expression kinetics of the lysre-gfp fusion were identical throughout the m. smegmatis growth curve to those measured using a conventional lysre-xyle reporter fusion, peaking upon entry into stationary phase. in addition, it was established that the tagged gfp variants were also unstable in mycobacterium bovis bcg. thus, we have demonstrated that unstable gfp variants are suitable reporter genes for monitoring transient gene expression in fast- and slow-growing mycobacteria.

TI  == biosynthesis of pyridoxine in saccharomyces cerevisiae--origin of the pyridoxine  nitrogen atom differs under anaerobic and aerobic conditions.
AB  == the amide nitrogen atom of glutamine is incorporated into pyridoxine in four eukaryotes (i.e., emericella nidulans, mucor racemosus, neurospora crassa and saccharomyces cerevisiae) and two prokaryotes (i.e., staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis). however, in the prokaryotes pseudomonas putida, enterobacter  aerogenes and escherichia coli, it is the nitrogen atom of glutamate that is incorporated into pyridoxine (j nutr sci vitaminol (2000) 46, 55-57). as these results were from experiments conducted under aerobic conditions, we investigated the biosynthesis of pyridoxine on s. cerevisiae under anaerobic conditions. the results showed that [amide-15n]l-glutamine was not incorporated into pyridoxine,  unlike the results for aerobic conditions. the incorporation of [15n]ammonium salts into pyridoxine was not inhibited in the presence of casamino acids and tryptophan. the results showed that the nitrogen atoms of amino acids are not used for the biosynthesis of pyridoxine. the incorporation of 15n into pyridoxine was inhibited in the presence of adenine, but not in that of hypoxanthine. thus,  the nitrogen atom of pyridoxine may be from the amino group attached to the c-6 of adenine.

TI  == long-term reduction of cold hardiness following ingestion of ice-nucleating bacteria in the colorado potato beetle, leptinotarsa decemlineata.
AB  == we investigated the effect of ingestion of ice-nucleating bacteria on the supercooling capacity and cold hardiness of the colorado potato beetle (leptinotarsa decemlineata say), a freeze-intolerant species that overwinters as  adults in shallow, terrestrial burrows. ingestion of ice-nucleating bacteria (enterobacter agglomerans, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas syringae), fed on slices of potato tuber, caused an abrupt decrease in supercooling capacity. no change occurred in the supercooling capacity of beetles fed escherichia coli, as this species lacks ice-nucleating activity. ingestion rates showed that tubers treated with different species were equally palatable. during diapause induction beetles evacuated food from their guts, but  nevertheless retained sufficient ice-nucleating bacteria to diminish supercooling. beetles fed p. fluorescens and p. putida exhibited reduced supercooling even after an 8-wk exposure to simulated winter conditions. furthermore, p. fluorescens was isolated 10-wk post-ingestion from diapausing beetles. our data suggest that ingested bacteria may be retained by insects during entry into diapause and that the cold hardiness of candidate crop pests, such as l. decemlineata, may be reduced by feeding them ice-nucleating bacteria prior to winter diapause.

TI  == functional analyses of genes involved in the metabolism of ferulic acid in pseudomonas putida kt2440.
AB  == pseudomonas putida kt2440 is a physiologically extremely versatile non-pathogenic bacterium that is applied as a "biosafety strain" in biotechnological processes,  as authorized by the usa national institute of health. analysis of the p. putida  kt2440 whole-genome sequence revealed the genetic organization of the genes fcs,  ech, and vdh, which are essential for ferulic acid conversion to vanillic acid via vanillin. to confirm the physiological function of these structural genes as  feruloyl-coa synthetase (fcs), enoyl-coa hydratase/aldolase (ech), and vanillin dehydrogenase (vdh), respectively, they were cloned and expressed in escherichia  coli. recombinant strains harboring fcs and ech were able to transform ferulic acid to vanillin. the enzyme activities of fcs and vdh were determined in protein extracts of these cells. the essential involvement of fcs, ech and vdh in the catabolism of ferulic acid in p. putida kt2440 was proven by separately inactivating each gene by insertion of omega-elements. the corresponding mutant strains kt2440 fcsomegakm, kt2440 echomegakm, and kt2440 vdhomegakm were not able to grow on ferulic acid. the potential application of p. putida kt2440 and the mutant strains in biotechnological vanillin production process is discussed.

TI  == gene cluster of arthrobacter ilicis ru61a involved in the degradation of quinaldine to anthranilate: characterization and functional expression of the quinaldine 4-oxidase qoxlms genes.
AB  == a genetic analysis of the anthranilate pathway of quinaldine degradation was performed. a 23-kb region of dna from arthrobacter ilicis ru61a was cloned into the cosmid pvk100. although escherichia coli clones containing the recombinant cosmid did not transform quinaldine, cosmids harboring the 23-kb region, or a 10.8-kb stretch of this region, conferred to pseudomonas putida kt2440 the ability to cometabolically convert quinaldine to anthranilate. the 10.8-kb fragment thus contains the genes coding for quinaldine 4-oxidase (qox), 1h-4-oxoquinaldine 3-monooxygenase, 1h-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinaldine 2,4-dioxygenase, and n-acetylanthranilate amidase. the qoxlms genes coding for the molybdopterin cytosine dinucleotide-(mcd-), fesi-, fesii-, and fad-containing qox were inserted into the expression vector pjb653, generating pkp1. qox is the first mcd-containing enzyme to be synthesized in a catalytically fully competent form by a heterologous host, p. putida kt2440 pkp1; the catalytic properties and the uv-visible and epr spectra of qox purified from p. putida kt2440 pkp1 were essentially like those of wild-type qox. this provides a starting point for the construction of protein variants of qox by site-directed mutagenesis. downstream  of the qoxlms genes, a putative gene whose deduced amino acid sequence showed 37% similarity to the cofactor-inserting chaperone xdhc was located. additional open  reading frames identified on the 23-kb segment may encode further enzymes (a glutamyl trna synthetase, an esterase, two short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases, an atpase belonging to the aaa family, a 2-hydroxyhepta-2,4-diene-1,7-dioate isomerase/5-oxopent-3-ene-1,2,5-tricarboxylate decarboxylase-like protein, and an enzyme of the mandelate racemase group) and hypothetical proteins involved in transcriptional regulation, and metabolite transport.

TI  == imp-12, a new plasmid-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase from a pseudomonas putida clinical isolate.
AB  == a pseudomonas putida strain showing broad-spectrum resistance to beta-lactams, including expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenems, was isolated from a patient with a urinary tract infection at the university hospital of varese in northern italy. the isolate was found to produce metallo-beta-lactamase activity  and to harbor a 50-kb plasmid, named pva758, carrying a new bla(imp) determinant, named bla(imp-12). plasmid pva758 was not self-transferable by conjugation to either escherichia coli or pseudomonas aeruginosa but could be introduced by electroporation and maintained in the latter host, where it conferred resistance  or decreased susceptibility to various beta-lactams. the imp-12 enzyme is quite divergent from other imp variants: its closest relatives are imp-8 and imp-2 (89  and 88% sequence identity, respectively), and imp-1 is 85% identical to imp-12. the bla(imp-12) determinant is carried on an integron-borne gene cassette whose attc recombination site is related to those present in cassettes containing bla(imp-1), bla(imp-6), bla(imp-7), bla(imp-10), and bla(imp-11) and unrelated to that present in cassettes containing bla(imp-2) and bla(imp-8). imp-12 was overproduced in e. coli by using a t7-based expression system and was purified by cation-exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration. kinetic analysis revealed that, like other imp variants, imp-12 exhibits an overall preference for cephalosporins and carbapenems rather than for penicillins and does not hydrolyze temocillin and aztreonam. however, imp-12 also exhibits some notable functional differences from other imp variants, including uniformly poor activity toward penicillins (k(cat)/k(m) values, around 10(4) m(-1). s(-1)) and a remarkably high k(m) (around 900 micro m) for imipenem.

TI  == chemical biotechnology for the specific oxyfunctionalization of hydrocarbons on a technical scale.
AB  == oxygenases catalyze, among other interesting reactions, highly selective hydrocarbon oxyfunctionalizations, which are important in industrial organic synthesis but difficult to achieve by chemical means. many enzymatic oxygenations have been described, but few of these have been scaled up to industrial scales, due to the complexity of oxygenase based biocatalysts and demanding process implementation. we have combined recombinant whole-cell catalysis in a two-liquid phase system with fed-batch cultivation in an optimized medium and developed an industrially feasible process for the kinetically controlled and complex multistep oxidation of pseudocumene to 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde using the xylene  monooxygenase of pseudomonas putida mt-2 in escherichia coli. successful scale up to 30 l working volume using downscaled industrial equipment allowed a productivity of 31 g l(-1) d(-1) and a product concentration of 37 g l(-1). these performance characteristics meet present industry requirements. product purification resulted in the recovery of 469 g of 3,4-dimethyl- benzaldehyde at a purity of 97% and an overall yield of 65%. this process illustrates the general feasibility of industrial biocatalytic oxyfunctionalization.

AB  == lupanine hydroxylase catalyses the first reaction in the catabolism of the alkaloid lupanine by pseudomonas putida. it dehydrogenates the substrate, which can then be hydrated. it is a monomeric protein of m(r) 72,000 and contains a covalently bound haem and a molecule of pqq. the gene for this enzyme has been cloned and sequenced and the derived protein sequence has a 26 amino acid signal  sequence at the n-terminal for translocation of the protein to the periplasm. many of the features seen in the sequence of lupanine hydroxylase are common with other quinoproteins including the w-motifs that are characteristic of the eight-bladed propeller structure of methanol dehydrogenase. however, the unusual  disulfide bridge between adjacent cysteines that is present in some pqq-containing enzymes is absent in lupanine hydroxylase. the c-terminal domain contains characteristics of a cytochrome c and overall the sequence shows similarities with that of the quinohaemoprotein, alcohol dehydrogenase from comamonas testosteroni. the gene coding for lupanine hydroxylase has been successfully expressed in escherichia coli and a procedure has been developed to  renature and reactivate the enzyme, which was found to be associated with the inclusion bodies. reactivation required addition of pqq and was dependent on calcium ions.

AB  == the adaptive responses of the bacterium acinetobacter calcoaceticus to different  aliphatic alcohols on the level of the membrane fatty acids were studied in detail. the toxicity of the aliphatic alcohols increased with an increasing hydrophobicity. as alcohols are known to increase the fluidity of the membrane they consequently should cause the same adaptive effect on membrane level. yet, cells of a. calcoaceticus react completely different to the alcohols: in the presence of long-chained alcohols they increase their degree of saturation, while in the presence of short-chained alcohols they decrease the degree of saturation. so, there are no observable differences in the adaptive responses of bacteria with the so-called anaerobic pathway, like escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida, and the bacterium carrying the so-called aerobic pathway like a. calcoaceticus. these results strongly indicate a physico-chemical difference in the membrane effect of both the partitioning and localisation of the different alcohols into the membrane and the membrane adaptive responses of the bacteria to these effects.

TI  == identification of a novel gsp-related pathway required for secretion of the manganese-oxidizing factor of pseudomonas putida strain gb-1.
AB  == the manganese-oxidizing factor of pseudomonas putida strain gb-1 is associated with the outer membrane. one of the systems of protein transport across the outer membrane is the general secretory pathway (gsp). the gsp genes are called xcp in  pseudomonas species. in a previous study, it was shown that mutation of the prepilin peptidase xcpa and of a homologue of the pseudopilin xcpt inhibited transport of the factor. in the present study, we describe the genomic region flanking the xcpt homologue (designated xcmt1). we show that xcmt1 is part of a two-gene operon that includes an xcps homologue (designated xcms). no other xcp-like genes are present in the regions flanking the xcmt1/xcms cluster. we also characterized the site of transposon insertion of another transport mutant of p. putida gb-1. this insertion appeared to be located in a gene (designated xcmx) possibly encoding another pseudopilin-related protein. this xcmx is clustered with two other xcpt-related genes (designated xcmt2 and xcmt3) on one side and homologues of three csg genes (designated csme, csmf and csmg) on the other side. the csg genes are involved in production of aggregative fibres in escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. a search for xcmx homologues revealed that the recently published genome of ralstonia solanacearum and the unannotated genome of p. putida kt2440 contain comparable gene clusters with xcmx and xcp homologues that are different from the well-described 'regular'xcp/gsp clusters. they do contain xcpr and xcpq homologues but, for example, homologues of xcpp, y and z are lacking. the results suggest a novel xcp-related system for  the transport of manganese-oxidizing enzymes to the cell surface.

AB  == traditionally, chemical analyses are used in the assessment of contaminated soil  and in monitoring the efficiency of soil remediation processes. we investigated if chemical analysis could be supported and even partly replaced by biological toxicity tests. in two case studies creosote-contaminated soil was composted outdoors in 5- and 100-m3 windrows. degradation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) was followed by chemical analysis and toxicity tests. polyaromatic hydrocarbons were quantified and identified by hplc. because the soil was also contaminated by copper-, chromium-, and arsenic-containing fungicides, these elements were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry. the toxicity of soil samples was assessed by a soil-contact modification of the luminescent bacteria (vibrio fischeri) test and in the other case also by enzyme synthesis inhibition  (toxi-chromopad test, escherichia coli). the toxicity of soil water extracts was  measured by the standard luminescent bacteria (v. fischeri) test and bacterial (pseudomonas putida) growth inhibition test. after the first 4 months of the composting period the total amount of pahs was reduced in all windrows, and in particular, the loss of two- and some three-ring compounds was high, almost 90%.  toxicity decreased concurrently with the decrease in pah concentration during composting, but after 4 months, one of the piles inoculated with mycobacteria and containing more three- and four-ring compounds was found to be more toxic than at the beginning. after the next summer, total pah content was further reduced but some four-ring or heavier compounds were demonstrated to be poorly degraded. the  toxicity was also reduced to the same level as in the control pile. the total pah content and the toxicity were both reduced significantly during 5 months of composting.

AB  == biotechnological upgrading of fossil fuels is of increasing interest as remaining stocks of petroleum show increasing levels of contaminants such as heavy metals,  sulfur and nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic compounds. carbazole is of particular interest as a major petroleum component known to reduce refining yields through catalyst poisoning. in this study, the biotransformation of carbazole was successfully demonstrated in a liquid two-phase system, when solubilized in either 1-methylnaphthalene or in diesel fuel. the effects of solvent toxicity were investigated by expressing the carbazole-transformation genes from mb1332, a rifampicin-resistant derivative of pseudomonas sp. ld2, in a solvent-resistant heterologous host, p. putida idaho [1]. this solvent-resistant  strain successfully degraded carbazole solubilized in 1-methylnaphthalene and in  the presence of 10 vol% xylenes similar to the non-recombinant strain pseudomonas sp. ld2. identification of a suitable recombinant host, however, was essential for further investigations of partial pathway transformations. recombinant p. putida idaho expressing only the initial dioxygenase enzymes transformed carbazole to an intermediate well retained in the oil phase. partial carbazole transformation converts carbazole to non-aromatic species; their effect is unknown on refinery catalyst poisoning, but would allow almost complete retention of carbon content and fuel value.

AB  == rhizosphere isolate pseudomonas sp. strain bw11m1, which belongs to the pseudomonas putida cluster, secretes a heat- and protease-sensitive bacteriocin which kills p. putida gr12-2r3. the production of this bacteriocin is enhanced by dna-damaging treatment of producer cells. we isolated a tnmod mutant of strain bw11m1 that had lost the capacity to inhibit the growth of strain gr12-2r3. a wild-type genomic fragment encompassing the transposon insertion site was shown to confer the bacteriocin phenotype when it was introduced into escherichia coli  cells. the bacteriocin structural gene was identified by defining the minimal region required for expression in e. coli. this gene was designated llpa (lectin-like putidacin) on the basis of significant homology of its 276-amino-acid product with mannose-binding lectins from monocotyledonous plants. llpa is composed of two monocot mannose-binding lectin (mmbl) domains. several uncharacterized bacterial genes encoding diverse proteins containing one or two mmbl domains were identified. a phylogenetic analysis of the mmbl domains present in eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins assigned the putidacin domains to a new bacterial clade within the mmbl-containing protein family. heterologous expression of the llpa gene also conveyed bacteriocin production to several pseudomonas fluorescens strains. in addition, we demonstrated that strain bw11m1  and heterologous hosts secrete llpa into the growth medium without requiring a cleavable signal sequence. most likely, the mode of action of this lectin-like bacteriocin is different from the modes of action of previously described pseudomonas bacteriocins.

TI  == use of the two-liquid phase concept to exploit kinetically controlled multistep biocatalysis.
AB  == the two-liquid phase concept was used to develop a whole cell biocatalytic system for the efficient multistep oxidation of pseudocumene to 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde. recombinant escherichia coli cells were employed to express the pseudomonas putida genes encoding xylene monooxygenase, which catalyzes the multistep oxygenation of one methyl group of toluene and xylenes to corresponding alcohols, aldehydes, and acids. a fed-batch based two-liquid phase  bioconversion was established with bis(2-ethylhexyl)- phthalate as organic carrier solvent and a phase ratio of 0.5; the product formation pattern, the impact of the nutrient feeding strategy, and the partitioning behavior of the reactants were studied. on the basis of the favorable conditions provided by the  two-liquid phase system, engineering of the initial pseudocumene concentration allowed exploiting the complex kinetics of the multistep reaction for the exclusive production of 3,4-dimethyl- benzaldehyde. further oxidation of the product to 3,4-dimethylbenzoic acid could be inhibited by suitable concentrations of pseudocumene or 3,4-dimethylbenzyl alcohol. the optimized biotransformation setup includes a completely defined medium with high iron content and a nutrient  feeding strategy that avoids severe glucose limitation as well as high inhibitory glucose levels. using such a system on a 2-liter scale, we were able to produce,  within 14.5 h, 30 g of 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde as predominant reactant in the organic phase and reached a maximal productivity of 1.6 g per liter liquid volume per hour. the present study implicates that the two-liquid phase concept is an efficient tool to exploit the kinetics of multistep biotransformations in general.

TI  == measurement of strain-dependent toxicity in the indene bioconversion using multiparameter flow cytometry.
AB  == the bionconversion of indene to cis-(1s,2r)-indandiol, a potential key intermediate in the synthesis of merck's hiv protease inhibitor, crixivan trade mark, can be achieved using rhodococcus, pseudomonas putida, and escherichia coli strains. this study reports on the application of multiparameter flow cytometry for the measurement of cytoplasmic membrane integrity and membrane depolarization as indicators of toxic effects of the substrate, product, and by-products using each of these strains. measurements of oxygen uptake rate (our) and optical density (od) as indicators of metabolic activity and biomass growth, respectively, were also made. measurements of the cytoplasmic membrane potential, cell viability, and respiratory activity provided a sensitive set of parameters to assess toxicity in the indene bioconversion and provided the basis for process improvements and strain selection. the toxic concentrations of the substrate, product, and by-products for each strain have been determined. the results show that it is possible to accumulate cis-(1s,2r)-indandiol and cis-1-amino-2-indanol up to 20 g/l without significant negative effects on cell physiology using any of the strains tested. the gram-negative p. putida (421-5 and gm 730) and e. coli strains were more resistant to indene and the isolated chemicals of the biotransformation than the gram-positive rhodoccoccus i24 strain, possibly due to the presence of the outer membrane and efflux pump mechanisms. p. putida gm 730 and the e. coli tdo 123 strains responded similarly to toxic effects, and the e.  coli tdo 123 strain was more resistant than the p. putida 421-5 strain. in addition to the recommendations for strain selection, the identified targets for  bioprocess improvement include a combination of genetic as well as process engineering approaches.

TI  == transcriptional organization of the pseudomonas putida tol-oprl genes.
AB  == proteins of the tol system play a key role in the maintenance of outer membrane integrity and cell morphology in gram-negative bacteria. in pseudomonas putida, the seven genes, orf1, tolq, tolr, tola, tolb, oprl, and orf2, which encode the proteins of this complex, are clustered in a 5.8-kb region of chromosomal dna. analysis of polar mutations, reverse transcriptase pcr assays, and transcriptional fusion constructs with a promoterless lacz gene revealed that the genes are arranged in two operons: orf1 tolq tolr tola tolb and oprl orf2. we were also able to find a transcript that was initiated at the orf1 promoter and covered the two operons in a single mrna. on the basis of the oprl protein level, we surmised that this transcript contributed only about 10 to 15% of the total oprl protein. primer extension analysis identified the oprl orf2 operon promoter  within the tolb gene, and the -10 and -35 regions exhibited some similarity to those of sigma(70)-recognized promoters. the transcription start point of orf1 was located 91 bp upstream of the orf1 start codon, and the -10/-35 region also exhibited sigma(70) -10/-35 recognition sequences. the expression from both promoters in rich and minimal media was constitutive and was very little influenced by the growth phase or iron-deficient conditions. in addition, analyses of the beta-galactosidase activities of different translational fusion constructs revealed that translation of tola and orf2 genes was dependent on the  translation of their corresponding upstream genes (tolr and oprl, respectively).

AB  == the evolution in india of multi-drug resistant pathogens possessing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) threatens to compromise the clinical utility of third-generation cephalosporins and monobactams. using selected resistant strains from a recent indian 10 centre surveillance study that measured the prevailing incidence of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, the potential  clinical utility of meropenem was assessed against nine other antimicrobial agents. a total of 212 gram-negative bacilli were tested, of which 125 were confirmed by reference methods to be esbl-producers. meropenem was the most active of the test antimicrobials against these strains and the rank order of susceptibility was meropenem (99.1% susceptible) > piperacillin/tazobactam (76.9%) > ciprofloxacin (42.5%) > aminoglycosides (34.4-39.6%) = other beta-lactams (30.0-39.6%). of the tested strains only two (acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas putida) showed an intermediate susceptibility (8 mg/l) to meropenem.  of the 57 tested strains of salmonella spp., three had an esbl phenotype, confirmed two of the strains. this study confirms the high levels of resistance to beta-lactams agents in india reported elsewhere and also demonstrates, for escherichia coli and klebsiella spp., high levels of co-resistance between the tested beta-lactam agents and ciprofloxacin and the aminoglycosides, gentamicin and tobramycin. however, carbapenems such as meropenem, remain a therapeutic option.

TI  == gene cloning and characterization of multiple alkane hydroxylase systems in rhodococcus strains q15 and nrrl b-16531.
AB  == the alkane hydroxylase systems of two rhodococcus strains (nrrl b-16531 and q15,  isolated from different geographical locations) were characterized. both organisms contained at least four alkane monooxygenase gene homologs (alkb1, alkb2, alkb3, and alkb4). in both strains, the alkb1 and alkb2 homologs were part of alk gene clusters, each encoding two rubredoxins (ruba1 and ruba2; ruba3 and ruba4), a putative tetr transcriptional regulatory protein (alku1; alku2), and, in the alkb1 cluster, a rubredoxin reductase (rubb). the alkb3 and alkb4 homologs were found as separate genes which were not part of alk gene clusters. functional heterologous expression of some of the rhodococcal alk genes (alkb2, ruba2, and ruba4 [nrrl b-16531]; alkb2 and rubb [q15]) was achieved in escherichia coli and  pseudomonas expression systems. pseudomonas recombinants containing rhodococcal alkb2 were able to mineralize and grow on c(12) to c(16) n-alkanes. all rhodococcal alkane monooxygenases possessed the highly conserved eight-histidine  motif, including two apparent alkane monooxygenase signature motifs (lqrh[s/a]dhh and nyxehyg[l/m]), and the six hydrophobic membrane-spanning regions found in all alkane monooxygenases related to the pseudomonas putida gpo1 alkane monooxygenase. the presence of multiple alkane hydroxylases in the two rhodococcal strains is reminiscent of other multiple-degradative-enzyme systems reported in rhodococcus.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of the escherichia coli r1 plasmid host killing peptide.
AB  == the 52 amino acid host killing peptide (hok) from the hok/sok post-segregational  killer system of the escherichia coli plasmid r1 was synthesized using fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) chemistry, and its molecular weight was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. hok kills cells by depolarizing the cytoplasmic membrane when  it is made in the cytosol. six microorganisms, e. coli, bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. putida, salmonella typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus were exposed to the purified peptide but showed no significant killing. however, electroporation of hok (200 microgml(-1)) into e. coli cells showed a dramatic reduction (100000-fold) in the number of cells transformed with plasmid  dna which indicates that the synthetic hok peptide killed cells. electroporation  of hok into p. putida was also very effective with a 500-fold reduction in electrocompetent cells (100 microgml(-1)). heat shock in the presence of hok (380 microgml(-1)) resulted in a 5-fold reduction in e. coli cells but had no effect on b. subtilis. in addition, three hok fragments (hok(1-28), hok(31-52) and hok(16-52)) killed cells when electroporated into e. coli at 200 microgml(-1) (over 1000-fold killing for hok(1-28), 50-fold killing for hok(16-52) and over 1000-fold killing for hok(31-52)). e. coli cells electroporated with hok and visualized using transmission electron microscopy showed the same morphological changes as control cells to which hok was induced using a plasmid inside the cell.

TI  == nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant isolates of pseudomonas putida producing vim-1 metallo-beta-lactamase.
AB  == successful carbapenem-based chemotherapy for the treatment of pseudomonas infections has been seriously hindered by the recent appearance of imp- and vim-type metallo-beta-lactamases, which confer high-level resistance to carbapenems and most other beta-lactams. recently, multidrug-resistant pseudomonas putida isolates for which carbapenem mics were >/=32 micro g/ml were  recovered from cultures of urine from three inpatients in the general intensive care unit of the ospedale di circolo, varese, italy. enzyme assays revealed production of a metallo-beta-lactamase activity, while molecular analysis detected in each isolate a bla(vim-1) determinant carried by an apparently identical medium-sized plasmid. conjugation experiments were unsuccessful in transferring the beta-lactamase determinant to escherichia coli or pseudomonas aeruginosa. macrorestriction analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the isolates were of clonal origin. pcr mapping and sequencing  of the variable region of the plasmid-borne class 1 integron carrying the bla(vim-1) determinant (named in110) showed that the bla(vim-1)-containing cassette was identical to that previously found in strains of different species from other italian hospitals and that the cassette array of in110 was not identical but clearly related to that of in70 (a bla(vim-1)-containing plasmid-borne integron from an achromobacter xylosoxidans isolate), pointing to a common origin of this cassette and to a related evolutionary history of their cognate integrons.

TI  == identification and broad dissemination of the ctx-m-14 beta-lactamase in different escherichia coli strains in the northwest area of spain.
AB  == during the course of a molecular epidemiology study of mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in the area served by our hospital (516,000 inhabitants), we isolated  the gene encoding ctx-m-14 beta-lactamase. thirty clinical strains (27 escherichia coli and 3 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates) with a phenotype of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase were collected from january to october 2001 and  studied for the presence of the ctx-m-14 beta- lactamase gene. by isoelectric point determination, pcr, and nucleotide sequencing, we detected the presence of  this gene in 17 e. coli strains belonging to 15 different genotypes (rep-pcr) causing infections in 17 different patients. epidemiological studies based on medical records did not suggest any relationship between the patients infected with these e. coli strains and, interestingly, 7 of 30 patients harboring strains with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases never had contact with the hospital environment before the clinical e. coli isolation. conjugation experiments revealed that this gene was plasmid mediated in the 17 e. coli strains, and plasmid restriction fragment length polymorphisms showed 9 different patterns in  the 17 e. coli strains. by pcr, the sequence of the tnpa transposase gene of the  insert sequence isecp-1 was detected in all the plasmids harboring the ctx-m-14 gene. these results strongly suggest that plasmid dissemination between different e. coli strains in addition to a mobile element (transposon) around the beta-lactamase gene may be involved in the spreading of the ctx-m-14 gene. this study reinforces the hypothesis that the epidemiology of the prevalence of the beta-lactamase genes is changing and should alert the medical community to the increase in the emergence of the ctx-m beta-lactamases worldwide.

TI  == two dnab genes are associated with the origin of replication of pqbr55, an exogenously isolated plasmid from the rhizosphere of sugar beet.
AB  == plasmid pqbr55 ( approximately 149 kb) represents one of five (groups i-v) genetically distinct transfer proficient, mercury resistance plasmid groups that  have been observed in the phytosphere pseudomonad community at a single geographic location in oxford, uk. a 4.9-kb hindiii fragment was cloned from pqbr55 (a group iii plasmid) that facilitates autonomous replication of a narrow  host range cloning vector, pkil29, in the non-permissive host pseudomonas putida  uwc1. sequencing revealed that the fragment contains a unique tandem array of dnab genes (one partial and one complete), a homologue of the traa gene of plasmid rp4 and several potential open reading frames with little homology to any known sequences. the fragment also contains: a short region of direct and indirect repeats, two sequences that resemble the consensus escherichia coli dnaa box motif, an a+t rich region and evidence of a gc-skew inversion. all features associated with origins of replication. two specific oligonucleotide primer pairs, one targeted at the tandem dnab genes and the other at the dnab-traa arrangement were used for pcr analysis of other plasmids isolated from the same field site. pcr generated amplification products were only amplified from group iii plasmids (defined by rflp typing) but not from plasmids belonging to group i, ii, iv or v. the nucleotide sequences of the amplified fragments were identical to those of pqbr55, even though the other group iii plasmids had distinct rflp patterns. the results of a more general pcr screen, using primers to amplify a 389-bp fragment of all described pseudomonad dnab genes, suggests that closely related dnab sequences are only associated with group iii plasmids.

TI  == the crystal structure of ydce, a 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase homologue from escherichia coli, confirms the structural basis for oligomer diversity.
AB  == the tautomerase superfamily consists of three major families represented by 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-ot), 5-(carboxymethyl)-2-hydroxymuconate isomerase (chmi), and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (mif). the members of this superfamily are structurally homologous proteins constructed from a simple beta-alpha-beta fold that share a key mechanistic feature; they use an amino-terminal proline, which has an unusually low pk(a), as the general base in  a keto-enol tautomerization. several new members of the 4-ot family have now been identified using psi-blast and categorized into five subfamilies on the basis of  multiple-sequence alignments and the conservation of key catalytic and structural residues. the members of subfamily 5, which includes a hypothetical protein designated ydce from escherichia coli, are predicted not to form hexamers. the crystal structure of ydce has been determined to 1.35 a resolution and confirms that it is a dimer. in addition, ydce complexed with (e)-2-fluoro-p-hydroxycinnamate, identified as a potent competitive inhibitor of  this enzyme, as well as n-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-n'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (hepes) and benzoate are also presented. these latter crystal structures reveal the location of the active site and suggest a mechanism for the observed ydce-catalyzed tautomerization reaction. the dimeric arrangement of ydce represents a new structure in the 4-ot family and demonstrates structural diversity within the 4-ot family not previously reported.

TI  == spectroscopic studies of peroxyacetic acid reaction intermediates of cytochrome p450cam and chloroperoxidase.
AB  == it is generally assumed that the putative compound i (cpd i) in cytochrome p450 should contain the same electron and spin distribution as is observed for cpd i of peroxidases and catalases and many synthetic cpd i analogues. in these systems one oxidation equivalent resides on the fe(iv)=o unit (d(4), s=1) and one is located on the porphyrin (s'=1/2), constituting a magnetically coupled ferryl iron-oxo porphyrin pi-cation radical system. however, this laboratory has recently reported detection of a ferryl iron (s=1) and a tyrosyl radical (s'=1/2), via mossbauer and epr studies of 8 ms-reaction intermediates of substrate-free p450cam from pseudomonas putida, prepared by a freeze-quench method using peroxyacetic acid as the oxidizing agent [schunemann et al., febs lett. 479 (2000) 149]. in the present study we show that under the same reaction  conditions, but in the presence of the substrate camphor, only trace amounts of the tyrosine radical are formed and no fe(iv) is detectable. we conclude that camphor restricts the access of the heme pocket by peroxyacetic acid. this conclusion is supported by the additional finding that binding of camphor and metyrapone inhibit heme bleaching at room temperature and longer reaction times,  forming only trace amounts of 5-hydroxy-camphor, the hydroxylation product of camphor, during peroxyacetic acid oxidation. as a control we performed freeze-quench experiments with chloroperoxidase from caldariomyces fumago using peroxyacetic acid under the identical conditions used for the substrate-free p450cam oxidations. we were able to confirm earlier findings [rutter et al., biochemistry 23 (1984) 6809], that an antiferromagnetically coupled fe(iv)=o porphyrin pi-cation radical system is formed. we conclude that cpo and p450 behave differently when reacting with peracids during an 8-ms reaction time. in p450cam the formation of fe(iv) is accompanied by the formation of a tyrosine radical, whereas in cpo fe(iv) formation is accompanied by the formation of a porphyrin radical.

AB  == zinc is essential but toxic in excess. bacterial metallothionein, smta from synechococcus pcc 7942, sequesters and detoxifies four zinc ions per molecule and contains a zinc finger structurally similar to eukaryotic gata. the dearth of other reported bacterial metallothioneins has been surprising. here we describe related bacterial metallothioneins (bmta) from anabaena pcc 7120, pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas putida that bind multiple zinc ions with high stability towards protons. thiol modification demonstrates that cysteine coordinates zinc in all of these proteins. additionally, (111)cd-nmr, and (111)cd-edited (1)h-nmr, identified histidine ligands in anabaena pcc 7120 bmta,  analogous to smta. a related escherichia coli protein bound only a single zinc ion, via four cysteine residues, with low stability towards protons; (111)cd-nmr  and (111)cd-edited (1)h-nmr confirmed exclusive cysteine-coordination, and these  cysteine residues reacted rapidly with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid). (1)h-nmr of proteins from p. aeruginosa, anabaena pcc 7120 and e. coli generated  fingerprints diagnostic for the gata-like zinc finger fold of smta. these studies reveal first the existence of multiple bacterial metallothioneins, and second proteins with smta-like lone zinc fingers, devoid of a cluster,and designated gata. we have identified 12 smta-like genes in sequence databases including four  of the gata type.

TI  == biochemical characterization of the pseudomonas putida 3-hydroxyacyl acp:coa transacylase, which diverts intermediates of fatty acid de novo biosynthesis.
AB  == the 3-hydroxyacyl acp:coa transacylase (phag) was recently identified in various  pseudomonas species and catalyzes the diversion of acp thioester intermediates of fatty acid de novo biosynthesis toward the respective coa thioesters, which serve as precursors for polyester and rhamnolipid biosynthesis. phag from pseudomonas putida was overproduced in escherichia coli as a c-terminal hexahistidine-tagged  (his(6)) fusion protein in high yield. the his(6)-phag was purified to homogeneity by refolding of phag obtained from inclusion bodies, and a new enzyme assay was established. kinetic analysis of the 3-hydroxyacyl transfer to acp, catalyzed by his(6)-phag, gave k(0.5) values of 28 microm (acp) and 65 microm (3-hydroxyacyl-coa) considering v(max) values of 11.7 milliunits/mg and 12.4 milliunits/mg, respectively. a hill coefficient of 1.38 (acp) and 1.32 (3-hydroxyacyl-coa) indicated a positive substrate cooperativity. subcellular localization studies showed that phag is not attached to polyester granules and resides in the cytosol. gel filtration chromatography analysis in combination with light scattering analysis indicated substrate-induced dimerization of the transacylase. a threading model of phag was developed based on the homology to an epoxide hydrolase (1cqz). in addition, the alignment with the alpha/beta-hydrolase fold region indicated that phag belongs to alpha/beta-hydrolase superfamily. accordingly, cd analysis suggested a secondary  structure composition of 29% alpha-helix, 22% beta-sheet, 18% beta-turn, and 31%  random coil. site-specific mutagenesis of seven highly conserved amino acid residues (asp-60, ser-102, his-177, asp-182, his-192, asp-223, his-251) was used  to validate the protein model and to investigate organization of the transacylase active site. only the d182(a/e) mutation was permissive with about 30% specific activity of the wild type enzyme. furthermore, this mutation caused a change in substrate specificity, indicating a functional role in substrate binding. the serine-specific agent phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pmsf) or the histidine-specific agent diethylpyrocarbonate (depc) caused inhibition of 3-hydroxyacyl transfer to holo-acp, and the s102(a/t) or h251(a/r) phag mutant was incapable of catalyzing 3-hydroxyacyl transfer, suggesting that these residues are part of a catalytic triad.

AB  == anhydrobiotic engineering aims to increase the level of desiccation tolerance in  sensitive organisms to that observed in true anhydrobiotes. in addition to a suitable extracellular drying excipient, a key factor for anhydrobiotic engineering of gram-negative enterobacteria seems to be the generation of high intracellular concentrations of the nonreducing disaccharide trehalose, which can be achieved by osmotic induction. in the soil bacterium pseudomonas putida kt2440, however, only limited amounts of trehalose are naturally accumulated in defined high-osmolarity medium, correlating with relatively poor survival of desiccated cultures. based on the enterobacterial model, it was proposed that increasing intracellular trehalose concentration in p. putida kt2440 should improve survival. using genetic engineering techniques, intracellular trehalose concentrations were obtained which were similar to or greater than those in enterobacteria, but this did not translate into improved desiccation tolerance. therefore, at least for some populations of microorganisms, trehalose does not appear to provide full protection against desiccation damage, even when present at high concentrations both inside and outside the cell. for p. putida kt2440, it was shown that this was not due to a natural limit in desiccation tolerance since successful anhydrobiotic engineering was achieved by use of a different drying excipient, hydroxyectoine, with osmotically preconditioned bacteria for which 40  to 60% viability was maintained over extended periods (up to 42 days) in the dry  state. hydroxyectoine therefore has considerable potential for the improvement of desiccation tolerance in sensitive microorganisms, particularly for those recalcitrant to trehalose.

TI  == plant growth-promoting pseudomonas putida wcs358 produces and secretes four cyclic dipeptides: cross-talk with quorum sensing bacterial sensors.
AB  == the most universal cell-cell signaling mechanism in gram-negative bacteria occurs via the production and response to a class of small diffusible molecules called n-acylhomoserine lactones (ahls). this communication is called quorum sensing and is responsible for the regulation of several physiological processes and many virulence factors in pathogenic bacteria. the detection of these molecules has been rendered possible by the utilization of genetically engineered bacterial biosensors which respond to the presence of exogenously supplied ahls. in this study, using diverse bacterial biosensors, several biosensor activating fractions were purified by organic extraction, hplc and tlc of cell-free culture supernatants of plant growth-promoting pseudomonas putida wcs358. surprisingly, it was observed that the most abundant compounds in these fractions were cyclic dipeptides (diketopiperazines, dkps), a rather novel finding in gram-negative bacteria. the purification, characterization, chemical synthesis of four dkps are reported and their possible role in cell-cell signaling is discussed.

TI  == aerobic metabolism of phenylacetic acids in azoarcus evansii.
AB  == the aerobic metabolism of phenylacetic acid (pa) and 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4-ohpa) was investigated in the beta-proteobacterium azoarcus evansii. evidence  for the existence of two independent catabolic pathways for pa and 4-ohpa is presented. 4-ohpa metabolism involves the formation of 2,5-dihydroxyphenylacetate (homogentisate) and maleylacetoacetate catalyzed by specifically induced 4-ohpa 1-monooxygenase and homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase. the metabolism of pa starts by its activation to phenylacetyl-coa (pa-coa) via an aerobically induced phenylacetate-coenzyme a ligase. phenylalanine (phe) aerobic metabolism in this bacterium proceeds also via pa and pa-coa. whole cells of a. evansii transformed  [1-(14)c]pa to (14)c-phenylacetyl-coa and subsequently to a number of unknown labeled products, which were also observed in pa-degrading bacteria from different phylogenetic groups, i.e. escherichia coli, rhodopseudomonas palustrisand bacillus stearothermophilus. a chromosomal region from a. evansiiof  11.5 kb containing a cluster of 11 phenylacetic acid catabolic ( paa) genes ( paayzghikabcde) was sequenced and characterized. the derived gene products were similar to the characterized putative gene products involved in pa catabolism in  e. coli and pseudomonas putida and to other putative pa catabolic gene products of diverse bacteria. rt-pcr analysis of the paa genes of a. evansiigrowing aerobically with pa showed a probable organization of the paa genes in three operons. the similarity of the pa metabolic products pattern and of gene sequences suggests a common aerobic bacterial pa pathway.

TI  == survival of an aeromonas hydrophila in an artificial mineral water microcosm.
AB  == the survival capacity of an aeromonas hydrophila strain (named sb14) isolated from mineral water was investigated in an artificial mineral water microcosm. the bacterial count of this microorganism was compared with two strains of other species from aquatic environments (pseudomonas fluorescens ssd and pseudomonas putida ssc) and a bacterium indicative of faecal pollution (escherichia coli atcc 25922). among the strains, all added to sterile pyrex glass flasks (1 l) to yield a final bacterial count of about 5 x 10(6) cfu/ml, a. hydrophila sb14 showed a quite strong survival capacity (150 days), even though the pseudomonas strains were better adapted to this habitat (more than 240 days). e. coli atcc 25922 was  the least well fitted to survive and was no longer detected after 70 days. when a. hydrophila sb14 was inoculated together with one or two of the above strains,  its survival appeared to be dependent on interaction with other organisms. a marked decrease in survival by 30 days, possibly due to antagonistic interaction, was observed when this microorganism was associated with e. coli atcc 25922, and  an increase by 30 and 60 days, possibly due to commensalic interaction, was obtained when a. hydrophila sb14 was inoculated with p. fluorescens ssd or p. putida ssc, respectively.

TI  == molecular analysis of aerobic phenylacetate degradation in azoarcus evansii.
AB  == the azoarcus evansii gene which codes for phenylacetate-coa ligase, an enzyme involved in the aerobic degradation of phenylacetate, was isolated from a genomic library, using as the probe a fragment of the gene which encodes the isoenzyme that is induced under anaerobic conditions. by this means both the gene and its flanking sequences were recovered. the gene is homologous to the phenylacetate-coa ligase genes of pseudomonas putida u and escherichia coli w. induction by phenylacetate under aerobic growth conditions was demonstrated using lacz fusions. western analysis showed that phenylacetate-coa ligase is involved in the degradation of the aromatic amino acid phenylalanine. genes coding for the phenylacetate-coa ligase and for the putative hydroxylating enzyme were expressed in e. coli. detection of 2-hydroxyphenylacetate in the recombinant e. coli strain indicated hydroxylation of phenylacetyl-coa. the gene pacl, which codes for the putative ring-opening enzyme was mutated to enable the isolation of intermediates in aerobic phenylacetic acid degradation, which were characterized by gc-ms and nmr analyses.

TI  == site-specific recombination system encoded by toluene catabolic transposon tn4651.
AB  == the 56-kb class ii toluene catabolic transposon tn4651 from pseudomonas putida plasmid pww0 is unique in that (i) its efficient resolution requires, in addition to the 0.2-kb resolution (res) site, the two gene products tnps and tnpt and (ii) the 2.4-kb tnpt-res-tnps region is 48 kb apart from the tnpa gene (m. tsuda, k.-i. minegishi, and t. iino, j. bacteriol. 171:1386-1393, 1989). detailed analysis of the 2.4-kb region revealed that the tnps and tnpt genes encoding the  putative 323- and 332-amino-acid proteins, respectively, were transcribed divergently with an overlapping 59-bp sequence in the 203-bp res site. the motifs (the r-h-r-y tetrad in domains i and ii with proper spacing) commonly conserved in the integrase family of site-specific recombinases were found in tnps. in contrast, tnpt did not show any significant amino acid sequence homology to the other proteins that are directly or indirectly involved in recombination. analysis of site-specific recombination under the escherichia coli reca cells indicated that (i) the site-specific resolution between the two copies of the res site on a single molecule was catalyzed by tnps, (ii) the functional res site was located within a 95-bp segment, and (iii) tnpt appeared to have the role of enhancing the site-specific resolution. it was also found that tnps catalyzed the site-specific recombination between the res sites located at two different molecules to form a cointegrate molecule. site-specific mutagenesis of the conserved tyrosine residue in tnps led to the loss of both the resolution and the integration activities, indicating that such a residue took part in both types of recombination.

TI  == tolerance of bacteria to organic solvents.
AB  == organic-solvent-tolerant bacteria are a relatively novel group of extremophilic microorganisms. they overcome the toxic and destructive effects of organic solvents due to the presence of various adaptive mechanisms. extensive studies done on the toluene tolerance of certain pseudomonas strains have led to an understanding of the mechanisms of organic solvent tolerance involving novel adaptations such as the toluene efflux pumps, cis-trans isomerisation of membrane fatty acids, rapid membrane repair mechanisms, etc. organic-solvent-tolerant mutants of escherichia coli have been constructed and genes enhancing such tolerance characterised. however, there is practically no information available on the tolerance mechanisms of the reported gram-positive organic-solvent-tolerant bacterial strains like bacillus, rhodococcus and arthrobacter. this review discusses the general aspects of organic-solvent-tolerant bacteria, their history, biodiversity, mechanisms of tolerance and proposes certain probable adaptations of gram-positive bacteria in  tolerance to organic solvents.

TI  == mechanisms of solvent tolerance in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == organic solvents can be toxic to microorganisms, depending on the inherent toxicity of the solvent and the intrinsic tolerance of the bacterial species and  strains. the toxicity of a given solvent correlates with the logarithm of its partition coefficient in n-octanol and water (log pow). organic solvents with a log pow between 1.5 and 4.0 are extremely toxic for microorganisms and other living cells because they partition preferentially in the cytoplasmic membrane, disorganizing its structure and impairing vital functions. several possible mechanisms leading to solvent-tolerance in gram-negative bacteria have been proposed: (a) adaptive alterations of the membrane fatty acids and phospholipid headgroup composition, (b) formation of vesicles loaded with toxic compounds, and (c) energy-dependent active efflux pumps belonging to the resistance-nodulation-cell division (rnd) family, which export toxic organic solvents to the external medium. in these mechanisms, changes in the phospholipid profile and extrusion of the solvents seem to be shared by different strains. the most significant changes in phospholipids are an increase in the melting temperature of the membranes by rapid cis-to-trans isomerization of unsaturated fatty acids and modifications in the phospholipid headgroups. toluene efflux pumps are involved in solvent tolerance in several gram-negative strains, e.g., escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the acrab-tolc  and acref-tolc efflux pumps are important for n-hexane tolerance in e. coli. a number of p. putida strains have been isolated that tolerate toxic hydrocarbons such as toluene, styrene, and p-xylene. at least three efflux pumps (ttgabc, ttgdef, and ttgghi) are present in the most extensively characterized solvent-tolerant strain, p. putida dot-t1e, and the number of efflux pumps has been found to correlate with the degree of solvent tolerance in different p. putida strains. the operation of these efflux pumps seems to be coupled to the proton motive force via the tonb system, although the intimate mechanism of energy transfer remains elusive. specific and global regulators control the expression of the efflux pump operons of e. coli and p. putida at the transcriptional level.

TI  == the role of the fatty acid beta-oxidation multienzyme complex from pseudomonas oleovorans in polyhydroxyalkanoate biosynthesis: molecular characterization of the fadba operon from p. oleovorans and of the enoyl-coa hydratase genes phaj from p. oleovorans and pseudomonas putida.
AB  == in order to investigate the role of the putative epimerase function of the beta-oxidation multienzyme complex (fadba) in the provision of (r)-3-hydroxyacyl-coa thioesters for medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha(mcl)) biosynthesis, the fadba(po) operon of pseudomonas oleovorans was cloned and characterized. the fadba(po) operon and a class-ii pha synthase gene of pseudomonas aeruginosa were heterologously co-expressed in escherichia coli to determine whether the putative epimerase function of fadba(po) has the ability to provide precursors for pha accumulation in a non-pha-accumulating bacterium. cultivation studies with fatty acids as carbon source revealed that fadba(po) did not mediate pha(mcl) biosynthesis in the e. coli wild-type strain harboring a pha synthase gene. however, pha accumulation was strongly impaired in a recombinant e. coli fadb mutant, which harbored a pha synthase gene. these data indicate that in pseudomonads fadba does not possess the inherent property, based on a putative epimerase function, to provide the ( r)-enantiomer of 3-hydroxyacyl-coa efficiently and that other linking enzymes are required to efficiently channel intermediates of beta-oxidation towards pha(mcl) biosynthesis. however, the phaj  gene from p. oleovorans and from pseudomonas putida, both of which encoded a 3- re enoyl-coa hydratase, was identified. the co-expression of phaj(po/pp) with either a class-ii pha synthase gene or the pha synthase gene from aeromonas punctata in e. coli revealed that phaj(po/pp) mediated biosynthesis of either pha(mcl), contributing to about 1% of cellular dry mass, or of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate- co-3-hydroxyhexanoate), contributing to 3.6% of cellular  dry mass, when grown on decanoate. these data indicate that fadba(po)does not mediate the provision of (r)-3-hydroxyacyl-coa, which resembles fadba of non-pha-accumulating bacteria, and that 3- re enoyl-coa hydratases are required to divert intermediates of fatty acid beta-oxidation towards pha biosynthesis in  p. oleovorans.

TI  == plant-specific promoter sequences carry elements that are recognised by the eubacterial transcription machinery.
AB  == during evolution the promoter elements from prokaryotes and eukaryotes have developed differently with regard to their sequence and structure, implying that  in general a transfer of eukaryotic promoter sequences into prokaryotes will not  cause an efficient gene expression. however, there have been reports on the functionality of the 35s promoter from cauliflower mosaic virus (camv) in bacteria. we therefore decided to experimentally investigate the capability of plant promoter sequences to direct gene expression in various bacteria. accordingly, we tested ten different plant-specific promoters from solanum tuberosum, nicotiana tabacum, camv, agrobacterium tumefaciens, and a. rhizogenes  for their ability to initiate transcription in five different eubacterial species (escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, a. tumefaciens, pseudomonas putida, and acinetobacter sp. bd413). to monitor the strength of the plant-specific promoters in bacteria we created fusions between these promoters and the coding region of the luciferase genes from vibrio harveyi and measured the luminescence  in the bacteria. heterologous gene expression was observed in 50% of the combinations analysed. we then mapped the transcription start site caused by one  of the plant-specific promoters, the st-ls1 promoter from s. tuberosum, in these  bacterial species. the location of the mapped transcription start site indicated  that the sequences of the plant promoter themselves were recognised by the bacterial transcription apparatus. the recognition of plant-specific promoter sequences by the bacterial rna polymerase was further confirmed by site-directed  mutagenesis of the st-ls1 promoter and the analysis of the effects of the mutations on the strength of gene expression in e. coli. using these mutants in our reporter assays we could localise the sequences of the st-ls1 promoter serving as -10 region in e. coli. the results of our study show that promoter sequences are much less specific than is generally assumed. this is of great importance for our knowledge about the evolution of gene expression systems and for the construction of optimised expression vectors.

TI  == reactivity of toluate dioxygenase with substituted benzoates and dioxygen.
AB  == toluate dioxygenase (tado) of pseudomonas putida mt-2 catalyzes the dihydroxylation of a broad range of substituted benzoates. the two components of  this enzyme were hyperexpressed and anaerobically purified. reconstituted tado had a specific activity of 3.8 u/mg with m-toluate, and each component had a full complement of their respective fe(2)s(2) centers. steady-state kinetics data obtained by using an oxygraph assay and by varying the toluate and dioxygen concentrations were analyzed by a compulsory order ternary complex mechanism. tado had greatest specificity for m-toluate, displaying apparent parameters of kma = 9 +/- 1 microm, k(cat) = 3.9 +/- 0.2 s(-1), and k(m)o(2) = 16 +/- 2 microm  (100 mm sodium phosphate, ph 7.0; 25 degrees c), where k(m)o(2) represents the k(m) for o(2) and kma represents the k(m) for the aromatic substrate. the enzyme  utilized benzoates in the following order of specificity: m-toluate > benzoate approximately 3-chlorobenzoate > p-toluate approximately 4-chlorobenzoate >> o-toluate approximately 2-chlorobenzoate. the transformation of each of the first five compounds was well coupled to o(2) utilization and yielded the corresponding 1,2-cis-dihydrodiol. in contrast, the transformation of ortho-substituted benzoates was poorly coupled to o(2) utilization, with >10 times more o(2) being  consumed than benzoate. however, the apparent k(m) of tado for these benzoates was >100 microm, indicating that they do not effectively inhibit the turnover of  good substrates.

AB  == a pseudomonas putida capable of degrading polychlorinated biphenyl was also found to transform 4-nitrocatechol to 3-nitro-2-hydroxy-6-oxohexa-2,4-dienoic acid (nhoda). crude cell extract of this bacterium exhibited an enzyme (nitrocatechol  dioxygenase, ndo) activity catalyzing this transformation. the gene encoding ndo  was cloned in e. coli. the cloned gene (ndo) expressed in e. coli had enzyme activity that degraded not only 4-nitrocatechol but also 4-chlorocatechol, 4-methylcatechol, 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl, and 4'-chloro-2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl. nucleotide sequence analysis of the cloned ndo exhibited an open reading frame of 939 base pairs. this sequence can encode a 313 amino acids protein of approximately molecular weight of 35 kd, which was confirmed by in vitro transcription and translation assay and sds-page analysis. a putative ribosomal binding site (gaggaga) was present 7 base pairs upstream from the aug start codon and a promotor site homologous to e. coli '-10' and '-35' regulatory region was located at '-123' and '-174' area of our clone with sequences of ttgaag and gtgaca, respectively. the deduced amino acid sequence showed 69% homology with cdo from burkholderia cepacia aai. a unique insertion of 21 amino acids was found towards the n-terminal of the ndo. expression of ndo in strain ou83 was repressed in presence of 3-chlorobenzoic acid as judged by the decrease in the expression of ndo specific transcript.

TI  == application of metabolic engineering to improve both the production and use of biotech indigo.
AB  == a fermentation process was developed for production of indigo from glucose using  recombinant escherichia coli. this was achieved by modifying the tryptophan pathway to cause high-level indole production and adding the pseudomonas putida genes encoding naphthalene dioxygenase (ndo). in comparison to a tryptophan-over-producing strain, the first indigo-producing strain made less than half of the expected amount of indigo. severe inactivation of the first enzyme of aromatic biosynthesis, 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (dahp) synthase (the arogfbr gene product), was observed in cells collected from  indigo fermentations. subsequent in vitro experiments revealed that dahp synthase was inactivated by exposure to the spontaneous chemical conversion of indoxyl to  indigo. indigo production was thereafter improved by increasing the gene dosage of arogfbr or by increasing substrate availability to dahp synthase in vivo by either amplifying the tkta (transketolase) gene or inactivating both isozymes of  pyruvate kinase. by combining all three strategies for enhancing dahp formation in the cell, a 60% increase in indigo production was achieved. metabolic engineering was then further applied to eliminate a byproduct of the spontaneous  conversion of indoxyl to indigo, thereby solving a serious problem with the use of bio-indigo in the final denim dyeing application.

TI  == the 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase family of enzymes: how nature makes new enzymes  using a beta-alpha-beta structural motif.
AB  == 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-ot) catalyzes the isomerization of beta,gamma-unsaturated enones to their alpha,beta-isomers. the enzyme is part of  a plasmid-encoded pathway, which enables bacteria harboring the plasmid to use various aromatic hydrocarbons as their sole sources of carbon and energy. among isomerases and enzymes in general, 4-ot is unusual for two reasons: it has one of the smallest known monomer sizes (62 amino acids) and the amino-terminal proline  functions as the catalytic base. in addition to pro-1, three other residues (arg-11, arg-39, and phe-50) have been identified as critical catalytic residues  by kinetic analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, chemical synthesis, nmr, and crystallographic studies. arginine-39 functions as the general acid catalyst (assisted by an ordered water molecule) in the reaction while arg-11 plays a role in substrate binding and facilitates catalysis by acting as an electron sink. finally, the hydrophobic nature of the active site, which lowers the pk(a) of pro-1 to approximately 6.4 and provides a favorable environment for catalysis, is largely maintained by phe-50. 4-ot is also the title enzyme of the 4-ot family of enzymes. the chromosomal homologues in this family are composed of monomers ranging in size from 61 to 79 amino acids, which code a beta-alpha-beta structural motif. the homologues all retain pro-1 and generally have an aromatic  or hydrophobic amino acid at the phe-50 position. characterization of representative members has uncovered mechanistic and structural diversity. a new  activity, a trans-3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenase, has been identified in addition to the previously known tautomerase and isomerase activities. two new structures have also been found, along with the 4-ot hexamer. the dehalogenase functions as a heterohexamer while the escherichia coli homologue, designated ydce, functions as a dimer. moreover, both 4-ot and the bacillus subtilis homologue, designated ywhb, exhibit low-level dehalogenase activity. amplification of this activity could have produced the full-fledged dehalogenase. the sum of these observations indicates that nature uses the beta-alpha-beta structural motif as a building block in a variety of manners to create new enzymes.

TI  == decreasing the level of ethyl acetate in ethanolic fermentation broths of escherichia coli ko11 by expression of pseudomonas putida estz esterase.
AB  == during the fermentation of sugars to ethanol relatively high levels of an undesirable coproduct, ethyl acetate, are also produced. with ethanologenic escherichia coli strain ko11 as the biocatalyst, the level of ethyl acetate in beer containing 4.8% ethanol was 192 mg liter(-1). although the e. coli genome encodes several proteins with esterase activity, neither wild-type strains nor ko11 contained significant ethyl acetate esterase activity. a simple method was developed to rapidly screen bacterial colonies for the presence of esterases which hydrolyze ethyl acetate based on ph change. this method allowed identification of pseudomonas putida nrrl b-18435 as a source of this activity and the cloning of a new esterase gene, estz. recombinant estz esterase was purified to near homogeneity and characterized. it belongs to family iv of lipolytic enzymes and contains the conserved catalytic triad of serine, aspartic  acid, and histidine. as expected, this serine esterase was inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and the histidine reagent diethylpyrocarbonate. the native and subunit molecular weights of the recombinant protein were 36,000, indicating that the enzyme exists as a monomer. by using alpha-naphthyl acetate as a model substrate, optimal activity was observed at ph 7.5 and 40 degrees c. the km and vmax for alpha-naphthyl acetate were 18 microm and 48.1 micromol. min(-1). mg of protein(-1), respectively. among the aliphatic esters tested, the  highest activity was obtained with propyl acetate (96 micromol. min(-1). mg of protein(-1)), followed by ethyl acetate (66 micromol. min(-1). mg of protein(-1)). expression of estz in e. coli ko11 reduced the concentration of ethyl acetate in fermentation broth (4.8% ethanol) to less than 20 mg liter(-1).

AB  == lavandula stoechas, a native plant of greece, is rich in essential oil and fenchone is its major constituent. we examined the effect of the essential oil and its main constituents on soil metabolism and microbial growth. addition of the essential oil or fenchone to soil samples induced a remarkable increase in soil respiration. this was accompanied by an increase in the soil bacterial population of three orders of magnitude. this sizable population was not qualitatively similar to that of the control soil samples. one bacterial strain dominated soil samples treated with l. stoechas essential oil or fenchone. by use of the disk diffusion assay, we evaluated the capacity of three bacterial strains that we isolated from the soil samples, as well as escherichia coli and bacillus  subtilis (reference strains), to grow in the presence of the essential oil and three of its main constituents (fenchone, cineol, alpha-pinene). the substances tested did not inhibit the growth of the strain found to dominate the bacterial populations of treated soil samples; they severely inhibited b. subtilis. the other two isolated strains could also grow in liquid cultures in the presence of  different quantities of essential oil or fenchone. addition of fenchone at the end of the exponential phase increased the cell numbers of the strain that dominated the bacterial populations of treated soil samples, indicating use of the substrate added. on the basis of these results, we propose a scheme of successional stages during the decomposition process of the rich-in-essential-oil litter of aromatic plants that abound in the mediterranean environment.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI  == inducible gene expression by nonculturable bacteria in milk after pasteurization.
AB  == the viability of bacteria in milk after heat treatments was assessed by using three different viability indicators: (i) cfu on plate count agar, (ii) de novo expression of a gfp reporter gene, and (iii) membrane integrity based on propidium iodide exclusion. in commercially available pasteurized milk, direct viable counts, based on dye exclusion, were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than  viable cell counts determined from cfu, suggesting that a significant subpopulation of cells in pasteurized milk are viable but nonculturable. heating  milk at 63.5 degrees c for 30 min resulted in a >4-log-unit reduction in the number of cfu of escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida that were marked with lac-inducible gfp. however, the reduction in the number of gfp-expressing cells of both organisms under the same conditions was <2.5 log units. these results demonstrate that a substantial portion of cells rendered incapable of forming colonies by heat treatment are metabolically active and are able to transcribe and translate genes de novo.

TI  == ferredoxin-mediated reactivation of the chlorocatechol 2,3-dioxygenase from pseudomonas putida gj31.
AB  == in the chlorobenzene degrader pseudomonas putida gj31, chlorocatechol is formed as an intermediate and cleaved by a meta-cleavage extradiol chlorocatechol dioxygenase, which has previously been shown to be exceptionally resistant to inactivation by substituted catechols. the gene encoding this dioxygenase ( cbze) is preceded by a gene ( cbzt) potentially encoding a ferredoxin, the function of  which was studied. the cbzt gene product was overproduced in escherichia coli and purified in recombinant form. two homologous proteins, cdot and atds, encoded by  genes identified in strains degrading nitrobenzene and aniline, respectively, were also purified and characterized. all three proteins showed spectroscopic properties typical for [2fe-2s] ferredoxins. the chlorocatechol dioxygenase from  strain gj31 (cbze) was fully inactivated when 4-methylcatechol was used as substrate. inactivated cbze could be rapidly reactivated in vitro in the presence of purified cbzt and a source of reductant. it is inferred that the ability of strain gj31 to metabolize both chlorobenzene and toluene might depend on the regeneration of the chlorocatechol dioxygenase activity mediated by cbzt. three cbzt-like ferredoxins, including atds, were found to be competent in the reactivation of cbze, whereas xylt, a protein known to mediate reactivation of the catechol dioxygenase from p. putida mt2 (xyle), was ineffective. accordingly, cbzt formed a covalent complex with cbze when cross-linked with a carbodiimide, whereas xylt did not. in the reverse situation, cbzt was found to reactivate xyle as efficiently as xylt and formed an heterologous covalent complex with this enzyme upon cross-linking. we conclude that cbzt, cdot and atds are isofunctional ferredoxins that appear to be involved in the reactivation of their cognate catechol dioxygenases. based on primary structure comparisons, residues of the ferredoxins possibly involved in the molecular interaction with catechol dioxygenases were identified and their significance is discussed.

TI  == the active partition gene incc of incp plasmids is required for stable maintenance in a broad range of hosts.
AB  == plasmids of incompatibility group p (incp) are capable of replication and stable  inheritance in a wide variety of gram-negative bacteria. three determinants of incp plasmids are components of an active partition locus that is predicted to function in the segregation of plasmid copies to daughter cells. these determinants are incc, which codes for a member of the para family of partition atpases; korb, which specifies a dna-binding protein that also functions as a global transcriptional repressor; and o(b), the dna target for korb, which occurs at multiple locations on incp plasmids. to determine the importance and host range of the incc/korb partition system in the maintenance of incp plasmids, we constructed an in-frame deletion of incc in the otherwise intact 60-kb incp alpha plasmid r995. r995 delta incc was found to be highly unstable in escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, agrobacterium tumefaciens, and  acinetobacter calcoaceticus, whereas wild-type r995 is stable in all these hosts. in addition, r995 delta incc could not be established in actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. trans-complementation analysis showed that the coding region for incc2 polypeptide, which is expressed from an internal translational start within the incc gene, was sufficient to restore stable maintenance to wild-type levels. the results show that the incc/korb active partition system of  incp plasmids is remarkably proficient for stable maintenance in diverse bacteria.

TI  == functional analysis of alkane hydroxylases from gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == we have cloned homologs of the pseudomonas putida gpo1 alkane hydroxylase from pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, pseudomonas fluorescens cha0, alcanivorax borkumensis ap1, mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv, and prauserella rugosa nrrl b-2295. sequence comparisons show that the level of protein sequence identity between the homologs is as low as 35%, and that the pseudomonas alkane hydroxylases are as distantly related to each other as to the remaining alkane hydroxylases. based on the observation that rubredoxin, an electron transfer component of the gpo1 alkane hydroxylase system, can be replaced by rubredoxins from other alkane hydroxylase systems, we have developed three recombinant host strains for the functional analysis of the novel alkane hydroxylase genes. two hosts, escherichia coli gec137 and p. putida gpo12, were equipped with pgec47 delta b, which encodes all proteins necessary for growth on medium-chain-length alkanes (c(6) to c(12)), except a functional alkane hydroxylase. the third host was an alkb knockout derivative of p. fluorescens cha0, which is no longer able to grow on c(12) to c(16) alkanes. all alkane hydroxylase homologs, except the acinetobacter sp. adp1 alkm, allowed at least one of the three hosts to grow on n-alkanes.

TI  == rubredoxins involved in alkane oxidation.
AB  == rubredoxins (rds) are essential electron transfer components of bacterial membrane-bound alkane hydroxylase systems. several rd genes associated with alkane hydroxylase or rd reductase genes were cloned from gram-positive and gram-negative organisms able to grow on n-alkanes (alk-rds). complementation tests in an escherichia coli recombinant containing all pseudomonas putida gpo1 genes necessary for growth on alkanes except rd 2 (alkg) and sequence comparisons showed that the alk-rds can be divided in alkg1- and alkg2-type rds. all alkane-degrading strains contain alkg2-type rds, which are able to replace the gpo1 rd 2 in n-octane hydroxylation. most strains also contain alkg1-type rds, which do not complement the deletion mutant but are highly conserved among gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. common to most rds are the two iron-binding cxxcg motifs. all alk-rds possess four negatively charged residues that are not conserved in other rds. the alkg1-type rds can be distinguished from the alkg2-type rds by the insertion of an arginine downstream of the second cxxcg motif. in addition, the glycines in the two cxxcg motifs are usually replaced by  other amino acids. mutagenesis of residues conserved in either the alkg1- or the  alkg2-type rds, but not between both types, shows that alkg1 is unable to transfer electrons to the alkane hydroxylase mainly due to the insertion of the arginine, whereas the exchange of the glycines in the two cxxcg motifs only has a limited effect.

AB  == the overexpression of fdm, which encodes the formaldehyde dismutase from pseudomonas putida f61, resulted in the formation of inclusion bodies made up of  aggregated enzyme, leaving little activity in the soluble fraction of the transformant cells. on the other hand, coexpression of groesl along with fdm facilitated in vivo solubilization of the enzyme protein in its active form. when coexpressed with groesl, formaldehyde dismutase purified from e. coli had the same crystalline form (i.e., a regular octahedron) as the native enzyme, and like the native enzyme, it bound 1 mol of nad(h) and 2 mol of zinc in each subunit.

TI  == the parab gene products of pseudomonas putida exhibit partition activity in both  p. putida and escherichia coli.
AB  == the bacteria for which there is evidence that proteins of the parab family act in chromosome segregation also undergo developmental transitions that involve the parab homologues, raising the question of whether the partition activity is equivalent to that of plasmid partition systems. we have investigated the role in partition of the parab locus of a free-living bacterium, pseudomonas putida, not  known to pass through developmental phases. a parab deletion mutant, compared with wild type, showed slightly higher frequencies of anucleate cells in exponentially growing cultures but much higher frequencies in deceleration phase. this increase was growth medium dependent. oversupply of para and parb proteins also raised anucleate cell levels, specifically in the deceleration phase, in wild-type and mutant strains and regardless of medium, as well as generating abnormal cell morphologies. absence or oversupply of parab function had either slight or considerable effects on growth rate, depending on temperature and medium. the need for the par proteins in chromosome partition thus appears to be  subject to the cell's physiological state. three sequences similar to cis-acting  stabilization sites of bacillus subtilis are present in the p. putida oric-parab  region. one was inserted into an unstable mini-f and shown to stabilize it in e.  coli in a parab-dependent manner.

TI  == characterization and application of xylene monooxygenase for multistep biocatalysis.
AB  == xylene monooxygenase of pseudomonas putida mt-2 catalyzes multistep oxidations of one methyl group of toluene and xylenes. recombinant escherichia coli expressing  the monooxygenase genes xylm and xyla catalyzes the oxygenation of toluene, pseudocumene, the corresponding alcohols, and the corresponding aldehydes, all by a monooxygenation type of reaction (b. buhler, a. schmid, b. hauer, and b. witholt, j. biol. chem. 275:10085-10092, 2000). using e. coli expressing xylma, we investigated the kinetics of this one-enzyme three-step biotransformation. we  found that unoxidized substrates like toluene and pseudocumene inhibit the second and third oxygenation steps and that the corresponding alcohols inhibit the third oxygenation step. these inhibitions might promote the energetically more favorable alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenations in the wild type. growth of e. coli was strongly affected by low concentrations of pseudocumene and its products. toxicity and solubility problems were overcome by the use of a two-liquid-phase system with bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate as the carrier solvent, allowing high overall substrate and product concentrations. in a fed-batch-based  two-liquid-phase process with pseudocumene as the substrate, we observed the consecutive accumulation of aldehyde, acid, and alcohol. our results indicate that, depending on the reaction conditions, product formation could be directed to one specific product.

TI  == oxygenation reactions of various tricyclic fused aromatic compounds using escherichia coli and streptomyces lividans transformants carrying several arene dioxygenase genes.
AB  == bioconversion (biotransformation) experiments on arenes (aromatic compounds), including various tricyclic fused aromatic compounds such as fluorene, dibenzofuran, dibenzothiophene, carbazole, acridene, and phenanthridine, were done using the cells of escherichia coli transformants expressing several arene dioxygenase genes. e. coli carrying the phenanthrene dioxygenase (phdabcd) genes  derived from the marine bacterium nocardioides sp. strain kp7 converted all of these tricyclic aromatic compounds, while e. coli carrying the pseudomonas putida f1 toluene dioxygenase (todc1c2ba) genes or the p. pseudoalcaligenes kf707 biphenyl dioxygenase (bpha1a2a3a4) genes was not able to convert these substrates. surprisingly, e. coli carrying hybrid dioxygenase (todc1::bpha2a3a4)  genes with a subunit substitution between the toluene and biphenyl dioxygenases was able to convert fluorene, dibenzofuran, and dibenzothiophene. the cells of a  streptomyces lividans transformant carrying the phenanthrene dioxygenase genes were also evaluated for bioconversion of various tricyclic fused aromatic compounds. the ability of this actinomycete in their conversion was similar to that of e. coli carrying the corresponding genes. products converted from the aromatic compounds with these recombinant bacterial cells were purified by column chromatography on silica gel, and identified by their ms and 1h and 13c nmr analyses. several products, e.g., 4-hydroxyfluorene converted from fluorene, and  cis-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydrophenanthridine, cis-9,10-dihydroxy-9,10-dihydrophenanthridine, and 10-hydroxyphenanthridine, which were converted from phenanthridine, were novel compounds.

TI  == integration of global regulation of two aromatic-responsive sigma(54)-dependent systems: a common phenotype by different mechanisms.
AB  == pseudomonas-derived regulators dmpr and xylr are structurally and mechanistically related sigma(54)-dependent activators that control transcription of genes involved in catabolism of aromatic compounds. the binding of distinct sets of aromatic effectors to these regulatory proteins results in release of a repressive interdomain interaction and consequently allows the activators to promote transcription from their cognate target promoters. the dmpr-controlled po promoter region and the xylr-controlled pu promoter region are also similar, although homology is limited to three discrete dna signatures for binding sigma(54) rna polymerase, the integration host factor, and the regulator. these common properties allow cross-regulation of pu and po by dmpr and xylr in response to appropriate aromatic effectors. in vivo, transcription of both the dmpr/po and xylr/pu regulatory circuits is subject to dominant global regulation, which results in repression of transcription during growth in rich media. here, we comparatively assess the contribution of (p)ppgpp, the ftsh protease, and a component of an alternative phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase system,  which have been independently implicated in mediating this level of regulation. further, by exploiting the cross-regulatory abilities of these two circuits, we identify the target component(s) that are intercepted in each case. the results show that (i) contrary to previous speculation, ftsh is not universally required  for transcription of sigma(54)-dependent systems; (ii) the two factors found to impact the xylr/pu regulatory circuit do not intercept the dmpr/po circuit; and (iii) (p)ppgpp impacts the dmpr/po system to a greater extent than the xylr/pu system in both the native pseudomonas putida and a heterologous escherichia coli  host. the data demonstrate that, despite the similarities of the specific regulatory circuits, the host global regulatory network latches onto and dominates over these specific circuits by exploiting their different properties.  the mechanistic implications of how each of the host factors exerts its action are discussed.

TI  == residues 137 and 153 at the n terminus of the xyls protein influence the effector profile of this transcriptional regulator and the sigma factor used by rna polymerase to stimulate transcription from its cognate promoter.
AB  == the 321-residue xyls and xyls1 proteins, encoded by the pww0 and pww53 plasmids respectively, differ in only 5 residues at positions 4, 53, 90, 137, and 153. as  a result, the effector profile of xyls is wider than that of xyls1, and xyls mediates higher levels of transcription from its cognate-regulatable promoter than does xyls1. we generated a series of xyls-pww0 mutants and found that the single mutants asp-137-->glu and his-153-->asn exhibited an activation pattern different from that of the wild-type regulator. in the double-mutant xylsd137e,h153n the effector profile for benzoates was similar to that of xyls1.  this suggests that these two residues are crucial for effector recognition and regulator activation to stimulate transcription. xyls-dependent transcription from its cognate promoter is mediated by rna polymerase with sigma(32) or sigma(38), whereas xyls1 uses rna polymerase with sigma(32) or sigma(70). we also found that point mutations at positions 137 and 153 of xyls led rna polymerase to mediate transcription with sigma(70) rather than with sigma(38), as demonstrated  by primer extension analysis in a sigma(70)-thermosensitive background proficient and deficient in sigma(38). this suggests that a positive transcriptional regulator can choose the rna polymerase complex that mediates transcription from  a given promoter.

(1999) biochemistry, 38, 5355-5361]. to evaluate the importance of several amino-acid residues at the active site for substrate binding and catalysis, we mutated the following amino-acid codons in the hal gene: r283, y53, y280, e414, q277, f329, n195 and h83. kinetic measurements with the overexpressed mutants showed that all mutations resulted in a decrease of catalytic activity. the mutants r283i, r283k and n195a were approximately 1640, 20 and 1000 times less active, respectively, compared to the single mutant c273a, into which all mutations were introduced. mutants y280f, f329a and q277a exhibited approximately 55, 100 and 125 times lower activity, respectively. the greatest loss of activity shown was in the hal mutants y53f, e414q, h83l and e414a, the last being more than 20 900-fold less active than the single mutant c273a, while h83l was 18 000-fold less active than mutant c273a. we propose that the carboxylate group of  e414 plays an important role as a base in catalysis. to investigate a possible participation of active site amino acids in the formation of mio, we used the chromophore formation upon treatment of hal with l-cysteine and dioxygen at ph 10.5 as an indicator. all mutants, except f329a showed the formation of a 338-nm  chromophore arising from a modified mio group. the uv difference spectra of hal mutant f329a with the mio-free mutant s143a provide evidence for the presence of  a mio group in hal mutant f329a also. for modelling of the substrate arrangement  within the active site and protonation state of mio, theoretical calculations were performed.

TI  == the tol plasmid pww0 xyln gene product from pseudomonas putida is involved in m-xylene uptake.
AB  == the upper operon of the tol plasmid pww0 of pseudomonas putida encodes a set of enzymes involved in the conversion of toluene and xylenes to their carboxylic acid derivatives. the last gene of the upper operon, xyln, encodes a 465-amino-acid polypeptide which exhibits significant sequence similarity to fadl, an outer membrane protein involved in fatty acid transport in escherichia coli. to analyze the role of the xyln gene product, xyln on tol plasmid pww0 was  disrupted by inserting a kanamycin resistance gene, and the phenotypes of p. putida harboring the wild-type and xyln mutant tol plasmids were characterized. the growth of p. putida harboring the wild-type tol plasmid was inhibited by a high concentration of m-xylene, while that of p. putida harboring the xyln mutant tol plasmid was not. the apparent k(s) value for the oxidation of m-xylene in intact cells of the xyln mutant was fourfold higher than that of the wild-type strain, although the tol catabolic enzyme activities in cell extracts from the two strains were almost identical. we therefore presume that the xyln gene product is a porin involved in the transport of m-xylene and its analogues across the outer membrane. western blot analysis confirmed the localization of xyln in the outer membrane.

TI  == characterization of phenotypic changes in pseudomonas putida in response to surface-associated growth.
AB  == the formation of complex bacterial communities known as biofilms begins with the  interaction of planktonic cells with a surface. a switch between planktonic and sessile growth is believed to result in a phenotypic change in bacteria. in this  study, a global analysis of physiological changes of the plant saprophyte pseudomonas putida following 6 h of attachment to a silicone surface was carried  out by analysis of protein profiles and by mrna expression patterns. two-dimensional (2-d) gel electrophoresis revealed 15 proteins that were up-regulated following bacterial adhesion and 30 proteins that were down-regulated. n-terminal sequence analyses of 11 of the down-regulated proteins identified a protein with homology to the abc transporter, potf; an outer membrane lipoprotein, nlpd; and five proteins that were homologous to proteins involved in amino acid metabolism. cdna subtractive hybridization revealed 40 genes that were differentially expressed following initial attachment of p. putida. twenty-eight of these genes had known homologs. as with the 2-d gel analysis, nlpd and genes involved in amino acid metabolism were identified by subtractive hybridization and found to be down-regulated following surface-associated growth. the gene for potb was up-regulated, suggesting differential expression of abc transporters following attachment to this surface. other genes that showed differential regulation were structural components of flagella and type iv pili, as well as genes involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis. immunoblot analysis of pila and flic confirmed the presence of flagella in planktonic cultures but not in 12- or 24-h biofilms. in contrast, pila was observed in 12-h biofilms but not in planktonic culture. recent evidence suggests that quorum sensing by bacterial homoserine lactones (hsls) may play a regulatory role in biofilm development. to determine if similar protein profiles  occurred during quorum sensing and during early biofilm formation, hsls extracted from p. putida and pure c(12)-hsl were added to 6-h planktonic cultures of p. putida, and cell extracts were analyzed by 2-d gel profiles. differential expression of 16 proteins was observed following addition of hsls. one protein, potf, was found to be down-regulated by both surface-associated growth and by hsl addition. the other 15 proteins did not correspond to proteins differentially expressed by surface-associated growth. the results presented here demonstrate that p. putida undergoes a global change in gene expression following initial attachment to a surface. quorum sensing may play a role in the initial attachment process, but other sensory processes must also be involved in these phenotypic changes.

AB  == during the screening for bacteria capable of converting eugenol to vanillin, strain ops1 was isolated, which was identified as a new pseudomonas species by 16 s rdna sequence analysis. when this bacterium was grown on eugenol, the intermediates, coniferyl alcohol, ferulic acid, vanillic acid, and protocatechuic acid, were identified in the culture supernatant. the genes encoding the eugenol  hydroxylase (ehya, ehyb), which catalyzes the first step of this biotransformation, were identified in a genomic library of pseudomonas sp. strain ops1 by complementation of the eugenol-negative mutant sk6165 of pseudomonas sp.  strain hr199. ehya and ehyb exhibited 57% and 85% amino acid identity to the eugenol hydroxylase subunits of pseudomonas sp. strain hr199 and up to 34% and 54% identity to the corresponding subunits of p-cresol methylhydroxylase from p.  putida. moreover, the amino-terminal sequences of the alpha- and beta-subunits reported recently for an eugenol dehydrogenase of p fluorescens e118 corresponded well with the appropriate regions of ehya and ehyb. downstream of ehyb, an open reading frame was identified, whose deduced amino acid sequence exhibited up to 71% identity to azurins, representing most probably the gene (azu) of the physiological electron acceptor of the eugenol hydroxylase. the eugenol hydroxylase genes were amplified by pcr, cloned, and functionally expressed in escherichia coli.

TI  == mycobacterium tuberculosis lipoamide dehydrogenase is encoded by rv0462 and not by the lpda or lpdb genes.
AB  == the gene encoding dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase from mycobacterium tuberculosis, rv0462, was expressed in escherichia coli and the protein purified to homogeneity. the 49 kda polypeptide forms a homodimer containing one tightly bound molecule of fad/monomer. the results of steady-state kinetic analyses using several reduced pyridine nucleotide analogs and a variety of electron acceptors,  and the ability of the enzyme to catalyze the transhydrogenation of nadh and thio-nad(+) in the absence of d,l-lipoamide, demonstrated that the enzyme uses a  ping-pong kinetic mechanism. primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects on v and v/k at ph 7.5 using nadh deuterated at the c(4)-pros position of the nicotinamide ring are small [(d)(v/k)(nadh) = 1.12 +/- 0.15, (d)v(app) = 1.05 +/- 0.07] when d,l-lipoamide is the oxidant but large and equivalent [(d)(v/k)(nadh) = (d)v = 2.95 +/- 0.03] when 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone is the oxidant. solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effects at ph 5.8, using apadh as the reductant, are inverse with (d)(v/k)(apadh) = 0.73 +/- 0.03, (d)(v/k)(lip(s))2 = 0.77 +/- 0.03,  and (d)v(app) = 0.77 +/- 0.01. solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effects with 4,4-dithiopyridine (dtp), the 4-thiopyridone product of which requires no protonation, are also inverse with (d)(v/k)(apadh) = 0.75 +/- 0.06, (d)(v/k)(dtp) = 0.71 +/- 0.02, and (d)v(app) = 0.56 +/- 0.15. all proton inventories were linear, indicating that a single proton is being transferred in the solvent isotopically sensitive step. taken together, these results suggest that (1) the reductive half-reaction (hydride transfer from nadh to fad) is rate limiting when a quinone is the oxidant, and (2) deprotonation of enzymic thiols, most likely cys(46) and cys(41), limits the reductive and oxidative half-reactions, respectively, when d,l-lipoamide is the oxidant.

TI  == crystal structure of escherichia coli fdx, an adrenodoxin-type ferredoxin involved in the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters.
AB  == escherichia coli ferredoxin (fdx) is an adrenodoxin-type [2fe-2s] ferredoxin. recent genetic analyses show that it has an essential role in the maturation of various iron-sulfur (fe-s) proteins. fdx probably functions as a component of the complex machinery responsible for the biogenesis of fe-s clusters. its crystal structure was determined by the multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion method using the iron atoms in the [2fe-2s] cluster of the protein and then refined to r and r(free) values of 0.255 and 0.278, respectively, at 1.7 a resolution. the structure of fdx is similar to the structures of bovine adrenodoxin (adx) and pseudomonas putida putidaredoxin (pdx) whose respective root-mean-square deviations of the corresponding calpha atoms are 1.8 and 2.2 a. this analysis also revealed the structure of the c-terminal residues protruding into the solvent, which is missing in adx and pdx. the [2fe-2s] cluster is located at the  edge of the molecule and bonds with the sgamma atoms of cys42, cys48, cys51, and  cys87. electrostatic potential analysis showed that the surface of fdx has two negatively charged areas separated by a hydrophobic lane. one is conserved on the surface of adx which is an area of interaction with adrenodoxin reductase. cys46  is located on the molecular surface in the vicinity of the [2fe-2s] cluster, an indication that it may be involved in fe-s cluster formation.

TI  == features of the replicon of plasmid pam10.6 of pseudomonas fluorescens.
AB  == we describe features of the basic replicon of the 10.6-kb medium-copy-number plasmid pam10.6. pam10.6 was able to replicate in various pseudomonas strains but was maintained in escherichia coli only after the p15a origin of replication was  inserted. deletion analysis suggests that the pam10.6 origin of replication is located in a 0.5-kb region that includes inverted and direct repeats upstream of  the repa gene. repa (204 aa) has a clear homology to plasmid replication proteins of some other gram-negative bacteria. the pas (plasmid addiction system) (genes encoded in the region of 480-bp) stabilizes plasmid maintenance in p. putida cells under nonselective conditions for at least 200 generations. a 3.75-kb psti  fragment of pam10.6 joined to a km(r) gene was shown to be a minimal plasmid unit maintained in p. putida as a monomer. further deletions of this 3.75-kb fragment  caused a drive to form stable head-to-tail dimeric plasmids in p. putida.

TI  == the inverted repeats of is1384, a newly described insertion sequence from pseudomonas putida strain h, represent the specific target for integration of is1383.
AB  == analysis of a region on plasmid ppgh1 from pseudomonas putida strain h that is flanked by two copies of is1383 has revealed an additional element with the typical features of a bacterial insertion sequence. this new is element, designated is1384, contains a single orf of 972 bp, and is flanked by 9-bp inverted repeats. based on sequence homology and structural characteristics of the putative transposase it encodes, is1384 belongs to the is5 subgroup of the is5 family. two copies of is1384 are present on plasmid ppgh1, whereas none could be detected on the chromosome of p. putida strain h. sequence analysis revealed the presence of two truncated copies of is1384 on the second plasmid in this strain, ppgh2. the inverted repeats of all is1384 copies (including the truncated ones) are interrupted by the integration of an is1383 element. all integrations were found to be site- and orientation-specific. pcr studies and sequence data indicate that is1383 can form a circular intermediate on excision. in the circular form, the previously described 13-bp inverted repeats of is1383 are separated by 10 bp that are identical to the 5-bp motif that flanks each side of  the element when it is integrated in its target. we provide evidence that these additional nucleotides, although not of inverted symmetry, represent an essential part of the inverted repeats. furthermore, the data indicate that is1383 integrated into the inverted repeats of is1384 by a site-specific recombination rather than a site-specific insertion event.

AB  == expression of azurin in pseudomonas putida hk5 was examined by immunoblot analysis. similar amounts of azurin were found in the cells grown into the stationary phase on any carbon sources, including lb medium without alcohol, where no quinoprotein alcohol dehydrogenases appeared. in the early exponential phase, the highest amount of azurin was found in the cells grown on 1-butanol, but here was none in the case of lb medium, suggesting that expression of azurin  is cooperative with that of the alcohol oxidase system, especially the system including quinohemoprotein alcohol dehydrogenase iib. the azurin gene (azu) was cloned and sequenced. azu is monocistronic, and in its promoter region, fnr-binding consensus sequence was found. however, its relative position suggests different transcriptional regulation from that in azu of p. aeruginosa. the molecular weight of the mature protein without copper ion calculated from the amino acid sequence was consistent with the value of the purified azurin measured by mass spectrometry.

TI  == the methionine biosynthetic pathway from homoserine in pseudomonas putida involves the metw, metx, metz, meth and mete gene products.
AB  == biosynthesis of methionine from homoserine in pseudomonas putida takes place in three steps. the first step is the acylation of homoserine to yield an acyl-l-homoserine. this reaction is catalyzed by the products of the metxw genes  and is equivalent to the first step in enterobacteria, gram-positive bacteria and fungi, except that in these microorganisms the reaction is catalyzed by a single  polypeptide (the product of the meta gene in escherichia coli and the met5 gene product in neurospora crassa). in pseudomonas putida, as in gram-positive bacteria and certain fungi, the second and third steps are a direct sulfhydrylation that converts the o-acyl-l-homoserine into homocysteine and further methylation to yield methionine. the latter reaction can be mediated by either of the two methionine synthetases present in the cells.

AB  == the electrokinetic properties of two nitrifying strains, nitrosomonas europaea and nitrobacter winogradskyi, and three heterotrophic bacteria, escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida and pseudomonas aeruginosa, were examined by electrophoretic mobility measurement and analyzed using the soft particle electrophoresis theory  that is suitable for biological particles. the bacterial adhesion characteristics onto glass bead substratum were also evaluated by packed bed method. the mobility of the bacterial cells employed converged to a non-zero value as the ionic concentration increased, suggesting that the bacterial cells exhibited typical soft particle characteristics. moreover, cell surface potentials based on the soft particle theory were lower than those estimated by the conventional smoluchowski formula, i.e. zeta potential. cell collision efficiencies onto glass beads (alpha(0)) were largely dependent on interfacial interaction, although almost electrically neutral p. aeruginosa did not follow that trend. from a comparison of alpha(0) with dlvo interaction energy maximum (v(max)), it was assumed that heterocoagulation between cell and substratum at primary minimum potential took place under v(max) of 24-34 kt based on soft particle analysis. on the other hand, v(max) predictions using the smoluchowski theory gave 81-223 kt,  which indicated the possibility of overestimating electrostatic repulsive forces  by the conventional smoluchowski theory. thus, the application of this new electrophoresis theory to several kinds of bacterial cells has led to the revision of the interpretation of bacterial mobility data and provided a more detailed understanding of the bacterial adhesion phenomenon.

TI  == role of fatty acid de novo biosynthesis in polyhydroxyalkanoic acid (pha) and rhamnolipid synthesis by pseudomonads: establishment of the transacylase (phag)-mediated pathway for pha biosynthesis in escherichia coli.
AB  == since pseudomonas aeruginosa is capable of biosynthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoic acid (pha) and rhamnolipids, which contain lipid moieties that are derived from fatty acid biosynthesis, we investigated various fab mutants from p. aeruginosa with respect to biosynthesis of phas and rhamnolipids. all isogenic faba, fabb, fabi, rhlg, and phag mutants from p. aeruginosa showed decreased pha accumulation and rhamnolipid production. in the phag (encoding transacylase) mutant rhamnolipid production was only slightly decreased. expression of phag from pseudomonas putida and expression of the beta-ketoacyl reductase gene rhlg from p. aeruginosa in these mutants indicated that phag catalyzes diversion of intermediates of fatty acid de novo biosynthesis towards pha biosynthesis, whereas rhlg catalyzes diversion towards rhamnolipid biosynthesis. these data suggested that both biosynthesis pathways are competitive. in order to investigate whether phag is the only linking enzyme between fatty acid de novo biosynthesis and pha biosynthesis, we generated five tn5 mutants of p. putida strongly impaired in pha production from gluconate. all mutants were complemented by the phag gene from p. putida, indicating that the transacylase-mediated pha biosynthesis route represents the only metabolic link between fatty acid de novo  biosynthesis and pha biosynthesis in this bacterium. the transacylase-mediated pha biosynthesis route from gluconate was established in recombinant e. coli, coexpressing the class ii pha synthase gene phac1 together with the phag gene from p. putida, only when fatty acid de novo biosynthesis was partially inhibited by triclosan. the accumulated pha contributed to 2 to 3% of cellular dry weight.

AB  == plasmid rk2 is unusual in its ability to replicate stably in a wide range of gram-negative bacteria. the replication origin (oriv) and a plasmid-encoded initiation protein (trfa; expressed as 33 and 44 kda forms) are essential for rk2 replication. to examine initiation events in bacteria unrelated to escherichia coli, the genes encoding the replicative helicase, dnab, of pseudomonas putida and pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated and used to construct protein expression vectors. the purified proteins were tested for activity along with e.coli dnab at rk2 oriv. each helicase could be recruited and activated at the rk2 origin in the presence of the host-specific dnaa protein and the trfa protein. escherichia coli or p.putida dnab was active with either trfa-33 or trfa-44, while p.aeruginosa dnab required trfa-44 for activation. moreover, unlike the e.coli dnab helicase,  both pseudomonas helicases could be delivered and activated at oriv in the absence of an atpase accessory protein. thus, a dnac-like accessory atpase is not universally required for loading the essential replicative helicase at a replication origin.

AB  == a cosmid library of dna from colicin js-sensitive enteroinvasive escherichia coli (eiec) strain o164 was made in colicin js-resistant strain e. coli vcs257, and colicin js-sensitive clones were identified. sensitivity to colicin js was associated with the carriage of a three-gene operon upstream of and partially overlapping senb. the open reading frames were designated cjrabc (for colicin js  receptor), coding for proteins of 291, 258, and 753 amino acids, respectively. tn7 insertions in any of them led to complete resistance to colicin js. a near-consensus fur box was found upstream of cjra, suggesting regulation of the cjr operon by iron levels. cjra protein was homologous to iron-regulated pseudomonas aeruginosa protein phuw, whose function is unknown; cjrb was homologous to the tonb protein from pseudomonas putida; and cjrc was homologous to a putative outer membrane siderophore receptor from campylobacter jejuni. cloning experiments showed that the cjrb and cjrc genes are sufficient for colicin js sensitivity. uptake of colicin js into sensitive bacteria was dependent on the exbb protein but not on the e. coli k-12 tonb and tola, -b, and  -q proteins. sensitivity to colicin js is positively regulated by temperature via the virb protein and negatively controlled by the iron source through the fur protein. among eiec strains, two types of colicin js-sensitive phenotypes were identified that differed in sensitivity to colicin js by 1 order of magnitude. the difference in sensitivity to colicin js is not due to differences between the sequences of the cjrb and cjrc proteins.

TI  == functional analyses of bph-tod hybrid dioxygenase, which exhibits high degradation activity toward trichloroethylene.
AB  == biphenyl dioxygenase (bphdox) in pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes kf707 is a multicomponent enzyme consisting of an iron-sulfur protein (isp) that is composed of alpha (bpha1) and beta (bpha2) subunits, a ferredoxin (fd(bpha3)), and a ferredoxin reductase (fdr(bpha4)). a recombinant escherichia coli strain expressing hybrid dox that had replaced bpha1 with todc1 (alpha subunit of toluene dioxygenase (toldox) of pseudomonas putida) exhibited high activity toward trichloroethylene (tce) (furukawa, k., hirose, j., hayashida, s., and nakamura, k. (1994) j. bacteriol. 176, 2121-2123). in this study, isp, fd, and fdr were purified and characterized. reconstitution of the dioxygenase components consisting of purified isp(todc1bpha2), fd(bpha3), and fdr(bpha4) exhibited oxygenation activities toward biphenyl, toluene, and tce. native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by the ferguson plot analyses demonstrated that isp(todc1bpha2) and isp(bpha1a2) were present as heterohexamers, whereas isp(todc1c2) was present as a heterotetramer. the molecular activity (k(0)) of the hybrid dox for tce was 4.1 min(-1), which is comparable to that of toldox. the k(m) value of the hybrid dox for tce was 130 microm, which was lower than 250 microm for toldox. these results suggest that the alpha subunit of isp is crucial for the determination of substrate specificity and that the change in the alpha subunit conformation of isp from alpha(2)beta(2) to alpha(3)beta(3) results in the acquisition of higher affinity to tce, which may lead to high tce degradation activity.

TI  == monitoring of bacteria growth using a wireless, remote query resonant-circuit sensor: application to environmental sensing.
AB  == a new technique is presented for in-vivo remote query measurement of the complex  permittivity spectra of a biological culture solution. a sensor comprised of a printed inductor-capacitor resonant-circuit is placed within the culture solution of interest, with the impedance spectrum of the sensor measured using a remotely  located loop antenna; the complex permittivity spectra of the culture is calculated from the measured impedance spectrum. the remote query nature of the sensor platform enables, for example, the in-vivo real-time monitoring of bacteria or yeast growth from within sealed opaque containers. the wireless monitoring technique does not require a specific alignment between sensor and antenna. results are presented for studies conducted on laboratory strains of bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli jm109, pseudomonas putida and saccharomyces cerevisiae.

TI  == dual system to reinforce biological containment of recombinant bacteria designed  for rhizoremediation.
AB  == active biological containment (abc) systems have been designed to control at will the survival or death of a bacterial population. these systems are based on the use of a killing gene, e.g., a porin-inducing protein such as the one encoded by  the escherichia coli gef gene, and a regulatory circuit that controls expression  of the killing gene in response to the presence or absence of environmental signals. an abc system for recombinant microorganisms that degrade a model pollutant was designed on the basis of the pseudomonas putida tol plasmid meta-cleavage regulatory circuit. the system consists of a fusion of the pm promoter to laci, whose expression is controlled by xyls with 3-methylbenzoate, and a fusion of a synthetic p(lac) promoter to gef. in the presence of the model  pollutant, bacterial cells survived and degraded the target compound, whereas in  the absence of the aromatic carboxylic acid cell death was induced. the system had two main drawbacks: (i) the slow death of the bacterial cells in soil versus  the fast killing rate in liquid cultures in laboratory assays, and (ii) the appearance of mutants, at a rate of about 10(-8) per cell and generation, that did not die after the pollutant had been exhausted. we reinforced the abc system  by including it in a deltaasd p. putida background. a p. putida deltaasd mutant is viable only in complex medium supplemented with diaminopimelic acid, methionine, lysine, and threonine. we constructed a p. putida deltaasd strain, called mcr7, with a pm::asd fusion in the host chromosome. this strain was viable in the presence of 3-methylbenzoate because synthesis of the essential metabolites was achieved through xyls-dependent induction. in the p. putida mcr7  strain, an abc system (pm::laci, xyls, p(lac)::gef) was incorporated into the host chromosome to yield strain mcr8. the number of mcr8 mutants that escaped killing was below our detection limit (<10(-9) mutants per cell and generation).  the mcr8 strain survived and colonized rhizosphere soil with 3-methylbenzoate at  a level similar to that of the wild-type strain. however, it disappeared in less  than 20 to 25 days in soils without the pollutant, whereas an asd(+), biologically contained counterpart such as p. putida cmc4 was still detectable in soils after 100 days.

TI  == regulation of rpos gene expression in pseudomonas: involvement of a tetr family regulator.
AB  == the rpos gene encodes the sigma factor which was identified in several gram-negative bacteria as a central regulator during stationary phase. rpos gene  regulation is known to respond to cell density, showing higher expression in stationary phase. for pseudomonas aeruginosa, it has been demonstrated that the cell-density-dependent regulation response known as quorum sensing interacts with this regulatory response. using the rpos promoter of p. putida, we identified a genomic tn5 insertion mutant of p. putida which showed a 90% decrease in rpos promoter activity, resulting in less rpos being present in a cell at stationary phase. molecular analysis revealed that this mutant carried a tn5 insertion in a  gene, designated psra (pseudomonas sigma regulator), which codes for a protein (psra) of 26.3 kda. psra contains a helix-turn-helix motif typical of dna binding proteins and belongs to the tetr family of bacterial regulators. the homolog of the psra gene was identified in p. aeruginosa; the protein showed 90% identity to psra of p. putida. a psra::tn5 insertion mutant of p. aeruginosa was constructed. in both pseudomonas species, psra was genetically linked to the sos lexa repressor gene. similar to what was observed for p. putida, a psra null mutant of p. aeruginosa also showed a 90% reduction in rpos promoter activity; both mutants could be complemented for rpos promoter activity when the psra gene was provided  in trans. psra mutants of both pseudomonas species lost the ability to induce rpos expression at stationary phase, but they retained the ability to produce quorum-sensing autoinducer molecules. psra was demonstrated to negatively regulate psra gene expression in pseudomonas and in escherichia coli as well as to be capable of activating the rpos promoter in e. coli. our data suggest that psra is an important regulatory protein of pseudomonas spp. involved in the regulatory cascade controlling rpos gene regulation in response to cell density.

AB  == a gene cluster isolated from pseudomonas stutzeri ox1 genomic dna and containing  six orfs codes for toluene/o-xylene-monooxygenase. the putative regulatory d subunit was expressed in escherichia coli and purified. its protein sequence was  verified by mass spectrometry mapping and found to be identical to the sequence predicted on the basis of the dna sequence. the surface topology of subunit d in  solution was probed by limited proteolysis carried out under strictly controlled  conditions using several proteases as proteolytic probes. the same experiments were carried out on the homologous p2 component of the multicomponent phenol hydroxylase from pseudomonas putida cf600. the proteolytic fragments released from both proteins in their native state were analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry, and the preferential cleavage sites were assessed. the results indicated that despite the relatively high similarity between the sequences of the two proteins, some differences in the distribution of preferential proteolytic cleavages were detected, and a much higher conformational flexibility of subunit d was inferred. moreover, automatic modeling of subunit d was attempted, based on the known three-dimensional structure of p2. our results indicate that, at least in this case, standard modeling procedures based on automatic alignment on the structure of p2 fail to produce a model consistent with limited proteolysis experimental data. thus, it is our opinion that reliable techniques such as limited proteolysis can be employed to test three-dimensional  models and highlight problems in automatic model building.

AB  == a moderately thermophilic (45 to 50 degrees c), highly acidophilic (ph 1.5 to 2.5), chemolithotrophic acidithiobacillus caldus strain, f, was isolated from a biooxidation process used to treat nickel ore. trans-alternating field electrophoresis analysis of total dna from the a. caldus cells revealed two plasmids of approximately 14 and 45 kb. the 14-kb plasmid, designated ptc-f14, was cloned and shown by replacement of the cloning vector with a kanamycin resistance gene to be capable of autonomous replication in escherichia coli. autonomous replication was also demonstrated in pseudomonas putida and agrobacterium tumefaciens lba 4404, which suggested that ptc-f14 is a broad-host-range plasmid. sequence analysis of the ptc-f14 replicon region revealed five open reading frames and a replicon organization like that of the broad-host-range incq plasmids. three of the open reading frames encoded replication proteins which were most closely related to those of incq-like plasmid ptf-fc2 (amino acid sequence identities: repa, 81%; repb, 78%; repc, 74%). however, the two plasmids were fully compatible and ptc-f14 represents a new incq-like plasmid replicon. surprisingly, asymmetrical incompatibility was found with the less closely related incq plasmid r300b derivative pke462 and the  incq-like plasmid derivative pie1108. analysis of the ptc-f14 oriv region revealed five direct repeats consisting of three perfectly conserved 22-bp iterons flanked by iterons of 23 and 21 bp. plasmid ptc-f14 had a copy number of  12 to 16 copies per chromosome in both e. coli, and a. caldus. the rep gene products of ptc-f14 and ptf-fc2 were unable to functionally complement each other's oriv regions, but replication occurred when the genes for each plasmid's  own repa, repb, and repc proteins were provided in trans. two smaller open reading frames were found between the repb and repa genes of ptc-f14, which encode proteins with high amino acid sequence identity (pasa, 81%; pasb, 72%) to  the plasmid addiction system of ptf-fc2. this is the second time a plasmid stability system of this type has been found on an incq-like plasmid.

TI  == structural and functional analysis of the phosphonoacetate hydrolase (phna) gene  region in pseudomonas fluorescens 23f.
AB  == the pseudomonas fluorescens 23f phosphonoacetate hydrolase gene (phna) encodes a  novel carbon-phosphorus bond cleavage enzyme whose expression is independent of the phosphate status of the cell. analysis of the regions adjacent to the phosphonoacetate hydrolase structural gene (phna) indicated the presence of five  open reading frames (orfs). these include one (phnr) whose putative product shows high levels of homology to the lysr family of positive transcriptional regulators. its presence was shown to be necessary for induction of the hydrolase activity. 2-phosphonopropionate was found to be an inducer (and poor substrate) for phosphonoacetate hydrolase. unlike phosphonoacetate, which is also an inducer of phosphonoacetate hydrolase, entry of 2-phosphonopropionate into cells appeared to be dependent on the presence of a gene (phnb) that lies immediately downstream of phna and whose putative product shows homology to the glycerol-3-phosphate transporter. rna analysis revealed transcripts for the phnab and phnr operons, which are transcribed divergently; the resulting mrnas overlapped by 29 nucleotide bases at their 5' ends. transcripts of phnab were detected only in cells grown in the presence of phosphonoacetate, whereas transcripts of phnr were observed in cells grown under both induced and uninduced conditions. the expression of three additional genes found in the phna region did not appear necessary for the degradation of phosphonoacetate and 2-phosphonopropionate by either pseudomonas putida or escherichia coli cells.

TI  == biotransformations catalyzed by cloned p-cymene monooxygenase from pseudomonas putida f1.
AB  == p-cymene monooxygenase (cmo) from pseudomonas putida f1 consists of a hydroxylase (cyma1) and a reductase component (cyma2) which initiate pcymene (p-isopropyltoluene) catabolism by oxidation of the methyl group to p-isopropylbenzyl alcohol (p-cumic alcohol). to study the possible diverse range  of substrates catalyzed by cmo, the cyma1a2 genes were cloned in an escherichia coli pt7-5 expression system and the cells were used in transformation experiments. the tested substrates include different substituents on the aromatic ring at the 2 (ortho), 3 (meta) or 4 (para) position relative to the methyl moiety. as a result, a distinct preference was observed for substrates containing at least an alkyl or heteroatom substituent at the para-position of toluene. the  conversion rate of 4-chlorotoluene or 4-methylthiotoluene to the corresponding benzyl alcohol was found to be as good as the canonical substrate, p-cymene. but  3-chlorotoluene, 4-fluorotoluene and 4-nitrotoluene were relatively poor substrates. cmo is also capable of producing styrene oxide from styrene. however, the oxidation of 4-chlorostyrene to 4-chlorostyrene oxide was by far the fastest  among the substrates used in this study. the various biotransformation products were identified by a combined solid phase microextraction/gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analytical technique.

(1996) biochim. biophys. acta 1275, 154-156]. here, we describe the nucleotide sequences of the regulatory region of the sal gene and an orf (salr gene) divergently oriented from the sal gene, which encodes the protein salr. this gene product positively controls sal gene expression at the transcriptional level. the salr gene consists of 930 base  pairs starting from a gtg codon and encodes a protein of 309 amino acids with a molecular mass of 34 542 da. the amino-acid sequence is homologous to lysr-family regulatory proteins such as catr of p. putida rb1 and has helix-turn-helix dna binding motif near its n-terminal. transcription start sites of sal and salr genes were determined to lie 30- and 24-bp upstream of the respective initiation  codons and separated from each other by 78 nucleotides. a shine-dalgarno sequence and the putative promoter sequences containing -10 and -35 sequences were seen in the sal and salr genes. expression of the salr gene on a plasmid in escherichia coli cells was confirmed by dna mobility shift assay. for the overexpression of the salr gene, it was cloned to pet28a (psahr) which was transferred to e. coli bl21 (e. coli bl21/psahr), and expressed by an inducer, isopropyl thio-beta-d-galactoside. salr was further purified to homogeneity from the cell-free extracts in yields of approximately 3 mg.l-1 culture volume. the molecular mass was determined to be 33 kda and the n-terminal amino-acid sequence was the same as that deduced from the nucleotide sequence of salr gene. native salr was also purified to homogeneity from p. putida s-1 with very low contents.  the properties of the protein were similar to those of salr expressed in e. coli.

TI  == chromosomal locus for cadmium resistance in pseudomonas putida consisting of a cadmium-transporting atpase and a merr family response regulator.
AB  == pseudomonads from environmental sources vary widely in their sensitivity to cadmium, but the basis for this resistance is largely uncharacterized. a chromosomal fragment encoding cadmium resistance was cloned from pseudomonas putida 06909, a rhizosphere bacterium, and sequence analysis revealed two divergently transcribed genes, cada and cadr. cada was similar to cadmium-transporting atpases known mostly from gram-positive bacteria, and to znta, a lead-, zinc-, and cadmium-transporting atpase from escherichia coli. cadr was related to the merr family of response regulators that normally control mercury detoxification in other bacterial systems. a related gene, zntr, regulates znta in e. coli, but it is not contiguous with znta in the e. coli genome as cada and cadr were in p. putida. in addition, unlike znta and other cada homologs, but similar to the predicted product of gene pa3690 in the p. aeruginosa genome, the p. putida cada sequence had a histidine-rich n-terminal extension. cadr and the product of pa3689 of p. aeruginosa also had histidine-rich c-terminal extensions not found in other merr family response regulators. mutational analysis indicated that cada and cadr are fully responsible for cadmium resistance and partially for zinc resistance. however, unlike znta, they did not confer significant levels of lead resistance. the cada  promoter was responsive to cd(ii), pb(ii), and zn(ii), while the cadr promoter was only induced by cd(ii). cadr apparently represses its own expression at the transcriptional level. however, cadr apparently does not repress cada. homologs of the cadmium-transporting atpase were detected in many other pseudomonas species.

AB  == a protein mixture containing two major components able to catalyze a beta-recombination reaction requiring nonspecific dna bending was obtained by fractionation of a pseudomonas putida extract. n-terminal sequence analysis and genomic data base searches identified the major component as an analogue of hupb  of pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli, encoding one hu protein variant.  the minor component of the fraction, termed hupn, was divergent enough from hupb  to predict a separate dna-bending competence. the determinants of the two proteins were cloned and hyperexpressed, and the gene products were purified. their activities were examined in vitro in beta-recombination assays and in vivo  by complementation of the hbsu function of bacillus subtilis. hupb and hupn were  equally efficient in all tests, suggesting that they are independent and functionally redundant dna bending proteins. this was reflected in the maintenance of in vivo activity of the final sigma54 ps promoter of the toluene degradation plasmid, tol, which requires facilitated dna bending, in deltahupb or deltahupn strains. however, hupb/hupn double mutants were not viable. it is suggested that the requirement for protein-facilitated dna bending is met in p. putida by two independent proteins that ensure an adequate supply of an essential cellular activity.

TI  == roles of dimerization in folding and stability of ketosteroid isomerase from pseudomonas putida biotype b.
AB  == equilibrium and kinetic analyses have been performed to elucidate the roles of dimerization in folding and stability of ksi from pseudomonas putida biotype b. folding was reversible in secondary and tertiary structures as well as in activity. equilibrium unfolding transition, as monitored by fluorescence and ellipticity measurements, could be modeled by a two-state mechanism without thermodynamically stable intermediates. consistent with the two-state model, one  dimensional (1d) nmr spectra and gel-filtration chromatography analysis did not show any evidence for a folded monomeric intermediate. interestingly enough, cys  81 located at the dimeric interface was modified by dtnb before unfolding. this inconsistent result might be explained by increased dynamic motion of the interface residues in the presence of urea to expose cys 81 more frequently without the dimer dissociation. the refolding process, as monitored by fluorescence change, could best be described by five kinetic phases, in which the second phase was a bimolecular step. because <30% of the total fluorescence change occurred during the first step, most of the native tertiary structure may  be driven to form by the bimolecular step. during the refolding process, negative ellipticity at 225 nm increased very fast within 80 msec to account for >80% of the total amplitude. this result suggests that the protein folds into a monomer containing most of the alpha-helical structures before dimerization. monitoring the enzyme activity during the refolding process could estimate the activity of the monomer that is not fully active. together, these results stress the importance of dimerization in the formation and maintenance of the functional native tertiary structure.

AB  == in pseudomonas putida u, the degradation of n-alkanoic and n-phenylalkanoic acids is carried out by two sets of beta-oxidation enzymes (betai and betaii). whereas  the first one (called betai) is constitutive and catalyses the degradation of n-alkanoic and n-phenylalkanoic acids very efficiently, the other one (betaii), which is only expressed when some of the genes encoding betai enzymes are mutated, catabolizes n-phenylalkanoates (n > 4) much more slowly. genetic studies revealed that disruption or deletion of some of the betai genes handicaps the growth of p. putida u in media containing n-alkanoic or n-phenylalkanoic acids with an acyl moiety longer than c4. however, all these mutants regained their ability to grow in media containing n-alkanoates as a result of the induction of  betaii, but they were still unable to catabolize n-phenylalkanoates completely, as the betai-fadba enzymes are essential for the beta-oxidation of certain n-phenylalkanoyl-coa derivatives when they reach a critical size. owing to the existence of the betaii system, mutants lacking betaifadb/a are able to synthesize new poly 3-oh-n-alkanoates (phas) and poly 3-oh-n-phenylalkanoates (phphas) efficiently. however, they are unable to degrade these polymers, becoming bioplastic overproducer mutants. the genetic and biochemical importance  of these results is reported and discussed.

TI  == analysis of the pmsceab gene cluster involved in biosynthesis of salicylic acid and the siderophore pseudomonine in the biocontrol strain pseudomonas fluorescens wcs374.
AB  == mutants of pseudomonas fluorescens wcs374 defective in biosynthesis of the fluorescent siderophore pseudobactin still display siderophore activity, indicating the production of a second siderophore. a recombinant cosmid clone (pmb374-07) of a wcs374 gene library harboring loci necessary for the biosynthesis of salicylic acid (sa) and this second siderophore pseudomonine was  isolated. the salicylate biosynthesis region of wcs374 was localized in a 5-kb ecori fragment of pmb374-07. the sa and pseudomonine biosynthesis region was identified by transfer of cosmid pmb374-07 to a pseudobactin-deficient strain of  p. putida. sequence analysis of the 5-kb subclone revealed the presence of four open reading frames (orfs). products of two orfs (pmsc and pmsb) showed homologies with chorismate-utilizing enzymes; a third orf (pmse) encoded a protein with strong similarity with enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of siderophores in other bacterial species. the region also contained a putative histidine decarboxylase gene (pmsa). a putative promoter region and two predicted iron boxes were localized upstream of pmsc. we determined by reverse transcriptase-mediated pcr that the pmsceab genes are cotranscribed and that expression is iron regulated. in vivo expression of sa genes was achieved in p. putida and escherichia coli cells. in e. coli, deletions affecting the first orf  (pmsc) diminished sa production, whereas deletion of pmsb abolished it completely. the pmsb gene induced low levels of sa production in e. coli when expressed under control of the lacz promoter. several lines of evidence indicate  that sa and pseudomonine biosynthesis are related. moreover, we isolated a tn5 mutant (374-05) that is simultaneously impaired in sa and pseudomonine production.

TI  == cell envelope mutants of pseudomonas putida: physiological characterization and analysis of their ability to survive in soil.
AB  == to generate mutants with altered lipopolysaccharides (lps) of the wild-type pseudomonas putida kt2442, we used the mini-tn5luxab-km transposon. a mutant was  found among luminescent colonies and selected as a negative clone in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) with monoclonal antibody (mab) 7.3b, which recognizes the o-antigen of p. putida lps. the dna region of the lps mutant interrupted by the minitransposon insertion was cloned and sequenced. comparison  of the deduced amino acid sequence with protein sequence databases showed similarity to the o-antigen polymerase (wzy) of salmonella enterica (muenchen). the wild-type gene was rescued by polymerase chain reaction (pcr), cloned into a  broad-host-range plasmid and used to carry out complementation assays. the cloned gene was able to restore the wild-type phenotype of the p. putida wzy mutant. we  constructed an isogenic mutant of the luminescent wzy mutant to which an oprl mutation was transferred by homologous recombination with an oprl::xyle cassette. the wzy mutants of p. putida were more sensitive to sds, deoxycholate and edta than the corresponding parental strains. we analysed the ability of wzy, oprl and wzy oprl mutants of p. putida to colonize soil. in comparison with the wild-type  strain, the ability of single mutants to colonize soil decreased; this characteristic was more evident for the double mutant, especially at high temperatures.

TI  == molecular screening for alkane hydroxylase genes in gram-negative and gram-positive strains.
AB  == we have developed highly degenerate oligonucleotides for polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of genes related to the pseudomonas oleovorans gpo1  and acinetobacter sp. adp1 alkane hydroxylases, based on a number of highly conserved sequence motifs. in all gram-negative and in two out of three gram-positive strains able to grow on medium- (c6-c11) or long-chain n-alkanes (c12-c16), pcr products of the expected size were obtained. the pcr fragments were cloned and sequenced and found to encode peptides with 43.2-93.8% sequence identity to the corresponding fragment of the p. oleovorans gpo1 alkane hydroxylase. strains that were unable to grow on n-alkanes did not yield pcr products with homology to alkane hydroxylase genes. the alkane hydroxylase genes  of acinetobacter calcoaceticus eb104 and pseudomonas putida p1 were cloned using  the pcr products as probes. the two genes allow an alkane hydroxylase-negative mutant of acinetobacter sp. adp1 and an escherichia coli recombinant containing all p. oleovorans alk genes except alkb, respectively, to grow on n-alkanes, showing that the cloned genes do indeed encode alkane hydroxylases.

TI  == crystallization and preliminary crystallographic study of the periplasmic domain  of the escherichia coli tolr protein.
AB  == the tolr protein from escherichia coli is part of the tol-pal multiprotein complex used by group a colicins to penetrate and kill cells. all genes of the tol-pal system are conserved in gram-negative bacteria and this system is thought to play a role in the maintenance of the bacterial envelope integrity, although its exact function is not known. the tolr protein comprises 142 amino acids. the  periplasmic domain of the tolr protein has been expressed, purified and crystallized. the crystals belong to the tetragonal space group p4(1)22, with unit-cell parameters a = 46.3, c = 178.0 a. there are one or two molecules in the asymmetric unit. frozen crystals diffract to at least 3.2 a resolution using synchrotron radiation. selenomethionine-substituted periplasmic tolr protein is currently being produced in order to use multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (mad) for phasing.

TI  == identification and characterization of the dnaa upstream region of thermus thermophilus.
AB  == the gene order in the dnaa region of thermus thermophilus was determined. previously, we showed that the putative oric of t. thermophilus is located in the dnaa-dnan intergenic region. in the 4 kb region upstream of the dnaa gene four orfs were found, all orientated in the same direction which is opposite to that of dnaa. the orfs were identified as t. thermophilus homologs of gida, gidb, soj  and spo0j of bacillus subtilis. the gene order spo0j-soj-gidb-gida-dnaa-dnan resembles that of b. subtilis, pseudomonas putida, coxiella burnetii, streptomyces coelicolor, mycobacterium leprae, and mycobacterium tuberculosis. we identified the transcriptional start point of the dnaa gene. the -10 region shows significant homology to the escherichia coli -10 consensus sequence. the putative -35 region shows homology neither to the e. coli -35 consensus sequence nor to known -35 sequences of t. thermophilus. there are no dnaa boxes in the promoter region, and consequently dnaa transcription is not repressed by dnaa protein in vitro, i.e. the dnaa gene of t. thermophilus is not autoregulated.

TI  == survival rate of microbes after freeze-drying and long-term storage.
AB  == the survival rates of 10 species of microorganisms were investigated after freeze-drying and preserving in a vacuum at 5 degrees c. the survival rates varied with species. the survival rates immediately after freeze-drying were different among yeast, gram-positive bacteria, and gram-negative bacteria, and the change in the 10-year survival rate was species-specific. the survival rate of yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae, was about 10% immediately after drying, and the rate did not decrease significantly during the 10-year storage period. survival rates after the drying of gram-positive bacteria, i.e., brevibacterium flavum, b. lactofermentum, corynebacterium acetoacidophilum, c. gultamicum, and streptococcus mutans, were around 80%. the survival rate of brevibacterium and corynebacterium did not decrease greatly during the storage period, whereas the rate of s. mutans decreased to about 20% after 10 years. survival rates after the drying of gram-negative bacteria, i.e., escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, serratia marcescens, and alcaligenes faecalis, were around 50%. the survival rate decreased for the first 5 years and then stabilized to around 10% thereafter.

TI  == rational design of a bacterial transcriptional cascade for amplifying gene expression capacity.
AB  == cascade regulatory circuits have been described that control numerous cell processes, and may provide models for the design of artificial circuits with novel properties. here we describe the design of a transcriptional regulatory cascade to amplify the cell response to a given signal. we used the salicylate-responsive activators of pseudomonas putida nahr of the naphthalene degradation plasmid nah7 and xyls2, a mutant regulator of the tol plasmid for catabolism of m-xylene and their respective cognate promoters psal and pm: control of the expression of xyls2 with the nahr/psal system permitted either their selective activation with specific effectors for each protein or the simultaneous activation of both of them with salicylate. when cells face the common effector of the two regulators, both the increase in xyls2 concentration and the stimulation of its activity act synergistically on the pm: promoter, amplifying the gene expression capacity by at least one order of magnitude with respect to the individual systems. by changing the hierarchy of regulators, we showed that the specific features of the downstream regulator were crucial for the amplification effect. directed changes in the effector profile of the regulators allowed the extension of the amplifying system to other molecular signals.

TI  == pseudomonas putida ce2010 can degrade biphenyl by a mosaic pathway encoded by the tod operon and cmte, which are identical to those of p. putida f1 except for a single base difference in the operator-promoter region of the cmt operon.
AB  == psudomonas putida ce2010 can assimilate biphenyl despite its high similarity to p. putida f1. biphenyl degradation in strain ce2010 was achieved using a mosaic of pathways consisting of the cmt and tod operons. cmte hydrolysed 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoic acid, the meta-cleavage product of 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl. this enzyme was expressed differently in strains ce2010 and f1. a cmte disruption mutant, a tod operon disruption mutant and a cmt operon disruption mutant were unable to utilize biphenyl. the introduction of the cmte gene enabled the cmt operon disruption mutant to grow on biphenyl. a single base  difference was found in the cmt promoter-operator region in strain ce2010, compared with that of strain f1. cymr protein was purified from escherichia coli  and binding assays were performed, the results of which suggested that the protein bound less strongly to the ce2010 operator sequence than to the f1 operator sequence. exchanging the f1 promoter-operator fragment into strain ce2010 resulted in a loss of biphenyl degradation capacity. these results indicate that cmte is not effectively repressed by cymr in strain ce2010, leading to low constitutive expression and, therefore, low growth on biphenyl.

TI  == a novel rolling-circle-replicating plasmid from pseudomonas putida p8: molecular  characterization and use as vector.
AB  == in pseudomonas putida p8, three cryptic circular plasmids were detected, i.e. ppp8-1 (2.5 kbp), ppp8-2 (42 kbp) and ppp8-3 (approximately 100 kbp). cloning and complete sequencing of ppp8-1 revealed a 2534 bp element harbouring four open reading frames (orfs a, b, c and d). no function could be attributed to the latter three orfs, whereas the predicted orf a gene product is homologous to replication proteins known from small multicopy plasmids of gram-positive bacteria and single-stranded (ss) phages, genetic elements replicating via a rolling circle (rc) mechanism involving characteristic ssdna intermediates. consistently, a double-strand origin of replication, highly conserved in rolling-circle-replicating (rcr) elements, was identified in ppp8-1, along with a putative single-strand origin. beyond this, ss replication intermediates were confirmed by southern analysis and mungbean-nuclease digestion. this being the first element of this type known in pseudomonads, a kanamycin-resistance gene was ligated into ppp8-1 and the resulting vector was successfully used for the transformation of both escherichia coli and p. putida.

TI  == directed evolution of toluene dioxygenase from pseudomonas putida for improved selectivity toward cis-indandiol during indene bioconversion.
AB  == toluene dioxygenase (tdo) from pseudomonas putida f1 converts indene to a mixture of cis-indandiol (racemic), 1-indenol, and 1-indanone. the desired product, cis-(1s,2r)-indandiol, is a potential key intermediate in the chemical synthesis  of indinavir sulfate (crixivan), merck's hiv-1 protease inhibitor for the treatment of aids. to reduce the undesirable byproducts 1-indenol and 1-indanone  formed during indene bioconversion, the recombinant tdo expressed in escherichia  coli was evolved by directed evolution using the error-prone polymerase chain reaction (eppcr) method. high-throughput fluorometric and spectrophotometric assays were developed for rapid screening of the mutant libraries in a 96-well format. mutants with reduced 1-indenol by-product formation were identified, and  the individual indene bioconversion product profiles of the selected mutants were confirmed by hplc. changes in the amino acid sequence of the mutant enzymes were  identified by analyzing the nucleotide sequence of the genes. a mutant with the most desirable product profile from each library, defined as the most reduced 1-indenol concentration and with the highest cis-(1s,2r)-indandiol enantiomeric excess, was used to perform each subsequent round of mutagenesis. after three rounds of mutagenesis and screening, mutant 1c4-3g was identified to have a threefold reduction in 1-indenol formation over the wild type (20% vs 60% of total products) and a 40% increase of product (cis-indandiol) yield.

TI  == control of the ferric citrate transport system of escherichia coli: mutations in  region 2.1 of the feci extracytoplasmic-function sigma factor suppress mutations  in the fecr transmembrane regulatory protein.
AB  == transcription of the ferric citrate transport genes is initiated by binding of ferric citrate to the feca protein in the outer membrane of escherichia coli k-12. bound ferric citrate does not have to be transported but initiates a signal that is transmitted by feca across the outer membrane and by fecr across the cytoplasmic membrane into the cytoplasm, where the feci extracytoplasmic-function (ecf) sigma factor becomes active. in this study, we isolated transcription initiation-negative missense mutants in the cytoplasmic region of fecr that were  located at four sites, l13q, w19r, w39r, and w50r, which are highly conserved in  fecr-like open reading frames of the pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida,  bordetella pertussis, bordetella bronchiseptica, and caulobacter crescentus genomes. the cytoplasmic portion of the fecr mutant proteins, fecr(1-85), did not interact with wild-type feci, in contrast to wild-type fecr(1-85), which induced  feci-mediated fecb transport gene transcription. two missense mutations in region 2.1 of feci, s15a and h20e, partially restored induction of ferric citrate transport gene induction of the fecr mutants by ferric citrate. region 2.1 of sigma(70) is thought to bind rna polymerase core enzyme; the residual activity of mutated feci in the absence of fecr, however, was not higher than that of wild-type feci. in addition, missense mutations in the feci promoter region resulted in a twofold increased transcription in fecr wild-type cells and a partial restoration of fec transport gene transcription in the fecr mutants. the  mutations reduced binding of the fe(2+) fur repressor and as a consequence enhanced feci transcription. the data reveal properties of the feci ecf factor distinct from those of sigma(70) and further support the novel transcription initiation model in which the cytoplasmic portion of fecr is important for feci activity.

TI  == a bioluminescent derivative of pseudomonas putida kt2440 for deliberate release into the environment.
AB  == recombinant derivatives of pseudomonas putida strain kt2440 are of potential interest as microbial inoculants to be deliberately released for agricultural applications. to facilitate tracking of this strain and its derivatives after introduction into the environment, a mini-tn5-'luxab transposon was introduced into the chromosome of p. putida kt2440, yielding strain p. putida s1b1. sequencing of the dna region located upstream of the 'luxab genes and similarity  search with the p. putida kt2440 genome sequence, localized the transposon within a 3021-bp open reading frame (orf), whose translated sequence showed significant  similarity with the hypothetical ydij proteins from escherichia coli and haemophilus influenzae. a second orf adjacent to and divergent from the ydij sequence was also found and showed significant homology with various lysr-type transcriptional activator proteins from several bacteria. disruption of the ydij  locus in p. putida s1b1 did not affect the survival of the strain in unvegetated  or vegetated soils. bioluminescent detection of p. putida s1b1 cells enriched in  selective media directly from soil allowed detection of culturable cells in soil  samples over a period of at least 8 months. the addition of the luxab biomarker facilitates tracking in the root system of several plant species grown under sterile and non-sterile conditions. the correlation of the bioluminescent phenotype with the growth activity of p. putida s1b1 cells colonizing the root system of barley and corn plants was estimated by monitoring ribosomal contents using quantitative hybridization with fluorescence-labeled ribosomal rna probes.  a correlation between inoculum density, light output, and ribosomal contents was  found for p. putida cells colonizing the root system of barley seedlings grown under sterile conditions. although ribosomal contents, and therefore growth activity, of p. putida s1b1 cells extracted from the rhizosphere of corn plants grown in non-sterile soil were similar to those found in starved cells, the luminescent system permitted non-destructive in situ detection of the strain in the upper root system.

TI  == genetic and biochemical characterization of 4-carboxy-2-hydroxymuconate-6-semialdehyde dehydrogenase and its role in the protocatechuate 4,5-cleavage pathway in sphingomonas paucimobilis syk-6.
AB  == protocatechuate (pca) is the key intermediate metabolite in the lignin degradation pathway of sphingomonas paucimobilis syk-6 and is metabolized to pyruvate and oxaloacetate via the pca 4,5-cleavage pathway. we characterized the  4-carboxy-2-hydroxymuconate-6-semialdehyde (chms) dehydrogenase gene (ligc). chms is the 4,5-cleavage product of pca and is converted into 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylate (pdc) by ligc. we found that ligc was located 295 bp downstream of ligb, which encodes the large subunit of the pca 4,5-dioxygenase. the ligc gene consists of a 945-bp open reading frame encoding a polypeptide with a molecular mass of 34,590 da. the deduced amino acid sequence of ligc showed 19  to 20% identity with 3-chlorobenzoate cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase of alcaligenes sp. strain br60 and phthalate cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenases of pseudomonas putida nmh102-2 and burkholderia cepacia dbo1, which are unrelated to group i, ii, and iii microbial alcohol dehydrogenases (m. f. reid and c. a. fewson, crit. rev. microbiol. 20:13-56, 1994). the ligc gene was expressed in escherichia coli and ligc was purified to near homogeneity. production of pdc from chms catalyzed by ligc was confirmed in the presence of nadp(+) by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. ligc is a homodimer. the isoelectric point, optimum ph, and optimum temperature were estimated to be 5.3, 8.0, and 25 degrees c, respectively. the k(m) for nadp(+) was estimated to be 24.6 +/- 1.5 microm, which was approximately 10 times lower than that for nad(+) (252 +/- 3.9 microm). the k(m)s for chms in the presence of nadp(+) and nad(+) are 26.0 +/- 0.5 and 20.6 +/- 1.0 microm, respectively. disruption of ligc in s. paucimobilis syk-6 prevented growth with vanillate. only pca was accumulated during the incubation of vanillate with the whole cells of the ligc insertion mutant (dlc), indicating a lack of pca 4,5-dioxygenase activity in dlc. however, the introduction of ligc into dlc restored its ability to grow on vanillate. pdc was suggested to be an inducer for ligab gene expression.

AB  == antibiotic resistance plasmids were exogenously isolated in biparental matings with piggery manure bacteria as plasmid donors in escherichia coli cv601 and pseudomonas putida uwc1 recipients. surprisingly, incq-like plasmids were detected by dot blot hybridization with an incq oriv probe in several p. putida uwc1 transconjugants. the capture of incq-like plasmids in biparental matings indicates not only their high prevalence in manure slurries but also the presence of efficiently mobilizing plasmids. in order to elucidate unusual hybridization data (weak or no hybridization with incq repb or incq orit probes) four incq-like plasmids (pie1107, pie1115, pie1120, and pie1130), each representing a different  ecorv restriction pattern, were selected for a more thorough plasmid characterization after transfer into e. coli k-12 strain dh5alpha by transformation. the characterization of the incq-like plasmids revealed an astonishingly high diversity with regard to phenotypic and genotypic properties.  four different multiple antibiotic resistance patterns were found to be conferred by the incq-like plasmids. the plasmids could be mobilized by the rp4 derivative  pth10 into acinetobacter sp., ralstonia eutropha, agrobacterium tumefaciens, and  p. putida, but they showed diverse patterns of stability under nonselective growth conditions in different host backgrounds. incompatibility testing and pcr  analysis clearly revealed at least two different types of incq-like plasmids. pcr amplification of total dna extracted directly from different manure samples and other environments indicated the prevalence of both types of incq plasmids in manure, sewage, and farm soil. these findings suggest that incq plasmids play an  important role in disseminating antibiotic resistance genes.

AB  == there is limited knowledge of interspecies interactions in biofilm communities. in this study, pseudomonas sp. strain gj1, a 2-chloroethanol (2-ce)-degrading organism, and pseudomonas putida dmp1, a p-cresol-degrading organism, produced distinct biofilms in response to model mixed waste streams composed of 2-ce and various p-cresol concentrations. the two organisms maintained a commensal relationship, with dmp1 mitigating the inhibitory effects of p-cresol on gj1. a triple-labeling technique compatible with confocal microscopy was used to investigate the influence of toxicant concentrations on biofilm morphology, species distribution, and exopolysaccharide production. single-species biofilms of gj1 shifted from loosely associated cell clusters connected by exopolysaccharide to densely packed structures as the p-cresol concentrations increased, and biofilm formation was severely inhibited at high p-cresol concentrations. in contrast, gj1 was abundant when associated with dmp1 in a dual-species biofilm at all p-cresol concentrations, although at high p-cresol concentrations it was present only in regions of the biofilm where it was surrounded by dmp1. evidence in support of a commensal relationship between dmp1  and gj1 was obtained by comparing gj1-dmp1 biofilms with dual-species biofilms containing gj1 and escherichia coli atcc 33456, an adhesive strain that does not  mineralize p-cresol. additionally, the data indicated that only tower-like cell structures in the gj1-dmp1 biofilm produced exopolysaccharide, in contrast to the uniform distribution of eps in the single-species gj1 biofilm.

TI  == characterization of three xylt-like [2fe-2s] ferredoxins associated with catabolism of cresols or naphthalene: evidence for their involvement in catechol  dioxygenase reactivation.
AB  == the xylt gene product, a component of the xylene catabolic pathway of pseudomonas putida mt2, has been recently characterized as a novel [2fe-2s] ferredoxin which  specifically reactivates oxygen-inactivated catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (xyle). in this study, three xylt-like proteins potentially involved in the catabolism of naphthalene (naht) or cresols (phhq and dmpq) have been overexpressed in escherichia coli, purified, and compared with respect to their biochemical properties and interaction with xyle. the three xylt analogues show general spectroscopic characteristics common to plant-type [2fe-2s] ferredoxins as well as distinctive features that appear to be typical for the xylt subgroup of these  proteins. the midpoint redox potentials of the phhq and dmpq proteins were -286 mv and -323 mv, respectively. interestingly, all purified xylt-like proteins promoted in vitro reactivation of xyle almost as efficiently as xylt. the interaction of xyle with xylt and its analogues was studied by cross-linking experiments using the 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide. a polypeptide band with an m(r) of 46,000, which corresponded to the cross-linked product between one xyle subunit and one molecule of ferredoxin, was obtained in  all cases. the formation of the complex was affected by ionic strength, indicating that electrostatic forces are involved in the dioxygenase-ferredoxin interaction. in complementation experiments, plasmids expressing xylt or its analogues were introduced into an xylt-null mutant of p. putida which is unable to grow on p-methylbenzoate. all transconjugants regained the wild-type phenotype, indicating that all analogues can substitute for xylt in the in vivo reactivation of xyle. our results provide evidence for a subgroup of [2fe-2s] ferredoxins with distinct biochemical properties whose specific function is to reactivate intrinsically labile extradiol ring cleavage dioxygenases involved in  the catabolism of various aromatic hydrocarbons.

TI  == regioselectivity and enantioselectivity of naphthalene dioxygenase during arene cis-dihydroxylation: control by phenylalanine 352 in the alpha subunit.
AB  == the naphthalene dioxygenase (ndo) system catalyzes the first step in the degradation of naphthalene by pseudomonas sp. strain ncib 9816-4. the enzyme has  a broad substrate range and catalyzes several types of reactions including cis-dihydroxylation, monooxygenation, and desaturation. substitution of valine or leucine at phe-352 near the active site iron in the alpha subunit of ndo altered  the stereochemistry of naphthalene cis-dihydrodiol formed from naphthalene and also changed the region of oxidation of biphenyl and phenanthrene. in this study, we replaced phe-352 with glycine, alanine, isoleucine, threonine, tryptophan, and tyrosine and determined the activity with naphthalene, biphenyl, and phenanthrene as substrates. ndo variants f352w and f352y were marginally active with all substrates tested. f352g and f352a had reduced but significant activity, and f352i, f352t, f352v, and f352l had nearly wild-type activities with respect to naphthalene oxidation. all active enzymes had altered regioselectivity with biphenyl and phenanthrene. in addition, the f352v and f352t variants formed the opposite enantiomer of biphenyl cis-3,4-dihydrodiol [77 and 60% (-)-(3s,4r), respectively] to that formed by wild-type ndo [>98% (+)-(3r,4s)]. the f352v mutant enzyme also formed the opposite enantiomer of phenanthrene cis-1,2-dihydrodiol from phenanthrene to that formed by biphenyl dioxygenase from sphingomonas yanoikuyae b8/36. a recombinant escherichia coli strain expressing the f352v variant of ndo and the enantioselective toluene cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase from pseudomonas putida f1 was used to produce enantiomerically pure (-)-biphenyl cis-(3s,4r)-dihydrodiol and (-)-phenanthrene cis-(1s,2r)-dihydrodiol from biphenyl and phenanthrene, respectively.

TI  == site-directed mutagenesis of potential catalytic residues in 1h-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline 2,4-dioxygenase, and hypothesis on the catalytic mechanism of 2,4-dioxygenolytic ring cleavage.
AB  == 1h-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline 2,4-dioxygenase (qdo) is a cofactor-free dioxygenase  proposed to belong to the alpha/beta hydrolase fold superfamily of enzymes. alpha/beta hydrolases contain a highly conserved catalytic triad (nucleophile-acidic residue-histidine). we previously identified a corresponding  catalytically essential histidine residue in qdo. however, as shown by amino acid replacements through site-directed mutagenesis, nucleophilic and acidic residues  of qdo considered as possible triad residues were not absolutely required for activity. this suggests that qdo does not contain the canonical catalytic triad of the alpha/beta hydrolase fold enzymes. some radical trapping agents affected the qdo-catalyzed reaction. a hypothetical mechanism of qdo-catalyzed dioxygenation of 1h-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline is compared with the dioxygenation of fmnh2 catalyzed by bacterial luciferase, which also uses a histidine residue as catalytic base.

TI  == cloning and expression of the nitrile hydratase and amidase genes from bacillus sp. br449 into escherichia coli.
AB  == a moderate thermophile, bacillus sp. br449 was previously shown to exhibit a high level of nitrile hydratase (nhase) activity when growing on high levels of acrylonitrile at 55 degrees c. in this report, we describe the cloning of a 6.1 kb sali dna fragment encoding the nhase gene cluster of br449 into escherichia coli. nucleotide sequencing revealed six orfs encoding (in order), two unidentified putative proteins, amidase, nhase beta- and alpha-subunits and a small putative protein of 101 amino acids designated p12k. spacings and orientation of the coding regions as well as their gene expression in e. coli suggest that the beta-subunit, alpha-subunit, and p12k genes are co-transcribed.  analysis of deduced amino acid sequences indicate that the amidase (348 aa, mw 38.6 kda) belongs to the nitrilase-related aliphatic amidase family, and that the nhase beta- (229 aa, mw 26.5 kda) and alpha- (214 aa, mw 24.5 kda) subunits comprise a cobalt-containing member of the nhase family, which includes rhodococcus rhodochrous j1 and pseudomonas putida 5b nhases. the amidase/nhase gene cluster differs both in arrangement and composition from those described for other nhase-producing strains. when expressed in escherichia coli dh5alpha, the subcloned nhase genes produced significant levels of active nhase enzyme when cobalt ion was added either to the culture medium or cell extracts. presence of the p12k gene and addition of amide compounds as inducers were not required for this expression.

TI  == analysis of the thiocapsa pfennigii polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase: subcloning, molecular characterization and generation of hybrid synthases with the corresponding chromatium vinosum enzyme.
AB  == the pha synthase structural gene of thiocapsa pfennigii was identified and subcloned on a 2.8-kbp bamhi restriction fragment, which was cloned recently from a genomic 15.6-kbp ecori restriction fragment. nucleotide sequence analysis of this fragment revealed three open reading frames (orfs), representing coding regions. two orfs encoded for the phae (mr 40,950) and phac (mr 40,190) subunits  of the pha synthase from t. pfennigii and exhibited high homology with the corresponding proteins of the chromatium vinosum (52.8% and 85.2% amino acid identity) and the thiocystis violacea (52.5% and 82.4%) pha synthases, respectively. this confirmed that the t. pfennigii pha synthase was composed of two different subunits. also, with respect to the molecular organization of phae  and phac, this region of the t. pfennigii genome resembled very much the corresponding regions of c. vinosum and of thiocystis violacea. a recombinant strain of pseudomonas putida, which overexpressed phae and phac from t. pfennigii, was used to isolate the pha synthase by a two-step procedure including chromatography on procion blue h-erd and hydroxyapatite. the isolated pha synthase consisted of two proteins exhibiting the molecular weights predicted for phae and phac. hybrid pha synthases composed of phae from t. pfennigii and phac from c. vinosum and vice versa were constructed and functionally expressed in a pha-negative mutant of p. putida; and the resulting phas were analyzed.

TI  == mutations in each of the tol genes of pseudomonas putida reveal that they are critical for maintenance of outer membrane stability.
AB  == the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria functions as a permeability barrier  that protects cells against a large number of antibacterial agents. oprl protein  of pseudomonas putida has been shown to be crucial to maintain the stability of this cell component (j. j. rodriguez-herva, m.-i. ramos-gonzalez, and j. l. ramos. j. bacteriol. 178:1699-1706, 1996). in the present study we cloned and mutagenized the orf1, tolq, tolr, tola, and tolb genes from p. putida kt2440, which were located upstream of the oprl gene. polar and nonpolar mutations of the p. putida tolq, tolr, tola, and tolb genes were generated in vitro by using the omega-km(r) interposon, which carries two transcriptional stop signals, or a promoterless xyle cassette, lacking any transcriptional stop signal, respectively. the mutant constructs were used to inactivate, by reverse genetics  procedures, the corresponding chromosomal copies of the genes. the phenotype of each mutant strain was analyzed and compared with those of the wild-type strain and the previously characterized p. putida oprl::xyle mutant. all mutant strains  exhibited a similar phenotype: altered cell morphology, bleb formation at the cell surface, release of periplasmic and outer membrane proteins to the extracellular medium, increased sensitivity to a variety of compounds (i.e., edta, sodium dodecyl sulfate, deoxycholate, and some antibiotics), filament formation, and severely reduced cell motility. altogether, these results demonstrate the importance of the tol-oprl system for the maintenance of outer membrane integrity in p. putida and suggest a possible role of these proteins in  assembling outer membrane components.

TI  == microbial conversion of indene to indandiol: a key intermediate in the synthesis  of crixivan.
AB  == indene is oxidized to mixtures of cis- and trans-indandiols and related metabolites by pseudomonas putida and rhodococcus sp. isolates. indene metabolism is consistent with monooxygenase and dioxygenase activity. p. putida resolves enantiomeric mixtures of cis-1,2-indandiol by further selective oxidation of the  1r, 2s-enantiomer yielding high enantiomeric purity of cis-(1s, 2r)-indandiol, a  potential intermediate in the synthesis of indinavir sulfate (crixivan), a protease inhibitor used in the treatment of aids. molecular cloning of p. putida  toluene dioxygenase in escherichia coli confirmed the requirement for the dihydrodiol dehydrogenase in resolving racemic mixtures of cis-indandiol. rhodococcus sp. isolates convert indene to cis-(1s, 2r)-indandiol at high initial enantiomeric excess and one isolate also produces trans-(1r, 2r)-indandiol, suggesting the presence of monooxygenase activity. scale up and optimization of the bioconversions to these key synthons for chiral synthesis of potential intermediates for commercial manufacture of indinavir sulfate are described.

TI  == pm promoter expression mutants and their use in broad-host-range rk2 plasmid vectors.
AB  == by coupling the pm/xyls promoter system to minimal replicons of the broad-host-range plasmid rk2 we recently showed that such vectors are useful for  both high- and low-level inducible expression of cloned genes in gram-negative bacteria. in this report, we extend this potential by identifying point mutations in or near the -10 transcriptional region of pm. point mutations leading to gene-independent enhancements of expression levels of the induced state or reduced background expression levels were identified using escherichia coli as a  host. by combining these mutations an additive effect in expression levels from the constructed pm was observed. the highest induced expression level was obtained by inserting an e. coli consensus sigma70 - 10 recognition region. most  of the remaining activities in the reduced-background mutations appeared to originate from a transcriptional start site other than pm. the effects of some of these mutations were also analyzed in pseudomonas aeruginosa and were found to act similarly, but less pronounced in this host.

TI  == parameters affecting gene expression from the pm promoter in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the pm promoter inserted chromosomally or in broad-host-range replicons based on  plasmid rsf1010 or rk2 are useful systems for both high- and low-level expression of cloned genes in several gram-negative bacterial species. the positive pm regulator xyls is activated by certain substituted benzoic acid derivatives, and  here we show that these effectors induce expression of pm at similar relative ranking levels in both escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa however, the kinetics of expression was not the same in the two organisms. different carbon sources and dissolved oxygen levels displayed limited effects on expression, but  surprisingly the ph of the growth medium was found to be of major importance. by  combining the effects of genetic and environmental parameters, expression from pm could be varied over a ten-thousand- to a hundred-thousand-fold continuous range, and as an example of its applications we showed that pm can be used to control the xanthan biosynthesis in xanthomonas campestris.

TI  == overexpression of salicylate hydroxylase and the crucial role of lys(163) as its  nadh binding site.
AB  == expression systems for the sal gene encoding salicylate hydroxylase from pseudomonas putida s-1 were examined and some constructs were expressed in these  systems. by cultivation of escherichia coli bl21 (de3)/psah8 in lb medium at 37 degrees c with isopropyl-b-d-thiogalactopyranoside as the inducer, salicylate hydroxylase was overexpressed mainly in the form of inclusion bodies. lower temperature cultivation at 20 degrees c after induction resulted in a large amount of the enzyme in the soluble form. the e. coli clone harboring the recombinant plasmid produced a 45 kda protein that appeared to be electrophoretically and immunochemically identical to the p. putida enzyme and contained the same n-terminal amino acid sequence. this recombinant dna product also exhibited properties characteristic of a flavoprotein and was fully functional as salicylate hydroxylase. based on chemical modification of the salicylate hydroxylase from p. putida, lys163 was previously proposed to be the nadh binding site. in this study, to obtain a better understanding of the predicted role of lys163, this residue in the active center of salicylate hydroxylase was replaced with arg, gly, or glu by conventional site-directed mutagenesis. kinetic studies using these mutant enzymes and the recombinant enzyme revealed increases in apparent k(m) values for nadh in the order of wild-type enzyme > k163r > k163g > k163e, with some decreases in v(max). examination of the recombinant enzyme and k163g indicated that the ph dependency  of k(m) on nadh with pk(a) 10.5 is lost by mutation despite the lack of changes in v(max) values, suggesting a requirement for the lysine residue as the nadh binding site. based on these results, lys163 is proposed to play a role in the binding of nadh at the active site through an ionic bond rather than playing a role in catalysis.

TI  == mutational analysis of the highly conserved c-terminal residues of the xyls protein, a member of the arac family of transcriptional regulators.
AB  == the xyls protein of the tol plasmid of pseudomonas putida belongs to the so-called arac/xyls family of regulators, that includes more than 100 different bacterial proteins. a conserved stretch of about 100 amino acids is present at the c-terminal end. this conserved region is believed to contain seven alpha-helices, including two helix-turn-helix (hth) dna binding motifs (alpha(2)-t-alpha(3) and alpha(5)-talpha-(6)), connected by a linker alpha-helix  (alpha(4)), and two flanking alpha-helices (alpha(1) and alpha(7)). the second hth motif is the region with the highest homology in the proteins of the family,  with certain residues showing almost 90% identity. we have constructed xyls single mutants in the most conserved residues and have analysed their ability to  stimulate transcription from its cognate promoter, pm, fused to 'lacz. the analysis revealed that mutations in the alpha(5)-helix conserved residues had little effect on the xyls transcriptional activity, whereas the distribution of polarity in the alpha(6)-helix was important for the activity. the strongest effect of the mutations was observed in conserved residues located outside the dna binding domain, namely, gly-290 in the turn between the two helices, pro-309  located downstream of alpha(6), and leu-313, in the small last helix alpha(7), that seems to play an important role in the activation of rna-polymerase. our analysis shows that conservation of amino acids in the family reflects structural requirements rather than functionality in specific dna interactions.

AB  == the atsk gene of pseudomonas putida s-313 was required for growth with alkyl sulfate esters as sulfur source. the atsk protein was overexpressed in escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. sequence analysis revealed that atsk was closely related to e. coli taurine dioxygenase (38% amino acid identity). the atsk protein catalyzed the alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent cleavage  of a range of alkyl sulfate esters, with chain lengths ranging from c(4) to c(12), required oxygen and fe(2+) for activity and released succinate, sulfate, and the corresponding aldehyde as products. enzyme activity was optimal at ph 7 and was strongly stimulated by ascorbate. unlike most other characterized alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, atsk accepted a range of alpha-keto acids as co-substrates, including alpha-ketoglutarate (k(m) 140 microm), alpha-ketoadipate, alpha-ketovalerate, and alpha-ketooctanoate. the measured k(m) values for hexyl sulfate and sds were 40 and 34 microm, respectively. the apparent m(r) of the purified enzyme of 121,000 was consistent with a homotetrameric structure, which is unusual for this enzyme superfamily, members of which are usually monomeric or dimeric. the properties and amino acid sequence of the atsk enzyme thus define it as an unusual oxygenolytic alkylsulfatase and a novel member of the alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family.

AB  == the ubiquitous glyoxalase system, which is composed of two enzymes, removes cellular cytotoxic methylglyoxal (mg). in an effort to identify critical residues conserved in the evolution of the first enzyme in this system, glyoxalase i (glxi), as well as the structural implications of sequence alterations in this enzyme, a search of the national center for biotechnology information (ncbi) database of unfinished genomes was undertaken. eleven putative glxi sequences from pathogenic organisms were identified and analyses of these sequences in relation to the known and previously identified glxi enzymes were performed. several of these sequences show a very high similarity to the escherichia coli glxi sequence, most notably the 79% identity of the sequence identified from yersinia pestis, the causative agent of bubonic plague. in addition to the conservation of residues critical to binding the catalytic metal in all of the proposed glxi enzymes, four regions in the homo sapiens glxi enzyme are absent in all of the bacterial glxi sequences, with the exception of pseudomonas putida. removal of these regions may alter the active-site conformation of the bacterial  enzymes in relation to that of the h. sapiens. these differences may be targeted  for the development of inhibitors selective to the bacterial enzymes.

TI  == the ssu locus plays a key role in organosulfur metabolism in pseudomonas putida s-313.
AB  == pseudomonas putida s-313 can utilize a broad range of aromatic sulfonates as sulfur sources for growth in sulfate-free minimal medium. the sulfonates are cleaved monooxygenolytically to yield the corresponding phenols. minitn5 mutants  of strain s-313 which were no longer able to desulfurize arylsulfonates were isolated and were found to carry transposon insertions in the ssueadcbf operon, which contained genes for an atp-binding cassette-type transporter (ssuabc), a two-component reduced flavin mononucleotide-dependent monooxygenase (ssued) closely related to the escherichia coli alkanesulfonatase, and a protein related  to clostridial molybdopterin-binding proteins (ssuf). these mutants were also deficient in growth with a variety of other organosulfur sources, including aromatic and aliphatic sulfate esters, methionine, and aliphatic sulfonates other than the natural sulfonates taurine and cysteate. this pleiotropic phenotype was  complemented by the ssu operon, confirming its key role in organosulfur metabolism in this species. further complementation analysis revealed that the ssuf gene product was required for growth with all of the tested substrates except methionine and that the oxygenase encoded by ssud was required for growth  with sulfonates or methionine. the flavin reductase ssue was not required for growth with aliphatic sulfonates or methionine but was needed for growth with arylsulfonates, suggesting that an alternative isozyme exists for the former compounds that is not active in transformation of the latter substrates. aryl sulfate ester utilization was catalyzed by an arylsulfotransferase, and not by an arylsulfatase as in the related species pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == characterization and expression of the pseudomonas putida bacterioferritin alpha  subunit gene.
AB  == the root-colonizing pseudomonad pseudomonas putida (pp) appears to produce two subunits, alpha and beta, of the iron-binding protein, bacterioferritin. a gene encoding the alpha-bacterioferritin subunit was located adjacent to the major catalase in pp. the deduced protein sequence of the pp bfralpha gene had a very high identity with other alpha-subunits, possessing conserved amino acids responsible for ferroxidase activity. the gene also lacked a deduced methionine at residue 52, associated with heme binding in beta-subunits. an antibody generated toward the escherichia coli (e. coli) multifunctional single subunit bacterioferritin recognized two proteins in the pp extract, a 22 kda protein likely to be a beta-subunit and, to a lesser extent, a 23 kda band. the 23 kda band was absent in a pp mutant in which the bfralpha gene was disrupted. loss of  alpha-bacterioferritin stimulated production of fluorescent siderophore. growth on media and on root surfaces was not impaired by deletion of the alpha-bacterioferritin. transcription of bfralpha was independent of the catalase gene and was dependent on iron. the transcript levels from bfralpha decreased in  iron deficiency experienced during stationary-phase or upon treatment during growth with an iron chelator.

TI  == interactions of dnaa proteins from distantly related bacteria with the replication origin of the broad host range plasmid rk2.
AB  == replication initiation of the broad host range plasmid rk2 requires binding of the host-encoded dnaa protein to specific sequences (dnaa boxes) at its replication origin (oriv). in contrast to a chromosomal replication origin, which functionally interacts only with the native dnaa protein of the organism, the ability of rk2 to replicate in a wide range of gram-negative bacterial hosts requires the interaction of oriv with many different dnaa proteins. in this study we compared the interactions of oriv with five different dnaa proteins. dnase i footprint, gel mobility shift, and surface plasmon resonance analyses showed that the dnaa proteins from escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, and pseudomonas aeruginosa bind to the dnaa boxes at oriv and are capable of inducing open complex formation, the first step in the replication initiation process. however, dnaa proteins from two gram-positive bacteria, bacillus subtilis and streptomyces lividans, while capable of specifically interacting with the dnaa box sequences at oriv, do not bind stably and fail to induce open complex formation. these results suggest that the inability of the dnaa protein of a host bacterium to form a stable and functional complex with the dnaa boxes at oriv is a limiting step for plasmid host range.

AB  == xylene monooxygenase of pseudomonas putida mt-2 catalyzes the methylgroup hydroxylation of toluene and xylenes. to investigate the potential of xylene monooxygenase to catalyze multistep oxidations of one methyl group, we tested recombinant escherichia coli expressing the monooxygenase genes xylm and xyla under the control of the alk regulatory system of pseudomonas oleovorans gpo1. expression of xylene monooxygenase genes could efficiently be controlled by n-octane and dicyclopropylketone. xylene monooxygenase was found to catalyze the  oxygenation of toluene, pseudocumene, the corresponding alcohols, and the corresponding aldehydes. for all three transformations (18)o incorporation provided stong evidence for a monooxygenation type of reaction, with gem-diols as the most likely reaction intermediates during the oxygenation of benzyl alcohols  to benzaldehydes. to investigate the role of benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase (xylb)  in the formation of benzaldehydes, xylb was cloned behind and expressed in concert with xylma. in comparison to e. coli expressing only xylma, the presence  of xylb lowered product formation rates and resulted in back formation of benzyl  alcohol from benzaldehyde. in p. putida mt-2 xylb may prevent the formation of high concentrations of the particularly reactive benzaldehydes. in the case of high fluxes through the degradation pathways and low aldehyde concentrations, xylb may contribute to benzaldehyde formation via the energetically favorable dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohols. the results presented here characterize xylma as an enzyme able to catalyze the multistep oxygenation of toluenes.

TI  == riding the sulfur cycle--metabolism of sulfonates and sulfate esters in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == sulfonates and sulfate esters are widespread in nature, and make up over 95% of the sulfur content of most aerobic soils. many microorganisms can use sulfonates  and sulfate esters as a source of sulfur for growth, even when they are unable to metabolize the carbon skeleton of the compounds. in these organisms, expression of sulfatases and sulfonatases is repressed in the presence of sulfate, in a process mediated by the lysr-type regulator protein cysb, and the corresponding genes therefore constitute an extension of the cys regulon. additional regulator  proteins required for sulfonate desulfonation have been identified in escherichia coli (the cbl protein) and pseudomonas putida (the asfr protein). desulfonation of aromatic and aliphatic sulfonates as sulfur sources by aerobic bacteria is oxygen-dependent, carried out by the alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent taurine dioxygenase, or by one of several fmnh(2)-dependent monooxygenases. desulfurization of condensed thiophenes is also fmnh(2)-dependent, both in the rhodococci and in two gram-negative species. bacterial utilization of aromatic sulfate esters is catalyzed by arylsulfatases, most of which are related to human lysosomal sulfatases and contain an active-site formylglycine group that is generated post-translationally. sulfate-regulated alkylsulfatases, by contrast, are less well characterized. our increasing knowledge of the sulfur-regulated metabolism of organosulfur compounds suggests applications in practical fields such as biodesulfurization, bioremediation, and optimization of crop sulfur nutrition.

TI  == the pseudomonas aeruginosa phag gene product is involved in the synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoic acid consisting of medium-chain-length constituents from non-related carbon sources.
AB  == we recently identified the phag(pp) gene encoding (r)-3-hydroxydecanoyl-acp:coa transacylase in pseudomonas putida, which directly links the fatty acid de novo biosynthesis and polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) biosynthesis. an open reading frame (orf) of which the deduced amino acid sequence shared about 57% identity with phag from p. putida was identified in the p. aeruginosa genome sequence. its coding region (herein called phag(pa)) was amplified by pcr and cloned into the vector pbbr1mcs-2 under lac promoter control. the resulting plasmid pbhr88 mediated pha synthesis contributing to about 13% of cellular dry weight from non-related carbon sources in the phag(pp)-negative mutant p. putida phag(n)-21.  the pha was composed of 5 mol% 3-hydroxydodecanoate, 61 mol% 3-hydroxydecanoate,  29 mol% 3-hydroxyoctanoate and 5 mol% 3-hydroxyhexanoate. furthermore, an isogenic phag(pa) knock-out mutant of p. aeruginosa was constructed by gene replacement. the phag(pa) mutant did not show any difference in growth rate, but  pha accumulation from gluconate was decreased to about 40% of wild-type level, whereas from fatty acids wild-type level pha accumulation was obtained. these data suggested that phag from p. aeruginosa exhibits 3-hydroxyacyl-acp:coa transacylase activity and strongly enhances the metabolic flux from fatty acid de novo synthesis towards pha(mcl) synthesis. therefore, a function could be assigned to the orf present in the p. aeruginosa genome, and a second phag is now known.

TI  == functional analysis of pvds, an iron starvation sigma factor of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == in pseudomonas aeruginosa, iron modulates gene expression through a cascade of negative and positive regulatory proteins. the master regulator fur is involved in iron-dependent repression of several genes. one of these genes, pvds, was predicted to encode a putative sigma factor responsible for the transcription of  a subset of genes of the fur regulon. pvds appears to belong to a structurally and functionally distinct subgroup of the extracytoplasmic function family of alternative sigma factors. members of this subgroup, also including pbra from pseudomonas fluorescens, pfri and pupi from pseudomonas putida, and feci from escherichia coli, are controlled by the fur repressor, and they activate transcription of genes for the biosynthesis or the uptake of siderophores. evidence is provided that the pvds protein of p. aeruginosa is endowed with biochemical properties of eubacterial sigma factors, as it spontaneously forms 1:1 complexes with the core fraction of rna polymerase (rnap, alpha(2)betabeta' subunits), thereby promoting in vitro binding of the pvds-rnap holoenzyme to the  promoter region of the pvda gene. these functional features of pvds are consistent with the presence of structural domains predicted to be involved in core rnap binding, promoter recognition, and open complex formation. the activity of pyoverdin biosynthetic (pvd) promoters was significantly lower in e. coli overexpressing the multicopy pvds gene than in wild-type p. aeruginosa pao1 carrying the single gene copy, and pvd::lacz transcriptional fusions were silent  in both pfri (the pvds homologue) and pfra (a positive regulator of pseudobactin  biosynthetic genes) mutants of p. putida wcs358, while they are expressed at pao1 levels in wild-type wcs358. moreover, the pvds-rnap holoenzyme purified from e. coli lacked the ability to generate in vitro transcripts from the pvda promoter.  these observations suggest that at least one additional positive regulator could  be required for full activity of the pvds-dependent transcription complex both in vivo and in vitro. this is consistent with the presence of a putative activator binding site (the iron starvation box) at variable distance from the transcription initiation sites of promoters controlled by the iron starvation sigma factors pvds, pfri, and pbra of fluorescent pseudomonads.

AB  == we demonstrate a very fast heterogeneous redox reaction of substrate-free cytochrome p450(cam) on a glassy carbon electrode modified with sodium montmorillonite. the linear relationship of the peak current in the cyclic voltammogram with the scan rate indicates a reversible one-electron transfer surface process. the electron transfer rate is in the range from 5 to 152 s(-1) with scan rates from 0.4 to 12 v/s, respectively. these values are comparable to  rates reported for the natural electron transfer from putidaredoxin to p450(cam). the formal potential of adsorbed p450(cam) is -139 mv (vs nhe) and therefore positively shifted by 164 mv compared to the potential of substrate-free p450(cam) in solution. uv-vis and ftir spectra do not indicate an influence of the clay colloidal particles on the heme and the secondary structure of p450(cam) in solution. however, p450(cam) adsorbed on the surface of the clay-modified electrode may undergo partial dehydration resulting in the shift of the formal potential.

AB  == the growth activity of pseudomonas putida cells colonizing the rhizosphere of barley seedlings was estimated at the single-cell level by monitoring ribosomal contents and synthesis rates. ribosomal synthesis was monitored by using a system comprising a fusion of the ribosomal escherichia coli rrnbp1 promoter to a gene encoding an unstable variant of the green fluorescent protein (gfp). gfp expression in a p. putida strain carrying this system inserted into the chromosome was strongly dependent on the growth phase and growth rate of the strain, and cells growing exponentially at rates of > or = 0.17 h(-1) emitted growth rate-dependent green fluorescence detectable at the single-cell level. the single-cell ribosomal contents were very heterogeneous, as determined by quantitative hybridization with fluorescently labeled rrna probes in p. putida cells extracted from the rhizosphere of 1-day-old barley seedlings grown under sterile conditions. after this, cells extracted from the root system had ribosomal contents similar to those found in starved cells. there was a significant decrease in the ribosomal content of p. putida cells when bacteria were introduced into nonsterile bulk or rhizosphere soil, and the gfp monitoring  system was not induced in cells extracted from either of the two soil systems. the monitoring system used permitted nondestructive in situ detection of fast-growing bacterial microcolonies on the sloughing root sheath cells of 1- and 2-day-old barley seedlings grown under sterile conditions, which demonstrated that it may be possible to use the unstable gfp marker for studies of transient gene expression in plant-microbe systems.

TI  == expression and stereochemical and isotope effect studies of active 4-oxalocrotonate decarboxylase.
AB  == 4-oxalocrotonate decarboxylase (4-od) and vinylpyruvate hydratase (vph) from pseudomonas putida mt-2 form a complex that converts 2-oxo-3-hexenedioate to 2-oxo-4-hydroxypentanoate in the catechol meta fission pathway. to facilitate mechanistic and structural studies of the complex, the two enzymes have been coexpressed and the complex has been purified to homogeneity. in addition, glu-106, a potential catalytic residue in vph, has been changed to glutamine, and the resulting e106qvph mutant has been coexpressed with 4-od and purified to homogeneity. the 4-od/e106qvph complex retains full decarboxylase activity, with  comparable kinetic parameters to those observed for 4-od in the wild-type complex, but is devoid of any detectable hydratase activity. decarboxylation of (5s)-2-oxo-3-[5-d]hexenedioate by either the 4-od/vph complex or the mutant complex generates 2-hydroxy-2,4e-[5-d]pentadienoate in d(2)o. ketonization of 2-hydroxy-2,4-pentadienoate by the wild-type complex is highly stereoselective and results in the formation of 2-oxo-(3s)-[3-d]-4-pentenoate, while the mutant complex generates a racemic mixture. these results indicate that 2-hydroxy-2, 4-pentadienoate is the product of 4-od and that 2-oxo-4-pentenoate results from a vph-catalyzed process. on this basis, the previously proposed hypothesis for the  conversion of 2-oxo-3-hexenedioate to 2-oxo-4-hydroxypentanoate has been revised  [lian, h., and whitman, c. p. (1994) j. am. chem. soc. 116, 10403-10411]. finally, the observed (13)c kinetic isotope effect on the decarboxylation of 2-oxo-3-hexenedioate by the 4-od/vph complex suggests that the decarboxylation step is nearly rate-limiting. because the value is not sensitive to either magnesium or manganese, it is likely that the transition state for carbon-carbon  bond cleavage is late and that the metal positions the substrate and polarizes the carbonyl group, analogous to its role in oxalacetate decarboxylase.

AB  == the alkylbenzoate degradation genes of pseudomonas putida tol plasmid are positively regulated by xyls, an arac family protein, in a benzoate-dependent manner. in this study, we used deletion mutants and hybrid proteins to identify which parts of xyls are responsible for the dna binding, transcriptional activation, and benzoate inducibility. we found that a 112-residue c-terminal fragment of xyls binds specifically to the pm operator in vitro, protects this sequence from dnase i digestion identically to the wild-type (wt) protein, and activates the pm promoter in vivo. when overexpressed, that c-terminal fragment could activate transcription as efficiently as wt xyls. all the truncations, which incorporated these 112 c-terminal residues, were able to activate transcription at least to some extent when overproduced. intactness of the 210-residue n-terminal portion was found to be necessary for benzoate responsiveness of xyls. deletions in the n-terminal and central regions seriously reduced the activity of xyls and caused the loss of effector control, whereas insertions into the putative interdomain region did not change the basic features of the xyls protein. our results confirm that xyls consists of two parts which probably interact with each other. the c-terminal domain carries dna-binding and  transcriptional activation abilities, while the n-terminal region carries effector-binding and regulatory functions.

AB  == pseudomonas putida kt2442 is a root-colonizing strain which can use proline, one  of the major components in root exudates, as its sole carbon and nitrogen source. a p. putida mutant unable to grow with proline as the sole carbon and nitrogen source was isolated after random mini-tn5-km mutagenesis. the mini-tn5 insertion  was located at the puta gene, which is adjacent to and divergent from the putp gene. the puta gene codes for a protein of 1,315 amino acid residues which is homologous to the puta protein of escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, rhodobacter capsulatus, and several rhizobium strains. the central part of p. putida puta showed homology to the proline dehydrogenase of saccharomyces cerevisiae and drosophila melanogaster, whereas the c-terminal end  was homologous to the pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase of s. cerevisiae and  a number of aldehyde dehydrogenases. this suggests that in p. putida, both enzymatic steps for proline conversion to glutamic acid are catalyzed by a single polypeptide. the putp gene was homologous to the putp genes of several prokaryotic microorganisms, and its gene product is an integral inner-membrane protein involved in the uptake of proline. the expression of both genes was induced by proline added in the culture medium and was regulated by puta. in a p. putida puta-deficient background, expression of both puta and putp genes was maximal and proline independent. corn root exudates collected during 7 days also  strongly induced the p. putida put genes, as determined by using fusions of the put promoters to 'lacz. the induction ratio for the puta promoter (about 20-fold) was 6-fold higher than the induction ratio for the putp promoter.

AB  == an aerotaxis gene, aer, was cloned from pseudomonas putida prs2000. a p. putida aer mutant displayed an altered aerotactic response in a capillary assay. wild-type p. putida clustered at the air/liquid interface. in contrast, the aer mutant did not cluster at the interface, but instead formed a diffuse band at a distance from the meniscus. wild-type aer, provided in trans, complemented the aer mutant to an aerotactic response that was stronger than wild-type. the p. putida aer sequence is similar over its entire length to the aerotaxis (energy taxis) signal transducer protein, aer, of escherichia coli. the amino-terminus is similar to redox-sensing regulatory proteins, and the carboxy-terminus contains the highly conserved domain present in chemotactic transducers.

TI  == properties of p-cresol methylhydroxylase flavoprotein overproduced by escherichia coli.
AB  == the alpha(2)beta(2) flavocytochrome p-cresol methylhydroxylase (pcmh) from pseudomonas putida is composed of a flavoprotein homodimer (alpha(2) or pchf(2);  m(r) = 119 kda) with a cytochrome monomer (beta, pchc; m(r) = 9.3 kda) bound to each pchf subunit. escherichia coli bl21(de3) has been transformed with a vector  for expression of the pchf gene, and pchf is overproduced by this strain as the homodimer. during purification, it was recognized that some pchf had fad bound, while the remainder was fad-free. however, unlike pchf obtained from pcmh purified from p. putida, fad was bound noncovalently. the fad was conveniently removed from purified e. coli-expressed pchf by hydroxyapatite chromatography. fluorescence quenching titration indicated that the affinity of apo-pchf for fad  was sufficiently high to prevent the determination of the dissociation constant.  it was found that p-cresol was virtually incapable of reducing pchf with noncovalently bound fad (pchf(nc)), whereas 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, the intermediate product of p-cresol oxidation by pcmh, reduced pchf(nc) fairly quickly. in contrast, p-cresol rapidly reduced pchf with covalently bound fad (pchf(c)), but, unlike intact pcmh, which consumed 4 electron equiv/mol when titrated with p-cresol (2 electrons from p-cresol and 2 from 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol), pchf(c) accepted only 2 electron equiv/mol. this is explained by extremely slow release of 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol from reduced pchf(c). 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol rapidly reduced pchf(c), producing 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. it was demonstrated that p-cresol has a charge-transfer interaction with fad when bound to oxidized pchf(nc), whereas 4-bromophenol (a substrate analogue) and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde have charge-transfer interactions with fad when bound to either pchf(c) or pchf(nc). this is the first example of a "wild-type" flavoprotein, which normally has covalently bound flavin, to bind flavin noncovalently in a stable, redox-active manner.

TI  == expression of marker rnas in pseudomonas putida.
AB  == a broad-host-range vector that expresses a unique artificial rna in pseudomonas putida has been developed. this vector was derived from the plasmid pbbr1mcs and  incorporates regulatory regions from the escherichia coli ribosomal operon, rrnb. these include the promoters p1 and p2, and the terminators t1 and t2. the gene for the artificial rna was derived from vibrio proteolyticus 5s rrna. the artificial rna product accumulates to a level that is 10-20% of the total 5s rrna in p. putida. the rna product is not incorporated into ribosomes and has a minimal effect on cell growth rate. in contrast, when wild-type v. proteolyticus  5s rrna was expressed from the vector, it was incorporated into ribosomes. it is  expected that this new vector system will allow artificial rna expression systems to be readily developed for a large variety of species.

TI  == identification and molecular characterization of the eugenol hydroxylase genes (ehya/ehyb) of pseudomonas sp. strain hr199.
AB  == the gene loci ehya and ehyb, which are involved in the bioconversion of eugenol to coniferyl alcohol by pseudomonas sp. strain hr199 (dsm 7063), were identified  as the structural genes of a eugenol hydroxylase that represents an enzyme of the flavocytochrome c class. these genes were localized downstream of the eugenol catabolism genes vana and vanb, encoding vanillate-o-demethylase, on an ecori fragment (e230) that has recently been cloned from a pseudomonas sp. strain hr199 genomic library. the gene encoding the cytochrome c subunit (ehya) was identified on a subfragment (k18) of e230 by complementation of a nitrosoguanidine-induced,  eugenol-negative mutant of strain hr199. the nucleotide sequences of fragment k18 and adjacent regions were determined, revealing open reading frames of 354 and 1,554 bp that represent ehya and ehyb, respectively. these genes are most probably organized in one operon together with a third open reading frame (orf2)  of 687 bp that was located between ehya and ehyb. the deduced amino acid sequences of ehya and ehyb exhibited up to 29 and 55% amino acid identity to the  corresponding subunits of p-cresol methylhydroxylase from pseudomonas putida. moreover, the amino-terminal sequences of the alpha- and beta-subunits reported recently for a eugenol dehydrogenase of pseudomonas fluorescens e118 corresponded well with appropriate regions of ehya and ehyb. the sequence of orf2 and the deduced amino acid sequence exhibited no significant similarities to any dna or amino acid sequence from the databases. the eugenol hydroxylase genes were amplified by pcr, cloned in pbluescript sk(-), and functionally expressed in escherichia coli. transfer of a dna fragment comprising ehya and ehyb to various  strains of pseudomonas species that were unable to utilize eugenol as a carbon source conferred to these bacteria the ability to grow on this substrate.

AB  == genes from pseudomonas putida (pp), soda, encoding manganese-superoxide dismutase (mnsod) and, sodb, iron-superoxide dismutase (fesod) were cloned by hybridization with digoxigenin (dig)-labeled pcr products generated from pp genomic dna. the sodb gene had a 594 bp open reading frame (orf), corresponding to 198 amino acids (aa), and a transcript of 880 bases. the soda gene contained a 609 bp orf encoding 203 aa and was transcribed as part of a polycistronic operon, consisting of orfy-fumc-orfx-soda. pp soda or sodb genes both restored aerobic growth, growth on paraquat, and growth on minimal medium to an escherichia coli (ec) mutant deficient in sod activity. paraquat treatment did not enhance mrna transcription of the sod genes or increase sod activity in pp. the pp sodb gene was highly expressed throughout logarithmic-(log) growth phase and stationary-phase cells grown in medium supplemented with fecl3, but was down-regulated in iron-deficient conditions, such as in stationary-phase or generated by 2,2'-dipyridyl (dp) treatment. this is the first evidence that iron  regulates expression of the sodb gene at the transcriptional level. in contrast,  iron-deficient conditions, or addition of mncl2 to the growth medium, induced transcripts (2.4 kb and 1.2 kb) from the soda operon. our results reveal an intricate role of iron in the transcriptional regulation of both pp soda and sodb genes.

TI  == a novel lipolytic enzyme located in the outer membrane of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == a lipase-negative deletion mutant of pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 still showed extracellular lipolytic activity toward short-chain p-nitrophenylesters. by screening a genomic dna library of p. aeruginosa pao1, an esterase gene, esta, was identified, cloned, and sequenced, revealing an open reading frame of 1,941 bp. the product of esta is a 69.5-kda protein, which is probably processed by removal of an n-terminal signal peptide to yield a 67-kda mature protein. a molecular mass of 66 kda was determined for (35)s-labeled esta by sodium dodecyl  sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. the amino acid sequence of esta indicated that the esterase is a member of a novel gdsl family of lipolytic enzymes. the esta gene showed high similarity to an open reading frame of unknown function located in the trpe-trpg region of p. putida and to a gene encoding an outer membrane esterase of salmonella typhimurium. amino acid sequence alignments led us to predict that this esterase is an autotransporter protein which possesses a carboxy-terminal beta-barrel domain, allowing the secretion of the amino-terminal passenger domain harboring the catalytic activity. expression of esta in p. aeruginosa and escherichia coli and subsequent cell fractionation revealed that the enzyme was associated with the cellular membranes. trypsin treatment of whole cells released a significant amount of esterase, indicating that the enzyme was located in the outer membrane with the catalytic domain exposed to the surface. to our knowledge, this esterase is unique in that it exemplifies in p. aeruginosa (i) the first enzyme identified in the outer membrane and (ii) the first example of a type iv secretion mechanism.

TI  == an electrochemical study of the factors responsible for modulating the reduction  potential of putidaredoxin.
AB  == the gene coding for putidaredoxin has been synthesized using a combination of chemical and enzymatic methods and subsequently expressed in escherichia coli. the recombinant protein characterized by electronic spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and electrochemistry was found to be identical to putidaredoxin obtained from pseudomonas putida. polylysine was found to promote the fast and reversible electrochemistry of putidaredoxin at negatively charged electrodes such as indium-doped tin oxide or gold surfaces modified with mercaptoalkanoate groups. the value of the heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant obtained from solutions containing a mixture of putidaredoxin and polylysine (k(s) = 1.3 x 10(-3) cm/s) is one order of magnitude larger than the values reported previously at gold electrodes modified with mercaptoethylamine or at antimony-doped tin oxide semiconductor electrodes. it was observed that when the reduction potential of putidaredoxin is measured by cyclic voltammetry, the resultant value is consistently more positive (64 mv) than the reduction potential measured with potentiometric titrations. a comparison between the electrochemical responses of  putidaredoxin and spinach ferredoxin, combined with the examination of their corresponding three-dimensional structures, indicates that the positive shift in  the reduction potential of putidaredoxin originates from the formation of a transient complex between putidaredoxin and polylysine at the electrode surface.  the formation of this transient complex modulates the reduction potential of putidaredoxin by lowering the value of the dielectric constant around its iron-sulfur cluster microenvironment, specifically by neutralizing negative charges surrounding the active site and by excluding water from the solvent exposed iron sulfur cluster. the observed positive shift in e degrees ', which is induced by complexation with polylysine at the electrode-surface, suggests that similar factors are likely to contribute to the anodic shift in the e degrees ' of cytochrome p450(cam)-bound putidaredoxin (+44 mv) with respect to the e degrees ' measured for free putidaredoxin.

TI  == importance of illegitimate recombination and transposition in is30-associated excision events.
AB  == in the present study we report on the excision of is30 elements and is30-derived  composite transposons. frequent loss of is30 was observed during dissolution of dimeric is30 structures, containing ir-ir junctions, leading to resealed donor molecules. in contrast, unambiguous transpositional excision resulting in resealed remainder products could not be identified in the case of a monomeric element. the bias in the excision of monomeric and dimeric is30 structures indicates a difference in the molecular mechanism of transposition of is30 monomers and dimers. sequence data on the rarely detected plasmids missing full is or tn copies rather suggest that all products were derived from illegitimate recombination. the reaction occurred between short homologies and was independent of the transposase activity. similar is30 excision events accompanied by multiple plasmid or genome rearrangements were detected in pseudomonas putida and rhizobium meliloti, yielding stable replicons that retained the selective marker  gene of the transposon. we provide evidence that both transposition and illegitimate recombination can contribute to the stabilization of replicons through the elimination of is elements, which emphasizes the evolutionary significance of these events.

TI  == mutations of glutamate-84 at the putative potassium-binding site affect camphor binding and oxidation by cytochrome p450cam.
AB  == cytochrome p450cam (cyp101) from pseudomonas putida is unusual among p450 enzymes in that it exhibits co-operative binding between the substrate camphor and a potassium ion. this behaviour has been investigated by mutagenesis of glu84, a surface residue which forms part of the cation-binding site. substitutions that neutralize or reverse the charge of this side chain are shown to disrupt the co-operativity of potassium and camphor binding by p450cam, and also to influence the catalytic activity. in particular, replacement of glu84 by positively charged residues such as lysine results in increased high-spin haem fractions and camphor turnover activities in the absence of potassium, along with decreased camphor dissociation constants. however, in the presence of potassium the camphor dissociation constants of these mutants are significantly increased compared with the wild-type, although the camphor turnover activities remain marginally higher. in contrast, substitution by aspartate results in tighter binding of both potassium and camphor, but has little effect on the enzymatic activity. in all cases the reaction remains essentially 100% coupled and gives 5-exo-hydroxycamphor as the only product. these results suggest that an anionic side chain at the 84 position is crucial for the co-operativity of camphor and cation binding, and that the physiological role for potassium binding by cytochrome p450cam is to promote camphor binding even at the expense of turnover  rate, thus allowing the organism to utilize low environmental concentrations of this substrate for growth.

TI  == a high-throughput digital imaging screen for the discovery and directed evolution of oxygenases.
AB  == background: oxygenases catalyze the hydroxylation of a wide variety of organic substrates. an ability to alter oxygenase substrate specificities and improve their activities and stabilities using recombinant dna techniques would expand their use in processes such as chemical synthesis and bioremediation. discovery and directed evolution of oxygenases require efficient screens that are sensitive to the activities of interest and can be applied to large numbers of crude enzyme samples. results: horseradish peroxidase (hrp) couples the phenolic products of hydroxylation of aromatic substrates to generate colored and/or fluorescent compounds that are easily detected spectroscopically in high-throughput screening. coexpression of the coupling enzyme with a functional mono- or dioxygenase creates a pathway for the conversion of aromatic substrates into fluorescent compounds in vivo. we used this approach for detecting the products of the toluene-dioxygenase-catalyzed hydroxylation of chlorobenzene and to screen large mutant libraries of pseudomonas putida cytochrome p450cam by fluorescence digital imaging. colors generated by the hrp coupling reaction are sensitive to the site of oxygenase-catalyzed hydroxylation, allowing the screen to be used to  identify catalysts with new or altered regiospecificities. conclusions: the coupled oxygenase-peroxidase reaction system is well suited for screening oxygenase libraries to identify mutants with desired features, including higher activity or stability and altered reaction specificity. this approach should also be useful for screening expressed dna libraries and combinatorial chemical libraries for hydroxylation catalysts and for optimizing oxygenase reaction conditions.

TI  == novel biodegradable aromatic plastics from a bacterial source. genetic and biochemical studies on a route of the phenylacetyl-coa catabolon.
AB  == novel biodegradable bacterial plastics, made up of units of 3-hydroxy-n-phenylalkanoic acids, are accumulated intracellularly by pseudomonas  putida u due to the existence in this bacterium of (i) an acyl-coa synthetase (encoded by the fadd gene) that activates the aryl-precursors; (ii) a beta-oxidation pathway that affords 3-oh-aryl-coas, and (iii) a polymerization-depolymerization system (encoded in the pha locus) integrated by two polymerases (phac1 and phac2) and a depolymerase (phaz). the complete assimilation of these compounds requires two additional routes that specifically  catabolize the phenylacetyl-coa or the benzoyl-coa generated from these polyesters through beta-oxidation. genetic studies have allowed the cloning, sequencing, and disruption of the genes included in the pha locus (phac1, phac2,  and phaz) as well as those related to the biosynthesis of precursors (fadd) or to the catabolism of their derivatives (acua, fada, and paa genes). additional experiments showed that the blockade of either fadd or phac1 hindered the synthesis and accumulation of plastic polymers. disruption of phac2 reduced the quantity of stored polymers by two-thirds. the blockade of phaz hampered the mobilization of the polymer and decreased its production. mutations in the paa genes, encoding the phenylacetic acid catabolic enzymes, did not affect the synthesis or catabolism of polymers containing either 3-hydroxyaliphatic acids or 3-hydroxy-n-phenylalkanoic acids with an odd number of carbon atoms as monomers,  whereas the production of polyesters containing units of 3-hydroxy-n-phenylalkanoic acids with an even number of carbon atoms was greatly  reduced in these bacteria. yield-improving studies revealed that mutants defective in the glyoxylic acid cycle (isocitrate lyase(-)) or in the beta-oxidation pathway (fada), stored a higher amount of plastic polymers (1.4- and 2-fold, respectively), suggesting that genetic manipulation of these pathways could be useful for isolating overproducer strains. the analysis of the organization and function of the pha locus and its relationship with the core of  the phenylacetyl-coa catabolon is reported and discussed.

AB  == (s)-mandelate dehydrogenase (mdh) from pseudomonas putida, a member of the flavin mononucleotide-dependent alpha-hydroxy acid oxidase/dehydrogenase family, is a membrane-associated protein, in contrast to the more well-characterized members of this protein family including glycolate oxidase (gox) from spinach. in a previous study [mitra, b., et al. (1993) biochemistry 32, 12959-12967], the membrane association of mdh was correlated to a 53 amino acid segment in the interior of the primary sequence by construction of a chimeric enzyme, mdh-gox1,  in which the membrane-binding segment in mdh was deleted and replaced with the corresponding 34 amino acid segment from the soluble gox. though mdh-gox1 was soluble, it was an inefficient, nonspecific enzyme that involved a different transition state for the catalyzed reaction from that of the wild-type mdh. in the present study, it is shown that the membrane-binding segment in mdh is somewhat shorter, approximately 39 residues long. partial or total deletion of this segment disrupts membrane localization of mdh. this segment is not important for substrate oxidation activity. a new chimera, mdh-gox2, was created by replacing this shorter membrane-binding segment from mdh with the corresponding 20 amino acid segment from gox. the soluble mdh-gox2 is very similar to the wild-type membrane-bound enzyme in its spectroscopic properties, substrate specificity, catalytic activity, kinetic mechanism, and lack of reactivity toward oxygen. therefore, it should prove to be a highly useful model for structural studies of mdh.

TI  == distribution of bacterial growth activity in flow-chamber biofilms.
AB  == in microbial communities such as those found in biofilms, individual organisms most often display heterogeneous behavior with respect to their metabolic activity, growth status, gene expression pattern, etc. in that context, a novel reporter system for monitoring of cellular growth activity has been designed. it  comprises a transposon cassette carrying fusions between the growth rate-regulated escherichia coli rrnbp1 promoter and different variant gfp genes.  it is shown that the p1 promoter is regulated in the same way in e. coli and pseudomonas putida, making it useful for monitoring of growth activity in organisms outside the group of enteric bacteria. construction of fusions to genes encoding unstable gfp proteins opened up the possibility of the monitoring of rates of rrna synthesis and, in this way, allowing on-line determination of the distribution of growth activity in a complex community. with the use of these reporter tools, it is demonstrated that individual cells of a toluene-degrading p. putida strain growing in a benzyl alcohol-supplemented biofilm have different  levels of growth activity which develop as the biofilm gets older. cells that eventually grow very slowly or not at all may be stimulated to restart growth if  provided with a more easily metabolizable carbon source. thus, the dynamics of biofilm growth activity has been tracked to the level of individual cells, cell clusters, and microcolonies.

TI  == conserved cytoplasmic loops are important for both the transport and chemotaxis functions of pcak, a protein from pseudomonas putida with 12 membrane-spanning regions.
AB  == chemotaxis to the aromatic acid 4-hydroxybenzoate (4-hba) by pseudomonas putida is mediated by pcak, a membrane-bound protein that also functions as a 4-hba transporter. pcak belongs to the major facilitator superfamily (mfs) of transport proteins, none of which have so far been implicated in chemotaxis. work with two  well-studied mfs transporters, lacy (the lactose permease) and teta (a tetracycline efflux protein), has revealed two stretches of amino acids located between the second and third (2-3 loop) and the eighth and ninth (8-9 loop) transmembrane regions that are required for substrate transport. these sequences  are conserved among most mfs transporters, including pcak. to determine if pcak has functional requirements similar to those of other mfs transport proteins and  to analyze the relationship between the transport and chemotaxis functions of pcak, we generated strains with mutations in amino acid residues located in the 2-3 and 8-9 loops of pcak. the mutant proteins were analyzed in 4-hba transport and chemotaxis assays. cells expressing mutant pcak proteins had a range of phenotypes. some transported at wild-type levels, while others were partially or  completely defective in 4-hba transport. an aspartate residue in the 8-9 loop that has no counterpart in lacy and teta, but is conserved among members of the aromatic acid/h(+) symporter family of the mfs, was found to be critical for 4-hba transport. these results indicate that conserved amino acids in the 2-3 and 8-9 loops of pcak are required for 4-hba transport. amino acid changes that decreased 4-hba transport also caused a decrease in 4-hba chemotaxis, but the effect on chemotaxis was sometimes slightly more severe. the requirement of pcak  for both 4-hba transport and chemotaxis demonstrates that p. putida has a chemoreceptor that differs from the classical chemoreceptors described for escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium.

AB  == the polyhydroxyalkanoic acid synthase gene from chromobacterium violaceum (phac(cv)) was cloned and characterized. a 6.3-kb bamhi fragment was found to contain both phac(cv) and the polyhydroxyalkanoic acid (pha)-specific 3-ketothiolase (phaa(cv)). escherichia coli strains harboring this fragment produced significant levels of pha synthase and 3-ketothiolase, as judged by their activities. while c. violaceum accumulated poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) or poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) when grown on a fatty acid carbon source, klebsiella aerogenes and ralstonia eutropha (formerly alcaligenes eutrophus), harboring phac(cv), accumulated the above-mentioned polymers and, additionally, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) when even-chain-length fatty acids were utilized as the carbon source. this finding suggests that the metabolic environments of these organisms are sufficiently different to alter the product range of the c. violaceum pha synthase. neither recombinant e. coli nor recombinant pseudomonas putida harboring phac(cv) accumulated significant levels of pha. sequence analysis of the phac(cv) product  shows homology with several pha synthases, most notably a 48% identity with that  of alcaligenes latus (genbank accession no. aad10274).

TI  == not only the nature of peptide but also the characteristics of cell membrane determine the antimicrobial mechanism of a peptide.
AB  == the mechanisms of antimicrobial actions of magainin 2, buforin ii and poly l-lysine against various escherichia coli strains were studied. poly l-lysine inhibited bl21, ad 434 and groe+/dnak+ growth without lysing the cell. magainin 2 had a pore-forming activity on bl 21 and ad 434 membrane but could not inhibit the groe+/dnak+ growth in a nutrient-rich medium. buforin ii, which killed bl21 and ad 434 without cell membrane damage, lysed groe+/dnak+ to death. once they were introduced into the cell by electroporation, all three peptides were able to inhibit cell growth at concentrations of 10 times lower than their mics. these results indicate that the nature of the peptide and also the characteristics of the cell membrane determine the antimicrobial actions of a peptide.

AB  == we isolated a toluene-sensitive mutant, named mutant no. 32, which showed unchanged antibiotic resistance levels, from toluene-tolerant pseudomonas putida  ih-2000 by transposon mutagenesis with tn5. the gene disrupted by insertion of tn5 was identified as cyoc, which is one of the subunits of cytochrome o. the membrane protein, phospholipid, and lipopolysaccharide (lps) of ih-2000 and that  of mutant no. 32 were examined and compared. some of the outer membrane proteins  showed a decrease in mutant no. 32. the fatty acid components of lps were found to be dodecanoic acid, 2-hydroxydodecanoic acid, 3-hydroxydodecanoic acid, and 3-hydroxydecanoic acid in both ih-2000 and no. 32; however, the relative proportions of these components differed in the two strains. furthermore, cell surface hydrophobicity was increased in no. 32. these data suggest that mutation  of cyoc caused the decrease in outer membrane proteins and the changing fatty acid composition of lps. these changes in the outer membrane would cause an increase in cell surface hydrophobicity, and mutant no. 32 is considered to be sensitive to toluene.

TI  == copurification of the fpva ferric pyoverdin receptor of pseudomonas aeruginosa with its iron-free ligand: implications for siderophore-mediated iron transport.
AB  == the pseudomonas aeruginosa fpva receptor is a tonb-dependent outer membrane transport protein that catalyzes uptake of ferric pyoverdin across the outer membrane. surprisingly, fpva expressed in p. aeruginosa grown in an iron-deficient medium copurifies with a ligand x that we have characterized by uv, fluorescence, and mass spectrometry as being iron-free pyoverdin (apo-paa). paa was absent from fpva purified from a paa-deficient p. aeruginosa strain. the  properties of ligand binding in vitro revealed very similar affinities of apo-paa and ferric-paa to fpva. fluorescence resonance energy transfer was used to study  in vitro the formation of the fpva-paa-fe complex in the presence of paa-fe or citrate-fe. the circular dichroism spectrum of fpva indicated a 57% beta-structure content typical of porins and in agreement with the 3d structures  of the siderophore receptors fhua and fepa. in the absence of the protease's inhibitors, a truncated form of fpva lacking 87 amino acids at its n-terminus was purified. this truncated form still bound paa, and its beta-sheet content was conserved. this n-terminal region displays significant homology to the n-terminal periplasmic extensions of feca from escherichia coli and pupb from pseudomonas putida, which were previously shown to be involved in signal transduction. this suggests a similar function for fpva. the mechanism of iron transport in p. aeruginosa via the pyoverdin pathway is discussed in the light of all these new findings.

TI  == quantification of bacterial lead resistance via activity assays.
AB  == the level of microbial resistance to heavy metals is an important issue for the microbial ecology of heavy metal-contaminated habitats. however, assays based upon growth in nutrient media will overestimate the resistance level due to metal ion interactions with inorganic and organic components. the analysis of pb-resistant bacteria isolated from soils containing up to 38 mmol total pb x kg(-1) indicated that pyt80b medium which did not contain inorganic salts, contained low amounts of organic matter, and was buffered with a molecule that did not interact with metal ions (2-n-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (mes)) provided the lowest estimates of lead resistance. however, better results were obtained by assaying metabolic activity (aerobic respiration) of resting cells suspended in 10 mm mes. by this criterion, 50% inhibition of arthrobacter js7 was found at 37 microm pb(no3)2. the effects of pb+2 concentrations upon respiration  of resting cells and growth rate in pyt80b medium were similar. the activity assay also showed that metal resistance was induced to higher levels when arthrobacter js7 was grown in the presence of pb.

TI  == development of a bioconversion process for production of cis-1s,2r-indandiol from indene by recombinant escherichia coli constructs.
AB  == recombinant escherichia coli cells expressing the toluene dioxygenase (tdo) genes from pseudomonas putida convert indene to cis-1s,2r-indandiol, a potentially important intermediate for the chemical synthesis of the hiv-1 protease inhibitor, crixivan. a bioconversion process was developed through optimization of medium composition and reaction conditions at the shake-flask and 23-1 fermentor scales. a cis-1,2-indandiol productivity of approx. 1000 mg/l was achieved with construct tdo123, which represents a 50-fold increase over the initial titer. varying the bioconversion conditions did not change the enantiomeric excess (e.e.) for the 1s,2r enantiomer from about 30%, suggesting that toluene dioxygenase intrinsically converts indene to 1s,2r- and 1r,2s-indandiols at a ratio of 2:1. further inclusion of the pseudomonas dehydrogenase gene in construct d160-1 led to the production of chirally pure cis-1s,2r-indandiol (e.e. > 99%) as a result of the selective degradation of the  1r,2s enantiomer, with the overall yield (650 mg/l) proportionally reduced. a single stage process was developed for d160-1 and scaled up to the 23-1 fermentor, achieving a cis-1s,2r-indandiol titer of 1200 mg/l.

TI  == laboratory evolution of peroxide-mediated cytochrome p450 hydroxylation.
AB  == enzyme-based chemical transformations typically proceed with high selectivity under mild conditions, and are becoming increasingly important in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. cytochrome p450 monooxygenases (p450s) constitute a large family of enzymes of particular interest in this regard. their biological functions, such as detoxification of xenobiotics and steroidogenesis,  are based on the ability to catalyse the insertion of oxygen into a wide variety  of compounds. such a catalytic transformation might find technological applications in areas ranging from gene therapy and environmental remediation to  the selective synthesis of pharmaceuticals and chemicals. but relatively low turnover rates (particularly towards non-natural substrates), low stability and the need for electron-donating cofactors prohibit the practical use of p450s as isolated enzymes. here we report the directed evolution of the p450 from pseudomonas putida to create mutants that hydroxylate naphthalene in the absence  of cofactors through the 'peroxide shunt' pathway with more than 20-fold higher activity than the native enzyme. we are able to screen efficiently for improved mutants by coexpressing them with horseradish peroxidase, which converts the products of the p450 reaction into fluorescent compounds amenable to digital imaging screening. this system should allow us to select and develop mono- and di-oxygenases into practically useful biocatalysts for the hydroxylation of a wide range of aromatic compounds.

TI  == an alkane-responsive expression system for the production of fine chemicals
AB  == membrane-located monooxygenase systems, such as the pseudomonas putida mt-2-derived xylene oxygenase, are attractive for challenging transformations of  apolar compounds, including enantiospecific epoxidations, but are difficult to synthesize at levels that are useful for application to biotechnological processes. in order to construct efficient biocatalysis strains, we utilized the  alkane-responsive regulatory system of the oct plasmid-located alk genes of pseudomonas oleovorans gpo1, a very attractive system for recombinant biotransformation processes. determination of the nucleotide sequence of alks, whose activated gene product positively regulates the transcription of the structural genes alkbfghjkl, on a 3.7-kb sali-hpai oct plasmid fragment was completed, and the n-terminal amino acid sequence of an alks-lacz fusion protein  was found to be consistent with the predicted dna sequence. the alks gene and the alkbp promoter were assembled into a convenient alkane-responsive genetic expression cassette which allowed expression of the xylene oxygenase genes in a recombinant escherichia coli strain at a specific activity of 91 u per g (dry weight) of cells when styrene was the substrate. this biocatalyst was used to produce (s)-styrene oxide in two-liquid-phase cultures. volumetric productivities of more than 2 g of styrene oxide per h per liter of aqueous phase were obtained; these values represented a fivefold improvement compared with previous results.

TI  == the physiological contribution of acinetobacter pcak, a transport system that acts upon protocatechuate, can be masked by the overlapping specificity of vank.
AB  == vank is the fourth member of the ubiquitous major facilitator superfamily of transport proteins to be identified that, together with pcak, benk, and muck, contributes to aromatic catabolism in acinetobacter sp. strain adp1. vank and pcak have overlapping specificity for p-hydroxybenzoate and, most clearly, for protocatechuate: inactivation of both proteins severely impairs growth with protocatechuate, and the activity of either protein alone can mask the phenotype  associated with inactivation of its homolog. furthermore, vank pcak double-knockout mutants appear completely unable to grow in liquid culture with the hydroaromatic compound quinate, although such cells on plates convert quinate to protocatechuate, which then accumulates extracellularly and is readily visible as purple staining. this provides genetic evidence that quinate is converted to protocatechuate in the periplasm and is in line with the early argument that quinate catabolism should be physically separated from aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in the cytoplasm so as to avoid potential competition for intermediates common to both pathways. previous studies of aromatic catabolism in acinetobacter have taken advantage of the ability to select directly strains that contain a spontaneous mutation blocking the beta-ketoadipate pathway and preventing the toxic accumulation of carboxymuconate. by using this procedure, strains with a mutation in structural or regulatory genes blocking degradation of vanillate, p-hydroxybenzoate, or protocatechuate were selected. in this study, the overlapping specificity of the vank and pcak permeases was exploited to directly select strains with a mutation in either vank or pcak. spontaneous mutations identified in vank include a hot spot for frameshift mutation due to contraction of a g6 mononucleotide repeat as well as point mutations producing amino acid substitutions useful for analysis of vank structure and function. preliminary second-site suppression analysis using transformation-facilitated pcr mutagenesis in one vank mutant gave results similar to those using lacy, the prototypic member of the major facilitator superfamily, consistent with the two proteins having a similar mechanism of action. the selection for transport mutants described here for acinetobacter may also be applicable to pseudomonas putida, where the pcak permease has an additional role in chemotaxis.

AB  == benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase from acinetobacter calcoaceticus (ac-badh) and tol plasmid-encoded benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase from pseudomonas putida (tol-badh) have previously been shown to oxidize a variety of aromatic alcohols but not aliphatic substrates. here, we have expressed the genes for ac-badh and tol-badh  in escherichia coli, purified the resulting over-expressed enzymes, and shown that each is an effective catalyst of both benzylic and allylic alcohol oxidation, but not of oxidation of nonallylic analogs. enzyme specificity (kcat/km) for both enzymes was higher with an aliphatic, allylic alcohol (3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol) than with benzyl alcohol. these results suggest that bacterial benzyl alcohol dehydrogenases use the resonance stabilization provided  by allylic and benzylic alcohols to promote catalysis.

TI  == photometric assay for polynucleotide phosphorylase.
AB  == polynucleotide phosphorylase (pnpase) is a prokaryotic enzyme that catalyzes phosphorolysis of polynucleotides with release of ndps. it is also believed to play a key role in turnover of prokaryotic transcripts, thus regulating gene expression. at the moment, only radioisotopic methods are available for assaying  pnpase in crude extracts; these involve incubating [32p]phosphate and poly(a) in  the presence of the enzyme, separating [32p]phosphate from [32p]adp, and quantifying adp by scintillation counting. photometric assay using pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase as auxiliary enzymes is not feasible in crude extracts because of endogenous atpase activities, which regenerate adp from the atp released by pyruvate kinase. here, we present a simple photometric assay that uses a cyclic detection system which, due to the sequential action of pyruvate kinase and hexokinase, results in an exponential increase of adp and glucose 6-phosphate. glucose 6-phosphate is then revealed by a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction. based on the theoretical model, a linear increase in absorbance is predicted as a function of the square of the reaction time, with a  slope proportional to pnpase activity. experimental data confirmed the theoretical predictions and showed that the assay was quantitative and unquestionably specific. we also devised a simple procedure for determining absolute enzyme activities (expressed in micromoles of product formed per minute) using exact amounts of pure pnpase as internal standards.

TI  == role of the alternative sigma factor sigmas in expression of the alks regulator of the pseudomonas oleovorans alkane degradation pathway.
AB  == the alks protein activates transcription from the palkb promoter, allowing the expression of a number of genes required for the assimilation of alkanes in pseudomonas oleovorans. we have identified the promoter from which the alks gene  is transcribed, palks, and analyzed its expression under different conditions and genetic backgrounds. transcription from palks was very low during the exponential phase of growth and increased considerably when cells reached the stationary phase. the palks -10 region was similar to the consensus described for promoters  recognized by escherichia coli rna polymerase bound to the alternative sigma factor sigmas, which directs the expression of many stationary-phase genes. reporter strains containing palks-lacz transcriptional fusions showed that palks  promoter is very weakly expressed in a pseudomonas putida strain bearing an inactivated allele of the gene coding for sigmas, rpos. when palks was transferred to e. coli, transcription started at the same site and expression was higher in stationary phase only if sigmas-rna polymerase was present. the low levels of alks protein generated in the absence of sigmas were enough to support  a partial induction of the palkb promoter. the -10 and -35 regions of palks promoter also show some similarity to the consensus recognized by sigmad-rna polymerase, the primary form of rna polymerase. we propose that in exponential phase palks is probably recognized both by sigmad-rna polymerase (inefficiently)  and by sigmas-rna polymerase (present at low levels), leading to low-level expression of the alks gene. sigmas-rna polymerase would be responsible for the high level of activity of palks observed in stationary phase.

TI  == the palkbfghjkl promoter is under carbon catabolite repression control in pseudomonas oleovorans but not in escherichia coli alk+ recombinants.
AB  == the alk genes are located on the oct plasmid of pseudomonas oleovorans and encode an inducible pathway for the utilization of n-alkanes as carbon and energy sources. we have investigated the influence of alternative carbon sources on the  induction of this pathway in p. oleovorans and escherichia coli alk+ recombinants. in doing so, we confirmed earlier reports that induction of alkane  hydroxylase activity in pseudomonads is subject to carbon catabolite repression.  specifically, synthesis of the monooxygenase component alkb is repressed at the transcriptional level. the alk genes have been cloned into plasmid pgec47, which  has a copy number of about 5 to 10 per cell in both e. coli and pseudomonads. pseudomonas putida gpo12 is a p. oleovorans derivative cured of the oct plasmid.  upon introduction of pgec47 in this strain, carbon catabolite repression of alkane hydroxylase activity was reduced significantly. in cultures of recombinant e. coli hb101 and w3110 carrying pgec47, induction of alkb and transcription of the alkb gene were no longer subject to carbon catabolite repression. this suggests that carbon catabolite repression of alkane degradation is regulated differently in pseudomonas and in e. coli strains. these results also indicate that palkbfghjkl, the palk promoter, might be useful in attaining high expression levels of heterologous genes in e. coli grown on inexpensive carbon sources which normally trigger carbon catabolite repression of native expression systems in this host.

AB  == a mechanism for regulating gene expression at the level of transcription utilizes an antagonist of the sigma transcription factor known as the anti-sigma (anti-sigma) factor. the cytoplasmic class of anti-sigma factors has been well characterized. the class includes asia form bacteriophage t4, which inhibits escherichia coli sigma 70; flgm, present in both gram-positive and gram-negative  bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor sigma 28; spoiiab, which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, sigma f and sigma g, of bacillus  subtilis; rbsw of b. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor sigma  b; and dnak, a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor sigma 32. in addition to this class of well-characterized cytoplasmic anti-sigma factors, a new class of homologous, inner-membrane-bound anti-sigma factors has recently been discovered in a variety of eubacteria. this new class of anti-sigma factors regulates the expression of so-called extracytoplasmic functions, and hence is known as the ecf subfamily of  anti-sigma factors. the range of cell processes regulated by anti-sigma factors is highly varied and includes bacteriophage phage growth, sporulation, stress response, flagellar biosynthesis, pigment production, ion transport, and virulence.

TI  == polyhydroxyalkanoate inclusion body-associated proteins and coding region in bacillus megaterium.
AB  == polyhydroxyalkanoic acids (pha) are carbon and energy storage polymers that accumulate in inclusion bodies in many bacteria and archaea in response to environmental conditions. this work presents the results of a study of pha inclusion body-associated proteins and an analysis of their coding region in bacillus megaterium 11561. a 7, 917-bp fragment of dna was cloned and shown to carry a 4,104-bp cluster of 5 pha genes, phap, -q, -r, -b, and -c. the phap and -q genes were shown to be transcribed in one orientation, each from a separate promoter, while immediately upstream, phar, -b, and -c were divergently transcribed as a tricistronic operon. transfer of this gene cluster to escherichia coli and to a phac- mutant of pseudomonas putida gave a pha+ phenotype in both strains. translational fusions to the green fluorescent protein localized phap and phac to the pha inclusion bodies in living cells. the data presented are consistent with the hypothesis that the extremely hydrophilic protein phap is a storage protein and suggests that pha inclusion bodies are not  only a source of carbon, energy, and reducing equivalents but are also a source of amino acids.

TI  == isolation and characterization of toluene-sensitive mutants from pseudomonas putida ih-2000.
AB  == two toluene-sensitive mutants were generated from pseudomonas putida ih-2000, the first known toluene-tolerant isolate, by tn5 transposon mutagenesis. these mutants were unable to grow in the presence of toluene (log p(ow) 2.8) but they could grow in medium overlaid with organic solvents having a log p(ow) value higher than that of toluene such as p-xylene (log p(ow) 3.1), cyclohexane (log p(ow) 3.4) and n-hexane (log p(ow) 3.9). the tn5 transposable element knocked out a cyob-like gene in one mutant and a cyoc-like gene in the other mutant. seven open reading frames were found in a 5.5-kb region containing the cyob- and cyoc-like genes of strain ih-2000. orfs 3.7 showed significant identity to the cyoabcde gene products of escherichia coli, but orfs 1 and 2 showed no significant homology to any protein reported so far. the growth patterns of the tn5 mutants with the inactivated cyo-like gene were similar to that of the wild-type strain in the absence of organic solvents, although the doubling times  were slightly longer than that of the wild-type strain. our findings indicate that cyo is an important gene for toluene tolerance, although its role is still unclear.

TI  == genetic and biochemical analyses of the tec operon suggest a route for evolution  of chlorobenzene degradation genes.
AB  == the teca broad-spectrum chlorobenzene dioxygenase of burkholderia sp. strain ps12 catalyzes the first step in the mineralization of 1,2,4, 5-tetrachlorobenzene. the catabolic genes were localized on a small plasmid that belongs to the incpbeta incompatibility group. pcr analysis of the genetic environment of the tec genes indicated high similarity to the transposon-organized catabolic tcb chlorobenzene degradation genes of pseudomonas sp. strain p51. sequence analysis  of the regions flanking the teca genes revealed an upstream open reading frame (orf) with high similarity to the todf 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-2,4-heptadienoate hydrolase gene of pseudomonas putida f1 and a discontinuous downstream orf showing high similarity to the tode catechol 2,3-dioxygenase gene of strain f1. both homologues in strain p51 exist only as deletion remnants. we suggest that different genetic events thus led to inactivation of the perturbing meta-cleavage enzymes in strains p51 and ps12 during the evolution of efficient chlorobenzene degradation pathways. biochemical characterization of todf-like protein tlpf and  a genetically refunctionalized tode-like protein, tlpe, produced in escherichia coli provided data consistent with the proposed relationships.

AB  == active biological containment systems are based on the controlled expression of killing genes. these systems are of interest for the pseudomonadaceae because of  the potential applications of these microbes as bioremediation agents and biopesticides. the physiological effects that lead to cell death upon the induction of expression of two different heterologous killing genes in nonpathogenic pseudomonas putida kt2440 derivatives have been analyzed. p. putida cmc4 and cmc12 carry in their chromosomes a fusion of the pa1-04/03 promoter to the escherichia coli gef gene and the phix174 lysis gene e, respectively. expression of the killing genes is controlled by the laci protein, whose expression is initiated from the xyls-dependent pm promoter. under induced conditions, killing of p. putida cmc12 cells mediated by phix174 lysis protein e  was faster than that observed for p. putida cmc4, for which the gef protein was the killing agent. in both cases, cell death occurred as a result of impaired respiration, altered membrane permeability, and the release of some cytoplasmic contents to the extracellular medium.

TI  == combined physical and genetic map of the pseudomonas putida kt2440 chromosome.

TI  == formation of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) by pha synthase from ralstonia eutropha.
AB  == the acetoacetyl-coa reductase and the polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) synthase from ralstonia eutropha (formerly alcaligenes eutrophus) were expressed in escherichia coli, klebsiella aerogenes, and pha-negative mutants of r. eutropha and pseudomonas putida. while expression in e. coli strains resulted in the accumulation of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) [phb], strains of r. eutropha, p. putida  and k. aerogenes accumulated poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) [poly(3hb-co-3hhx)] when even chain fatty acids were provided as carbon source, and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) [poly(3hb-co-3hv)] when odd chain fatty acids were provided as carbon source. this suggests that fatty acid degradation can be directly accessed employing only the acetoacetyl-coa reductase and the pha synthase. this is also the first proof that the pha synthase from r.  eutropha can incorporate 3-hydroxyhexanoate (3hhx) into pha and has, therefore, a broader substrate specificity than previously described.

TI  == protein organization on the pha inclusion cytoplasmic boundary.
AB  == polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) cellular inclusions consist of polyesters, phospholipids, and proteins. both the polymerase and the depolymerase enzymes are active components of the structure. recently, proteins associated with these inclusions have been described in a number of bacterial species. in order to further clarify the structure and function of these proteins in relation to polymer inclusions, ultrastructural studies of isolated polymer inclusions were initiated. the surface boundary characteristics of polymer inclusions, produced by several genera of bacteria, two different pseudomonas putida deletion mutants  and by escherichia coli recombinants, were examined. the recombinant e. coli carried either the phb biosynthesis operon (phacab) from ralstonia eutropha alone, or both this operon and a gene encoding an inclusion surface protein of r. eutropha (phap). the results support two suggestions: (i) specific genes in the pha gene cluster code for the proteins forming the surface boundary arrays which  characterize the polymer inclusion; and (ii) transfer of such a gene would result in subcellular compartmentalization of accumulating polymer. although the proteins appear to serve a similar function among different genera, nevertheless, the different surface proteins are encoded by a variety of non-homologous genetic sequences.

TI  == int-b13, an unusual site-specific recombinase of the bacteriophage p4 integrase family, is responsible for chromosomal insertion of the 105-kilobase clc element  of pseudomonas sp. strain b13.
AB  == pseudomonas sp. strain b13 carries the clcrabde genes encoding chlorocatechol-degradative enzymes on the self-transmissible 105-kb clc element.  the element integrates site and orientation specifically into the chromosomes of  various bacterial recipients, with a glycine trna structural gene (glyv) as the integration site. we report here the localization and nucleotide sequence of the  integrase gene and the activity of the integrase gene product in mediating site-specific integration. the integrase gene (int-b13) was located near the right end of the clc element. it consisted of an open reading frame (orf) of maximally 1,971 bp with a coding capacity for 657 amino acids (aa). the full-length protein (74 kda) was observed upon overexpression and sodium dodecyl  sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation. the n-terminal 430 aa of the predicted int-b13 protein had substantial similarity to integrases from bacteriophages of the p4 family, but int-b13 was much larger than p4-type integrases. the c-terminal 220 aa of int-b13 were homologous to an orf flanking a gene cluster for naphthalene degradation in pseudomonas aeruginosa pak1. similar  to the bacteriophages phir73 and p4, the clc element integrates into the 3' end of the target trna gene. this target site was characterized from four different recipient strains into which the clc element integrated, showing sequence specificity of the integration. in pseudomonas sp. strain b13, a circular form of the clc element, which carries an 18-bp dna sequence identical to the 3'-end portion of glyv as part of its attachment site (attp), could be detected. upon chromosomal integration of the clc element into a bacterial attachment site (attb), a functional glyv was reconstructed at the right end of the element. the  integration process could be demonstrated in reca-deficient escherichia coli with two recombinant plasmids, one carrying the int-b13 gene and the attp site and the other carrying the attb site of pseudomonas putida f1.

AB  == homocysteine alpha,gamma-lyase from the anaerobic protozoan parasite trichomonas  vaginalis has been cloned from genomic dna using pcr methods and expressed in escherichia coli with a vector containing the t7 promoter. the recombinant homocysteine alpha,gamma-lyase (rhcyase) is expressed as the major protein in the host e. coli cells. the enzyme was purified to approximately 90% purity using heat treatment at 50 degreesc, precipitation steps with polyethyleneimine, polyethylene glycol 8000, and high sodium chloride, deae-sepharose ff chromatography, and phenyl-sepharose 6 ff chromatography. the final yield was greater than 50%, which encompassed an approximate 18-fold purification. the enzyme is a homotetramer with a monomer molecular weight of 43k and contains pyridoxal phosphate. the trichomonas rhcyase is selective for homocysteine with respect to very low cysteinase activity in contrast to the alpha,gamma-lyase from pseudomonas putida, which has very high cysteinase activity with respect to homocysteine. the t. vaginalis and p. putida alpha,gamma-lyases readily separate  on a phenyl-sepharose 6 ff column with the t. vaginalis enzyme eluting first. rhcyase is stable up to 50 degreesc and active over a ph range of 6-8. these properties of high recombinant expression in e. coli, a simple and effective high-yield purification procedure and high relative specificity for homocysteine  with respect to cysteine, make rhcyase a promising candidate to use for the diagnosis of hyperhomocystenemia, which has been demonstrated to be a major risk  factor for the onset and mortality of cardiovascular disease of all types.

AB  == the polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) synthase gene (phacnc) from nocardia corallina was identified in a lambda library on a 6-kb bamhi fragment. a 2.8-kb xhoii subfragment was found to contain the intact pha synthase. this 2.8-kb fragment was subjected to dna sequencing and was found to contain the coding region for the pha synthase and a small downstream open reading frame of unknown function. on the basis of dna sequence, phacnc is closest in homology to the pha synthases  (phacpai and phacpaii) of pseudomonas aeruginosa (approximately 41% identity and  55% similarity). the 2.8-kb xhoii fragment containing phacnc was subcloned into broad host range mobilizable plasmids and transferred into escherichia coli, klebsiella aerogenes (both containing a plasmid bearing phaa and phab from ralstonia eutropha), and pha-negative strains of r. eutropha and pseudomonas putida. the recombinant strains were grown on various carbon sources and the resulting polymers were analyzed. in these strains, the pha synthase from n. corallina was able to mediate the production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) containing high levels of 3-hydroxyhexanoate when grown on hexanoate and larger even-chain fatty acids and  poly(3-hydroxyvalerate-co-3-hydroxyheptanoate) containing high levels of 3-hydroxyheptanoate when grown on heptanoate or larger odd-chain fatty acids.

AB  == operon op2 on the pseudomonas putida tol plasmid encodes enzymes for m-toluate catabolism; transcription of this operon is activated by xyls in the presence of  m-toluate. because transcriptional activation of op2 specifically occurs in the stationary phase of growth both in p. putida and in escherichia coli, we suspected that its transcription is dependent on rpos (sigmas). therefore, we constructed a rpos disruption strain of p. putida mt-2, and assayed op2 expression and other phenotypes. op2 transcription was dependent on rpos, indicating that the stationary-phase specific activation of op2 is due to positive regulation by rpos in p. putida mt-2. the rpos mutant exhibited reduced  viability during the stationary phase and was sensitive to high salt concentrations and h2o2. p. putida mt-2 has two catalase isozymes, kata and katb. expression of the katb gene was specific to the stationary phase and entirely dependent on the rpos gene, while the kata gene expressed during log phase partially required rpos. there were no significant changes in tolerance to high temperature or uv light in the rpos mutant. no difference was observed between the e. coli rpos mutants and their parents in their capacity to activate op2, suggesting that the mechanism of op2 activation in the stationary phase of growth differs between p. putida and e. coli.

TI  == substrate specificity of and product formation by muconate cycloisomerases: an analysis of wild-type enzymes and engineered variants.
AB  == muconate cycloisomerases play a crucial role in the bacterial degradation of aromatic compounds by converting cis,cis-muconate, the product of catechol ring cleavage, to (4s)-muconolactone. chloromuconate cycloisomerases catalyze both the corresponding reaction and a dehalogenation reaction in the transformation of chloroaromatic compounds. this study reports the first thorough examination of the substrate specificity of the muconate cycloisomerases from pseudomonas putida prs2000 and acinetobacter "calcoaceticus" adp1. we show that they transform, in addition to cis,cis-muconate, 3-fluoro-, 2-methyl-, and 3-methyl-cis, cis-muconate with high specificity constants but not 2-fluoro-, 2-chloro-, 3-chloro-, or 2,4-dichloro-cis,cis-muconate. based on known three-dimensional structures, variants of p. putida muconate cycloisomerase were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis to contain amino acids found in equivalent positions in chloromuconate cycloisomerases. some of the variants had significantly increased  specificity constants for 3-chloro- or 2,4-dichloromuconate (e.g., a271s and i54v showed 27- and 22-fold increases, respectively, for the former substrate). these  kinetic improvements were not accompanied by a change from protoanemonin to cis,cis-dienelactone as the product of 3-chloro-cis,cis-muconate conversion. the  rate of 2-chloro-cis,cis-muconate turnover was not significantly improved, nor was this compound dehalogenated to any significant extent. however, the direction of 2-chloro-cis,cis-muconate cycloisomerization could be influenced by amino acid exchange. while the wild-type enzyme discriminated only slightly between the two  possible cycloisomerization directions, some of the enzyme variants showed a strong preference for either (+)-2-chloro- or (+)-5-chloromuconolactone formation. these results show that the different catalytic characteristics of muconate and chloromuconate cycloisomerases are due to a number of features that  can be changed independently of each other.

AB  == interaction potentials between soil microarthropods and microorganisms were investigated with folsomia candida (insecta, collembola) in microcosm laboratory  experiments. microscopic analysis revealed that the volumes of the simple, rod-shaped guts of adult specimens varied with their feeding activity, from 0.7 to 11.2 nl. a dense layer of bacterial cells, associated with the peritrophic membrane, was detected in the midgut by scanning electron microscopy. depending on the molting stage, which occurred at intervals of approximately 4 days, numbers of heterotrophic, aerobic gut bacteria changed from 4.9 x 10(2) to 2.3 x  10(6) cfu per specimen. a total of 11 different taxonomic bacterial groups and the filamentous fungus acremonium charticola were isolated from the guts of five  f. candida specimens. the most abundant isolate was related to erwinia amylovora  (96.2% dna sequence similarity to its 16s rrna gene). f. candida preferred to feed on pseudomonas putida and three indigenous gut isolates rather than eight different type culture strains. when luciferase reporter gene-tagged bacterial strains were pulse fed to f. candida, gut isolates were continuously shed for 8 days to several weeks but escherichia coli hb101 was shed for only 1 day. ratios  of ingested to released bacterial cells demonstrated that populations of nonindigenous gut bacteria like sinorhizobium meliloti l33 and e. coli hb101 were reduced by more than 4 orders of magnitude but that the population of gut isolate alcaligenes faecalis hr4 was reduced only 500-fold. this work demonstrates that f. candida represents a frequently changeable but selective habitat for bacteria  in terrestrial environments and that microarthropods have to be considered factors that modify soil microbial communities.

TI  == cloning, sequencing, and phenotypic characterization of the rpos gene from pseudomonas putida kt2440.
AB  == a gene homologous to the rpos gene of escherichia coli was cloned from a pseudomonas putida kt2440 gene bank by complementation of the rpos-deficient strain e. coli zk918. the rpos gene of p. putida complemented the acid sensitivity and catalase deficiency of the rpos mutant of e. coli and stimulated  expression of the rpos-controlled promoter, bolap1. the gene was sequenced and found to be highly similar to the rpos genes of other gram-negative bacteria. like in other gram-negative bacteria, a homolog of the nlpd gene was found upstream to the rpos gene. a transcriptional fusion of the promoter of the p. putida rpos gene to the luxab genes from vibrio harveyi was constructed and used  as an inactivated allele of rpos for gene replacement of the wild-type copy in the chromosome of p. putida. the resultant rpos mutant of p.putida, c1r1, showed  reduced survival of carbon starvation and reduced cross-protection against other  types of stress in cells starved for carbon, in particular after a challenge with ethanol. survival in soil amended with m-methylbenzoate was also reduced in the mutant strain p. putida c1r1. the rpos protein of p. putida controls the expression of more than 50 peptides, which are normally expressed in cells after  a short period of carbon starvation.

TI  == activation and repression of transcription at the double tandem divergent promoters for the xylr and xyls genes of the tol plasmid of pseudomonas putida.
AB  == the xylr and xyls genes are divergent and control transcription of the tol plasmid catabolic pathways for toluene metabolism. four promoters are found in the 300-bp intergenic region: pr1 and pr2 are constitutive sigma70-dependent tandem promoters that drive expression of xylr, while expression of the xyls gene is driven from ps2, a constitutive sigma70-dependent promoter, and by the regulatable sigma54 class ps1 promoter. in ps1 the xylr targets (upstream activator sequences [uass]) overlap the pr promoters, and two sites for integration host factor (ihf) binding are located at the region from positions -2 to -30 (-2/-30 region) and the -137/-156 region, the latter overlapping the pr promoters. when the xylr protein binds to the uass in the absence of effector, it represses expression from pr promoters. in the xylr-plus background and in the absence of an effector, the level of expression from ps1 is low, although detectable, whereas ps2 is active. in this background and in the presence of an effector, xylr increases autorepression. in a sigma54-deficient pseudomonas putida background, no expression occurred from ps1 regardless of the presence of  an effector. however, in the presence of an effector, the amount of rna produced  from pr promoters was almost undetectable. this finding suggests that when no transcription occurred at the ps1 promoter, clearance of xylr from the uass was almost negligible. in this background, expression from ps2 was very high regardless of the presence of an effector; this finding suggests that rna polymerase containing sigma54 modulates expression from the downstream ps2 sigma70-dependent promoter. in a p. putida ihf-minus background and in the presence of effector, ps1 expression was the highest found; in contrast, the basal levels of this promoter were the lowest observed. this finding suggests that ihf acts in vivo as a repressor of the sigma54-dependent ps1 promoter. in an ihf-deficient host background, expression from ps2 in the presence of effector was negligible. thus, binding of rna polymerase containing sigma54 at the upstream promoter may modulate expression from the ps2 promoter.

TI  == expression of the transposase gene tnpa of tn4652 is positively affected by integration host factor.
AB  == tn4652 is a derivative of the toluene degradation transposon tn4651 that belongs  to the tn3 family of transposons (m. tsuda and t. iino, mol. gen. genet. 210:270-276, 1987). we have sequenced the transposase gene tnpa of transposon tn4652 and mapped its promoter to the right end of the element. the deduced amino acid sequence of tnpa revealed 96.2% identity with the putative transposase of tn5041. homology with other tn3 family transposases was only moderate (about 20 to 24% identity), suggesting that tn4652 and tn5041 are distantly related members of the tn3 family. functional analysis of the tnpa promoter revealed that it is active in pseudomonas putida but silent in escherichia coli, indicating that some p. putida-specific factor is required for the transcription from this promoter. additionally, tnpa promoter activity was shown to be modulated by integration host factor (ihf). the presence of an ihf-binding site upstream of the tnpa promoter enhanced the promoter activity. the positive role of ihf was also confirmed by the finding that the enhancing effect of ihf was not detected in the p. putida ihfa-deficient strain a8759. moreover, the tn4652 terminal sequences had a negative effect on transcription from the tnpa promoter in the ihfa-defective strain. this finding suggests that ihf not only enhances transcription from the tnpa promoter but also alleviates the negative effect of terminal sequences of tn4652 on the promoter activity. also, an in vitro binding  assay demonstrated that both ends of tn4652 bind ihf from a cell lysate of e. coli.

TI  == new unstable variants of green fluorescent protein for studies of transient gene  expression in bacteria.
AB  == use of the green fluorescent protein (gfp) from the jellyfish aequorea victoria is a powerful method for nondestructive in situ monitoring, since expression of green fluorescence does not require any substrate addition. to expand the use of  gfp as a reporter protein, new variants have been constructed by the addition of  short peptide sequences to the c-terminal end of intact gfp. this rendered the gfp susceptible to the action of indigenous housekeeping proteases, resulting in  protein variants with half-lives ranging from 40 min to a few hours when synthesized in escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida. the new gfp variants should be useful for in situ studies of temporal gene expression.

TI  == a novel -2fe-2s- ferredoxin from pseudomonas putida mt2 promotes the reductive reactivation of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase.
AB  == catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (xyle) is a component of the tol plasmid-encoded pathway for the degradation of toluene and xylenes and catalyzes the dioxygenolytic cleavage of the aromatic ring. purified xyle is oxygen-sensitive and unstable in  vitro, particularly in the presence of substituted catechol substrates, but it is stabilized in vivo by another protein, xylt, encoded by the xylt gene located just upstream of xyle. in this study, we have purified to homogeneity the xylt product from a recombinant escherichia coli strain containing a hyperexpressible  xylt gene and characterized it as a novel [2fe-2s] ferredoxin. it is the first example of a soluble ferredoxin with a net positive charge at neutral ph. the epr signal of the iron sulfur cluster has rhombic symmetry as is the case for plant-type ferredoxins, but the xylt absorbance spectrum resembles more closely that of adrenodoxin. the midpoint redox potential was determined to be -373 +/- 6 mv, at ph 8. 5. xylt was unusually unstable for a [2fe-2s] ferredoxin, with half-lives of 69 min at 25 degrees c in air and 70 min at 37 degrees c in argon.  with photochemically reduced 5-deazaflavin for the controlled generation of reductant, it was demonstrated that xylt mediates the rapid reactivation of purified inactive catechol 2,3-dioxygenase in vitro. inactivation of xyle by 4-methylcatechol resulted in oxidation of the active site iron to a high spin ferric state that was detectable by epr. spectroscopic evidence presented here demonstrates that xylt reactivates xyle through reduction of the iron atom in the active site of the enzyme. it is the first instance of a ferredoxin-mediated reactivation of an enzyme. the level of expression of xylt in pseudomonas putida  mt2 cells is low and the calculated xylt/xyle molar ratio is consistent with the  proposal that xyle reactivation involves catalytic nonstoichiometric amounts of xylt.

TI  == the primitive protozoon trichomonas vaginalis contains two methionine gamma-lyase genes that encode members of the gamma-family of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzymes.

AB  == two different antigenic protein-coding clones (ppa1 and ppa2) were isolated using anti-pasteurella piscicida rabbit serum from a genomic dna library of p. piscicida strain kp9038. the ppa1 and ppa2 expressed 7 kda and 45 kda proteins in escherichia coli, respectively, and the molecular sizes of these expressed proteins are the same as these of the major antigenic proteins of p. piscicida. ppa1 encodes a protein of 83 amino acids residues, which is similar to the bacterial lipoprotein. comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of the ppa1-encoded 7 kda protein of p. piscicida with previously reported bacterial lipoprotein sequence data revealed that it shares about 40% amino acid sequence identity. ppa2 has two large open reading frame (orfs). the larger orf (encoding  452 amino acid residues) encodes a homolog of degq protease, and the smaller orf  (371 amino acid residues) encodes a homolog of degs protease. the antibodies reacted with the larger orf-encoded 45 kda degq homolog protein. the degq and degs homolog proteins contain an export signal and a serine protease active site. the structural features of the ppa2-coding locus are similar to those of the loci in e. coli for the degq and degs serine protease genes. a sequence in the 3' non-coding region of vibrio hollisae thermostable hemolysin gene that is highly homologous with a similar located sequence in the pseudomonas putida p-cresol methylhydroxylase gene is also found in the 3' non-coding region of the degs homolog gene of the ppa2.

TI  == pcau, a transcriptional activator of genes for protocatechuate utilization in acinetobacter.
AB  == the acinetobacter pcaijfbdkchg operon encodes the six enzymes that convert protocatechuate to citric acid cycle intermediates. directly downstream from the  operon are qui and pob genes encoding sets of enzymes that convert quinate and p-hydroxybenzoate, respectively, to protocatechuate. prior to this investigation, the only known regulatory gene in the pca-qui-pob cluster was pobr, which encodes a transcriptional activator that responds to p-hydroxybenzoate and activates transcription of poba. the pca and qui genes were known to be expressed in response to protocatechuate, but a protein that mediated this induction had not been identified. this study was initiated by characterization of a spontaneous mutation that mapped upstream from pcai and prevented expression of the pca genes. sequencing of wild-type dna extending from the translational start of pcai through and beyond the location of the mutation revealed a 282-bp intergenic region and a divergently transcribed open reading frame, designated pcau. downstream from pcau are two open reading frames encoding proteins similar in amino acid sequence to those associated with the oxidation of acyl thioesters. inactivation of pcau reduced the induced expression of pca structural genes by about 90% and impeded but did not completely prevent growth of the mutant cells with protocatechuate. pcau was expressed in escherichia coli and shown to bind to a portion of the pcai-pcau intergenic region containing a sequence identical in 16 of 19 nucleotide residues to a segment of the pob operator. further similarity of the two regulatory systems is indicated by 54% amino acid sequence identity in the aligned primary structures of pobr and pcau. the pob and pca systems were shown to differ, however, in the relative orientations of transcriptional starts  with respect to the site where the activator binds to dna, the size of the intergenic region, and the tightness of transcriptional control. the spontaneous  mutation blocking pca gene expression was located in the promoter for the pca operon. the 19-nucleotide residue operator sequences were shown to be parts of a  consensus associated with transcriptional activation of genes associated with protocatechuate catabolism. two different binding sites for pseudomonas putida pcar differ from the consensus in only a single nucleotide residue, and dna directly downstream from acinetobacter pcau contains a 19-bp segment differing from the consensus in only two residues. pcau was shown to bind to dna containing this segment as well as to the dna in the pcau-pcai intergenic region.

TI  == plasmid-mediated rifampicin resistance in pseudomonas fluorescens.
AB  == rifampicin is an antibiotic mostly used to treat tuberculosis and leprosy, and, occasionally, other diseases. resistance is due to alterations in membrane permeability or to mutation in the rpob gene coding for mrna polymerase. both these mechanisms originate via chromosomal mutation. however, a rifampicin-resistant pseudomonas fluorescens strain harboured a multiresistance plasmid which transferred rifampicin resistance when transformed into p. putida or escherichia coli. rifampicin readily diffused into the sensitive cells of the  e. coli and p. putida recipients, but the transformants with the plasmid, pscl were resistant to the drug and did not accumulate it. potassium cyanide restored  the diffusion of rifampicin into the resistant cells, indicating that an efflux pump was involved in the resistance mechanism. the resistance of the transformants and the wild strain was also abolished in sphaeroplasts generated by edta lysozyme treatment. analysis of membrane proteins by sds-page revealed the presence of two new proteins in the plasmid-containing cells of e. coli, p. putida and p. fluorescens and not in the plasmid-free cells. these may be involved in the efflux of rifampicin.

TI  == development and testing of a bacterial biosensor for toluene-based environmental  contaminants.
AB  == a bacterial biosensor for benzene, toluene, and similar compounds has been constructed, characterized, and field tested on contaminated water and soil. the  biosensor is based on a plasmid incorporating the transcriptional activator xylr  from the tol plasmid of pseudomonas putida mt-2. the xylr protein binds a subset  of toluene-like compounds and activates transcription at its promoter, pu. a reporter plasmid was constructed by placing the luc gene for firefly luciferase under the control of xylr and pu. when escherichia coli cells were transformed with this plasmid vector, luminescence from the cells was induced in the presence of benzene, toluene, xylenes, and similar molecules. accurate concentration dependencies of luminescence were obtained and exhibited k1/2 values ranging from 39.0 +/- 3.8 microm for 3-xylene to 2,690 +/- 160 microm for 3-methylbenzylalcohol (means +/- standard deviations). the luminescence response  was specific for only toluene-like molecules that bind to and activate xylr. the  biosensor cells were field tested on deep aquifer water, for which contaminant levels were known, and were able to accurately detect toluene derivative contamination in this water. the biosensor cells were also shown to detect betx (benzene, toluene, and xylene) contamination in soil samples. these results demonstrate the capability of such a bacterial biosensor to accurately measure environmental contaminants and suggest a potential for its inexpensive application in field-ready assays.

TI  == polyethylene glycol conjugation of recombinant methioninase for cancer therapy.
AB  == recombinant methioninase (rmetase) is a homotetrameric pyridoxal 5'-phosphate enzyme of 172-kda molecular mass derived from pseudomonas putida and cloned in escherichia coli. rmetase has been found previously to be an effective, anti-tumor agent in vitro and in vivo. the enzyme targets the elevated minimal methionine requirement seen in all tumor types. in order to prevent immunological reactions which might be produced by multiple dosing of rmetase and to prolong the serum half-life of rmetase, the n-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester of methoxypolyethylene glycol propionic acid (m-spa-peg 5000) has been coupled to rmetase. molar ratios of m-spa-peg-5000 (peg) to rmetase from 10 to 40 were used  for pegylation of rmetase. pegylation reactions were run at 20 degrees c for 30 to 60 min in reaction buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, ph 8.3). the pegylated molecules (peg-rmetase) were purified from unreacted peg with amicon 30 k centriprep concentrators or by sephacryl s-300 hr gel-filtration chromatography. unreacted rmetase was removed by deae sepharose ff anion-exchange chromatography. the resulting peg-rmetase subunit, from a peg/rmetase ratio of 30/1 in the synthetic reaction, had a molecular mass of approximately 53 kda determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, indicating the conjugation of two peg molecules per subunit of rmetase and eight  per tetramer. peg-rmetase molecules obtained from reacting ratios of peg /rmetase of 30/1 had enzyme activities of 70% of unmodified rmetase. pegylation of rmetase increased the serum half-life of the enzyme in rats to approximately 160 min compared to 80 min for unmodified rmetase. peg-rmetase could deplete serum methionine levels to less than 0.1 microm for approximately 8 h compared to 2 h for rmetase in rats. efficacy studies of peg-rmetase on human lung cancer and kidney cancer cells in vitro demonstrated a 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) of 0.04 and 0.06 units/ml, respectively. these ic50 values were almost identical  to unmodified rmetase, thus indicating maintenance of antitumor efficacy in the pegylated enzyme. peg-rmetase had an ic50 for normal lung and kidney cells of 0.8 and 1.5 units/ml, respectively, similar to rmetase. the efficacy data indicated that peg-rmetase maintained the high level tumor selectivity of rmetase. peg-rmetase injected intravenously in mice demonstrated a tumor/blood retention ratio of approximately 1/6 compared to 1/10 of unmodified enzyme, indicating that peg-rmetase distributes to the tumor at least as effectively as rmetase.

AB  == a full-length heme oxygenase gene from the pathogenic bacterium corynebacterium diphtheriae has been subcloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the enzyme is expressed at high levels as a soluble catalytically active protein that results in the accumulation of biliverdin within the e. coli cells. the purified heme oxygenase forms a 1:1 complex with heme (kd = 2.5 +/- 1 microm) and has hemeprotein spectra similar to those previously reported for the purified eukaryotic heme oxygenases. in the presence of an e. coli nadph-dependent reductase isolated during the purification of hmu o, the heme-hmu o complex is catalytically turned over to yield biliverdin ixalpha and carbon monoxide. a number of redox partners were investigated for their ability to reconstitute hmu  o activity in vitro. of these the most efficient appeared to be the recombinant nadh-dependent putidaredoxin/putidaredoxin reductase from pseudomonas putida. as  with the e. coli nadph-dependent reductase the final products of the reaction were biliverdin ixalpha and carbon monoxide. this is the first bacterial heme oxygenase to be described to date. the close relationship between iron acquisition and pathogenesis suggests that the release of iron from heme by heme  oxygenase may play a crucial role in the pathogenicity of c. diphtheriae.

AB  == the xylr protein controls expression from the pseudomonas putida tol plasmid upper pathway operon promoter (pu) in response to aromatic effectors. xylr-dependent stimulation of transcription from a pu::lacz fusion shows different induction kinetics with different effectors. with toluene, activation followed a hyperbolic curve with an apparent k of 0.95 mm and a maximum beta-galactosidase activity of 2,550 miller units. with o-nitrotoluene, in contrast, activation followed a sigmoidal curve with an apparent k of 0.55 mm and a hill coefficient of 2.65. m-nitrotoluene kept the xylr regulator in an inactive transcriptional form. therefore, upon binding of an effector, the substituent on  the aromatic ring leads to productive or unproductive xylr forms. the different transcriptional states of the xylr regulator are substantiated by xylr mutants. xylre172k is a mutant regulator that is able to stimulate transcription from the  pu promoter in the presence of m-nitrotoluene; however, its response to m-aminotoluene was negligible, in contrast with the wild-type regulator. these results illustrate the importance of the electrostatic interactions in effector recognition and in the stabilization of productive and unproductive forms by the  regulator upon aromatic binding. xylrd135n and xylrd135q are mutant regulators that are able to stimulate transcription from pu in the absence of effectors, whereas substitution of glu for asp135 in xylrd135e resulted in a mutant whose ability to recognize effectors was severely impaired. therefore, the conformation of mutant xylrd135q as well as xylrd135n seemed to mimic that of the wild-type regulator when effector binding occurred, whereas mutant xylrd135e seemed to be blocked in a conformation similar to that of wild-type xylr and xylre172k upon binding to an inhibitor molecule such as m-nitrotoluene or m-aminotoluene.

AB  == the stereoselective nitrile hydratase (nhase) from pseudomonas putida 5b has been over-produced in escherichia coli. maximal enzyme activity requires the co-expression of a novel downstream gene encoding a protein (p14k) of 127 amino acids, which shows no significant homology to any sequences in the protein database. nitrile hydratase produced in transformed e. coli showed activity as high as 472 units/mg dry cell (sixfold higher than 5b), and retained the stereoselectivity observed in the native organism. separated from the end of the  beta subunit by only 51 bp, p14k appears to be part of an operon that includes the alpha and beta structural genes of nitrile hydratase, and other potential coding sequences.

TI  == cloning of the bacillus firmus of4 cls gene and characterization of its gene product.
AB  == the gene that codes for cardiolipin (cl) synthase and an adjacent gene that codes for a meca homolog in the alkaliphilic bacteria bacillus firmus of4 have been cloned and sequenced (genbank accession number u88888). the cls gene contains 1509 nucleotides, corresponding to a polypeptide of 57.9 kda. the predicted amino acid sequence has 129 identities and 100 similarities with the escherichia coli cl synthase. homologies were also noted with polypeptide sequences from putative  cls genes from bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas putida. conserved histidine, tyrosine, and serine residues may be part of the active site and participate in phosphatidyl group transfer. the b. firmus of4 cls gene product was inserted into plasmid pet3 to form a recombinant plasmid pdg2, which overproduces cl synthase in e. coli. a membrane fraction containing the overproduced enzyme converts phosphatidylglycerol to cl and glycerol. the b. firmus enzyme is stimulated by potassium phosphate, inhibited by cl and phosphatidate, and has a slightly higher ph optimum than the e. coli enzyme.

TI  == identification of the open reading frame for the pseudomonas putida d-hydantoinase gene and expression of the gene in escherichia coli.
AB  == a dna fragment containing the gene for d-hydantoinase was cloned from pseudomonas putida ccrc 12857 into escherichia coli. the cloned gene contained an open reading frame (orf) of 1485 nucleotides encoding a protein of 53.4 kda in which the carboxyl terminal end is longer than that previously deduced from strain dsm  84. this orf was verified by amino acid sequencing of amino and carboxyl termini, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and amino acid sequence comparison. deletion analysis revealed that 32 amino acids from the carboxyl terminal end were essential for d-hydantoinase activity. tagging of six  consecutive histidyl residues to the amino terminus or to the carboxyl terminus of the enzyme did not significantly affect d-hydantoinase activity. under the control of t5lac promoter and lactose induction, the d-hydantoinase activity of transformed e. coli reached 200 u l-1 which is about 20-fold higher than that of  gene donor strain.

TI  == heterologous expression of heterotrophic nitrification genes.
AB  == paracoccus denitrificans is a heterotrophic organism capable of oxidizing ammonia to nitrite during growth on an organic carbon and energy source. this pathway, termed heterotrophic nitrification, requires the concerted action of an ammonia monooxygenase (amo) and hydroxylamine oxidase (hao). the genes required for heterotrophic nitrification have been isolated by introducing a pa. denitrificans genomic library into pseudomonas putida and screening for the accumulation of nitrite. in contrast to the situation in chemolithoautotrophic ammonia oxidizers, the genes encoding amo and hao are present in single linked copies in the genome  of pa. denitrificans. amo from pa. denitrificans expressed in ps. putida is capable of oxidizing ethene (ethylene) to epoxyethane (ethylene oxide), which is  indicative of a relaxed substrate specificity. further, when expressed in the methylotroph methylobacterium extorquens am1, the amo endows on this organism the ability to grow on ethene and methane. thus, the pa. denitrificans amo is capable of oxidizing methane to methanol, as is the case for the amo from nitrosomonas europaea. the heterotrophic nitrification genes are moderately toxic in m. extorquens, more toxic in ps. putida, and non-toxic in escherichia coli. toxicity is due to the activity of the gene products in m. extorquens, and both expression and activity in ps. putida. this is the first time that the genes encoding an active amo have been expressed in a heterologous host.

AB  == glycerol trinitrate (gtn) reductase, which enables agrobacterium radiobacter to utilize gtn and related explosives as sources of nitrogen for growth, was purified and characterized, and its gene was cloned and sequenced. the enzyme was a 39-kda monomeric protein which catalyzed the nadh-dependent reductive scission  of gtn (km = 23 microm) to glycerol dinitrates (mainly the 1,3-isomer) with a ph  optimum of 6.5, a temperature optimum of 35 degrees c, and no dependence on metal ions for activity. it was also active on pentaerythritol tetranitrate (petn), on  isosorbide dinitrate, and, very weakly, on ethyleneglycol dinitrate, but it was inactive on isopropyl nitrate, hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, ammonium ions, nitrate, or nitrite. the amino acid sequence deduced from the dna sequence was homologous (42 to 51% identity and 61  to 69% similarity) to those of petn reductase from enterobacter cloacae, n-ethylmaleimide reductase from escherichia coli, morphinone reductase from pseudomonas putida, and old yellow enzyme from saccharomyces cerevisiae, placing  the gtn reductase in the alpha/beta barrel flavoprotein group of proteins. gtn reductase and petn reductase were very similar in many respects except in their distinct preferences for nadh and nadph cofactors, respectively.

AB  == transposon mutants of pseudomonas putida p8 were generated by applying a mini-tn5 mutagenesis system. the mutants obtained were checked for their ability to tolerate increased temperatures and elevated phenol concentrations. approximately 5,800 transposon mutants were used to generate a pool of 600 temperature-sensitive strains; one of these strains was identified as being damaged in its ability to perform cis-trans isomerization of fatty acids. a gene  library of p. putida p8 was constructed and screened by using as a probe sequences immediately adjacent to the mini-tn5 insertion. a dna fragment that complemented the mutation was isolated and cloned. the corresponding gene, termed cti, is located close to the methionine synthase locus (meth) in p. putida p8. a  cti-carrying fragment integrated into a plasmid also conferred the ability for cis-trans isomerization to escherichia coli; the cti gene was completely sequenced, and the amino acid sequence was deduced.

AB  == the cata gene, encoding the major cata from a root-colonizing isolate pseudomonas putida (pp), was cloned by complementation into a catalase (cat)-deficient escherichia coli (ec) strain um2. the orf for cata consisted of 479 aa with a higher degree of identity with typical cat from eukaryotes than prokaryotes. chromosomal homologous exchange with a mutant gene bearing an insertion of a luxab-npt cassette into the sfii site of cata generated a cata-deficient pp isolate. this mutant and another mutant, j1m, derived by ems mutagenesis, were highly sensitive to hydrogen peroxide. cata activity and resistance to hydrogen peroxide were restored in both mutants by cata. adjacent to the 3' end of cata was a potential orf of 462 nt that had high identitity with other bfr genes that  encode iron-storage proteins. northern analysis of the bfr gene from pp revealed  a transcript of approximately 500 nt. cata and bfr probes hybridized to the same  size restriction fragments in genomic dnas from other root-colonizing and plant pathogenic pseudomonads. thus, the genes for an iron-storage protein and the heme-containing cat appear to be conserved in adjacent loci in certain pseudomonads.

TI  == pcak, a high-affinity permease for the aromatic compounds 4-hydroxybenzoate and protocatechuate from pseudomonas putida.
AB  == pcak is a transporter and chemoreceptor protein from pseudomonas putida that is encoded as part of the beta-ketoadipate pathway regulon for aromatic acid degradation. when expressed in escherichia coli, pcak was localized to the membrane and catalyzed the accumulation of two aromatic substrates, 4-hydroxybenzoate and protocatechuate, against a concentration gradient. benzoate inhibited 4-hydroxybenzoate uptake but was not a substrate for pcak-catalyzed transport. a p. putida pcak mutant was defective in its ability to accumulate micromolar amounts of 4-hydroxybenzoate and protocatechuate. the mutant was also  impaired in growth on millimolar concentrations of these aromatic acids. in contrast, the pcak mutant grew at wild-type rates on benzoate. the vmax for uptake of 4-hydroxybenzoate was at least 25 nmol/min/mg of protein, and the km was 6 microm. pcak-mediated transport is energized by the proton motive force. these results show that although aromatic acids in the undissociated (uncharged)  form can diffuse across bacterial membranes, high-specificity active transport systems probably also contribute to the ability of bacteria to grow on the micromolar concentrations of these compounds that are typically present in soil.  a variety of aromatic molecules, including naturally occurring lignin derivatives and xenobiotics, are metabolized by bacteria and may be substrates for transport  proteins. the characterization of pcak provides a foundation for understanding active transport as a critical step in the metabolism of aromatic carbon sources.

AB  == tol plasmid in pseudomonas putida mt-2 has a series of genes for the degradation  of xylene, toluene, and their derivatives to pyruvate and acetaldehyde (or propionaldehyde). two operons, i.e., upper operon and meta operon, play indispensable roles for the digestion of xylene derivatives: when xyir protein recognizes xylene derivatives, another controlling gene, xyis, is activated, which results in the activation of meta operon. therefore, we have constructed a  fusion gene between tol plasmid and the firefly luciferase gene under the control of xyir and the promoter of xyis gene; i.e., by using fusions of the meta operon  with promotorless luciferase expression vector from firefly, we have constructed  and tested biomonitors for benzene derivatives. bioluminescence specified by escherichia coli (ptsn316), carrying xyir and xyis promoters, ampr and luc, was measured in either a benzene derivative-saturated or o-methylbenzyl alcohol-dissolved medium both in the case of cell suspension and in the case of immobilized cell form. the utility of the biosensing system for monitoring in chemical plant drainage was demonstrated with samples supplemented with benzene derivatives. the xyir-xyis promoter-lux fusion carried by ptsn316 responded to a  benzene-related chemical in sample solutions. immobilization of the transformed e. coli, at one end of fiber optic, bearing firefly luciferase gene fused to tol  plasmid, has been demonstrated to fabricate a luminescent remote biomonitoring device for the protection of environmental deterioration. due to the luminescent  detection, the detection limits for benzene-related aromatics that are recognized by a binding protein (xyir) were parts-per-million. we had already submitted a preliminary report concerning the possibility of environmental monitoring based on the above idea by using the transformed e. coli in a cell-suspended solution.  this paper describes mainly a fiber-optic-based biomonitoring device for the protection of environmental deterioration.

AB  == in pseudomonas putida, benzoate and 3-chlorobenzoate are converted to catechol and 3-chlorocatechol, respectively, which are then catabolized to tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates via the catbca and clcabd pathways. the catbca and clcabd operons are regulated by homologous transcriptional activators catr and clcr. previous studies have demonstrated that in addition to sequence similarities, catr and clcr share functional similarities which allow catr to complement clcr. in this study, we demonstrate that catr activates the clcabd promoter in vitro without inducer, but more transcript is produced when inducer is added. dnase i footprinting and dna-bending analyses demonstrate that catr binds to and bends the clcabd promoter to the same angle as does clcr plus its inducer, 2-chloromuconate. this implies that catr binds to the clc promoter in its active conformation. transcription of the clcabd promoter by the alpha-subunit truncation mutant (alpha-235) of rna polymerase was sharply reduced, indicating that the alpha-subunit c-terminal domain is important. however, a small amount of transcript was produced under these conditions, indicating that other contact sites on the rna polymerase may play a role in activation.

AB  == a 15-kb region of pseudomonas putida chromosomal dna containing the mde operon and an upstream regulatory gene (mder) has been cloned and sequenced. the mde operon contains two structural genes involved in l-methionine degradative metabolism: the already-identified mdea, which encodes l-methionine gamma-lyase (h. inoue, k. inagaki, m. sugimoto, n. esaki, k. soda, and h. tanaka. j. biochem. (tokyo) 117:1120-1125, 1995), and mdeb, which encodes a homologous protein to the homodimeric-type e1 component of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. a rho-independent terminator was present just downstream of mdeb, and open reading  frames corresponding to other components of alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex were not found. when mdeb was overproduced in escherichia coli, the cell extract  showed the e1 activity with high specificity for alpha-ketobutyrate rather than pyruvate. these results suggest that mdeb plays an important role in the metabolism of alpha-ketobutyrate produced by mdea from l-methionine. accordingly, mdeb encodes a novel e1 component, alpha-ketobutyrate dehydrogenase e1 component, of an unknown alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex in p. putida. in addition, we found that the mder gene was located on the opposite strand and began at 127 bp from the translational start site of mdea. the mder gene product has been identified as a member of the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (lrp) family  and revealed to act as an essential positive regulator allowing the expression of the mdeab operon.

TI  == evidence for the bacterial origin of genes encoding fermentation enzymes of the amitochondriate protozoan parasite entamoeba histolytica.
AB  == entamoeba histolytica is an amitochondriate protozoan parasite with numerous bacterium-like fermentation enzymes including the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (por), ferredoxin (fd), and alcohol dehydrogenase e (adhe). the goal of this study was to determine whether the genes encoding these cytosolic e. histolytica fermentation enzymes might derive from a bacterium by horizontal transfer, as has previously been suggested for e. histolytica genes encoding heat shock protein 60, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, and superoxide dismutase. in this study, the e. histolytica por gene and the adhe gene of a second amitochondriate protozoan parasite, giardia lamblia, were sequenced, and their phylogenetic positions were estimated in relation to por, adhe, and fd cloned from eukaryotic and eubacterial organisms. the e. histolytica por gene encodes a 1,620-amino-acid peptide that contained conserved iron-sulfur- and thiamine pyrophosphate-binding sites. the predicted e. histolytica por showed fewer positional identities to the por of g. lamblia (34%) than to the por of the enterobacterium klebsiella pneumoniae (49%), the cyanobacterium anabaena sp. (44%), and the protozoan trichomonas vaginalis (46%), which targets its por to anaerobic organelles called hydrogenosomes. maximum-likelihood, neighbor-joining, and parsimony analyses also suggested as less likely e. histolytica por sharing more recent common ancestry with g. lamblia por than with por of bacteria and the t. vaginalis hydrogenosome. the g. lamblia adhe encodes an 888-amino-acid fusion  peptide with an aldehyde dehydrogenase at its amino half and an iron-dependent (class 3) adh at its carboxy half. the predicted g. lamblia adhe showed extensive positional identities to adhe of escherichia coli (49%), clostridium acetobutylicum (44%), and e. histolytica (43%) and lesser identities to the class 3 adh of eubacteria and yeast (19 to 36%). phylogenetic analyses inferred a closer relationship of the e. histolytica adhe to bacterial adhe than to the g. lamblia adhe. the 6-kda fd of e. histolytica and g. lamblia were most similar to  those of the archaebacterium methanosarcina barkeri and the delta-purple bacterium desulfovibrio desulfuricans, respectively, while the 12-kda fd of the t. vaginalis hydrogenosome was most similar to the 12-kda fd of gamma-purple bacterium pseudomonas putida. e. histolytica genes (and probably g. lamblia genes) encoding fermentation enzymes therefore likely derive from bacteria by horizontal transfer, although it is not clear from which bacteria these amebic genes derive. these are the first nonorganellar fermentation enzymes of eukaryotes implicated to have derived from bacteria.

AB  == transcription of the ferric citrate transport genes of escherichia coli is induced by a novel mechanism. ferric citrate, the inducer, does not have to enter the cytoplasm to initiate transcription. interaction of ferric citrate with the outer membrane receptor protein feca induces transcription of the fec transport gene operon consisting of the fecirabcde genes. a signal from feca occupied with  ferric citrate is transmitted across the outer membrane into the periplasm with the help of the electrochemical potential of the cytoplasmic membrane and the ton system. the signal is then transduced across the cytoplasmic membrane by the fecr protein, which in turn activates the feci sigma-factor that directs the rna polymerase core-enzyme to the fec transport gene promoter. the promoter of the regulatory genes feci and fecr is not controlled by ferric citrate but is regulated by iron via the fur repressor. it is proposed that the information flux from the cell surface to the cytoplasm involves a series of conformational changes of the proteins feca, fecr, and feci in that order. the level of the regulatory proteins feci and fecr is adjusted to the intracellular iron concentration and determines the degree of the response of the cell to ferric citrate in the medium. ferric citrate induces transcription of the fec transport  genes under iron-limiting conditions. a regulatory device similar to the ferric citrate transport system exists in pseudomonas putida wcs358. the synthesis of the outer membrane receptor pupb, involved in the transport of the ferric pseudobactins bn7 and bn8, is induced by the ferric siderophores and requires pupb and two proteins homologous to feci and fecr.

TI  == structure of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase gene encoded in tom plasmid of pseudomonas  cepacia g4.
AB  == the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase is an extradiol-type dioxygenase which cleaves the c-c bond at the meta position of catechol to form 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde.  a catechol 2,3-dioxygenase gene (tomb) in the tom plasmid of p. cepacia g4 has been cloned and its nucleotide sequence was analyzed. the enzyme gene consisted of 945 base pairs with an atg initiation codon and a tga termination codon which  can encode a polypeptide of molecular weight 35 kda containing 314 amino acid residues, and a putative ribosome-binding sequence was identified at approximately 10 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon. the deduced amino  acid sequence of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase from p. cepacia g4 exhibited 79-82% homologies with those of 3-methylcatechol 2,3-dioxygenase of p. putida ucc2 and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase of p. pickettii pko1.

TI  == studies on spontaneous promoter-up mutations in the transcriptional activator-encoding gene phir and their effects on the degradation of phenol in escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida.
AB  == the activator-encoding gene phlr was identified upstream of the plasmid-encoded operon for phenol degradation in pseudomonas putida strain h by cassette mutagenesis and dna sequence analysis. the deduced amino acid sequence of phlr shows high homology to dmpr of p. putida sp. cf600 and to the chromosomally encoded phhr of p. putida p35x reported previously. trans-activation of phenol degradation was observed when phlr was overexpressed in a phlr insertion mutant.  transconjugants of escherichia coli carrying ppgh11, which contains the complete  set of phl genes, are unable to grow on phenol as carbon source. however, two types of mutants were selected for further characterization that were able to metabolize phenol as sole source of carbon and energy. in both types of mutants enhanced expression of phlr is responsible for the phl+ phenotype. in type i (ppgh13) a deletion of 1 bp made the -35 region and the spacing between the -35 and -10 regions of the phlr promoter more similar to the consensus structure. in  type ii (ppgh14) a duplication of the phlr 5' region was identified that includes part of the -35 motif and reduces the spacing between the -35 and -10 regions. in addition, due to the duplication of part of phlr, the distance from the phlr promoter to the catabolic phl operon is increased. different transcriptional start sites have been identified by primer extension analysis in clones harboring ppgh14 or the wild type phlr. quantitative primer extension analysis revealed that the greatest amount of phlr transcript is expressed from the partial, phlr duplication. growth on phenol and phenol hydroxylase activity reflect the high level of phlr transcript in e. coli transconjugants. overexpression of phlr was also observed when ppgh14 was transferred into p. putida, and results in earlier  induction of the phenol degradation operon relative to the wild-type strain.

TI  == manure enhances plasmid mobilization and survival of pseudomonas putida introduced into field soil.
AB  == we report a field study on plasmid mobilization in an agricultural soil. the influence of pig manure on the mobilization of the incq plasmid pie723 by indigenous plasmids or by the incp(alpha) plasmid pgp527 into the recipient pseudomonas putida uwc1 (rif(supr) nal(supr)) was studied in field soil. six plots were prepared in duplicate, three of which were treated with manure prior to inoculation of the donor and recipient strains. as a donor strain, either escherichia coli j53(pie723) or e. coli 600(pie723, pgp527) was used. putative transconjugants obtained on a selective medium were confirmed by dna hybridization and pcr. plasmid mobilization by indigenous mobilizing plasmids was observed on two occasions in manured soil. manuring of soil significantly enhanced the frequency of pie723 mobilization by pgp527, since mobilization frequencies into p. putida uwc1 were at least 10-fold higher in manured soil than in nonmanured soil. enhanced numbers of p. putida uwc1 transconjugant and recipient colonies could be observed in manured soil throughout the 79-day field  test. transfer of pie723 or pg527 into indigenous soil or rhizosphere bacteria could not be detected when indigenous bacteria isolated by selective cultivation  were screened for the presence of these plasmids by dna hybridization. furthermore, the presence of incn-, incp-, or incq-specific sequences was confirmed in total community dna extracted directly from the manured or nonmanured soil by pcr. incw plasmids were detectable only in manured soil, indicating entry of these plasmids into soil via manure.

AB  == the degradation of toluene by pseudomonas putida f1 and of chlorobenzenes by burkholderia sp. strain ps12 is initiated by incorporation of dioxygen into the aromatic nucleus to form cis-dihydrodihydroxybenzenes. toluene-grown cells of p.  putida f1 and 3-chlorobenzoate-grown cells of burkholderia sp. strain ps12 were found to monooxygenate the side chain of 2- and 3-chlorotoluene to the corresponding chlorobenzyl alcohols. further metabolism of these products was slow, and the corresponding chlorobenzoates were usually observed as end products, whereas the 3-chlorobenzoate produced from 3-chlorotoluene in burkholderia sp. strain ps12 was metabolized further. escherichia coli cells containing the toluene dioxygenase genes from p. putida f1 oxidized 2- and 3-chlorotoluene to the corresponding chlorobenzyl alcohols as major products, demonstrating that this enzyme is responsible for the observed side chain monooxygenation. two methyl- and chloro-substituted 1,2-dihydroxycyclohexadienes  were formed as minor products from 2- and 3-chlorotoluene, whereas a chloro- and  methyl-substituted cyclohexadiene was the only product formed from 4-chlorotoluene. the toluene dioxygenase of p. putida f1 and chlorobenzene dioxygenase from burkholderia sp. strain ps12 are the first enzymes described that efficiently catalyze the oxidation of 2-chlorotoluene.

AB  == naphthalene dioxygenase, a key enzyme in the dihydroxylation of naphthalene, is encoded by the plasmid pn3, responsible for naphthalene metabolism in pseudomonas fluorescens n3. the naphthalene dioxygenase, including all the sequences for its  expression and the regulatory region, has been localized on the 4.3-kb hindiii-clai fragment and on the 3.5-kb hindiii fragment of the plasmid pn3, by southern analysis using as probes naha and nahr genes, the homologous genes of the plasmid nah7 from pseudomonas putida g7. we cloned in escherichia coli jm109  the dioxygenase gene and its regulatory region and developed an efficient bacterial system inducible by salicylic acid, able to produce dihydrodiols. e. coli containing recombinant plasmids carrying the dioxygenase gene were analysed  for their potential as a biocatalytic tool to produce dihydrodiols from different naphthalenes with the substituent on the aromatic ring at the alpha or beta position. the dihydrodiols, identified by hplc (high-performance liquid chromatography) and 1h-nmr (nuclear magnetic resonance) were produced with yields ranging from 50 to 94%. the degree of bioconversion efficiency depends on the nature and the position of the substituent and indicates the broad substrate specificity of this dioxygenase and its potential for the production of a wide variety of fine chemicals.

AB  == the mechanism by which the prokaryotic histone-like protein hu replaces the integration host factor (ihf) in the coactivation of the sigma54-dependent promoter pu of pseudomonas putida has been investigated. by using a preactivated  form of the cognate activator protein xylr, we show that the functional replacement of ihf with hu previously suggested in vivo can be faithfully reproduced in vitro with purified components. furthermore, the coactivation effect of ihf on pu could be mimicked not only by hu but also by the mammalian nonhistone chromatin protein hmg-1 and could be bypassed by intrinsically curved  dna. these results suggest that either of two different mechanisms (generation of a site-specific static dna bend or a general flexibilization of the promoter region) gives rise to the same structural effect of stimulating transcription from pu through changes in promoter architecture.

TI  == genetic characterization and expression in heterologous hosts of the 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionate catabolic pathway of escherichia coli k-12.
AB  == we report the complete nucleotide sequence of the gene cluster encoding the 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionate (3-hpp) catabolic pathway of escherichia coli k-12. sequence analysis revealed the existence of eight genes that map at min 8 of the  chromosome, between the lac and hemb regions. six enzyme-encoding genes account for a flavin-type monooxygenase (mhpa), the extradiol dioxygenase (mhpb), and the meta-cleavage pathway (mhpcdfe). the order of these catabolic genes, with the sole exception of mhpf, parallels that of the enzymatic steps of the pathway. the mhpf gene may encode the terminal acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (acylating) not reported previously in the proposed pathway. enzymes that catalyze the early reactions of the pathway, mhpa and mhpb, showed the lowest level of sequence similarity to analogous enzymes of other aromatic catabolic pathways. however, the genes mhpcdfe present the same organization and appear to be homologous to the pseudomonas xyl, dmp, and nah meta-pathway genes, supporting the hypothesis of the modular evolution of catabolic pathways and becoming the first example of  this type of catabolic module outside the genus pseudomonas. two bacterial interspersed mosaic elements were found downstream of the mhpabcdfe locus and flank a gene, orft, which encodes a protein related to the superfamily of transmembrane facilitators that might be associated with transport. all of the genes of the 3-hpp cluster are transcribed in the same direction, with the sole exception of mhpr. inducible expression of the mhp catabolic genes depends upon the presence, in the cis or trans position, of a functional mhpr gene, which suggests that the mhpr gene product is the activator of the 3-hpp biodegradative  pathway. the primary structure of mhpr revealed significant similarities to that  of members of the iclr subfamily of transcriptional regulators. a 3-hpp catabolic dna cassette was engineered and shown to be functional not only in enteric bacteria (e. coli and salmonella typhimurium) but also in pseudomonas putida and  rhizobium meliloti, thus facilitating its potential application to improve the catabolic abilities of bacterial strains for degradation of aromatic compounds.

TI  == promoter-creating mutations in pseudomonas putida: a model system for the study of mutation in starving bacteria.
AB  == a novel experimental system to study mutation in starving bacteria was designed,  relying on the activation of a promoterless phenol degradation operon of pseudomonas putida. the phe+ (phenol-utilizing) mutants accumulated in the starving culture of p. putida in the presence of phenol but not in the absence of it. we ruled out the possibility that the absence of phenol eliminates phe+ mutants from the starving population. sequence analysis of the phe+ mutants revealed that base substitutions, deletions, and insertion of tn4652 can result in creation of a sequence similar to the sigma70-specific promoter consensus. one particular c --> a transversion was predominant in the phe+ mutants that arose in the starving population under selection for phenol use. in contrast, various deletions were the most frequent phe+ mutants occurring in a culture growing without selection. the accumulation rate of the phe+ mutants on selective plates  was found to be higher for bacteria plated from stationary-phase culture than that from exponentially growing cells. this suggests that some specific processes, occurring predominantly in stationary-phase cells, facilitate generation and/or fixation of such mutations.

TI  == activation of the catbca promoter: probing the interaction of catr and rna polymerase through in vitro transcription.
AB  == the soil bacterium pseudomonas putida is capable of degrading many aromatic compounds, including benzoate, through catechol as an intermediate. the catabolism of catechol is mediated by the catbca operon, whose induction requires the pathway intermediate cis,cis-muconate as an inducer and the regulatory protein, catr. catr also regulates the plasmid-borne pheba operon of p. putida paw85, which is involved in phenol catabolism. we have used an in vitro transcription system to study the roles of catr, cis,cis-muconate, escherichia coli rna polymerase, and promoter sequences in expression of the cat and phe operons. the assay confirmed the requirement of both catr and cis,cis-muconate for transcript formation. we also examined the in vitro transcription of three site-directed mutants of the catbca promoter; the results obtained compared favorably with previous in vivo data. the requirement of the alpha subunit of rna polymerase for expression of the catbca and the pheba transcripts was also examined. the c-terminal region of the alpha subunit of rna polymerase has been implicated in direct protein-protein contact with transcriptional regulatory proteins and/or direct contact with the dna. we show that the carboxyl terminus of the alpha subunit is required for the expression of the catbca and the pheba operons because rna polymerases with truncated alpha subunits were deficient in activation. further experiments demonstrated the arginine at position 265 and the asparagine at position 268 of the alpha subunit as possible amino acids involved  in activation. on the basis of these and previous results, we propose a model to  explain the interaction of the different regulatory components leading to catr-dependent activation of the catbca operon.

AB  == the ferripyochelin receptor a (fpta) gene codes for the transport of the ferrisiderophore ferripyochelin in pseudomonas aeruginosa. a p. aeruginosa fpta internal fragment was used to probe chromosomal dna from p. aureofaciens, b. cepacia, p. fluorescens, p. putida, and five strains of p.aeruginosa. these bacteria all contained dna that hybridized to the fpta fragment. four of the five p. aeruginosa strains displayed marked and identical patterns, indicating a high  degree of sequence similarities among these strains. dna from the non-p. aeruginosa bacteria, in contrast, hybridized less to the fpta fragment. pseudomonas aeruginosa and b. cepacia synthesize pyochelin. experiments were performed to confirm p. fluorescens pyochelin synthesis and to determine if pyochelin, cepabactin or salicylic acid were made by p. aureofaciens, p. putida,  and p. fluorescens. only pyochelin was isolated and identified from p. fluorescens. p. aureofaciens and p. putida produced none of these compounds. while all of these bacteria contain chromosomal dna that hybridized to the fpta fragment probe, pyochelin synthesis did not occur in all, indicating that fpta fragment hybridization cannot always be correlated with pyochelin biosynthesis.

AB  == the behaviour of norbornane-type substrates bound to oxidised cytochrome p-450cam (cyp 101) in 60% (w/w) glycerol-containing phosphate buffer was investigated using electronic absorption spectroscopy. the high-pressure dependence study revealed that the value of the spin-state reaction-volume change decreased from -70 to -22.8 cm3/mol with decreasing high-spin state content from 99 to 63%. simultaneously, the values for the enthalpy and entropy determined from the low-temperature dependence of the spin-state transition decreased from 73.7 to 24.3 kj/mol and from 310.4 to 88.9 j/mol k, respectively. under our experimental  conditions the ph-value of the buffer remained at low temperatures and high pressures in the range of ph 7-8, in which no ph-value-induced spin-state conversion occurred. therefore, the secondary effect of the temperature and pressure-induced ph change can be disregarded as being responsible for the observed spin-state transition effects. substrate dissociation constants were determined. from the temperature-jump experiments (297 k to 180 k) we found a higher mobility in the active site for the substrates in the sequence (1r)-camphor, (1s)-camphor, camphane, (1r)- and (1s)-camphorquinone, norcamphor,  and norbornane. our findings can be explained by the incomplete fit of the methyl groups of the norbornane-type substrate to the protein, in particular to the i-helix, predominantly determining the substrate mobility and water accessibility to the protein.

TI  == genetic evidence of separate repressor and activator activities of the xylr regulator of the tol plasmid, pww0, of pseudomonas putida.
AB  == the xylr protein encoded by pww0, the tol (toluene biodegradation) plasmid of pseudomonas putida, activates at a distance the transcription of pu and ps, which are the two sigma(54)-dependent promoters of the plasmid, but it also downregulates its own sigma(70)-promoter, pr, which divergently overlaps the upstream activating sites of ps. all regulatory elements that control pr activity have been faithfully reproduced in escherichia coli, and the basis of the autoregulation of xylr transcription has been examined by monitoring the activity in vivo of different combinations of mutant proteins and promoters in rpon+ and rpon-genetic backgrounds. by using ps/pr regions bearing deleted or offset binding sites for xylr and the sigma(54)-containing rna polymerase, we could show that formation of a nucleoprotein complex involving the polymerase bound to the divergent promoter ps is not required for downregulation of pr. mutant xylr proteins, g268n and a311v (mutated within the ntp-binding region of xylr) or r453h (affected in multimerization), which are unable to activate sigma(54)-dependent transcription from ps, were indistinguishable from the wild-type xylr in their ability to repress a reporter pr-lacz fusion. autoregulation of xylr is therefore due exclusively to the binding of the protein to its target sites at the pr promoter. this allows one to define sensu stricto xylr as a transcriptional repressor, independently of its activator role in other promoters.

AB  == the goal of the next generation of cancer chemotherapy is effective tumor-selectivity. a tumor-selective target with high therapeutic potential is the elevated methionine requirement of tumor cells relative to normal cells. we have termed the elevated requirement for methionine in tumors methionine dependence. to selectively target the methionine dependence of tumors for treatment on a large-scale preclinical and clinical basis, the l-methionine alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase (methioninase, metase) gene from pseudomonas putida has been cloned in escherichia coli using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the metase gene was then ligated into the pt7-7 overexpression plasmid containing the t7 rna polymerase promoter and recloned in e. coli strain  bl21(de3). the pac-1 clone was isolated by its yellow-orange color which is due to high enrichment of the pyridoxal phosphate-containing recombinant methioninase (rmetase) and distinguished rmetase-overproducer from rmetase-negative colonies.  a scale-up production protocol which contained a heat step, two deae sepharose ff ion-exchange, and one acticlean etox endotoxin-affinity chromatography columns has been established. the pac-1 clone produces rmetase at approximately 10% of the total soluble protein and up to 1 g/liter in shake-flask culture. the protocol can produce therapeutic rmetase at the multi-gram level per batch with high yield (> 60%), high purity (> 98%), high stability, and low endotoxin. purified rmetase is stable to lyophilization. the t1/2 of rmetase was 2 h when rmetase was administered by i.v. injection in mice. studies of the antitumor efficacy of rmetase in vitro and in vivo on human tumors xenografted in nude mice demonstrated that all types of human tumors tested including those from lung, colon, kidney, brain, prostate, and melanoma were sensitive to rmetase. in contrast, normal cells were insensitive to rmetase in vitro and correspondingly,  no toxicity was detected in vivo at the effective doses. in conclusion, the overexpression clone and large-scale production protocols for rmetase have enabled rmetase to be used as a tumor-selective therapeutic with broad indication and high promise for effective, low-toxicity human cancer therapy.

AB  == the two-component signal transduction pathways in bacteria use a histidine-aspartate phosphorelay circuit to mediate cellular changes in response  to environmental stimuli. here we describe a novel two-component todst system, which activates expression of the toluene degradation (tod) pathway in pseudomonas putida f1. the tods gene is predicted to encode a sensory hybrid kinase with two unique properties--a basic region leucine zipper dimerization motif at the n terminus and a duplicated histidine kinase motif. evidence from a  synthetic peptide model suggests that tods binds as a dimer to a pseudopalindromic sequence (5'-tgactca), which resembles the recognition sequence of the eukaryotic transcription factors fos and jun. these results provide additional evidence that bacteria and eukaryotes share common regulatory motifs.  the todt gene product, a response regulator, was overproduced as a fusion protein in escherichia coli, and the purified protein was found to bind specifically to a 6-bp palindromic dna structure in the tod control region. the phosphorylated form of todt appears to be the activator of tod structural genes. this is the first report of a two-component system that regulates aromatic metabolism in bacteria.

TI  == a new approach for containment of microorganisms: dual control of streptavidin expression by antisense rna and the t7 transcription system.
AB  == the use of microorganisms in the open environment would be of less concern if they were endowed with programmed self-destruction mechanisms. here, we propose a new genetic design to increase the effectiveness of cell suicide systems. it ensures very tight control of the derepression of cell death by the combination of the bacteriophage t7 rna polymerase-lysozyme system and an inducible synthesis of antisense rna and the escherichia coli laci repressor. functionality of this regulatory concept was tested by applying it to containment of gram-negative bacteria, based on the conditional expression of the lethal streptomyces avidinii streptavidin gene. toxicity of streptavidin is derived from its exceptionally high binding affinity for an essential prosthetic group, d-biotin. the entire construct was designed to allow the soil bacterium pseudomonas putida to survive  only in the presence of aromatic hydrocarbons and their derivatives which it can  degrade. under favorable growth conditions, clones escaping killing appeared at frequencies of only 10(-7)-10(-8) per cell per generation. the general requirement for biotin through the living world should make streptavidin-based conditional lethal designs applicable to a broad range of containment strategies.

TI  == mechanisms for solvent tolerance in bacteria.
AB  == the development of tolerance in pseudomonas putida dot-t1 to toluene and related  highly toxic compounds involves short- and long-term responses. the short-term response is based on an increase in the rigidity of the cell membrane by rapid transformation of the fatty acid cis-9,10-methylene hexadecanoic acid (c17:cyclopropane) to unsaturated 9-cis-hexadecenoic acid (c16:1,9 cis) and subsequent transformation to the trans isomer. the long-term response involves in addition to the changes in fatty acids, alterations in the level of the phospholipid polar head groups: cardiolipin increases and phosphatidylethanolamine decreases. the two alterations lead to increased cell membrane rigidity and should be regarded as physical mechanisms that prevent solvent penetrance. biochemical mechanisms that decrease the concentration of toluene in the cell membrane also take place and involve: (i) a solvent exclusion system and (ii) metabolic removal of toluene via oxidation. mutants unable to carry out cis --> trans isomerization of unsaturated lipids, that exhibit altered cell envelopes because of the lack of the oprl protein, or that are unable to exclude toluene from cell membranes are hypersensitive to toluene.

TI  == construction and use of a versatile set of broad-host-range cloning and expression vectors based on the rk2 replicon.
AB  == the plasmid vectors described in this report are derived from the broad-host-range rk2 replicon and can be maintained in many gram-negative bacterial species. the complete nucleotide sequences of all of the cloning and expression vectors are known. important characteristics of the cloning vectors are as follows: a size range of 4.8 to 7.1 kb, unique cloning sites, different antibiotic resistance markers for selection of plasmid-containing cells, orit-mediated conjugative plasmid transfer, plasmid stabilization functions, and  a means for a simple method for modification of plasmid copy number. expression vectors were constructed by insertion of the inducible pu or pm promoter together with its regulatory gene xylr or xyls, respectively, from the tol plasmid of pseudomonas putida. one of these vectors was used in an analysis of the correlation between phosphoglucomutase activity and amylose accumulation in escherichia coli. the experiments showed that amylose synthesis was only marginally affected by the level of basal expression from the pm promoter of the  acetobacter xylinum phosphoglucomutase gene (celb). in contrast, amylose accumulation was strongly reduced when transcription from pm was induced. celb was also expressed with a very high induction ratio in xanthomonas campestris. these experiments showed that the a. xylinum celb gene could not complement the role of the bifunctional x. campestris phosphoglucomutase-phosphomannomutase gene in xanthan biosynthesis. we believe that the vectors described here are useful for cloning experiments, gene expression, and physiological studies with a wide range of bacteria and presumably also for analysis of gene transfer in the environment.

TI  == neisseria meningitidis tonb, exbb, and exbd genes: ton-dependent utilization of protein-bound iron in neisseriae.
AB  == we have recently cloned and characterized the hemoglobin (hb) receptor gene, hmbr, from neisseria meningitidis. to identify additional proteins that are involved in hb utilization, the n. meningitidis hb utilization system was reconstituted in escherichia coli. five cosmids from n. meningitidis dna library  enabled a heme-requiring (hema), hmbr-expressing mutant of e. coli to use hb as both porphyrin and iron source. nucleotide sequence analysis of dna fragments subcloned from the hb-complementing cosmids identified four open reading frames,  three of them homologous to pseudomonas putida, e. coli, and haemophilus influenzae exbb, exbd, and tonb genes. the n. meningitidis tonb protein is 28.8 to 33.6% identical to other gram-negative tonb proteins, while the n. meningitidis exbd protein shares between 23.3 and 34.3% identical amino acids with other exbd and tolr proteins. the n. meningitidis exbb protein was 24.7 to 36.1% homologous with other gram-negative exbb and tolq proteins. complementation studies indicated that the neisserial ton system cannot interact with the e. coli fhua tonb-dependent outer membrane receptor. the n. meningitidis tonb mutant was  unable to use hb, hb-haptoglobin complexes, transferrin, and lactoferrin as iron  sources. insertion of an antibiotic cassette in the 3' end of the exbd gene produced a leaky phenotype. efficient usage of heme by n. meningitidis tonb and exbd mutants suggests the existence of a ton-independent heme utilization mechanism. e. coli complementation studies and the analysis of n. meningitidis hmbr and hpu mutants suggested the existence of another hb utilization mechanism  in this organism.

AB  == a xyle-icec transcriptional fusion was created by ligatinga dna fragment harboring the cloned xyle structural gene from the tol plasmid of pseudomonas putida mt-2 into the cloned icec gene of pseudomonas syringae cit7. this fusion construct was integrated into the chromosome of pseudomonas syringae cit7 by homologous recombination. both cis-merodiploid strain cit7m17 and marker exchange strain cit7h69 produced the xyle gene product, catechol2,3-dioxygenase. strain cit7m17, in which xyle was influenced by transcription initiated by the amp promoter on pbr322, exhibited xyle activity in stationary phase at levels about 45 times higher than strain cit7h69, permitting detection of 10(7) cit7m17 cells  in the spectrophotometric assay and 10(3) cells in hplc measurements. the stability of xyle in both cit7m17 and cit7h69 was compared with maintenance of xyle in several plasmid-borne constructs in p.aeruginosa, erwinia herbicola, and  escherichia coli. only the xyle-icec fusion in the chromosome of cit7h69 and cit7m17was stable in plate assays over the course of these studies. even though strain cit7h69 stably expressed xyle, the low level of expression precludes its use in direct spectrophotometric or hplc assays as a means for detecting cells in environmental samples. however, expression of xylein cit7h69 is sufficient for identification of colonies harboring this marker gene which is useful in laboratory plate assays, and as a marker gene system for the detection of environmentally-competent strains chromosomally taggedwith xyle for use in autecological studies.

TI  == improved broad-host-range rk2 vectors useful for high and low regulated gene expression levels in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == this report describes the construction and use of improved broad-host-range expression vectors based on the previously constructed pjb137 and pjb653 plasmids (blatny et al., 1997). these vectors contain the minimal replicon of rk2 and the  inducible pu or pm promoters together with their regulatory xylr or xyls genes, respectively, from the pseudomonas putida tol plasmid pwwo. a set of atg vectors  were derived from pjb653, and these vectors are characterized by the relatively small size, the presence of multiple cloning sites downstream of pm, the establishment of their nucleotide sequence, the presence of rk2 orit, and different antibiotic selection markers. the copy numbers of all the vectors can easily be modified by using copy-up mutations of the trfa gene, required for initiation of replication of rk2 replicons. the vectors were used to study the expression levels of the acetobacter xylinum phosphoglucomutase gene celb and the two commonly used reporter genes luc and cat in escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and xanthomonas campestris. good induction properties and tight regulation of pm were achieved in all three species tested, and higher gene expression levels were obtained by using the atg vectors compared to pjb653. by introducing different trfa copy-up mutations into the vectors, a wide range of gene expression levels from pu and pm were obtained in e. coli. induced expression levels of luc, cat, and celb from pm were found to be comparable to or higher than those from the ptrc and pt7 promoters located on high copy number plasmids. the induced levels of luc activity were higher in p. aeruginosa than in e. coli, indicating that these vectors may be useful for maximization of gene expression in strains other than e. coli. we believe that the well-characterized  vectors described here are useful for gene expression studies and routine cloning experiments in many gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == xyluw, two genes at the start of the upper pathway operon of tol plasmid pww0, appear to play no essential part in determining its catabolic phenotype.
AB  == the upper pathway operon of the toluene catabolic pathway of tol plasmid pww0 was shown to carry two open reading frames between the start of transcription and xylc (encoding benzaldehyde dehydrogenase), the first previously reported gene of the operon. these were designated xyluw: xylu encoded a protein of 131 amino acid residues (m(r) 14,244) which bore no relationship with any protein in the databases, and xylw encoded a protein of 348 residues (m(r) 36,992) which was strongly homologous to other long-chain zn-containing alcohol dehydrogenases. extracts of escherichia coli carrying xyluw in expression vector ptrc99a contained a novel protein corresponding to xylw, but no nad(+)-dependent dehydrogenase activity against benzyl alcohol, mandelate or bezylamine. a mini-tn5 transposon carrying the meta pathway operon was constructed and from it  two strains of pseudomonas putida were constructed with the normally plasmid-encoded catabolic operons integrated into the chromosome. three derivatives of plasmid pkng101 containing modified xyluw genes were constructed,  two of which had frameshifts in xylu and xylw, respectively, and a third with a deletion from the 3' end of xylu into the 5' end of xylw. the wild-type genes of  the two pseudomonas strains were substituted by the mutant alleles by reverse genetics. the ability of the constructed mutant strains to utilize the aromatic substrates of the tol pathway was not significantly affected.

AB  == a 9,233-bp hindiii fragment of the aromatic amine catabolic plasmid ptdn1, isolated from a derivative of pseudomonas putida mt-2 (ucc22), confers the ability to degrade aniline on p. putida kt2442. the fragment encodes six open reading frames which are arranged in the same direction. their 5' upstream region is part of the direct-repeat sequence of ptdn1. nucleotide sequence of 1.8 kb of  the repeat sequence revealed only a single base pair change compared to the known sequence of is1071 which is involved in the transposition of the chlorobenzoate genes (c. nakatsu, j. ng, r. singh, n. straus, and c. wyndham, proc. natl. acad.  sci. usa 88:8312-8316, 1991). four open reading frames encode proteins with considerable homology to proteins found in other aromatic-compound degradation pathways. on the basis of sequence similarity, these genes are proposed to encode the large and small subunits of aniline oxygenase (tdna1 and tdna2, respectively), a reductase (tdnb), and a lysr-type regulatory gene (tdnr). the putative large subunit has a conserved [2fe-2s]r rieske-type ligand center. two genes, tdnq and tdnt, which may be involved in amino group transfer, are localized upstream of the putative oxygenase genes. the tdnq gene product shares  about 30% similarity with glutamine synthetases; however, a puc-based plasmid carrying tdnq did not support the growth of an escherichia coli glna strain in the absence of glutamine. tdnt possesses domains that are conserved among amidotransferases. the tdnq, tdna1, tdna2, tdnb, and tdnr genes are essential for the conversion of aniline to catechol.

AB  == the gene encoding phenylacetyl-coa ligase (pcl), the first enzyme of the pathway  involved in the aerobic catabolism of phenylacetic acid in pseudomonas putida u,  has been cloned, sequenced, and expressed in two different microbes. in both, the primary structure of the protein was studied, and after genetic manipulation, different recombinant proteins were analyzed. the pcl gene, which was isolated from p. putida u by mutagenesis with the transposon tn5, encodes a 48-kda protein corresponding to the phenylacetyl-coa ligase previously purified by us (martinez-blanco, h., reglero, a. rodriguez-aparicio, l. b., and luengo, j. m. (1990) j. biol. chem. 265, 7084-7090). expression of the pcl gene in escherichia  coli leads to the appearance of this enzymatic activity, and cloning and expression of a 10.5-kb dna fragment containing this gene confer this bacterium with the ability to grow in chemically defined medium containing phenylacetic acid as the sole carbon source. the appearance of phenylacetyl-coa ligase activity in all of the strains of the fungus penicillium chrysogenum transformed  with a construction bearing this gene was directly related to a significant increase in the quantities of benzylpenicillin accumulated in the broths (between 1.8- and 2.2-fold higher), indicating that expression of this bacterial gene (pcl) helps to increase the pool of a direct biosynthetic precursor, phenylacetyl-coa. this report describes the sequence of a phenylacetyl-coa ligase for the first time and provides direct evidence that the expression in p. chrysogenum of a heterologous protein (involved in the catabolism of a penicillin precursor) is a useful strategy for improving the biosynthetic machinery of this  fungus.

AB  == 5-oxoprolinase (ec 3.5.2) catalyzes a reaction in which the endergonic cleavage of 5-oxo-l-proline to form l-glutamate is coupled to the exergonic hydrolysis of  atp to adp and inorganic phosphate. highly purified preparations of the enzyme have been obtained from rat kidney and pseudomonas putida. the rat kidney enzyme  is composed of two strongly interacting, apparently identical subunits (mr = 142,000), whereas that from p. putida is composed of two functionally different protein components that can readily be dissociated. here we report the cloning of rat kidney 5-oxoprolinase with preliminary expression studies. cdna clones encoding the enzyme were isolated by screening a lambdagt11 cdna library beginning with a degenerate oligonucleotide probe based on peptide sequence data  obtained from the purified enzyme. the whole cdna clone was completed by amplifying its 5' end from a premade library of rat kidney marathon-readytm cdnas using polymerase chain reaction methodology. the composite cdna (4,016 bases) revealed an uninterrupted open reading frame encoding 1,288 amino acid residues (mr = 137,759). the deduced amino acid sequence contains all four of the peptide  sequences that were independently found in peptide fragments derived from the enzyme. expression of the full-length clone in escherichia coli yielded a product of the same size as the rat kidney enzyme and which reacted with antibodies directed against the rat kidney enzyme. the predicted amino acid sequence is almost 50% identical throughout its entire length to that of a hypothetical yeast protein ykl215c. it is also 26% identical in half its length to the bacterial hydantoinase hyua and 26% identical in the other half to the bacterial hydantoinase hyub. the results suggest unexpected evolutionary relationships among the hydantoinases and rat kidney 5-oxoprolinase which share the common property of hydrolyzing the imide bond of 5-membered rings but which do not all require atp.

TI  == phhr, a divergently transcribed activator of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene cluster of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa was recently found to possess a cluster of structural genes encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (phha), carbinolamine dehydratase (phhb), and aromatic aminotransferase (phhc). we now report the presence, in the  flanking upstream region, of a divergently transcribed gene (phhr) encoding an activator protein. inactivation of phhr markedly reduced expression of the structural genes. phhr belongs to the large prokaryote family of sigma 54 enhancer-binding proteins, and activation of the phh operon by phhr in p. aeruginosa required rpon. the closest homologues of phhr are the tyrr proteins from escherichia coli and haemophilus influenzae. e. coli tyrr is an unusual member of the homologue family in that the transcriptional units regulated by tyrr are driven by sigma 70 promoters. p. aeruginosa phhr was able to replace e.  coli tyrr as a repressor of the arof-tyra operon (but not as an activator of mtr) in the heterologous e. coli system. two regions that resemble e. coli tyrr boxes  were identified in the intervening region between phhr and phha. we propose that  one or both boxes may be the target of phhr acting as an autogenous repressor at  a sigma 70 promoter in one direction. in the other direction, one or both boxes may be the upstream activator sequence targeted by phhr to facilitate expression  of the phh operon from a sigma 54 promoter. the phh operon was strongly induced in fructose- or glucose-based minimal medium by l-phenylalanine. inactivation of  phhr in p. aeruginosa abolished ability to utilize either l-phenylalanine or l-tyrosine as a sole source of carbon for growth.

TI  == biosynthesis of synthons in two-liquid-phase media.
AB  == the pseudomonas oleovorans alkane hydroxylase and xylene oxygenase from pseudomonas putida are versatile mono-oxygenases for stereo- and regioselective oxidation of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. pseudomonas oleovorans and alkanol dehydrogenase deficient mutants of pseudomonas have previously been used  to produce alkanols from various alkanes and optically active epoxides from alkenes. similarly, p. putida strains have been used to produce aromatic alcohols, aromatic acids, and optically active styrene oxides. a limitation in the use of pseudomonas strains for bioconversions is that these strains can degrade some of the products formed. to counter this problem, we have constructed escherichia coli recombinants, which contain the alk genes from the oct plasmid of p. oleovorans [e. coli hb101 (pgec47)] and the xylma genes from the tol plasmid of p. putida mt-2 [e. coli hb101 (pgb63)], encoding alkane hydroxylase and xylene oxygenase, respectively. escherichia coli hb101 (pgec47) was used to produce octanoic acid from n-octane and e. coli hb101 (pbg63) was put to use for  the oxidation of styrene to styrene oxide in two-liquid phase biocatalysis at high cell densities. the alk(+) recombinant strain e. coli hb101 (pgec47) was grown to 40 g/l cell dry mass in the presence of n-octane, which was converted to octanoic acid by the alkane oxidation system, the product accumulating in the aqueous phase. the xyl(+) recombinant e. coli hb101 (pbg63) was grown to a cell density of 26 g/l cell dry mass in the presence of around 7% (v/v) n-dodecane, which contained 2% (v/v) styrene. the recombinant e. coli (xyl(+)) converted styrene to (s)-(+)-styrene oxide at high enantiomeric excess (94% ee) and this compound partitioned almost exclusively into the organic phase. using these high-cell-density two-liquid-phase cultures, the products accumulated rapidly, yielding high concentrations of products (50 mm octanoic acid and 90 mm styrene oxide) in the respective phases.

TI  == transcriptional regulation of the rhodococcus rhodochrous j1 nita gene encoding a nitrilase.
AB  == the 1.4-kb downstream region from a nitrilase gene (nita) of an actinomycete rhodococcus rhodochrous j1, which is industrially in use, was found to be required for the isovaleronitrile-dependent induction of nitrilase synthesis in experiments using a rhodococcus-escherichia coli shuttle vector pk4 in a rhodococcus strain. sequence analysis of the 1.4-kb region revealed the existence of an open reading frame (nitr) of 957 bp, which would encode a protein with a molecular mass of 35,100. deletion of the central and 3'-terminal portion of nitr resulted in the complete loss of nitrilase activity, demonstrating that nitr codes for a transcriptional positive regulator in nita expression. the deduced amino acid sequence of nitr showed similarity to a positive regulator family including xyls from pseudomonas putida and arac from e. coli. by northern blot analysis, the 1.4-kb transcripts for nita were detected in r. rhodochrous j1 cells cultured in the presence of isovaleronitrile, but not those cultured in the absence of isovaleronitrile. the transcriptional start site for nita was mapped to a c residue located 26 bp upstream of its translational start site. deletion analysis to define the nita promoter region suggested the possible participation  of an inverted repeat sequence, centered on base pair -52, in induction of nita transcription.

TI  == cloning of the genes for and characterization of the early stages of toluene and  o-xylene catabolism in pseudomonas stutzeri ox1.
AB  == in order to study the toluene and o-xylene catabolic genes of pseudomonas stutzeri ox1, a genomic library was constructed. a 28-kb ecori restriction endonuclease dna fragment, cloned into the vector plasmid plafr1 and designated pfb3401, permitted pseudomonas putida paw340 to convert toluene and o-xylene into the corresponding meta-ring fission products. physical and functional endonuclease restriction maps have been derived from the cloned dna fragment. further subcloning into and deletion analysis in the escherichia coli vector pgem-3z allowed the genes for the conversion of toluene or o-xylene into the corresponding catechols to be mapped within a 6-kb region of the pfb3401 insert and their direction of transcription to be determined. following exposure to toluene, e. coli cells carrying this 6-kb region produce a mixture of o-cresol, m-cresol, and p-cresol, which are further converted to 3-methylcatechol and 4-methylcatechol. similarly, a mixture of 2,3-dimethylphenol and 3,4-dimethylphenol, further converted into dimethylcatechols, was detected after  exposure to o-xylene. the enzyme involved in the first step of toluene and o-xylene degradation exhibited a broad substrate specificity, being able to oxidize also benzene, ethylbenzene, m-xylene, p-xylene, styrene, and naphthalene. deletions of the 6-kb region which affect the ability to convert toluene or o-xylene into the corresponding methylphenols compromise also their further oxidation to methylcatechols. this suggests that a single enzyme system could be  involved in both steps of the early stages of toluene and o-xylene catabolism.

TI  == characterization of an oprl null mutant of pseudomonas putida.
AB  == a pseudomonas putida oprl null mutant was generated with reverse genetics by using an in vitro-truncated oprl::xyle construct and in vivo allelic exchange. the nature of the mutation introduced in p. putida was confirmed by southern blotting. western blots (immunoblots) of peptidoglycan-associated proteins revealed that the oprl protein was not made in the mutant strain, whereas it was  detectable as a 19-kda band in protein preparations of the wild-type strain. the  p. putida oprl, mutant exhibited altered cell morphology as revealed by electron  microscopy and was more sensitive to sodium dodecyl sulfate, deoxycholate, and edta than the wild-type strain. the oprl gene was conserved in a wide variety of  the pseudomonas strains belonging to rrna group i, which suggests that this gene  is important for the maintenance of the cell envelope and cell morphology in this group of microorganisms.

TI  == the nucleotide sequence of the pseudomonas aeruginosa pyre-crc-rph region and the purification of the crc gene product.
AB  == the gene (crc) responsible for catabolite repression control in pseudomonas aeruginosa has been cloned and sequenced. flanking the crc gene are genes encoding orotate phosphoribosyl transferase (pyre) and rnase ph (rph). new crc mutants were constructed by disruption of the wild-type crc gene. the crc gene encodes an open reading frame of 259 amino acids with homology to the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease family of dna repair enzymes. however, crc mutants do not have a dna repair phenotype, nor can the crc gene complement escherichia coli dna repair-deficient strains. the crc gene product was overexpressed in both p. aeruginosa and in e. coli, and the crc protein was purified from both. the purified crc proteins show neither apurinic/apyrimidinic  endonuclease nor exonuclease activity. antibody to the purified crc protein reacted with proteins of similar size in crude extracts from pseudomonas putida and pseudomonas fluorescens, suggesting a common mechanism of catabolite repression in these three species.

TI  == characterization and expression of the plasmid-borne bedd gene from pseudomonas putida ml2, which codes for a nad+-dependent cis-benzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase.
AB  == the catabolic plasmid phmt112 in pseudomonas putida ml2 contains the bed gene cluster encoding benzene dioxygenase (bedc1c2ba) and a nad+-dependent dehydrogenase (bedd) required to convert benzene into catechol. analysis of the nucleotide sequence upstream of the benzene dioxygenase gene cluster (bedc1c2ba)  revealed a 1,098-bp open reading frame (bedd) flanked by two 42-bp direct repeats, each containing a 14-bp sequence identical to the inverted repeat of is26. in vitro translation analysis showed bedd to code for a polypeptide of ca.  39 kda. both the nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences show significant identity to sequences of glycerol dehydrogenases from escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, and bacillus stearothermophilus. a bedd mutant of p. putida ml2 in which the gene was disrupted by a kanamycin resistance cassette was unable to utilize benzene for growth. the bedd gene product was found to complement the  todd mutation in p. putida 39/d, the latter defective in the analogous cis-toluene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase. the dehydrogenase encoded by bedd) was overexpressed in escherichia coli and purified. it was found to utilize nad+ as an electron acceptor and exhibited higher substrate specificity for cis-benzene dihydrodiol and 1,2-propanediol compared with glycerol. such a medium-chain dehydrogenase is the first to be reported for a pseudomonas species, and its association with an aromatic ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase is unique among bacterial species capable of metabolizing aromatic hydrocarbons.

TI  == construction and use of recombinant escherichia coli strains for the synthesis of toluene cis-glycol.
AB  == the toluene dioxygenase genes derived from pseudomonas putida ncimb 11767 were subcloned from a previously constructed recombinant plasmid, pig, using puc18 as  the cloning vector and e. coli tg2 as the host strain. the resulting strain, e. coli tg2 (p1/1), produced toluene cis-glycol when grown in lb broth or minimal medium in the presence of toluene. restriction mapping and partial dna sequencing provided evidence for the presence of orfs with extensive homology to parts of the tod operon from p. putida f1. the clones exhibited some residual toluene cis-glycol dehydrogenase activity which resulted in the formation of small amounts of 3-methylcatechol. expression of the dioxygenase was induced by toluene, but was not directed by the lac promoter within the cloning vector. the  clones were assessed for toluene cis-glycol production in ph-controlled batch cultures, and the maximum product concentration obtained was 1.02 g l-1. product  formation was dependent upon the presence of glucose in the culture medium. although the substrate was toxic, the biotransformation was apparently limited by the supply of toluene. the results suggest that it should be possible to improve  toluene cis-glycol production by recombinants substantially by improving both the strain and fermentation process.

TI  == optimization of trichloroethylene degradation using soluble methane monooxygenase of methylosinus trichosporium ob3b expressed in recombinant bacteria.
AB  == by complementing cell-free extracts of pseudomonas putida f1/psmmo20 with purified soluble methane monooxygenase (smmo) components of methylosinus trichosporium ob3b, the low cloned-gene smmo activity in the recombinant strain was found to be due to incomplete activity of the hydroxylase component. to address this incomplete activity, additional smmo-expressing strains were formed  by transferring mmo-containing psmmo20 and psmmo50 into various bacterial species including pseudomonads and alpha-2 subdivision strains such as methanotrophs, methylotrophs, agrobacterium tumefaciens a114, and rhizobium meliloti 102f34 (11  new strains screened); smmo activity was detected in the last two strains. to increase plasmid segregational stability, the hok/sok locus originally from escherichia coli plasmid r1 was inserted downstream of the mmo locus of psmmo20 (resulting in psmmo40) and found to enhance plasmid stability in p. putida f1 and r. meliloti 102f34 (first report of hok/sok in rhizobium). to further increase smmo activity, a modified whittenbury minimal medium was selected from various minimal and complex media based on trichloroethylene (tce) degradation and growth rates and was improved by removing the smmo-inhibiting metal ions [cu(ii), ni(ii), and zn(ii)] and chloramphenicol from the medium and by supplementing with an iron source (3.6 microm of ferrous ammonium sulfate). using chemostat-grown p. putida f1/psmmo40, it was found that smmo activity was higher for cells grown at  higher dilution rates. these optimization efforts resulted in a twofold increase  in the extent of tce degradation and more consistent smmo activity.

TI  == a stringently controlled expression system for analysing lateral gene transfer between bacteria.
AB  == the lateral transfer of genetic information among microorganisms is a major force driving the outstanding adaptability of microbial communities to environmental changes. until now little information has been obtained on gene transfer in natural ecosystems. we present here a genetic circuit for detecting and quantifying horizontal gene transfer from a defined donor microorganism to recipient organisms in the absence of selection for a recipient-specific phenotype. the system consists of an engineered lacz (encoding beta-galactosidase) reporter gene whose expression is controlled by a synthetic regulatory element based on a fusion between the pr promoter-operator from lambda bacteriophage and the 5' non-coding leader region of the inp gene encoding the is 10 transposase function. expression of this reporter cassette in the recombinant  microorganism is completely shut down by two chromosomally encoded trans-acting repressors working at the level of transcription (the cl-ek117 protein from the lambda phage), and at the level of translation (the antisense rna-out of the is 10 element). when the reporter element is transferred to a different host by any  mechanism, it escapes repression and becomes expressed. the system was validated  with pseudo-monas putida, and conjugational transfer frequencies of the reporter  element as low as 10(-6) were detected. the modular design and broad host range of the genetic circuit, in combination with biomarkers which permit real-time in  situ detection, will facilitate the monitor-ing of gene flow in a non-disruptive  manner within the environment.

AB  == bkdr is the transcriptional activator of the bkd operon of pseudomonas putida, which encodes branched chain keto acid dehydrogenase. bkdr binds to a large region of dna between its own structural gene and the first gene of the bkd operon. the object of the present studies was to determine the stoichiometry of binding as part of an effort to understand the action of bkdr in regulation of the bkd operon. [35s]bkdr was prepared and found to be essentially 100% active in the gel shift assay. only one complex was formed under all the conditions used. the stoichiometry of bkdr binding to its specific substrate dna was three tetramers per mold substrate dna. l-valine did not affect the stoichiometry although this ligand was previously shown to affect the dnase i protection pattern. the addition of nonspecific dna to the incubation mixture also did not affect this stoichiometry.

TI  == comparison of the "rieske" [2fe-2s] center in the bc1 complex and in bacterial dioxygenases by circular dichroism spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry.
AB  == two different types of "rieske" [2fe-2s] clusters have been observed in proteins, one in the bc complexes of the respiratory chain and the other in bacterial dioxygenases. we have compared the circular dichroic (cd) spectra and redox properties of the water soluble fragment of the rieske center of the bovine heart mitochondrial bc1 complex (isf) and of the ferredoxin from benzene dioxygenase in pseudomonas putida ml2 (fdbed). spinach ferredoxin was also measured for comparison. the redox potential of both proteins could be determined in solution  by cyclic voltammetry (cv) and by cd-monitored spectroelectrochemistry using a specially constructed optically transparent thin layer (ottle) cell. whereas the  redox potential of the isf (+312 +/- 5 mv at ph 7.0) depended both on the ph above ph 7 and on the ionic strength, the redox potential of the fdbed (-155 +/-  5 mv at ph 7.0) was observed to be independent of ph and ionic strength. the isf  showed a marked dependence of its redox potential on temperature, while the fdbed showed no temperature dependence. the entropy of the redox reaction delta s degrees rc was calculated as -88 +/- 11 j k-1 mol-1 for the bc1 rieske center and approximately 0 j k-1 mol-1 for the fdbed. the cd spectra of rieske type clusters are significantly different from those of plant type [2fe-2s] ferredoxins. a strong negative cd band is present at 20 000 cm-1 (500 nm) in all reduced rieske  clusters. the possible assignment of this band is discussed as arising from the highest energy magnetically allowed d --> d transition (dz2 --> dxz) of the feii  site. if so, this band is highly indicative of the distortion of the ligand field of the feii site.

TI  == tol plasmid transcription factor xyls binds specifically to the pm operator sequence.
AB  == xyls, an arac family transcription factor, positively regulates transcription of  pseudomonas putida tol plasmid meta operon from the pm promoter. a tandem of 15 bp homologous direct repeats, separated by 6 bp and overlapping with the -35 hexamer of the promoter, is required for the activation of pm by xyls in vivo. in this study we have characterized specific binding of xyls to the pm operator om.  xyls was overexpressed with an epitope tag in its n-terminus. tagged xyls (n-xyls) was immunopurified and was shown to specifically bind to om. we have used matrix-bound n-xyls in dna footprinting and methylation interference experiments. binding of n-xyls protects 44 bp in the om region on both strands from dnase i digestion and generates hypersensitive sites (within the protected area) which lie on the same face of the dna helix. results of hydroxyl radical footprinting and methylation interference assays indicate that xyls binds along one side of the dna and covers four helical turns. the protein has base-specific  contacts in four adjacent major groove regions on the same helical face. our data are in accord with the prediction of the presence of two separate dna-binding units in an xyls molecule which are involved in base-specific contacts in two adjacent major-groove regions of a half-site. the direct repeat arrangement of the binding site and the mode of dna binding of xyls are similar to the arrangement of recognition sites and the dna contact pattern of arac protein from escherichia coli.

AB  == in the presence of m-xylene, the protein xylr encoded by the tol plasmid of pseudomonas putida, activates the final sigma54-dependent promoter pu. early activation stages involve the release of the intramolecular repression caused by  the signal reception n-terminal (a domain) of xylr on the central module of the protein. a genetic approach has been followed to locate the specific segment within a domain of xylr that is directly responsible for its down-regulation in the absence of inducer, as compared to that involved in effector (m-xylene) binding. for this, a reporter escherichia coli strain carrying a monocopy transcriptional fusion of pu to lacz was transformed with a collection of plasmids encoding equivalent truncated varieties of xylr, consisting of nested and internal deletions throughout the entire a domain. examination of the resulting phenotypes allowed the assignment of the a domain region near the central activation domain, as the portion of the protein responsible for the specific repression of xylr activity in the absence of m-xylene.

TI  == untranslated sequence upstream of mara in the multiple antibiotic resistance locus of escherichia coli is related to the effector-binding domain of the xyls transcriptional activator.
AB  == mara, the 129-amino-acid (aa) protein which plays a crucial role in the multiple  antibiotic resistance (mar) phenotype in escherichia coli, shows homology to members of the xyls/arac family of transcriptional regulators. although these proteins vary in size from around 100 to 350 aa they all contain a dna-binding domain with a helix-turn-helix motif. the larger ones, e.g., xyls, arac, and rob, contain an additional domain either at their amino- or at their carboxyterminus.  this domain is important for effector-binding or dimerization or of unknown function. mara consists only of the dna-binding component. nevertheless, a sequence with a coding potential of 141 aa upstream of its atg start-codon showed 20.5-26.9% aa identity with the corresponding section within the effector-binding domain of xyls from the tol plasmid of pseudomonas putida when translated in the  same reading frame as mara. however, the reading frame was interrupted by 11 translational stops. in another frame, this upstream sequence actually codes for  a real protein, marr, that is completely unrelated to xyls. implications for the  putative evolution of regulatory proteins through translocation of domains followed by adaptation are discussed.

AB  == previously we have shown that flagella and the o-specific polysaccharide of lipopolysaccharide play a role in colonization of the potato root by plant growth-promoting pseudomonas strains wcs374 and wcs358. in this paper, we describe a novel cell surface-exposed structure in pseudomonas putida wcs358 examined with a specific monoclonal antibody. this cell surface structure appeared to be a polysaccharide, which was accessible to the monoclonal antibody  at the outer cell surface. further study revealed that it does not contain 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate, heptose, or lipid a, indicating that it is not a second type of lipopolysaccharide. instead, the polysaccharide shared some characteristics with k antigen described for escherichia coli. from a series of 49 different soil bacteria tested, only one other potato plant growth-promoting pseudomonas strain reacted positively with the monoclonal antibody. mutant cells  lacking the novel antigen were efficiently isolated by an enrichment method involving magnetic antibodies. mutant strains defective in the novel antigen contained normal lipopolysaccharide. one of these mutants was affected in neither its ability to adhere to sterile potato root pieces nor its ability to colonize potato roots. we conclude that the bacterial cell surface of p. putida wcs358 contains at least two different polysaccharide structures. these are the o-specific polysaccharide of lipopolysaccharide, which is relevant for potato root colonization, and the novel polysaccharide, which is not involved in adhesion to or colonization of the potato root.

TI  == use of an ipb-lux fusion to study regulation of the isopropylbenzene catabolism operon of pseudomonas putida re204 and to detect hydrophobic pollutants in the environment.
AB  == a dna segment involved in the regulation of the isopropylbenzene (cumene) catabolism operon (ipb) of plasmid pre4 from pseudomonas putida re204 and the vibrio fischeri luciferase genes, luxcdabe, were used to create an ipbro/pa(prm1)-luxcdabe reporter fusion plasmid, pos25. escherichia coli hms174(pos25) produces light in the presence of inducers of the ipb operon. these inducers were shown to be hydrophobic compounds and to include monoalkylbenzenes, substituted benzenes and toluenes, some alkanes and cycloalkanes, chlorinated solvents, and naphthalenes. complex hydrocarbon mixtures, such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuels (jp-4 and jp-5), and creosote, were also inducers of ipb-lux. bacteria carrying the ipb-lux reporter may be useful as bioindicators of hydrocarbon pollution in the environment and may be particularly valuable for examining the bioavailability of inducing pollutants.

TI  == identification of tonb homologs in the family enterobacteriaceae and evidence for conservation of tonb-dependent energy transduction complexes.
AB  == the transport of fe(iii)-siderophore complexes and vitamin b12 across the outer membrane of escherichia coli requires the tonb-dependent energy transduction system. a set of murine monoclonal antibodies (mabs) was generated against an e.  coli trpc-tonb fusion protein to facilitate structure and function studies. in the present study, the epitopes recognized by these mabs were mapped, and their distribution in gram-negative organisms was examined. cross-species reactivity patterns obtained against tonb homologs of known sequence were used to refine epitope mapping, with some epitopes ultimately confirmed by inhibition experiments using synthetic polypeptides. epitopes recognized by this set of mabs were conserved in tonb homologs for 9 of 12 species in the family enterobacteriaceae (including e. coli), including previously unidentified tonb homologs in shigella, citrobacter, proteus, and kluyvera species. these homologs  were also detected by a polyclonal alpha-trpc-tonb serum that additionally recognized the known yersinia enterocolitica tonb homolog and a putative tonb homolog in edwardsiella tarda. these antibody preparations failed to detect the known tonb homologs of either pseudomonas putida or haemophilus influenzae but did identify potential tonb homologs in several other nonenteric gram-negative species. in vivo chemical cross-linking experiments demonstrated that in addition to tonb, auxiliary components of the tonb-dependent energy transduction system are broadly conserved in members of the family enterobacteriaceae, suggesting that the tonb system represents a common system for high-affinity active transport across the gram-negative outer membrane.

AB  == pseudomonas putida 14g-3, a derivative of the natural soil inhabitant p. putida kt2440, exhibited a chromosomal insertion of a mini-tn5/'phoa transposon that resulted in reduced ability to colonize soil. in vitro characterization of p. putida 14g-3 revealed that it exhibited an altered cell morphology and envelope,  as revealed by electron microscopy. the derived strain was sensitive to sodium dodecyl sulfate, deoxycholate, and edta, produced clumps when it reached high cell densities in the late logarithmic growth phase, and did not grow on low-osmolarity medium. the p. putida dna surrounding the mini-tn5/'phoa insertion was cloned and used as a probe to rescue the wild-type gene, which was sequenced. comparison of the deduced peptide sequence with sequences in the swiss-prot database allowed the knocked-out gene to be identified as that encoding the peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (pal or oprl) of p. putida. the protein was  identified in coupled transcription and translation assays in vitro.

AB  == a 4.64 kb region of the 180 kb heavy metal resistance plasmid pmol28 of alcaligenes eutrophus ch34, previously shown to be able to replicate autonomously, was sequenced and analyzed. three genes involved in plasmid maintenance were identified: para28 and parb28 are involved in plasmid partitioning and stability, while repa28 encodes a protein required for replication. in addition to the par ab28 genes, a third locus, pars28, required in cis active partitioning was identified. the parabs28 locus of pmol28 shows strong similarity in organization to the sop, par and rep regions, respectively,  of the escherichia coli f-factor, the e.coli p1 and p7 prophages and the agrobacterium ptib6s3 and pria4b plasmids. the parab28 proteins of pmol28 also show similarity to the proteins encoded by two conserved open reading frames present in the replication regions of the pseudomonas putida and bacillus subtilis chromosomes. the functionality of the pmol28 par region was examined by  performing stability and incompatibility tests between pmol28 and pmol846 or pmol850 which contain the 4.64 ecori replicon fragment of pmol28, cloned in opposite orientations into psup202, which is itself unable to replicate in a. eutrophus. the repa2 8 replication protein showed similarity to the repl protein  of p1, which is required for lytic replication of this e. coli phage. the replication origin of pmol28, oriv28, seems to be located within the repa28 coding region, and pmol28 replication may depend on transcriptional activation of oriv28.

TI  == the two-step lysis system of pneumococcal bacteriophage ej-1 is functional in gram-negative bacteria: triggering of the major pneumococcal autolysin in escherichia coli.
AB  == the holin function ejh of the pneumococcal bacteriophage ej-1 has been characterized. it shows structural features similar to, and functionally complemented, the prototype member of the holin family. in escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida the ejh product caused cellular death, and changes in cell morphology could be accounted for by lesions in the cytoplasmic membrane. expression of ejh resulted in the inhibition of growth in a variety of phylogenetically distant bacterial genera, suggesting a broad spectrum of action. concomitant expression of the ejh and ejl (encodes a lysin) genes led to lysis of e. coli and p. putida cells. remarkably, the ejl lysin was able to attack murein  from bacteria lacking choline in their sacculi, which suggests that pneumococcal  lysins have a broader substrate specificity than previously assumed. furthermore, the ejh holin was able to trigger activity of the major pneumococcal autolysin cloned and expressed in e. coli, and this raised new questions about the regulation of this model autolysin. a new function for holins in systems where the phage lysin is supposed to be associated with the membrane is proposed.

TI  == involvement of sigma 54 in exponential silencing of the pseudomonas putida tol plasmid pu promoter.
AB  == the sigma 54-dependent pu promoter of the tol plasmid pww0 of pseudomonas putida  becomes activated by the prokaryotic enhancer-binding xyir protein when cells encounter m-xylene in the medium. however, even in the presence of the aromatic inducer, pu activity is silenced in vivo during rapid exponential growth of the cells in rich medium. various elements known to be involved in the control of the transcriptional activity of the promoter were examined to ascertain the mechanism by which expression of pu is limited during the exponential phase of growth. a truncated and fully constitutive xyir derivative deleted of its signal-reception  n-terminal domain was found to be subjected to the same exponential silencing as  the wild-type xyir when exposed to m-xylene. this indicated that the phenomenon is not due to a late activation of xyir by the aromatic effector. a pu variant in which the integration host factor (ihf)-binding site had been functionally replaced by a statically curved dna segment showed the same induction pattern, thus ruling out variations in the intracellular levels of ihf changes during growth as the element responsible for the inactivity of pu in rapidly growing cells. on the contrary, overproduction of the sigma 54 factor allowed pu expression during exponential phase. as sigma 54 protein levels remained approximately constant during growth, the exponential silencing of pu could be caused ultimately by changes in the activity of the factor itself. this effect may not be exclusive to pu, but could be a general co-regulation mechanism in sigma 54-dependent promoters that connects transcription of a specific set of genes with the general physiological status of the cells.

TI  == a transposon for green fluorescent protein transcriptional fusions: application for bacterial transport experiments.
AB  == the movement of bacteria through groundwater is a poorly understood process. factors such as soil porosity and mineralogy, heterogeneity of soil particle size, and response of the bacteria to their environment contribute to the pattern of bacterial flow. the identification of transported bacteria is often a limiting factor in both laboratory and field transport experiments. two bacterial strains  were modified for use in bacterial transport experiments: a strain of escherichia coli harboring the pgfp plasmid and a strain of pseudomonas putida modified with  a tn5 derivative, tn5gfp1. the tn5gfp1 transposon incorporates the gene (gfp) encoding green fluorescent protein (gfp) and can be used to mutagenize gram-bacteria. fluorescent colonies were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) at a concentration of approx. 10(9) bacteria/ml. a 10-cm glass column packed with quartz sand (diameter range 177-250 microns) was equilibrated with pbs prior to the forced flow introduction of the bacteria. collected fractions were analyzed and the bacteria quantitated using a fluorescence spectrometer. results demonstrate that the bacteria can be accurately tracked using their fluorescence, and that the intensity of the signal can be used to determine a c/co ratio for the transported bacteria. the data show a rapid breakthrough of the bacteria followed by a characteristic curve pattern. a lower limit of detection of 10(5) cells was estimated based on these experiments. the tn5gfp1 transposon should become a valuable tool for labeling bacteria.

TI  == nondisruptive detection of activity of catabolic promoters of pseudomonas putida  with an antigenic surface reporter system.
AB  == a simple procedure to detect the switching on and off of catabolic promoters of pseudomonas putida, at the level of single cells based on the immunodetection of  a reporter epitope expressed on the surface of bacterial cells, has been developed. to do this, the antigenic sequence asp-leu-pro-pro-asn-ser-asp-val-val-asp, from a coronavirus, was inserted genetically in the permissive site around amino acid position 153 of the lamb protein (maltose and lambda phage receptor) of escherichia coli. when the hybrid  lamb gene is transcribed, the epitope becomes presented on the surface of the bacterial cells in a configuration available to specific antibodies. to validate  this notion in nonenteric bacteria, the expression and correct processing of lamb were confirmed by coupling the lamb gene to the salicylate-responsive psa1 promoter of the nah7 (naphthalene degradation) plasmid in pseudomonas putida. subsequently, a hybrid lamb gene carrying the sequence of the coronavirus antigen was placed downstream of the m-toluate-responsive pm promoter of the tol (toluene degradation) plasmid. exposure of the epitope on the pseudomonas cell surface was monitored through fluorescence of whole cells treated with a monoclonal antibody  against the heterologous antigen. fluorescence emission was dependent on the presence of m-toluate in the medium, thus permitting detection of the pm promoter switching on by simple optical inspection of individual cells, even in situations when these are a very minor component of a complex bacterial community.

TI  == molecular characterization of the 4-hydroxyphenylacetate catabolic pathway of escherichia coli w: engineering a mobile aromatic degradative cluster.
AB  == we have determined and analyzed the nucleic acid sequence of a 14,855-bp region that contains the complete gene cluster encoding the 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4-hpa) degradative pathway of escherichia coli w (atcc 11105). this catabolic pathway is composed by 11 genes, i.e., 8 enzyme-encoding genes distributed in two putative operons, hpabc (4-hpa hydroxylase operon) and hpagedfhi (meta-cleavage operon); 2 regulatory genes, hpar and hpaa; and the gene, hpax, that encodes a protein related to the superfamily of transmembrane facilitators and appears to be cotranscribed with hpaa. although comparisons with other aromatic catabolic pathways revealed interesting similarities, some of the genes did not present any similarity to their corresponding counterparts in other pathways, suggesting different evolutionary origins. the cluster is flanked by two genes homologous to the esta (carbon starvation protein) and tsr (serine chemoreceptor) genes of e. coli k-12. a detailed genetic analysis of this region has provided a singular example of how e. coli becomes adapted to novel nutritional sources by the recruitment of a catabolic cassette. furthermore, the presence of the pac gene in the proximity of the 4-hpa cluster suggests that the penicillin g acylase was a recent acquisition to improve the ability of e. coli w to metabolize a wider range of substrates, enhancing its catabolic versatility. five repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences that might be involved in transcriptional regulation were found within the cluster. the complete 4-hpa cluster was cloned in plasmid and transposon cloning vectors that were used to engineer e. coli k-12 strains able to grow on 4-hpa. we report here also the in vitro design of new biodegradative capabilities through the construction of a transposable cassette containing the wide substrate range 4-hpa hydroxylase, in order to expand the ortho-cleavage pathway of pseudomonas putida kt2442 and allow the new recombinant strain to use phenol as the only carbon source.

TI  == the cytochrome subunit is necessary for covalent fad attachment to the flavoprotein subunit of p-cresol methylhydroxylase.
AB  == when p-cresol methylhydroxylase (pcmh) is expressed in its natural host pseudomonas putida, or when the genes of the alpha and beta subunits of the enzyme are expressed together in the heterologous host escherichia coli, flavin-adenine dinucleotide (fad) is covalently attached to tyr384 of the alpha subunit and the correct alpha 2 beta 2 form of the enzyme is assembled. the apoflavoprotein has been expressed in e. coli in the absence of the beta cytochrome c subunit and purified. while noncovalent fad binding to apoflavoprotein in the absence of the cytochrome subunit could not be directly demonstrated, circumstantial evidence suggests that this indeed occurs. covalent  flavinylation requires one molecule each of fad and cytochrome for each flavoprotein subunit. the flavinylation process leads to the 2-electron-reduced form of covalently bound fad, and the resulting alpha 2 beta 2 enzyme is identical to wild-type pcmh. this work presents clear evidence that covalent flavinylation occurs by a self-catalytic mechanism; an external enzyme or chaperon is not required, nor is prior chemical activation of fad or of the protein. this work is the first to define the basic chemistry of covalent flavinylation of an enzyme to produce the normal, active species, and confirms a  long standing, postulated chemical mechanism of this process. it also demonstrates, for the first time, the absolute requirement for a partner subunit  in the post-translational modification of a protein. it is proposed that the covalent fad bond to tyr384 and the phenolic portion of this tyr are part of the  essential electron transfer path from fad to heme.

TI  == modeling simultaneous hexavalent chromium reduction and phenol degradation by a defined coculture of bacteria.
AB  == based on the kinetics of cr(vi) reduction by escherichia coli atcc 33456 and phenol degradation by pseudomonas putida dmp-1, a mathematical model is developed to describe simultaneous cr(vi) reduction and phenol degradation in the coculture of the two species. the developed model incorporates the toxicity effects of cr(vi) and phenol on phenol degradation and cr(vi) reduction in the coculture. the model illustrates the inhibitory effects of phenol on cr(vi) reduction and cr(vi) toxicity toward phenol degradation. the model also reveals the recoveries  of the activities of the repressed bacterial cells with continuous cr(vi) reduction and phenol degradation in the coculture. the model is capable of predicting simultaneous cr(vi) reduction and phenol degradation within a broad range of cr(vi) and phenol concentrations and under an appropriate composition of populations. however, the model simulates lower concentrations of phenol than experimental observations once cr(vi) is reduced to a low level (<7 mg/l). the model simulation for cr(vi) also deviates from experimental data when p. putida is outnumbered by e. coli by a ratio of 1:5.

TI  == bacterial morphinone reductase is related to old yellow enzyme.
AB  == morphinone reductase, produced by pseudomonas putida m10, catalyses the nadh-dependent saturation of the carbon-carbon double bond of morphinone and codeinone, and is believed to be involved in the metabolism of morphine and codeine. the structural gene encoding morphinone reductase, designated morb, was  cloned from ps. putida m10 genomic dna by the use of degenerate oligonucleotide probes based on elements of the amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme. sequence analysis and structural characteristics indicated that morphinone reductase is related to the flavoprotein alpha/beta-barrel oxidoreductases, and is particularly similar to old yellow enzyme of saccharomyces spp. and the related oestrogen-binding protein of candida albicans. expressed sequence tags from several plant species show high homology to these enzymes, suggesting the presence of a family of enzymes conserved in plants and fungi. although related bacterial proteins are known, morphinone reductase appears to be more similar to  the eukaryotic proteins. morphinone reductase was overexpressed in escherichia coli, and has potential applications for the industrial preparation of semisynthetic opiates.

TI  == dissection of the core and auxiliary sequences in the vegetative replication origin of promiscuous plasmid rk2.
AB  == the vegetative replication origin (oriv) of promiscuous incp plasmid rk2 can function in many gram-negative bacterial species when supplied with the plasmid-encoded replication protein trfa and host-encoded replication proteins including dnaa. nine trfa binding sites (iterons) are known, and also two dnaa binding sites, box 1, between trfa iterons 4 and 5, and box 2, downstream of repeat 9. the deletion analysis presented here shows that the core oriv requires  dnaa box 1 for function in escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida. this dna box  is not essential in pseudomonas aeruginosa, although its deletion does reduce plasmid copy number in this species. a putative ihf binding site is located upstream of dnaa box 1, but ihf deficiency in e. coli seems not to alter replication efficiency or copy number control. cloned oriv can interfere with maintenance of an independent rk2 replicon. analysis of replication inhibition functions associated with oriv showed that a short putative orf between trfa iterons 1 and 2 is not necessary for replication inhibition, the presence of repeats 5 to 9 in target and inhibitor plasmid are not sufficient for efficient inhibition and inhibition does not correlate directly with the number of direct repeats present. rather, the results showed that the isolated repeats 1 and 2 to  4, potentiate replication inhibition disproportionately to their effect on the number of trfa binding sites. the results are consistent with the idea that repeats 1 to 4, arranged as a single copy and as an irregular group of three, potentiate the ability of the oriv region to form complexes which inhibit replication. we suggest that trfa bound at these iterons may be more susceptible  to forming pairs between oriv sequences on different plasmids.

TI  == role of sigma s in transcription from the positively controlled pm promoter of the tol plasmid of pseudomonas putida.
AB  == transcription from the tol plasmid pm promoter is dependent on the xyls regulator activated by benzoate effectors. we analysed transcription from pm in several backgrounds with differing escherichia coli alpha and sigma subunits of rna polymerase. in different rpoa backgrounds, transcription from pm was as high as in the wild-type background throughout the growth curve. in the sigma s-deficient background provided by e. coli rh90, high levels of transcription from pm (xyls/3-methylbenzoate dependent) were observed in the early logarithmic growth phase but not in the late logarithmic phase or early stationary phase. this contrasted with the results obtained in the isogenic sigma s-proficient background, in which high levels of transcription were observed throughout the growth curve. xyls/3-methylbenzoate-dependent transcription from pm in the late logarithmic growth phase in the rh90 background was restored by cloned rpos. the  transcription initiation point of pm was the same regardless of the growth phase  and the sigma s background. the requirement of sigma s for stimulation of transcription from pm in the late logarithmic and early stationary phase was overcome by using certain mutant pm promoters, e.g. pm5 (c-47-->g, a-44-->g), and the mutant regulator xylsg44s. it is suggested that the transcription from pm involves the use of two sigma factors: sigma 70 during the early logarithmic phase and sigma s thereafter.

AB  == active e1 component of pseudomonas putida branched-chain-oxoacid dehydrogenase was purified from p. putida strains carrying pjrs84 which contains bkdr (encoding the transcriptional activator) and bkda1 and bkda2 (encoding the alpha and beta subunits). expression was inducible, however, 45-, 39- and 37-kda proteins were produced instead of the expected 45-kda and 37-kda proteins. the 45-kda protein was identified as e1 alpha and the 37-kda and 39-kda proteins were identified as  separate translational products of bkda2 by their n-terminal sequences. the n-terminal amino acid of the 39-kda protein was leucine instead of methionine. the 45-, 39- and 37-kda proteins were also produced in wild-type p.putida. translation of bkda1 and bkda2 from an escherichia coli expression plasmid produced only 45-kda and 39-kda proteins, with n-terminal methionine on the 39-kda protein. the insertion of guanine residues 5' to the first atg of bkda2 did not affect expression of e1 beta in p. putida including the n-terminal leucine which appears to eliminate the possibility of ribosome jumping. the z-average molecular mass of the e1 component was determined by sedimentation equilibrium to be 172 +/- 9 kda compared to a calculated value of 166 kda for the heterotetramer and a stokes radius of 5.1 nm. e1 alpha ser313, which is homologous to the phosphorylated residue of rat liver e1 alpha, was converted to  alanine resulting in about a twofold increase in km, but no change in kcat. s315a and s319a mutations had no effect on km or kcat indicating that these residues do not play a major part in catalysis of e1 alpha beta 2.

TI  == sequence and expression of the bpdc1c2bade genes involved in the initial steps of biphenyl/chlorobiphenyl degradation by rhodococcus sp. m5.
AB  == the nucleotide (nt) sequence of the bpdc1c2bade genes which encode the first three enzymes in the biphenyl (bp) degradation pathway of gram+ rhodococcus sp. m5 (formerly arthrobacter m5) was determined. except for the ferredoxin component (bpdb) of the initial bp dioxygenase, the predicted amino acid (aa) sequences of  the remaining proteins are found to be more closely related to the counterpart proteins (todc1c2bade) present in the toluene-degrader, pseudomonas putida f1, than those of three bp-degrading pseudomonads. the cloned bpd genes were verified by their expression in the escherichia coli t7 rna polymerase/promoter system. in e. coli, bpda was able to complement todc1c2b in indigo biosynthesis, although the m5 native or cloned bp dioxygenase does not carry out this reaction.

TI  == desaturation and oxygenation of 1,2-dihydronaphthalene by toluene and naphthalene dioxygenase.
AB  == bacterial strains expressing toluene and naphthalene dioxygenase were used to examine the sequence of reactions involved in the oxidation of 1,2-dihydronaphthalene. toluene dioxygenase of pseudomonas putida f39/d oxidizes  1,2-dihydronaphthalene to (+)-cis-(1s,2r)-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene, (+)-(1r)-hydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene, and (+)-cis-(1r,2s)-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene. in contrast, naphthalene dioxygenase of pseudomonas sp. strain ncib 9816/11 oxidizes 1,2-dihydronaphthalene to the opposite enantiomer, (-)-cis-(1r,2s)-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene and the identical (+)-cis-(1r,2s)-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene. recombinant escherichia coli strains expressing the structural genes for toluene and naphthalene dioxygenases  confirmed the involvement of these enzymes in the reactions catalyzed by strains  f39/d and ncib 9816/11. 1-hydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene was not formed by strains expressing naphthalene dioxygenase. these results coupled with time course studies and deuterium labelling experiments indicate that, in addition to  direct dioxygenation of the olefin, both enzymes have the ability to desaturate (dehydrogenate) 1,2-dihydronaphthalene to naphthalene, which serves as a substrate for cis dihydroxylation.

TI  == the use of two-dimensional gradient plates to investigate the range of conditions under which conjugal plasmid transfer occurs.
AB  == gel-stabilized two-dimensional gradient plates were used to study the effects of  ph, salt concentration and temperature on the conjugal transfer of plasmid rp4 between strains of escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida. the combinations of ph and salt concentration that permitted conjugation were mapped as a two-dimensional growth area occupied by transconjugants following conjugation. this conjugation domain was less extensive than the areas that supported growth of the parental strains, and showed evidence for the interactive effects of ph and salt concentration in determination of conditions that permitted conjugation. the size and shape of the conjugation domain was influenced by time, temperature, the identities of the donor and recipient bacteria, and the combination of donor  and recipient bacteria.

TI  == production of pseudomonas aeruginosa rhamnolipid biosurfactants in heterologous hosts.
AB  == the high-level production of rhamnolipid biosurfactants is a unique feature of pseudomonas aeruginosa and is strictly regulated in response to environmental conditions. the final step in rhamnolipid biosynthesis is catalyzed by the rhlab  genes encoding a rhamnosyltransferase. the expression of the cloned rhlab genes was studied in heterologous hosts, either under the control of the rhlr and rhli  rhamnolipid regulatory elements or under the control of the tac promoter. a recombinant p. fluorescens strain harboring multiple plasmid-encoded copies of the rhamnolipid gene cluster produced rhamnolipids (0.25 g liter(sup-1)) when grown under nitrogen-limiting conditions. the highest yields (0.6 g liter(sup-1)) and productivities (24 mg liter(sup-1) h(sup-1)) were obtained in a recombinant pseudomonas putida strain, kt2442, harboring promoterless rhlab genes fused to the tac promoter on a plasmid. active rhamnosyltransferase was synthesized, but no rhamnolipids were produced, by recombinant escherichia coli upon induction of  rhlab gene expression.

AB  == rsf1010-derived plasmids carrying a fusion of a promoterless lacz gene with the sigma s-dependent growth phase-regulated promoters of escherichia coli, bolap1 and fic, were constructed. the plasmids were mobilized into the gram-negative bacterial species acetobacter methanolicus, xanthomonas campestris, pseudomonas putida, and rhizobium meliloti. the beta-galactosidase activities of bacterial cultures were determined during exponential and stationary growth phases. transcriptional activation of the fic promoter in the different bacteria was growth phase dependent as in e. coli and was initiated generally during the transition to stationary phase. the induction of the bola promoter was also growth phase dependent in the bacteria tested. while the expression in e. coli and r. meliloti was initiated during the transition from exponential to stationary phase, the induction in a. methanolicus, p. putida, and x. campestris  started some hours after stationary growth phase was reached. in all the species  tested, dna fragments hybridizing with the rpos gene of e. coli were detected. the results show that in different gram-negative bacteria, stationary-phase-specific sigma factors which are structurally and functionally homologous to sigma s and are able to recognize the promoter sequences of both bola and fic exist.

TI  == cloning, dna sequencing, and amino acid sequencing of catechol 1,2-dioxygenases (pyrocatechase) from pseudomonas putida mt-2 and pseudomonas arvilla c-1.
AB  == catechol 1,2-dioxygenase catalyzes the oxygenative ring cleavage of catechol to form cis,cis-muconic acid and is encoded by a cata gene. we have cloned a cata gene from pseudomonas putida mt-2 using a pcr product of amino acid sequence-based primers as a probe. the amino acid sequence deduced from the 930 nucleotides was in complete agreement with the chemically determined sequence of  the protein. crude extracts of escherichia coli cells carrying the cata gene downstream from the lac promoter showed the enzyme activity. by using the same probe, we also cloned and sequenced the cata beta gene for catechol 1,2-dioxygenase isozyme beta beta from pseudomonas arvilla c-1, which has three isozymes, alpha alpha, alpha beta, and beta beta (c. nakai, h. horiike, s. kuramitsu, h. kagamiyama, and m. nozaki, 1990, j. biol. chem. 265, 660-665). there was very high homology between isozyme beta beta of the c-1 strain and the  enzyme of the mt-2 strain in both the amino acid (98%) and the dna sequences (97%). a preference for the use of codons terminating in c and g was found in the coding region of both the enzymes, which contributed to the high g + c content (65-66%) of the genes. a comparison of the dna sequences of various cata genes from other sources revealed their common ancestry, whereas a comparison of the amino acid sequences of the enzymes revealed clear reflection of substrate specificity. tyrosyl and histidyl residues for proposed ligands of ferric ion are conserved in all catechol 1,2-dioxygenases.

TI  == construction and behavior of biologically contained bacteria for environmental applications in bioremediation.
AB  == the survival of microorganisms can be predicted through the use of active biological containment systems. we have constructed contained pseudomonas putida  strains that degrade alkylbenzoates. the modified strain carries a fusion of the  plac promoter to the gef gene, which encodes a killing protein. expression from plac is controlled through a regulatory cascade, so that plac is switched on or off by the absence or presence of alkylbenzoates, respectively. similar uncontained strains were also constructed and tested as a control. contained and  uncontained strains were genetically stable, and their survival and functionality in soil microcosms were as expected. both contained and uncontained strains survived well in soils supplemented with alkylaromatics, whereas survival of the  contained strain in soil microcosms without methylbenzoates was markedly reduced, in contrast to the control strain, which survived in these soils in the absence of alkylbenzoates. the tol plasmid was transferred in soils between pseudomonas strains but was not able to mobilize the elements of the containment system.

TI  == energy-coupled transport and signal transduction through the gram-negative outer  membrane via tonb-exbb-exbd-dependent receptor proteins.
AB  == iron in the form of ferric siderophore complexes and vitamin b12 are transported  through the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria by a mechanism which consumes energy. there is no known energy source in the outer membrane or in the  adjacent periplasmic space so that energy is provided by the electrochemical potential across the cytoplasmic membrane. energy flows from the cytoplasmic into the outer membrane via a complex consisting of the tonb, exbb and exbd proteins which are anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane. it is proposed that the tonb--exbb--exbd complex opens--via an energized conformation of the tonb protein--channels in the outer membrane, formed by proteins which serves as highly specific binding sites for the various ferric siderophores and vitamin b12. in addition, outer membrane receptors together with the tonb--exbb--exbd complex are directly involved in induction of the transcription of ferric citrate and pseudobactin transport genes of escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida, respectively.

TI  == characterization of biphenyl catabolic genes of gram-positive polychlorinated biphenyl degrader rhodococcus sp. strain rha1.
AB  == rhodococcus sp. strain rha1 is a gram-positive polychlorinated biphenyl (pcb) degrader which can degrade 10 ppm of pcb48 (equivalent to aroclor1248), including tri-, tetra-, and pentachlorobiphenyls, in a few days. we isolated the 7.6-kb ecori-bamhi fragment carrying the biphenyl catabolic genes of rha1 and determined their nucleotide sequence. on the basis of deduced amino acid sequence homology,  we identified six bph genes, bpha1a2a3a4, bphb, and bphc, that are responsible for the initial three steps of biphenyl degradation. the order of bph genes in rha1 is bpha1a2a3a4-bphc-bphb. this gene order differs from that of other pcb degraders reported previously. the amino acid sequences deduced from the rha1 bph genes have a higher degree of homology with the tod genes from pseudomonas putida f1 (49 to 79%) than with the bph genes of pseudomonas sp. strains kf707 and kks102 (30 to 65%). in escherichia coli, bpha gene activity was not observed even when expression vectors were used. the activities of bphb and bphc, however, were confirmed by observing the transformation of biphenyl to a meta-cleavage compound with the aid of benzene dioxygenase activity that complemented the bpha gene activity (s. irie, s. doi, t. yorifuji, m. takagi, and k. yano, j. bacteriol. 169:5174-5179, 1987). the expected products of the cloned bph genes, except bpha3, were observed in e. coli in an in vitro transcription-translation system.  insertion mutations of bpha1 and bphc of rhodococcus sp. strain rha1 were constructed by gene replacement with cloned gene fragments.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == aspartate transcarbamoylase genes of pseudomonas putida: requirement for an inactive dihydroorotase for assembly into the dodecameric holoenzyme.
AB  == the nucleotide sequences of the genes encoding the enzyme aspartate transcarbamoylase (atcase) from pseudomonas putida have been determined. our results confirm that the p. putida atcase is a dodecameric protein composed of two types of polypeptide chains translated coordinately from overlapping genes. the p. putida atcase does not possess dissociable regulatory and catalytic functions but instead apparently contains the regulatory nucleotide binding site  within a unique n-terminal extension of the pyrb-encoded subunit. the first gene, pyrb, is 1,005 bp long and encodes the 334-amino-acid, 36.4-kda catalytic subunit of the enzyme. the second gene is 1,275 bp long and encodes a 424-residue polypeptide which bears significant homology to dihydroorotase (dhoase) from other organisms. despite the homology of the overlapping gene to known dhoases, this 44.2-kda polypeptide is not considered to be the functional product of the pyrc gene in p. putida, as dhoase activity is distinct from the atcase complex. moreover, the 44.2-kda polypeptide lacks specific histidyl residues thought to be critical for dhoase enzymatic function. the pyrc-like gene (henceforth designated pyrc') does not complement escherichia coli pyrc auxotrophs, while the cloned pyrb gene does complement pyrb auxotrophs. the proposed function for the vestigial dhoase is to maintain atcase activity by conserving the dodecameric assembly of the native enzyme. this unique assembly of six active pyrb polypeptides coupled with six inactive pyrc' polypeptides has not been seen previously for atcase but is reminiscent of the fused trifunctional cad enzyme of eukaryotes.

AB  == the substrate specificities of two catechol 2,3-dioxygenases, one encoded by xyle on the tol plasmid pww0 and the other encoded by nahh on the nah7 plasmid, were investigated. the xyle catechol 2,3-dioxygenase catalyzes the ring-cleavage of catechol, 3-methylcatechol and 4-methylcatechol. the nahh catechol 2,3-dioxygenase was partially deficient in oxidizing 3-methylcatechol due to defects in two catalytic properties. first, nahh has a lower kcat value for 3-methylcatechol compared to xyle, and secondly, nahh is more susceptible than xyle to suicide inhibition by 3-methylcatechol. to identify the amino acid residues of xyle and nahh responsible for the differences in the efficacy of the  3-methylcatechol oxidation, kcat and kinact (the rate constant for suicide inhibition) for 3-methylcatechol were determined for several nahh-xyle hybrid proteins, each of which consisted of the nahh sequence in the n-terminal region and the xyle sequence in the c-terminal region. it is shown that a single amino acid substitution present in the nahh sequence, his250-->gln, was responsible for the reduced kcat and increased kinact values for 3-methylcatechol. in addition to the substitution at residue 250, some substitution(s) at residues 77-102 were responsible for the twofold difference in the kinact values for nahh and xyle with 3-methylcatechol. we also show that the binding site of 3-methylcatechol for suicide inhibition is different from the catalytic site.

AB  == in the presence of toluene, xylenes and other structural analogues, the regulatory protein xylr, of the family of transcriptional regulators which act in concert with the sigma 54 factor, activate the promoter pu of the tol (toluene degradation) plasmid pwwo of pseudomonas putida. amino acid changes val-219-asp and ala-220-pro, introducing a proline kink at the hinge region between the n-terminal a domain and the central portion of xylr, resulted in a semi-constitutive phenotype which mimicked the activating effect of aromatic inducers. this phenotype was further exacerbated by inserting extra amino acid residues within the same inter-domain region. a truncated xylr protein devoid of  the signal-receiving, amino-terminal portion of the protein stimulated the cognate promoter pu at high levels independently of inducer addition, both in escherichia coli and in pseudomonas putida. replacement of the amino-terminal domain by a heterologous peptide derived from the ms2 virus polymerase resulted in a hybrid protein still able to bind dna to the same extent in vivo as xylr, but unable to stimulate transcription. these data indicate that a key event in the activation of xylr by toluene/xylenes is the release of the repression caused by the a domain of the protein on surfaces located at the central domain of the regulator.

AB  == the 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase, xylf, of the pseudomonas putida tol  plasmid-encoded pathway for the catabolism of toluene and xylenes, catalyzes one  of the rarest types of enzyme reaction (ec 3.7.1.9), the hydrolysis of a carbon-carbon bond in its substrate, the ring-fission product of 3-alkyl-substituted catechols. in this study, amino acid sequence comparisons between xylf and other hydrolases, and analysis of the similarity between the predicted secondary structure of xylf and the known secondary structure of the haloalkane dehalogenase from xanthobacter autotrophicus strain gj10, led us to identify several conserved residues likely to have a functional role in the catalytic center of xylf. three amino acids, ser107, asp228, and his256, were found to be arranged in a sequential order similar to that in alpha/beta hydrolase-fold enzymes. investigations of the potential functional role of these  and other residues through amino acid modification and in vitro site-directed mutagenesis experiments provided evidence in support of the hypothesis that xylf  is a serine hydrolase of the alpha/beta hydrolase-fold family of enzymes, and pointed to the residues identified above as the catalytic triad of xylf. these studies also provided information on other conserved residues in xylf-related enzymes. interestingly, the substitution of phe by met in position 108 of xylf created an enzyme with increased thermostability and altered substrate specificity.

TI  == single amino acids changes in the signal receptor domain of xylr resulted in mutants that stimulate transcription in the absence of effectors.
AB  == the xylr protein positively controls expression from the pseudomonas putida tol plasmid sigma 54-dependent "upper" pathway operon promoter (pu) and the xyls gene promoter (ps), in response to the presence of aromatic effectors. two mutant xylr regulators able to stimulate transcription from pu and ps in the absence of effectors were isolated. these mutants exhibited single point mutations, namely asp135-->asn and pro85-->ser. both mutations are located in the amino termini domain of xylr, which is thought to be responsible for interactions with effectors. the effector profile of xylrp85s was similar to that of wild-type xylr protein; however, xylrd135n exhibited an altered pattern of effector recognition: with m-nitrotoluene it stimulated transcription from the pu promoter above the high basal level, whereas this nitroarene inhibited the wild-type regulator. previous work (delgado, a., and ramos, j.l. (1994) j. biol. chem. 269, 8059-8062) showed that residue 172 was involved in effector interactions, as mutant xylre172k also recognized m-nitrotoluene. however, double mutant xylr135n/e172k did not stimulate transcription in the absence of effector, but retained the ability to stimulate transcription with m-nitrotoluene. transcription mediated by xylrd135n and xylrp85s from pu::lacz was analyzed in detail. like the wild-type regulator, xylrd135n and xylrp85s required sigma 54 for full transcription activation, but in contrast with the wild-type regulator, xylrd135n, but not xylrp85s, stimulated transcription from pu in the absence of the integration host factor protein. xylrd135n, also in contrast with xylr and xylrp85s, mediated transcription from a mutant pu promoter that lacked one of the upstream regulator binding sites (delta uas1), but not when both upstream regulator binding sites were deleted. the level of autoregulation of xylrd135n was at least 2-fold higher than that found with the wild-type xylr regulator and the mutant xylrp85s.

TI  == identification of a membrane protein and a truncated lysr-type regulator associated with the toluene degradation pathway in pseudomonas putida f1.
AB  == a 3 kb dna region upstream of the toluene degradation (tod) genes, todfc1c2badegih, in pseudomonas putida f1 (ppf1) was sequenced. two divergently arranged open reading frames, todr and todx, were identified. a toluene-inducible promoter was localized in front of todx, and the transcription start point was mapped. this promoter is probably responsible for the expression of all tod structural genes. todx was found to be a membrane protein. its predicted amino acid sequence (453 residues; m(r) 48,265) exhibits considerable similarity with the fadl protein of escherichia coli, an outer membrane protein required for binding and transport of long-chain fatty acids. an apparent function of todx is  likely to be involved in facilitating the delivery of exogenous toluene inside the ppf1 cells. the sequence of todr (100 residues) exhibits extensive homology with the dna-binding domain of transcriptional activators of the lysr family, but todr was found to have a negligible role in tod gene regulation.

TI  == mechanism of the reaction catalyzed by mandelate racemase: structure and mechanistic properties of the k166r mutant.

(1994) biochemistry 33, 635-643], lys 166 and his 297 are positioned appropriately to participate in catalysis as acid/base catalysts that either abstract the alpha-proton from the enantiomers of mandelate to form an enolic intermediate or protonate the enolic intermediate to form the enantiomers of mandelate, with lys 166 participating as the (s)-specific acid/base catalyst and  his 297 participating as the (r)-specific acid/base catalyst. in this paper we report the structural and mechanistic properties of the mutant in which lys 166 has been replaced with arginine (k166r). the structure of k166r has been determined at 1.85 a resolution with the substrate (s)-mandelate bound in the active site. the structure of this complex reveals no geometric alterations in the active site, with the exception that the longer side chain of arg 166 is necessarily displaced upward from the position occupied by lys 166 by steric interactions with the bound substrate. in contrast to the h297n mutant of mr [landro, j. a., kallarakal, a. t., ransom, s. c., gerlt, j. a., kozarich, j. w.,  neidhart, d. j., & kenyon, g. l. (1991) biochemistry 30, 9275-9281], the k166r exhibits low levels of racemase activity [kcat is reduced 5 x 10(3)-fold in the (r)- to (s)-direction and 1 x 10(3)-fold in the (s)- to (r)-direction]. the substrate and solvent deuterium isotope effects support a reaction coordinate for the k166r-catalyzed reaction in which the transition state for interconversion of bound (s)-mandelate and the stabilized enolic intermediate is higher in energy that the transition state for interconversion of bound (r)-mandelate and the stabilized enolic intermediate. the solvent deuterium isotope effect when (s)-mandelate is substrate (2.2 +/- 0.3) supports the proposal that the formation of the enolic intermediate involves partial transfer of a solvent-derived proton  from glu 317 to the substrate as the alpha-proton is abstracted [mitra, b., kallarakal, a. t., kozarich, j. w., gerlt, j. a., clifton, j. g., petsko, g. a.,  & kenyon, g. l.

TI  == regulation of the hema gene during 5-aminolevulinic acid formation in pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == the general tetrapyrrole precursor 5-aminolevulinic acid is formed in bacteria via two different biosynthetic pathways. members of the alpha group of the proteobacteria use 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase for the condensation of succinyl-coenzyme a and glycine, while other bacteria utilize a two-step pathway  from aminoacylated trna(glu). the trna-dependent pathway, involving the enzymes glutamyl-trna reductase (encoded by hema) and glutamate-1-semialdehyde-2,1-aminomutase (encoded by heml), was demonstrated to be used by pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas stutzeri, comamonas testosteroni, azotobacter vinelandii, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus.  to study the regulation of the pathway, the glutamyl-trna reductase gene (hema) from p. aeruginosa was cloned by complementation of an escherichia coli hema mutant. the hema gene was mapped to the spei a fragment and the dpnil fragment of the p. aeruginosa chromosome corresponding to min 24.1 to 26.8. the cloned hema gene, coding for a protein of 423 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 46,234 da, forms an operon with the gene for protein release factor 1 (prf1). this translational factor mediates the termination of the protein chain at the ribosome at amber and ochre codons. since the cloned hema gene did not possess one of the appropriate stop codons, an autoregulatory mechanism such as that postulated for the enterobacterial system was ruled out. three open reading frames of unknown function transcribed in the opposite direction to the hema gene were found. hemm/orf1 and orf2 were found to be homologous to open reading frames located in the 5' region of enterobacterial hema genes. utilization of both transcription start sites was changed in a p. aeruginosa mutant missing the oxygen regulator anr (fnr analog), indicating the involvement of the transcription factor in hema expression. dna sequences homologous to one half of  an anr binding site were detected at one of the determined transcription start sites.

TI  == lipase modulator protein (liml) of pseudomonas sp. strain 109.
AB  == plasmids containing a pseudomonas sp. strain 109 extracellular lipase gene (lipl) lacking nh2-terminal sequence and a lipase modulator gene (liml) lacking the nh2-terminal hydrophobic region were constructed and expressed independently in escherichia coli by using the t7 promoter expression vector system. recombinant lipl (rlipl) was produced as inclusion bodies, whereas recombinant liml (rliml) was present as a soluble protein. during in vitro renaturation of the purified rlipl inclusion bodies after they had been dissolved in 8 m urea, addition of rliml was essential to solubilize and modulate rlipl. the solubility and activity of rlipl were influenced by the rliml/rlipl molar ratio; the highest level of solubility was obtained at an rliml/rlipl ratio of 4:5, whereas the highest activity level was obtained at an rliml/rlipl ratio of 4:1. after renaturation, rlipl and rliml were coprecipitated with anti-rlipl antibody, indicating the formation of an rlipl-rliml complex. activity of the native lipase purified from  pseudomonas sp. strain 109 was also inhibited by rliml. by western blotting (immunoblotting) with anti-rliml antibody, native liml was detected in pseudomonas cells solubilized by sarcosyl treatment. liml was purified from pseudomonas sp. strain 109, and the nh2-terminal amino acid sequence was determined to be nh2-leu-glu-pro-ser-pro-ala-pro-. we propose that to prevent membrane degradation, liml weakens lipase activity inside the cell, especially in the periplasm, in addition to modulating lipase folding.

TI  == a manganese-dependent dioxygenase from arthrobacter globiformis cm-2 belongs to the major extradiol dioxygenase family.
AB  == almost all bacterial ring cleavage dioxygenases contain iron as the catalytic metal center. we report here the first available sequence for a manganese-dependent 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate (3,4-dhpa) 2,3-dioxygenase and its further characterization. this manganese-dependent extradiol dioxygenase from arthrobacter globiformis cm-2, unlike iron-dependent extradiol dioxygenases, is not inactivated by hydrogen peroxide. also, ferrous ions, which activate iron extradiol dioxygenases, inhibit 3,4-dhpa 2,3-dioxygenase. the gene encoding 3,4-dhpa 2,3-dioxygenase, mndd, was identified from an a. globiformis cm-2 cosmid library. mndd was subcloned as a 2.0-kb smai fragment in puc18, from which manganese-dependent extradiol dioxygenase activity was expressed at high levels in escherichia coli. the mndd open reading frame was identified by comparison with the known n-terminal amino acid sequence of purified manganese-dependent 3,4-dhpa 2,3-dioxygenase. fourteen of 18 amino acids conserved in members of the  iron-dependent extradiol dioxygenase family are also conserved in the manganese-dependent 3,4-dhpa 2,3-dioxygenase (mndd). thus, mndd belongs to the extradiol family of dioxygenases and may share a common ancestry with the iron-dependent extradiol dioxygenases. we propose the revised consensus primary sequence (g,t,n,r)x(h,a)xxxxxxx(l,i,v,m,f)yxx(d,e,t,n,a)px(g,p) x(2,3)e for this  family. (numbers in brackets indicate a gap of two or three residues at this point in the sequence.) the suggested common ancestry is also supported by sequence obtained from genes flanking mndd, which share significant sequence identity with xylj and xylg from pseudomonas putida.

AB  == degenerate pcr primers, up-1 and up-2r, for the amplification of dna gyrase subunit b genes (gyrb) were designed by using consensus amino acid sequences of gyrases from escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, and bacillus subtilis. in addition to the degenerate sequences, these primers have sequences at the 5' end  which allow direct sequencing of amplified pcr products. with these primers, dna  segments of the predicted size were amplified from a variety of gram-negative and gram-positive genera. the nucleotide sequences of the amplified gyrb dna from three p. putida strains were determined directly from the amplified fragments. the base substitution frequency of gyrb between the strains of p. putida was much higher than that of the 16s rrna gene. with a specific set of pcr primers, it was possible to amplify gyrb fragments selectively from p. putida or its subgroups. the direct sequencing method of gyrb developed in this study provides a rapid and convenient system for bacterial identification, taxonomic analysis, and monitoring of bacteria in the natural environment.

AB  == the cloned xyle gene encoding catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (metapyrocatechase) from tol plasmid in pseudomonas putida mt-2 has been expressed in escherichia coli w3110 to a level of approximately 15% of the total soluble protein. of the total  iron in the crude extract, 45% was on the enzyme. the crystallized enzyme from e. coli had higher iron content (3.7 mol/mol enzyme) and specific activity (536 u/mg) than the enzyme from p. putida mt-2. however, no differences were observed  in physicochemical, protein-chemical, and kinetic properties between the two enzymes. the enzyme was a homotetramer, and no changes were observed in the values of m(r) (136,000 +/- 5,000) and stokes radius (4.26 nm) in the concentration range from 0.36 nm to 2.8 microm, indicating that the native enzyme neither dissociated into subunits nor polymerized in this range. the catalytic center activity and the km values for catechol and dioxygen were 278 s-1, 1.87 and 7.45 microm, respectively, at ph 7.5 and 25 degrees c. the enzyme showed a broad substrate specificity. among substrates, 4-methylcatechol and 4-chlorocatechol showed specificity constants (approximately 200 microm-1.s-1) higher than that for catechol. acetone and phenol derivatives competitively inhibited the activity against catechol. the relationship between specific activity and iron content was not linear, suggesting some conformational changes  in the partially iron-depleted enzyme.

TI  == iron regulation of siderophore biosynthesis and transport in pseudomonas putida wcs358: involvement of a transcriptional activator and of the fur protein.
AB  == pseudobactin 358 is the yellow-green fluorescent siderophore produced by pseudomonas putida wcs358 in conditions of iron limitation. the genes encoding for siderophore biosynthesis are iron-regulated at the transcriptional level. previous work has shown that a positive regulator, pfra, is absolutely required for the activation under iron-limiting conditions of pseudobactin 358 biosynthesis. in this study we identified a set of tn5 insertion mutants of strain wcs358 which lost the ability to activate an iron-regulated siderophore promoter. these mutants no longer produced pseudobactin 358. molecular analysis revealed that they carried a tn5 insertion in a gene, designated pfrl (pseudomonas ferric regulator), which codes for a protein (pfrl) of 19.5 kda. pfrl contains a putative helix-turn-helix motif typical of dna-binding proteins and has homology to two dna-binding transcriptional activators, fecl from escherichia coli and pupl from p. putida. the proposed role of pfrl in strain wcs358 is an activator protein regulating pseudobactin 358 biosynthesis under iron limitation. the pfrl promoter region contains a sequence which displays high identity to the fur-box consensus. this 19 bp consensus sequence is recognized by fur, an iron-binding repressor protein found in many different bacteria. the e. coli fur protein can bind to the pfrl promoter region, indicating that this activator gene is likely to be iron-regulated by fur. we also report the identification and characterization of the p. putida wcs358 fur gene. the fur protein of strain wcs358 is structurally and functionally similar to other cloned fur proteins from other bacterial species.

TI  == characterization of bkdr-dna binding in the expression of the bkd operon of pseudomonas putida.
AB  == the bkd operon of pseudomonas putida consists of the structural genes encoding the components of the inducible branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase. bkdr, a positive regulator of the bkd operon and a homolog of lrp of escherichia coli is  encoded by a structural gene adjacent to, and divergently transcribed from, the bkd operon of p. putida. bkdr was purified from e. coli containing bkdr cloned into pcytexp1, an expression vector. the molecular weight of bkdr obtained by gel filtration indicates that bkdr is a tetramer, and the abundance of bkdr in p. putida was estimated to be about 25 to 40 copies of the tetramer per cell. bkdr bound specifically to the region between bkdr and bkda1, the latter being the first gene of the bkd operon. one bkdr-dna complex was observed in gel mobility shift patterns. approximately 100 bp was protected from the action of dnase i by  bkdr, and the addition of l-branched-chain amino acids enhanced the appearance of hypersensitive sites in the protected region. there are four potential bkdr-dna binding sequences in this region based on similarity to lrp-binding consensus sequences. like many other transcriptional activators, bkdr regulates expression  of its structural gene. dnas from several gram-negative bacteria hybridized to a  probe containing bkdr, indicating the presence of bkdr-like genes in these organisms.

AB  == the gene (fdm) coding for formaldehyde dismutase (ec 1.2.99.4) from a genomic library of formaldehyde-tolerant pseudomonas putida f61 was cloned and expressed  in escherichia coli. the nucleotides of the cloned dna were sequenced; they included a single open reading frame of 1200 base pairs, coding for a putative protein with a molecular weight of 42,848. sequencing of the first 20 n-terminal  amino acid residues and of an internal part of the enzyme purified from p. putida f61 established the identity and the start codon of fdm. comparison of the amino  acid sequence predicted from fdm with that of alcohol dehydrogenase from horse liver suggested a putative pyridine-dinucleotide-binding domain in fdm, and also  potential ligands for the catalytic domain and the second zinc atom-folding domain. fdm seemed to be expressed in e. coli under control of the promoter of fdm; there was an e. coli promoter-like sequence upstream from the gene. the enzyme expressed in e. coli was purified to homogeneity. the molecular weight and the sequence of the first 20 n-terminal amino acid residues were identical with those of p. putida formaldehyde dismutase. each subunit contained 1 mol of nad(h) and 2 mol of zinc per mol of protein. the enzyme produced in e. coli catalyzed the dismutation of formaldehyde to form methanol and formic acid at the ratio of  1:1 in the absence of the exogenous electron acceptor, nad(h).

TI  == effect of cellular physiology on pcr amplification efficiency.
AB  == culture conditions, and other variables that modulate a cell's physiology, can bias a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification against generating a representative population profile. two pseudomonas putida nahr alleles were constructed in puc19 that differ solely in a 31-bp internal segment whose sequence has been inverted. after pcr amplification, the products could be distinguished on the basis of a change in a unique restriction site. when an escherichia coli strain carrying one nahr allele is submitted to different growth conditions, the consequences of such variations on the relative pcr amplification of whole cells can be ascertained through coamplification with a strain carrying  the other allele and subsequent restriction analysis. cells in stationary phase displayed improved amplifiability while cells grown at 42 degrees c were equally  amplifiable as compared to cells grown at 37 degrees c. however, sublethal levels of tetracycline or growth in minimal medium made the pcr target in these cells relatively less amplifiable. when cells are completely lysed and the plasmid dna  is purified beforehand, the coamplification bias is eliminated. these results suggest that mixed populations containing cells in different physiological states may not be representatively amplified by pcr unless a dna extraction step is included.

TI  == expression vectors for the use of eukaryotic luciferases as bacterial markers with different colors of luminescence.
AB  == an easy way to identify microorganisms is to provide them with gene markers that  confer a unique phenotype. several genetic constructions were developed to use eukaryotic luciferase genes for bacterial tagging. the firefly and click bettle luciferase genes, luc and lucor, respectively, were cloned under constitutive control and regulated control from different transcriptional units driven by p1,  lambda pr, and ptrc promoters. comparison of the expression of each gene in escherichia coli cells from identical promoters showed that bioluminescence produced by luc could be detected luminometrically in a more sensitive manner. in contrast, luminescence from intact lucor-expressing cells was much more stable and resistant to high temperatures than that from luc-expressing cells. to analyze the behavior of these constructions in other gram-negative bacteria, gene fusions with luc genes were cloned on broad-host-range vectors. measurements of light emission from rhizobium meliloti, agrobacterium tumefaciens, and pseudomonas putida cells indicated that both luciferases were poorly expressed from p1 in most bacterial hosts. in contrast, the lambda promoter pr yielded constitutively high levels of luciferase expression in all bacterial species tested. pr activity was not regulated by temperature when the thermosensitive repressor ci857 was present in the bacterial species tested, except for e. coli.  in contrast, the regulated laciq-ptrc::lucor fusion expression system behaved in  a manner similar to that observed in e. coli cells. after iptg (isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside) induction, this system produced the highest levels of lucor expression in all bacterial species tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == possible regulatory role for nonaromatic carbon sources in styrene degradation by pseudomonas putida ca-3.
AB  == styrene metabolism in styrene-degrading pseudomonas putida ca-3 cells has been shown to proceed via styrene oxide, phenylacetaldehyde, and phenylacetic acid. the initial step in styrene degradation by strain ca-3 is oxygen-dependent epoxidation of styrene to styrene oxide, which is subsequently isomerized to phenylacetaldehyde. phenylacetaldehyde is then oxidized to phenylacetic acid. styrene, styrene oxide, and phenylacetaldehyde induce the enzymes involved in the degradation of styrene to phenylacetic acid by p. putida ca-3. phenylacetic acid-induced cells do not oxidize styrene or styrene oxide. thus, styrene degradation by p. putida ca-3 can be subdivided further into an upper pathway which consists of styrene, styrene oxide, and phenylacetaldehyde and a lower pathway which begins with phenylacetic acid. studies of the repression of styrene degradation by p. putida ca-3 show that glucose has no effect on the activity of  styrene-degrading enzymes. however, both glutamate and citrate repress styrene degradation and phenylacetic acid degradation, showing a common control mechanism on upper pathway and lower pathway intermediates.

AB  == sensitive and convenient biosensing of environmental pollutants has been developed by fusing a gene of firefly luciferase to the tol plasmid. tol plasmid  of pseudomonas putida encodes a series of enzymes for degradation of benzene and  its derivatives. the expression of these enzymes is controlled with the regulating proteins xylr and xyls, whose promoters are activated in the presence  of aromatic compounds. the structural gene of firefly luciferase, as a reporter enzyme, was inserted under the control of the promoter of xyls protein, and gene  fusion plasmid ptsn316 was constructed. the recombinant escherichia coli transformed with this plasmid was applied to the environmental biosensing of benzene derivatives. the expression of luciferase was induced in the presence of  aromatic compounds and the lower detection limit for m-xylene was 5 microm.

TI  == localization of functional domains in the escherichia coli coprogen receptor fhue and the pseudomonas putida ferric-pseudobactin 358 receptor pupa.
AB  == transport of ferric-siderophores across the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria is mediated by specific outer membrane receptors. to localize the substrate-binding domain of the ferric-pseudobactin 358 receptor, pupa, of pseudomonas putida wcs358, we constructed chimeric receptors in which different domains of pupa were replaced by the corresponding domains of the related ferric-pseudobactin receptors pupb and pupx, or the coprogen receptor fhue of escherichia coli. none of the chimeric proteins composed of pseudobactin receptor domains facilitated growth on any of the original substrates, or they showed only an extremely low efficiency. however, these receptors enabled cells of pseudomonas bn8 to grow on media supplemented with uncharacterized siderophore preparations. these siderophore preparations were isolated from the culture supernatant of wcs358 cells carrying plasmids that contain genes of pseudomonas b10 required for the biosynthesis of pseudobactin b10. hybrid proteins that contained at least the amino-terminal 516 amino acids of mature fhue were active  as a receptor for coprogen and interacted with the e. coli tonb protein. a chimeric pupa-fhue protein, containing the amino-terminal 94 amino acids of mature pupa, was also active as a coprogen receptor, but only in the presence of  pseudomonas tonb. it is concluded that the carboxy-terminal domain of ferric-pseudobactin receptors is important, but not sufficient, for ligand interaction, whereas binding of coprogen by the fhue receptor is not dependent on this domain. apparently, the ligand-binding sites of different receptors are located in different regions of the proteins. furthermore, species-specific tonb  binding by the pupa receptor is dependent on the amino-terminal domain of the receptor.

AB  == the 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase and the acetoin-cleaving system were simultaneously induced in pseudomonas putida ppg2 during growth on 2,3-butanediol and on acetoin. hybridization with a dna probe covering the genes for the e1 subunits of the alcaligenes eutrophus acetoin cleaving system and nucleotide sequence analysis identified acoa (975 bp), acob (1020 bp), apoc (1110 bp), acox  (1053 bp) and adh (1086 bp) in a 6.3-kb genomic region. the amino acid sequences  deduced from acoa, acob, and acoc for e1 alpha (m(r) 34639), e1 beta (m(r) 37268), and e2 (m(r) 39613) of the p. putida acetoin cleaving system exhibited striking similarities to those of the corresponding components of the a. eutrophus acetoin cleaving system and of the acetoin dehydrogenase enzyme system  of pelobacter carbinolicus and other bacteria. strong sequence similarities of the adh translational product (2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase, m(r) 38361) were obtained to various alcohol dehydrogenases belonging to the zinc- and nad(p)-dependent long-chain (group i) alcohol dehydrogenases. expression of the p. putida adh in escherichia coli was demonstrated. the aco genes and adh constitute presumably one single operon which encodes all enzymes required for the conversion of 2,3-butanediol to central metabolites.

TI  == construction of phoe-caa, a novel pcr- and immunologically detectable marker gene for pseudomonas putida.
AB  == in this paper we describe the construction and use in pseudomonas putida wcs358 of phoe-caa, a novel hybrid marker gene, which allows monitoring both at the protein level by immunological methods and at the dna level by pcr. the marker is based on the escherichia coli outer membrane protein gene phoe and 75 bp of e. coli caa, which encode a nonbacteriocinic fragment of colicin a. this fragment contains an epitope which is recognized by monoclonal antibody (mab) 1c11. as the epitope is contained in one of the cell surface-exposed loops of phoe, whole cells of bacteria expressing the protein can be detected by using the mab. the marker gene contains only e. coli sequences not coding for toxins and therefore can be considered environmentally safe. the hybrid phoe-cola protein was expressed in e. coli under conditions of phosphate starvation, and single cells could be detected by immunofluorescence microscopy with mab 1c11. using a wide-host-range vector the phoe-caa gene was introduced into p. putida wcs358. the gene appeared to be expressed under phosphate limitation in this species, and the gene product was present in the membrane fraction and reacted with mab 1c11.  the hybrid phoe-cola protein could be detected on whole cells of wcs358 mutant strains lacking (part of) the o-antigen of the lipopolysaccharide but not on wild-type wcs358 cells, unless these cells had previously been washed with 10 mm  edta. in addition to immunodetection, the phoe-caa marker gene could be specifically detected by pcr with one primer directed to a part of the phoe sequence and a second primer that annealed to the caa insert.

TI  == identification of the pcarkf gene cluster from pseudomonas putida: involvement in chemotaxis, biodegradation, and transport of 4-hydroxybenzoate.
AB  == pseudomonas putida prs2000 is chemotactic to 4-hydroxybenzoate and other aromatic acids. this behavioral response is induced when cells are grown on 4-hydroxybenzoate or benzoate, compounds that are degraded via the beta-ketoadipate pathway. isolation of a transposon mutant defective in 4-hydroxybenzoate chemotaxis allowed identification of a new gene cluster designated pcarkf. dna sequencing, mutational analysis, and complementation studies revealed that pcar encodes a regulatory protein required for induction of at least four of the enzymes of the beta-ketoadipate pathway and that pcaf encodes beta-ketoadipyl-coenzyme a thiolase, the last enzyme in the pathway. the  third gene, pcak, encodes a transporter for 4-hydroxybenzoate, and this protein is also required for chemotaxis to aromatic acids. the predicted pcak protein is  47 kda in size, with a deduced amino acid sequence indicative of membership in the major facilitator superfamily of transport proteins. the protein, expressed in escherichia coli, catalyzed 4-hydroxybenzoate transport. in addition, whole cells of p. putida pcak mutants accumulated 4-hydroxybenzoate at reduced rates compared with that in wild-type cells. the pcak mutation did not impair growth at the expense of 4-hydroxybenzoate under most conditions; however, mutant cells grew somewhat more slowly than the wild type on 4-hydroxybenzoate at a high ph. the finding that 4-hydroxybenzoate chemotaxis can be disrupted without an accompanying effect on metabolism indicates that this chemotactic response is receptor mediated. it remains to be determined, however, whether pcak itself is a chemoreceptor for 4-hydroxybenzoate or whether it plays an indirect role in chemotaxis. these findings indicate that aromatic acid detection and transport are integral features of aromatic degradation pathways.

TI  == nucleotide sequence and functional analysis of the genes encoding 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid oxygenase in pseudomonas cepacia ac1100.
AB  == pseudomonas cepacia ac1100 is able to use the chlorinated aromatic compound 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-t) as the sole source of carbon and energy. one of the early steps in this pathway is the conversion of 2,4,5-t to 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (2,4,5-tcp). 2,4,5-tcp accumulates in the culture medium when ac1100 is grown in the presence of 2,4,5-t. a dna region from the ac1100 genome has been subcloned as a 2.7-kb ssti-xbai dna fragment, which on transfer to pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 allows the conversion of 2,4,5-t to 2,4,5-tcp. we  have determined the directions of transcription of these genes as well as the complete nucleotide sequences of the genes and the number and sizes of the polypeptides synthesized by pulse-labeling experiments. this 2.7-kb dna fragment  encodes two polypeptides with calculated molecular masses of 51 and 18 kda. proteins of similar sizes were seen in the t7 pulse-labeling experiment in escherichia coli. we have designated the genes for these proteins tfta1 (which encodes the 51-kda protein) and tfta2 (which encodes the 18-kda protein). tfta1 and tfta2 have strong amino acid sequence homology to bena and benb from the benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase system of acinetobacter calcoaceticus, as well as to xylx and xyly from the toluate 1,2-dioxygenase system of pseudomonas putida. the  pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 strain containing the 2.7-kb ssti-xbai fragment was able to convert not only 2,4,5-t to 2,4,5-tcp but also 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic  acid to 2,4-dichlorophenol and phenoxyacetate to phenol.

AB  == pseudobactin 358 is the yellow-green fluorescent siderophore [microbial iron(iii) transport agent] produced by pseudomonas putida wcs358 under iron-limiting conditions. the genes encoding pseudobactin 358 biosynthesis are iron-regulated at the level of transcription. in this study, the molecular characterization is reported of a cosmid clone of wcs358 dna that can stimulate, in an iron-dependent manner, the activity of a wcs358 siderophore gene promoter in the heterologous pseudomonas strain a225. the functional region in the clone was identified by subcloning, transposon mutagenesis and dna sequencing as the groesl operon of strain wcs358. this increase in promoter activity was not observed when the groesl genes of strain wcs358 were integrated via a transposon vector into the genome of pseudomonas a225, indicating that multiple copies of the operon are necessary for the increase in siderophore gene promoter activity. amplification of the escherichia coli and wcs358 groesl genes also increased iron-regulated promoter activity in the parent strain wcs358. the groesl operon codes for the chaperone proteins groes and groel, which are responsible for mediating the folding and assembly of many proteins.

AB  == the application of whole-cell hybridization using labelled oligonucleotide probes in microbial systematics and ecology is limited by difficulties in permeabilizing many gram-positive organisms. in this investigation paraformaldehyde treatment, acid methanolysis and acid hydrolysis were evaluated as a means of permeabilizing mycolic-acid-containing actinomycetes prior to hybridization with a fluorescently labelled oligonucleotide probe designed to bind to a conserved sequence of bacterial 16s rrna. methods were evaluated on stationary-phase cultures of gordona bronchialis, mycobacterium fortuitum, nocardia asteroides, n. brasiliensis, rhodococcus equi, r. erythropolis, r. fascians, r. rhodochrous and  tsukamurella paurometabola, none of which could be probed following 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde fixation. for comparison and to test the general applicability of mild acid pretreatments, bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus plantarum, escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida were also studied. the data showed that most of the mycolic-acid-containing organisms were successfully permeabilized by  mild acid hydrolysis in 1 m hcl at 37 degrees c. cells were treated for different lengths of time. in general, the mycolic-acid-containing organisms required between 30 and 50 min hydrolysis, whereas b. subtilis, e. coli and p. putida were rendered permeable in only 10 min. interestingly, l. plantarum could not be permeabilized using acid hydrolysis even after 60 min exposure to 1 m hcl.

AB  == the nucleotide sequences of the hpab and hpac genes encoding the 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-hydroxylase from escherichia coli w atcc 11105 have been determined. these genes appear to be part of an operon and encode two proteins of 58,781 and 18,679 da, respectively, that are required for hydroxylase activity. this aromatic hydroxylase is nadh-dependent and uses fad as the redox chromophore. the largest component (hpab) has been purified by affinity chromatography in cibacron blue. e. coli cells that express exclusively hpab showed only a very low hydroxylase activity that was enhanced in the presence of  extracts containing the smallest protein hpac. this behavior resembles that of the coupling protein of the 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-hydroxylase from pseudomonas putida, and it might prevent the wasteful oxidation of nadh in the absence of substrate. using a promoter-probe plasmid we have demonstrated that the hpabc operon is expressed by a promoter inducible by 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid. a gene, named hpaa, encoding a protein homologous to the xyls/arac family of regulators, was identified upstream of the hydroxylase operon. the role played by hpaa in the regulation of the hpabc operon remains to be elucidated. since hpab is not homologous to other aromatic hydroxylases, we suggest that the e. coli 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-hydroxylase is the first member of a new family of two-component aromatic hydroxylases sequenced so far.

TI  == characterization of the pcar regulatory gene from pseudomonas putida, which is required for the complete degradation of p-hydroxybenzoate.
AB  == the pca branch of the beta-ketoadipate pathway in pseudomonas putida is responsible for the complete degradation of p-hydroxybenzoate through ortho cleavage of the initial pathway metabolite, protocatechuate. the pcar regulatory  locus has been found to be required for both induction of all of the genes within the pca regulon (pcabdc, pcaij, and pcaf) and the chemotactic response of the bacteria to aromatic compounds. insertional inactivation mutagenesis, using tn5 and mini-tn5 transposons, was used to locate, clone, and sequence this pcar regulatory gene. the pcar gene product, when overexpressed in escherichia coli, possessed a specific affinity for the pcaij promoter region and demonstrated that the entire pcar protein was required for this function. the deduced amino acid sequence of the pcar regulatory peptide bears little resemblance to its counterpart in the other branch of the pathway, catr, but exhibits significant homology to its regulatory antecedent, pobr, which regulates the initial breakdown of p-hydroxybenzoate into protocatechuate. comparisons of the pcaij and pcar promoter regions revealed conservation of a 15-bp sequence centered around the -10 region in both sequences. this, together with previously defined deletional studies with the pcaij promoter region, suggests that pcar exerts its  regulatory effect through protein-dna interactions within this region, which would be unusually close to the transcriptional start site of pcaij for a positive regulator.

TI  == universal barrier to lateral spread of specific genes among microorganisms.
AB  == a genetic circuit to suppress the lateral spread of cloned genes from recombinant to indigenous microorganisms in the environment has been developed. it is based on the endonucleolytic activity of the bacterial toxin colicin e3, which has a distinct target at the 3' end of the 16s ribosomal rna; this sequence is conserved in virtually all prokaryotic and many eukaryotic genera. cleavage at this sequence separates the mrna binding sites from the remainder of the 16s rrna, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. while host bacteria carrying the genes for both colicin production and colicin immunity are perfectly viable, lateral transfer of the e3 gene to non-immune recipients results in killing of such recipients. this genetic circuit decreases operational transfer frequencies  of cloned genes linked to the e3 gene among a variety of bacterial genera by four to five orders of magnitude. in combination with transposon cloning vectors, the  circuit is predicted to reduce the rate of lateral spread of specific genes to ecologically insignificant levels. this system therefore represents a useful tool both to explore the evolutionary and ecological consequences of experimentally reducing lateral gene spread among microorganisms, and to increase the ecological predictability of novel recombinant microorganisms.

AB  == cytochrome p-450cam of pseudomonas putida is a prototype of various eukaryotic cytochrome p-450 molecules. arg-112 located on the surface of this protein is highly conserved among various other cytochromes p-450. in this study, we constructed mutant genes for p-450cam in which arg-112 was replaced by gln or glu, expressed them in escherichia coli and purified the mutant proteins. their enzymic activities were analyzed in the reconstituted system to determine the function of arg-112. kd values for d-camphor of arg112-gln and arg112-glu were much the same as those of the wild-type enzyme, whereas kd values for the oxidized form of putidaredoxin, which is an acidic protein and is the redox partner of p-450cam, were 240 and 530 microm, respectively. these values are 8 and 19 times larger than that of the wild-type enzyme (28 microm), thereby indicating lower affinities of the mutant enzymes for the oxidized putidaredoxin. reaction rate constants for reduction by the reduced form of putidaredoxin, measured using the stopped flow method, were 45.5, 9.0 x 10(-3) and 9.0 x 10(-4)  s-1 for the wild type, arg112-gln and arg112-glu, respectively. thus, arg-112 of  p-450cam plays an important role in the interaction with putidaredoxin and in the high efficiency of the electron transfer; the positive charge of the residue seeming to contribute to the process. the yields in escherichia coli, the heme contents in the purified fractions and heat stability of the mutant proteins were lower than those of the wild type enzyme, suggesting that arg-112 of p-450cam is  also important for stability of p-450cam.

TI  == oxygen dependent regulation of vitreoscilla globin gene: evidence for positive regulation by fnr.
AB  == vitreoscilla globin (vgb) gene, encoding for vitreoscilla haemoglobin (vthb) has  been cloned and functionally expressed in heterologous bacterial hosts. analysis  of vgb gene expression and the study on vgb-xyle transcriptional fusion revealed  that vgb promoter is preferentially activated in response to oxygen limitation in vitreoscilla and other heterologous bacterial hosts. microaerobic mode of induction in various hosts, provided evidence for a common regulatory factor involved in activation of vgb promoter under hypoxic condition. primary structure analysis of vgb upstream regulatory region indicated the presence of a possible binding site for the transcriptional activator, fnr. further, the e.coli mutant lacking fnr gene product was not able to activate vgb promoter under microaerobic condition, suggesting the involvement of fnr or fnr-like proteins in modulating its activity. the possibility of a second level of control by crp is also indicated. oxygen responsive nature and regulatory characteristics of vgb promoter offers a novel system for the expression of gene in heterologous bacterial hosts in an oxygen dependent manner.

TI  == identification of variability of ribosomal dna spacer from pseudomonas soil isolates.
AB  == the polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the spacer region located between the 16s and 23s ribosomal rna genes of strains of pseudomonas fluorescens and pseudomonas putida isolated from peat bog, canola field, or arctic plants. some of spacer region of four of the p. fluorescens strains examined, strains 64-3, 63-28, qp5, and r17-fp2, was about 515 base pairs (bp) in length, and contained the genes for trna(ile) and trna(ala). the dna sequences of two strains from canola, 64-3 and 63-28, differed at only two positions. the sequences of the peat bog strains qp5 and r17-fp2 were identical. however, differences were noted  between the dna sequence common to the pair of strains 64-3 and 63-28 and the corresponding common sequence for strains qp5 and r17-fp2. these differences were mainly concentrated in two dna segments of 10 and 19 bp, respectively. a probe for the 19-bp variable segment that occurs in the ribosomal spacer of strains qp5 and r17-fp2 recognized total dna from these two strains, but not dna from other bacteria of different origins. these results suggest the existence of a limited degree of variability within the 16s-23s ribosomal dna spacer region, and that this variability may be useful to the recognition of particular pseudomonas strains from environmental samples.

TI  == trichloroethylene and chloroform degradation by a recombinant pseudomonad expressing soluble methane monooxygenase from methylosinus trichosporium ob3b.
AB  == soluble methane monooxygenase (smmo) from methylosinus trichosporium ob3b can degrade many halogenated aliphatic compounds that are found in contaminated soil  and groundwater. this enzyme oxidizes the most frequently detected pollutant, trichloroethylene (tce), at least 50 times faster than other enzymes. however, slow growth of the strain, strong competition between tce and methane for smmo, and repression of the smmo locus by low concentrations of copper ions limit the use of this bacterium. to overcome these obstacles, the 5.5-kb smmo locus of m. trichosporium ob3b was cloned into a wide-host-range vector (to form psmmo20), and this plasmid was electroporated into five pseudomonas strains. the best tce degradation results were obtained with pseudomonas putida f1/psmmo20. the plasmid was maintained stably, and all five of the smmo proteins (alpha, beta, and gamma  hydroxylase proteins, reductase, and component b) were observed clearly by both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western immunoblotting. tce degradation rates were quantified for p. putida f1/psmmo20 with a gas chromatograph (vmax = 5 nmol per min per mg of protein), and the recombinant strain mineralized 55% of the tce (10 microm) as indicated by measuring chloride ion concentrations with a chloride ion-specific electrode. the maximum tce degradation rate obtained with the recombinant strain was lower than  that of m. trichosporium ob3b but greater than other tce-degrading recombinants and most well-studied pseudomonads. in addition, this recombinant strain mineralizes chloroform (a specific substrate for smmo), grows much faster than m. trichosporium ob3b, and degrades tce without competitive inhibition from the growth substrate.

TI  == tol plasmid-specified xylene oxygenase is a wide substrate range monooxygenase capable of olefin epoxidation.
AB  == xylene oxygenase, which is encoded on the tol plasmid pwwo of pseudomonas putida  mt-2, is a key enzyme system in the degradation of toluene and xylenes by this organism. it was expressed in an escherichia coli recombinant strain carrying the xylma structural genes. this recombinant, which expressed xylene oxygenase from the heat-shock induced lambda pl promoter, was analyzed for its potential as a biocatalytic tool so as to effect the oxidation of side chains of aromatic hydrocarbons to the corresponding alcohols. compounds that were tested as potential substrates carried different substituents on the aromatic ring at ortho, meta, and para positions, relative to the methyl moiety. products that accumulated after administration of the aromatic hydrocarbons to concentrated suspensions of the recombinant were identified by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. toluene derivatives with ortho substituents could not serve as substrates for the biocatalyst, whereas a number of meta- or para- substituted analogs were efficiently oxidized to the corresponding benzylalcohols. bioconversion of the substrates by resting cells varied from 3 mumol min-1 g-1 cell dry weight for 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene to 18 mumol min-1 g-1 cell dry weight  for meta-xylene. whole cells that expressed xylene oxygenase did catalyze the oxidation of the methyl substituent attached to a benzene ring, but no conversion of n-alkylbenzene derivatives with longer side chains was observed. although the  ethyl group of ethylbenzene could not be converted by the biocatalyst, cells containing xylene oxygenase were capable of oxidizing the ethylene side group of  styrene to produce styrene epoxide.

TI  == role for the outer membrane ferric siderophore receptor pupb in signal transduction across the bacterial cell envelope.
AB  == the outer membrane protein pupb of pseudomonas putida wcs358 facilitates transport of iron complexed to the siderophores pseudobactin bn8 and pseudobactin bn7 into the cell. its synthesis is induced by the presence of these specific siderophores under iron limitation. the signal transduction pathway regulating siderophore-dependent expression of pupb was shown to consist of two regulatory proteins, pupi and pupr, and the pupb receptor itself. mutational analysis of the regulatory genes suggested that pupi acts as a positive regulator of pupb transcription, whereas pupr modifies pupi activity dependent on the presence of pseudobactin bn8. pupi and pupr do not share homology with the classical bacterial two-component systems but display significant similarity to the feci and fecr proteins of escherichia coli involved in regulation of ferric dicitrate  transport. the function of the pupb receptor in pupb regulation was studied by the use of chimeric receptor proteins composed of pupb and the ferric pseudobactin 358 receptor pupa. this experiment revealed that pupb is involved in the initiation of the signal transduction pathway, implying a so far unique role  for an outer membrane protein in signal transduction.

TI  == oxa1, a saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear gene whose sequence is conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes controls cytochrome oxidase biogenesis.
AB  == yeast cells carrying a mutation in the oxa1 nuclear gene are respiratory deficient and lack cytochrome oxidase activity. we successively examined the different steps in the expression of the mitochondrial genes encoding the cytochrome oxidase subunits and apocytochrome b in strains carrying the oxa1-79 mutation. the ox1-79 strains exhibit a total absence of cytochrome aa3 and a decrease in cytochrome b, even in a strain devoid of mitochondrial introns, in which cox1 and cytb mrnas normally accumulate. the three mitochondrial-encoded subunits of cytochrome oxidase are still detectable although their amount is reduced, and apocytochrome b is synthesized normally. these results suggest that  the oxa1 gene is primary required at a post-translational step in cytochrome oxidase biogenesis, probably at the level of assembly, although the oxa1-79 mutation leads to some pleiotropic secondary defects in earlier steps of mitochondrial gene expression. the oxa1 gene has been cloned, sequenced, and disrupted. the phenotypes of the oxa1::leu2 and oxa1-79 alleles are similar. interestingly, the oxa1 gene, located on the yeast chromosome viii, is adjacent to the gene pet 122, which controls the initiation of cox3 mrna translation. in addition, the predicted oxa1 protein is homologous to several putative prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins, suggesting that the function of the oxa1 protein is important for respiration in all living cells.

TI  == genetic evidence that the xyls regulator of the pseudomonas tol meta operon controls the pm promoter through weak dna-protein interactions.
AB  == the activation of the pm promoter of the meta operon of the tol plasmid of pseudomonas putida by its cognate xyls activator protein in the presence and absence of benzoate inducers has been examined in specialized escherichia coli strains carrying pm-lacz fusions and the xyls gene in different configurations in which all controlling elements are present in near native conditions and stoichometry. expression of a chromosomal pm-xylx::lacz fusion was primarily dependent on the addition of an effector at a low xyls gene dosage, but such dependency decreased with increasing levels of the regulator, to the point that hyperproduced xyls could, in the absence of any aromatic effector, raise expression to a level 10(4)-fold higher than normal basal levels. pm activity never reached a defined saturation level within the range of intracellular concentrations permitted by the intrinsic solubility of the protein, thus suggesting a low degree of occupancy of the omr and oml (om right and left half-sites, respectively) operator sequences by xyls. this was confirmed by transcription interference experiments, which indicated that the frequency of occupation of pm by active xyls is low. this property permits a fine tuning of pm activity in vivo through changes in intracellular xyls concentrations, as is predicted in current models to account for the coordinated regulation of tol operons.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of a 2,5-dichloro-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-diol dehydrogenase gene involved in the degradation of gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane in  pseudomonas paucimobilis.
AB  == in pseudomonas paucimobilis ut26, gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-hch) is converted to 2,5-dichloro-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-diol (2,5-ddol), which is then metabolized to 2,5-dichlorohydroquinone. here, we isolated from the genomic library of ut26 two genes which expressed 2,5-ddol dehydrogenase activity when they were transformed into p. putida and escherichia coli. both gene products had an apparent molecular size of 28 kda by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the first gene, named linc, located separately from the two genes (lina and linb) which we had already cloned as genes involved in the gamma-hch degradation. the other, named linx, located about 1 kb upstream of the  lina gene encoding gamma-hch dehydrochlorinase. a gamma-hch degradation-negative  mutant, named ut72, which lacked the whole linc gene but had the intact linx gene was isolated. the linc gene given in a plasmid could complement ut72. these results strongly suggest that the linc gene but not the linx gene is essential for the assimilation of gamma-hch in ut26. deduced amino acid sequences of linc and linx show homology to those of members of the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase family.

TI  == identification of serine-143 as the most likely precursor of dehydroalanine in the active site of histidine ammonia-lyase. a study of the overexpressed enzyme by site-directed mutagenesis.
AB  == the gene coding for histidase (histidine ammonia-lyase, hal, ec 4.3.1.3) was isolated from a lambda-embl3 genomic library from pseudomonas putida nicii and subcloned into the expression vector pt7-7. transformation of escherichia coli bl21 (de3) cells with the recombinant vector led to the expression of catalytically active histidase amounting to 20-30% of the total soluble protein in the crude cell extract. a new rapid and highly efficient isolation procedure is described leading to electrophoretically homogeneous histidase within 1.5 days. six grams of e. coli bl21 (de3) cells (wet weight) gives approximately 100  mg of homogeneous histidase with a specific activity of 27 iu/mg. to investigate  the possible role of serine as a precursor of dehydroalanine in the active site of histidase, each of the four serines, conserved in all known histidases and phenylalanine ammonia-lyases, was consecutively changed to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. the resulting mutant genes were subcloned into the expression vector pt7-7 and were assayed for histidase activity. the catalytic activities of the four mutants and of wild-type histidase were compared. the km and vmax values of the overexpressed mutants s112a, s393a, and s418a and wild-type histidase did not show any significant differences. mutant s143a, however, was devoid of catalytic activity (< 0.01%), pointing to the outstanding  importance of this serine for the formation of an active enzyme. we conclude that serine-143 is the most probable precursor of the active-site dehydroalanine. the  role of serine-143 in the biosynthesis of active histidase is discussed.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == subtraction hybridisation and shot-gun sequencing: a new approach to identify symbiotic loci.
AB  == traditionally, new loci involved in the rhizobium-legume symbiosis have been identified by transposon mutagenesis and/or complementation. wide dispersal of the symbiotic loci in rhizobium species ngr234, as well as the large number of potential host-plants to be screened, greatly reduces the efficiency of these techniques. as an alternate strategy designed to identify new ngr234 genes involved in the early stages of the symbiosis, we combined data from competitive  rna hybridisation, subtractive dna hybridisation and shot-gun sequencing. on the  assumption that the expression of most nodulation genes is triggered by compounds released by the host-plant, we identified, in the ordered cosmid library of the large symbiotic plasmid pngr234a, restriction fragments that carry transcripts induced by flavonoids. to target genes not present in the closely related strain  r. fredii usda257, we selected fragments that also carried sequences purified by  subtractive dna hybridisation. shot-gun sequencing of this subset of fragments lead to the identification of sequences with strong homology to diverse prokaryotic genes/proteins. amongst these, a symbiotically active orf from pngr234a, is highly homologous to the leucine responsive regulatory protein of escherichia coli (lrp), is induced by flavonoids, and is not present in usda257.

AB  == the genetic accessibility of selected acidophilic bacteria was investigated to evaluate their applicability to degrading pollutants in acidic environments. the  incp1 antibiotic resistance plasmids rp4 and pvk101 and the phenol degradation-encoding plasmid ppgh11 were transferred from neutrophilic bacteria into the extreme acidophilic eubacterium acidiphilium cryptum at frequencies of 1.8 x 10(-2) to 9.8 x 10(-4) transconjugants per recipient cell. the incq antibiotic resistance plasmid psup106 was mobilizable to a. cryptum by triparental matings at a frequency of 10(-5) transconjugants per recipient cell.  in the transconjugants, antibiotic resistances and the ability to degrade phenol  were expressed. a. cryptum ac6 (ppgh11) grew with 2.5 mm phenol at a doubling time of 12 h and a yield of 0.52 g (dry cell weight) per g of phenol. a. cryptum  harbored five native plasmids of 255 to 6.3 kb in size. plasmids rp4 and pvk101 were transferred from escherichia coli into acidobacterium capsulatum at frequencies of 10(-3) and 2.3 x 10(-4) and to the facultative autotroph thiobacillus acidophilus at frequencies of 1.1 x 10(-5) and 2.9 x 10(-6) transconjugants per recipient cell, respectively. plasmid ppgh11 could not be transferred into the latter strains. t. acidophilus wild type contained six so far cryptic plasmids of 220 to 5 kb.

TI  == cloning, sequencing, and expression in escherichia coli of the d-hydantoinase gene from pseudomonas putida and distribution of homologous genes in other microorganisms.
AB  == pseudomonas putida dsm 84 produces n-carbamyl-d-amino acids from the corresponding d-5-monosubstituted hydantoins. the gene encoding this d-hydantoinase enzyme was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the nucleotide sequence of the 1.8-kb insert of subclone pges19 was determined. one open reading frame of 1,104 bp was found and was predicted to encode a polypeptide with a molecular size of 40.5 kda. local regions of identity between  the predicted amino acid sequence and that of other known amidohydrolases (two other d-hydantoinases, allantionase and dihydroorotase) were found. the d-hydantoinase gene was used as a probe to screen dna isolated from diverse organisms. within pseudomonas strains of rrna group i, the probe was specific. the probe did not detect d-hydantoinase genes in pseudomonads not in rrna group i, other bacteria, or plants known to express d-hydantoinase activity.

AB  == 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme (cmle; ec 5.5.1.5) from neurospora  crassa catalyzes the reversible gamma-lactonization of 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate by a syn-1,2 addition-elimination reaction. the stereochemical and regiochemical  course of the reaction is (i) opposite that of cmle from pseudomonas putida (ec 5.5.1.2) and (ii) identical to that of cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme (mle;  ec 5.5.1.1) from p. putida. in order to determine the mechanistic and evolutionary relationships between n. crassa cmle and the procaryotic cycloisomerases, we have purified cmle from n. crassa to homogeneity and determined its nucleotide sequence from a cdna clone isolated from a p-hydroxybenzoate-induced n. crassa cdna library. the deduced amino acid sequence predicts a protein of 41.2 kda (365 residues) which does not exhibit sequence similarity with any of the bacterial cycloisomerases. the cdna encoding n. crassa cmle was expressed in escherichia coli, and the purified recombinant protein exhibits physical and kinetic properties equivalent to those found for the isolated n. crassa enzyme. we also report that n. crassa cmle possesses substantially reduced yet significant levels of mle activity with cis,cis-muconate and, furthermore, does not appear to be dependent on divalent metals for activity. these data suggest that the n. crassa cmle may represent a novel eucaryotic motif in the cycloisomerase enzyme family.

TI  == fur regulon in gram-negative bacteria. identification and characterization of new iron-regulated escherichia coli genes by a fur titration assay.
AB  == a highly sensitive genetic screen for the detection of cloned genes coding for iron-regulated and iron-storage/binding proteins was developed. the fur titration assay (furta) enabled identification of cloned iron-regulated genes from different gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria such as: bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, pantoea agglomerans, pseudomonas putida, salmonella typhimurium, serratia marcescens and yersinia enterocolitica. an ordered e. coli  cosmid library was screened for either new genes containing fur-box nucleotide sequences or genes coding for iron-storage/binding proteins. among 150 cosmids covering approximately 85% of the e. coli genome, 24 cosmids were identified as positive by furta. nine of them contained new e. coli fur-regulated genes and/or  iron-storage/binding genes since they mapped at loci different to any of the known fur-box containing genes. a new e. coli gene encoding a 8.7 kda high-potential iron-sulfur-like protein was identified, cloned and sequenced. the fur titration assay was also used to probe in vivo interaction between fur repressor and different synthetic plasmid-located fur-boxes. non-optimal base-pairs in one half of the fur-box nucleotide sequence led to a dramatic decrease of fur repressor affinity. a synthetic fur-box with changes in both fur-box halves was no longer bound by the fur repressor complex in vivo.

TI  == [controlled-expression vector for pseudomonas bacteria involving regulatory elements of trpiba genes of pseudomonas putida].
AB  == a bireplicon controlled-expression vector pps10 was developed based, on trpiba genes of pseudomonas putida. it is a low-copy-number vector in pseudomonas bacteria, and a high-copy-number vector in escherichia coli. the vector is 10.4 kilobase pairs (kb), determines resistance to kanamycin, carries a replicon of cryptic pseudomonas pmk1 plasmid; a pbr322 replicon; the par locus of pmt2 plasmid; and the trpi gene of p. putida, which encodes the activator protein and  the promoter pba of trpba genes. expression of the promoter is induced by the trpi protein activator and the precursor of tryptophan, indole-3-glycerolphosphate (ingp). ingp is an unstable compound, and its accumulation in bacterial cells is ensured by using trpe mutants grown in the presence of anthranilate; no ingp is produced among trpe mutants on the media supplemented with tryptophan. as shown in the phea gene of e. coli, the expression of genetic material cloned under control of the pba promoter into the  pps10 vector, may be enhanced more than 70-fold in cells of pseudomonas under conditions of ingp accumulation.

TI  == construction of hybrid biphenyl (bph) and toluene (tod) genes for functional analysis of aromatic ring dioxygenases.
AB  == multicomponent enzyme complexes of biphenyl (bp) dioxygenase (dox) encoded by the gene cluster, bpha1a2a3a4 in pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes strain kf707 [taira et al., j. biol. chem. 267 (1992) 4844-4858] and toluene dox encoded by the gene cluster, todc1c2ba in p. putida strain f1 [zylstra et al., j. biol. chem. 264 (1989) 14940-14946], show high homologies (approx. 60%) for the corresponding subunit component in spite of the fact that they have discrete substrate specificities. we constructed hybrid gene clusters by replacing the gene component(s) between the large and small subunits of terminal dox in the bph and  tod gene clusters, and analyzed the function of a novel hybrid aromatic ring dox. escherichia coli cells expressing the hybrid gene clusters, todc1::bpha2a3a4, todc1c2::bpha3a4 and bpha1::todc2::bpha3a4, gained the ability to convert benzene-toluene and their derivatives to the dihydrodiols, indicating that the hybrid terminal dox composed of todc1::bpha2 and bpha1::todc2 forms a functionally active multicomponent dox associated with ferredoxin (fer) (bpha3) and fer reductase (bpha4). moreover, hybrid dox (composed of todc1::bpha2a3a4 and todc1c2::bpha3a4) showed a wide substrate specificity rather similar to that of the wild-type toluene dox (todc1c2ba). on the other hand, the hybrid dox (bpha1::todc2::bpha3a4) showed oxidative activities for the same compounds, but the rate of oxidation was dependent upon the substrate. these results suggest that (i) the two subunits of terminal dox are critically involved in the substrate specificity for bp, benzene and their derivatives, and (ii) the electron transport proteins, fer and fer reductase, are exchangeable with one another between the bp dox and toluene dox complexes.

TI  == fpta, the fe(iii)-pyochelin receptor of pseudomonas aeruginosa: a phenolate siderophore receptor homologous to hydroxamate siderophore receptors.
AB  == the pseudomonas aeruginosa siderophore pyochelin is structurally unique among siderophores and possesses neither hydroxamate- nor catecholate-chelating groups. the structural gene encoding the 75-kda outer membrane fe(iii)-pyochelin receptor fpta has been isolated by plasmid rescue techniques and sequenced. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the isolated fpta protein corresponded to that deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the fpta structural gene. the mature fpta protein has 682 amino acids and a molecular mass of 75,993 da and has considerable overall homology with the hydroxamate siderophore receptors fpva of p. aeruginosa, pupa and pupb of pseudomonas putida, and fhue of escherichia coli. this observation indicates that homologies between siderophore receptors are an unreliable predictor of siderophore ligand class recognition by a given receptor. the fpta gene was strongly regulated by iron; fpta transcription was totally repressed by 30 microm fecl3, as determined by northern (rna) blotting. the promoter of the fpta gene contained the sequence 5'-ataatgataagcattatc-3', which  matches the consensus e. coli fur-binding site at 17 of 18 positions. the -10 promoter region and transcriptional start site of the fpta gene reside within this fur-binding site.

AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the pseudomonas sp. strain m114 pbua gene, encoding the outer membrane receptor for ferric pseudobactin m114, has been determined. the region sequenced spans 2788 bases of plasmid pcup3, within which the receptor gene had previously been localised. a single open reading frame, potentially encoding 826 amino acids and including a leader peptide of 44 amino acids, is evident and is followed by an inverted repeat segment, which may act as a transcriptional terminator. a 20 bp region of dna, having significant homology with the e. coli fur-binding consensus sequence, is located upstream of the open  reading frame. pbua displays characteristics in common with other outer membrane  proteins and displays strong homology with the tonb boxes of both e. coli and pseudomonas receptors. more extensive homologies were found with the pupa receptor of p. putida wcs358 and the fhue and btub receptors of e. coli. it is suggested that areas exhibiting the least homology between these receptors may represent ferric siderophore-specific recognition sites of the pbua protein. the  deduced amino acid sequence of pbua was compared with that of pupx, encoding the  outer membrane receptor for ferric pseudobactin b10, of pseudomonas sp. strain b  10. a direct alignment of the two proteins gave an identity score of 92.5%. the distribution of pbua-like receptors among pseudomonas isolates was investigated by dna-dna hybridisation analysis. the results suggest that a pbua-like receptor  may be widely distributed among pseudomonas rhizosphere isolates.

TI  == molecular characterization of microbial alcohol dehydrogenases.
AB  == there is an astonishing array of microbial alcohol oxidoreductases. they display  a wide variety of substrate specificities and they fulfill several vital but quite different physiological functions. some of these enzymes are involved in the production of alcoholic beverages and of industrial solvents, others are important in the production of vinegar, and still others participate in the degradation of naturally occurring and xenobiotic aromatic compounds as well as in the growth of bacteria and yeasts on methanol. they can be divided into three  major categories. (1) the nad- or nadp-dependent dehydrogenases. these can in turn be divided into the group i long-chain (approximately 350 amino acid residues) zinc-dependent enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenases i, ii, and iii of saccharomyces cerevisiae or the plasmid-encoded benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase of pseudomonas putida; the group ii short-chain (approximately 250 residues) zinc-independent enzymes such as ribitol dehydrogenase of klebsiella aerogenes; the group iii "iron-activated" enzymes that generally contain approximately 385 amino acid residues, such as alcohol dehydrogenase ii of zymomonas mobilis and alcohol dehydrogenase iv of saccharomyces cerevisiae, but may contain almost 900  residues in the case of the multifunctional alcohol dehydrogenases of escherichia coli and clostridium acetobutylicum. the aldehyde/alcohol oxidoreductase of amycolatopsis methanolica and the methanol dehydrogenases of a. methanolica and mycobacterium gasti are 4-nitroso-n,n-dimethylaniline-dependent nicotinoproteins. (2) nad(p)-independent enzymes that use pyrroloquinoline quinone, haem or cofactor f420 as cofactor, exemplified by methanol dehydrogenase of paracoccus denitrificans, ethanol dehydrogenase of acetobacter and gluconobacter spp. and the alcohol dehydrogenases of certain archaebacteria. (3) oxidases that catalyze  an essentially irreversible oxidation of alcohols, such as methanol oxidase of hansenula polymorpha and probably the veratryl alcohol oxidases of certain fungi  involved in lignin degradation. this review deals mainly with those enzymes for which complete amino acid sequences are available. the discussion focuses on a comparison of their primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures and their catalytic mechanisms. the physiological roles of the enzymes and isoenzymes are also considered, as are their probable evolutionary relationships.

TI  == molecular analysis of the erwinia chrysanthemi region containing the kdga and zwf genes.
AB  == the pathways of pectin and galacturonate catabolism in erwinia chrysanthemi converge to form a common intermediate, 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate, which is phosphorylated to form 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (kdgp) and then cleaved  by the aldolase encoded by the kdga gene. we cloned the kdga gene of the e. chrysanthemi strain 3937 by complementing an escherichia coli kdga mutation, using an rp4-derivative plasmid. restriction mapping of the kdga region and isolation of kdga-lac fusions allowed the more precise localization of the kdga gene and determination of its transcriptional direction. the nucleotide sequence  of the kdga region indicated that the kdga reading frame is 639 bases long, corresponding to a protein of 213 amino acids with a molecular mass of 22,187 da. comparison of the deduced primary amino acid sequences of the e. chrysanthemi kdgp-aldolase to the e. coli, zymomonas mobilis and pseudomonas putida enzymes showed that they are highly conserved. the e. chrysanthemi kdga structural gene begins 153 bases downstream of an open reading frame that has a high homology with the zwf e. coli gene encoding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. the zwf gene is also linked to eda (kdga) in e. coli and p. putida but genetic organization is different. regulation of zwf and kdga expression in e. chrysanthemi was analysed using lacz fusions. the expression of zwf is independent of the growth rate, but is repressed in the presence of glucose. induction of kdga by pectin-degradation products is mediated in vivo by the negative regulatory gene kdgr, which also controls all the steps of pectin degradation.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == in pseudomonas putida paw85, the ortho-cleavage pathway is used for catechol degradation. the 11.4-kb xhoi fragment cloned from phenol degradation plasmid pest1226 into pkt240 (recombinant plasmid pat1140) contains the inducible pheba operon that encodes catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (gene pheb) and phenol monooxygenase (gene phea), the first two enzymes for the phenol degradation pathway. the promoter of the pheba operon is mapped 1.5 kb upstream of the pheb gene. the plasmid pat1140, when introduced into p. putida paw85, enables the bacteria to use the hybrid plasmid-chromosome-encoded pathway for phenol degradation. the synthesis of the plasmid-encoded phenol monooxygenase and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase is induced by cis,cis-muconate. the expression studies of the deletion subclones derived from pat1140 revealed that the transcription of the pheba operon is positively controlled by a regulatory protein that is chromosomally encoded in p. putida. cis,cis-muconate in cooperation with positive transcription factor catr activates the transcription of the chromosomal ortho-pathway genes cata and catbc in p. putida (r. k. rothmel, t. l. aldrich, j. e. houghton, w. m. coco, l. n. ornston, and a. m. chakrabarty, j. bacteriol. 172:922-931, 1990). the inability to express the pheba operon in a p. putida catr- background and activation of transcription of the pheba operon in escherichia coli in the presence of the catr-expressing plasmid demonstrated that the transcription of the pheba operon in p. putida paw85 carrying pest1226 is controlled by the chromosomally encoded catr.

TI  == evidence for autoregulation of camr, which encodes a repressor for the cytochrome p-450cam hydroxylase operon on the pseudomonas putida cam plasmid.
AB  == the regulatory gene camr on the cam plasmid of pseudomonas putida (atcc 17453) negatively controls expression of the cytochrome p-450cam hydroxylase operon (camdcab) for the camphor degradation pathway and is oriented in a direction opposite to that of the camdcab operon. in this study, we examined expression of  the camr gene by monitoring the beta-galactosidase activity of camr-lacz translational fusions in p. putida camr and camr+ strains. we found that the camr gene was autogenously regulated by its own product, camr. to search for an operator site of the camr gene, a cam repressor (camr)-overproducing plasmid, phaov1, was constructed by placing the camr gene under the control of a pl promoter. the translational initiation codon of camr was changed by site-directed mutagenesis from gtg to atg to improve translation efficiency. judging from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, the camr protein was expressed up to about 10% of the soluble protein of camr-overproducing escherichia coli jm83/phaov1 cells. results of dnase i footprinting assays using the cell lysate indicated that the camr repressor covered a single region between the camr gene and the camdcab operon. our findings also suggest that the camr gene autogenously regulates its own expression by binding of the gene product, camr, to the operator, which also serves as an operator of the camdcab operon.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and biosynthesis of indole antibiotics produced by xenorhabdus nematophilus.
AB  == we have investigated the mechanism of action and physiology of production of the  indole derivative antibiotics produced by the nematode-associated, entomopathogenic bacterium xenorhabdus nematophilus. maximum antibiotic concentration was reached during the late stationary phase of growth, and the antibiotic yield was appreciably enhanced by supplementation with tryptophan. antibiotic biosynthesis apparently involved the removal of the side-chain carboxyl (c-1) carbon of tryptophan. the c-3 methylene carbon of tryptophan, on the other hand, was retained. the purified indole antibiotic was effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria at low to moderate concentrations causing a severe inhibition of rna synthesis, accompanied by a less severe effect on protein synthesis. an isogenic pair of escherichia coli strains differing at the rela locus was used to demonstrate that the swift reduction in total rna synthesis is related to an antibiotic-induced accumulation of the regulatory nucleotide, ppgpp, in susceptible bacteria. the e. coli rela mutant, which does not exhibit any discernible increase in ppgpp upon antibiotic  treatment, showed no decrease in growth or rna synthesis. using this antibiotic,  it was also observed that ppgpp may be employed as a metabolic regulator in bacteria such as pseudomonas putida, which have not previously been reported to employ ppgpp as a regulatory molecule. we propose that the indole derivative antibiotic exerts growth inhibitory control in susceptible bacteria by greatly enhancing synthesis of ppgpp, resulting in a rapid inhibition of rna synthesis.

AB  == in a previous study of mutations in trfa, the gene encoding the replication initiation protein of the broad host-range plasmid rk2, a carboxyl-terminal deletion of 3 amino acids of the trfa protein was found to be completely nonfunctional for rk2 replication in escherichia coli and other gram-negative bacteria. in this work site-directed mutagenesis of the trfa gene was carried out to construct trfa proteins altered in the three carboxyl-terminal positions. specifically, trfa proteins with deletions or substitutions of the terminal cysteine, lysine, and arginine (codons 380-382, respectively) were constructed and characterized for their ability to initiate replication from an rk2 origin in vivo in e. coli, azotobacter vinelandii, pseudomonas putida, and agrobacterium tumefaciens and for binding activity to the iterons at the replication origin. substitutions of the cysteine at position 380 with a glycine or an arginine resulted in a trfa protein defective in binding to the rk2 origin and, therefore, defective in replication initiation activity in all four gram-negative bacteria.  substitution of a serine at that position preserved limited function in replication and dna binding. the lysine at position 381 could be changed to a glutamine without any obvious change in trfa function. deletion of the terminal arginine at position 382 did not affect the ability of trfa to bind to origin iterons but caused a complete loss of replication activity in all four bacteria.  substitution of this terminal arginine with alanine, serine, or glutamic acid also produced replication-defective trfa protein in all four bacterial hosts while not affecting iteron binding activity. however, substitution of this arginine with a lysine resulted in a loss of replication activity in e. coli and  a. vinelandii but had no effect in p. putida and a. tumefaciens. these observations suggest that the terminal arginine plays an essential role in the activity of the trfa protein, possibly interaction with host proteins, which can  be separated from its iteron binding activity.

TI  == a substrate-dependent biological containment system for pseudomonas putida based  on the escherichia coli gef gene.
AB  == a model substrate-dependent suicide system to biologically contain pseudomonas putida kt2440 is reported. the system consists of two elements. one element carries a fusion between a synthetic lac promoter (pa1-04/03) and the gef gene, which encodes a killing function. this element is contained within a transposaseless mini-tn5 transposon so that it can be integrated at random locations on the pseudomonas chromosome. the second element, harbored by plasmid  pcc102, is designed to control the first and bears a fusion between the promoter  of the p. putida tol plasmid-encoded meta-cleavage pathway operon (pm) and the laci gene, encoding the lac repressor, plus xyls2, coding for a positive regulator of pm. in liquid culture under optimal growth conditions and in sterile and nonsterile soil microcosms, p. putida kt2440 (pwwo) bearing the containment system behaves as designed. in the presence of a xyls effector, such as m-methylbenzoate, the laci protein is synthesized, preventing the expression of the killing function. in the absence of effectors, expression of the pa1-04/03::gef cassette is no longer prevented and a high rate of cell killing is observed. fluctuation test analyses revealed that mutants resistant to cell killing arise at a frequency of around 10(-5) to 10(-6) per cell per generation.  mutations are linked to the killing element rather than to the regulatory one. in bacteria bearing two copies of the killing cassette, the rate of appearance of mutants resistant to killing decreased to as low as 10(-8) per cell per generation.

TI  == early and late responses of tol promoters to pathway inducers: identification of  postexponential promoters in pseudomonas putida with lacz-tet bicistronic reporters.
AB  == transcriptional lacz fusions to the pu and pm promoters of the tol (toluene degradation) plasmid inserted in monocopy in the chromosome of pseudomonas putida showed a very different responsiveness to their respective aromatic effectors regarding growth phase. while a substantial xyls-dependent activation of pm-lacz  was detected nearly instantly after m-toluate addition, xylr- and xylene-mediated induction of the sigma 54 promoter pu became significant only after cells slowed  down exponential growth and entered stationary phase. when pu and pm were fused to lacz-tet reporters (i.e., promoterless lacz genes coupled to a tet gene which  confers resistance to tetracycline when cotranscribed with the leading gene) instead of lacz alone, the resulting colonies displayed a distinct phenotype consisting of hyperfluorescence on agar plates after being sprayed with 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-d-galactoside, simultaneously with being either sensitive (pu) or resistant (pm) to tetracycline. to examine whether the same phenotype could be scored in strains carrying transcriptional fusions of the lacz-tet cassettes to other genes or promoters whose expression is silenced during growth and activated in stationary phase, we constructed mini-tn5 lacz-tet transposons for random genetic probing of promoters preferentially active at advanced stages of growth. chromosomal insertions of this mobile element were selected by means of the constitutive resistance to kanamycin which is also specified by the transposon. a number of kanamycin-resistant colonies which are hyperfluorescent with 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-d-galactosidase but sensitive to  tetracycline and which reached full induction only at postexponential growth stages were obtained.

AB  == the genes that encode the alpha and beta subunits of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (3,4-pcd [ec 1.13.11.3]) were cloned from a pseudomonas putida (formerly p. aeruginosa) (atcc 23975) genomic library prepared in lambda phage. plaques were screened by hybridization with degenerate oligonucleotides designed  using known amino acid sequences. a 1.5-kb smai fragment from a 15-kb primary clone was subcloned, sequenced, and shown to contain two successive open reading  frames, designated pcah and pcag, corresponding to the beta and alpha subunits, respectively, of 3,4-pcd. the amino acid sequences deduced from pcahg matched the chemically determined sequence of 3,4-pcd in all except three positions. cloning  of pcahg into broad-host-range expression vector pkmy319 allowed high levels of expression in p. putida strains, as well as in proteus mirabilis after specific induction of the plasmid-encoded nahg promoter with salicylate. the recombinant enzyme was purified and crystallized from p. mirabilis, which lacks an endogenous 3,4-pcd. the physical, spectroscopic, and kinetic properties of the recombinant enzyme were indistinguishable from those of the wild-type enzyme. moreover, the same transient enzyme intermediates were formed during the catalytic cycle. these studies establish the methodology which will allow mechanistic investigations to  be pursued through site-directed mutagenesis of p. putida 3,4-pcd, the only aromatic ring-cleaving dioxygenase for which the three-dimensional structure is known.

TI  == cbbr, a lysr-type transcriptional activator, is required for expression of the autotrophic co2 fixation enzymes of xanthobacter flavus.
AB  == xanthobacter flavus is able to grow autotrophically with the enzymes of the calvin cycle for the fixation of co2, which are specified by the cbblsxfp gene cluster. previously, the 5' end of an open reading frame (cbbr), displaying a high sequence similarity to the lysr family of regulatory proteins and transcribed divergently from cbblsxfp, was identified (w. g. meijer, a. c. arnberg, h. g. enequist, p. terpstra, m. e. lidstrom, and l. dijkhuizen, mol. gen. genet. 225:320-330, 1991). this paper reports the complete nucleotide sequence of cbbr and a functional characterization of the gene. the cbbr gene of  x. flavus specifies a 333-amino-acid polypeptide, with a molecular weight of 35,971. downstream from cbbr, the 3' end of an open reading frame displaying a high similarity to orf60k from pseudomonas putida and orf261 from bacillus subtilis was identified. orf60k and orf261 are located at the replication origin  of the bacterial chromosome. inactivation of cbbr, via the insertion of an antibiotic resistance gene, rendered x. flavus unable to grow autotrophically. this was caused not by an inability to oxidize autotrophic substrates (e.g., formate) but by a complete lack of expression of the cbb genes. the expression of the cbbr protein in escherichia coli was achieved by placing cbbr behind a strong promoter and optimization of the translational signals of cbbr. cbbr binds specifically to two binding sites in the cbbr-cbbl intergenic region.

TI  == stabilization of creatinase from pseudomonas putida by random mutagenesis.
AB  == creatinase (creatine amidinohydrolase, ec 3.5.3.3) from pseudomonas putida is a homodimer of 45 kda subunit molecular mass, the three-dimensional structure of which is known at 1.9 a resolution. three point mutants, a109v, v355m, and v182i, as well as one double mutant combining a109v and v355m, and the triple mutant with all three replacements, were compared with wild-type creatinase regarding their physical and enzymological properties. high-resolution crystal data for wild-type creatinase and the first two mutants suggest isomorphism at least for these three proteins (r. huber, pers. comm.). physicochemical measurements confirm this prediction, showing that the mutations have no effect either on the  quaternary structure and gross conformation or the catalytic properties as compared to wild-type creatinase. the replacement of v182 (at the solvent-exposed end of the first helix of the c-terminal domain) does not cause significant differences in comparison with the wild-type enzyme. the other point mutations stabilize the first step in the biphasic denaturation transition without affecting the second one. in sum, the enhanced stability seems to reflect slight  improvements in the local packing without creating new well-defined bonds. the increase in hydrophobicity generated by the introduction of additional methyl groups (a109v, v182i) must be compensated by minor readjustments of the global structure. secondary or quaternary interactions are not affected. in going from single to double and triple mutants, to a first approximation, the increments of  stabilization are additive.

AB  == histidine ammonia-lyase (hal) from pseudomonas putida prs1 contains a catalytically important electrophilic center reported to be dehydroalanine. little is known about the origin of this group or its linkage to the protein. to  initiate structural studies on this enzyme, p. putida hal was purified from an escherichia coli high-expression clone in which the hal gene (huth) was under the control of the lambda pl promoter on a plasmid vector. in this clone from 6 to 10% of the soluble cell protein after heat induction was hal and approximately 200 mg of 95% pure hal could be obtained from 120 g wet weight of cells in a 40 to 60% yield. the overexpressed protein was identical to p. putida hal in native  molecular weight (220 kda), subunit composition (four identical subunits of 53 kda each), affinity for substrate (l-histidine km of 5.3 mm at ph 9.0), and its sensitivity to inactivation by cyanide and bisulfite. the n-terminal amino acid sequence was in agreement with the dna-predicted sequence, indicating proper translational initiation. these features make this enzyme an appropriate candidate for protein structure investigations regarding the nature of the electrophilic center and its association with the protein.

TI  == identification and characterization of a siderophore regulatory gene (pfra) of pseudomonas putida wcs358: homology to the alginate regulatory gene algq of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == genes encoding biosynthesis of pseudobactin 358 (a microbial iron transport agent) and its cognate outer membrane receptor protein, pupa, are transcribed only under iron limitation in plant growth-promoting pseudomonas putida wcs358. two cosmid clones were identified from a gene bank of wcs358 dna which could independently and in an iron-dependent manner activate transcription from a wcs358 siderophore gene promoter in heterologous pseudomonas strain a225. the functional region of one of the clones was localized by subcloning, transposon tn3gus mutagenesis, and dna sequencing. genomic transposon insertion mutants in the functional region lost the capacity to activate a siderophore gene promoter fusion transcriptionally; furthermore, these mutants no longer produced pseudobactin 358. the activating region consisted of a single gene designated pfra (pseudomonas ferric regulator). the pfra gene codes for a single polypeptide, pfra, of approximately 18 kda, which has 58% identity to algq (also  known as algr2), a positive regulator involved in transcriptionally regulating alginate biosynthesis in pseudomonas aeruginosa. cross-complementation studies between the pfra gene of p. putida and the algq gene of p. aeruginosa revealed that pfra can restore mucoidy (alginate production) in an algq mutant and that algq could poorly complement a pfra genomic mutant. it is concluded that pfra is  involved in the positive regulation of siderophore biosynthetic genes in response to iron limitation; furthermore, pfra and algq appeared to be interchangeable between p. putida and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == cloning, expression and mutational analysis of the urocanase gene (hutu) from pseudomonas putida.
AB  == the histidine-utilizing hutu gene was isolated from a lambda-embl3 phage of a genomic library from pseudomonas putida nicii and subcloned into the expression vector pt7-7. escherichia coli bl21 cells were transformed with the recombinant plasmid and produced a catalytically active protein, amounting to approximately 30% of the total protein in the crude cell-free extract. the addition of nad+ to  the growth medium ensured the full occupation of active sites by the cofactor. this requires a mechanism for the transport of nad+ into e. coli cells. using the overproducing mutant a new, fast and efficient isolation procedure is described which yields electrophoretically homogeneous urocanase within two days. the yield of pure enzyme, based on the culture volume, has been improved 50-80-fold compared with the traditional method. to investigate the possible role of cysteine residues in the catalysis or in the tight binding of the cofactor nad+,  six different mutants were prepared. in each mutant protein, one conserved cysteine was exchanged for alanine. the resulting clones were tested for the expression of urocanase with catalytic activity; the km and vmax values were determined. only cys410 was essential for catalysis. there was no detectable reconstitution or increase of activity after the addition of nad+, either in the  essential cys/ala mutant or the other mutant proteins. electrospray-mass spectroscopy of the wild-type enzyme revealed that the coenzyme is not covalently bound to the protein and computational analysis showed no typical sequence for a  mononucleotide-binding domain like the rossman fold. to obtain urocanase apoenzyme, p. putida nicii was transformed with pgp1-2 and ptet7-u and grown in nicotinate-depleted medium. like the mutant proteins, no activation of the apoform occurred after the addition of nad+. these observations led us to postulate a new model for the non-covalent but tight binding of nad+ to the enzyme by 'trapping' the cofactor while folding the nascent protein.

TI  == regulation of the pcaij genes for aromatic acid degradation in pseudomonas putida.
AB  == six of the genes encoding enzymes of the beta-ketoadipate pathway for benzoate and 4-hydroxybenzoate degradation in pseudomonas putida are organized into at least three separate transcriptional units. as an initial step to defining this pca regulon at the molecular level, lacz fusions were made with the pcai and pcaj genes, which encode the two subunits of beta-ketoadipate:succinyl-coenzyme a transferase, the enzyme catalyzing the next-to-last step in the beta-ketoadipate  pathway. fusion analyses showed that pcai and pcaj constitute an operon which requires beta-ketoadipate or its nonmetabolizable analog, adipate, as well as the pcar regulatory gene for induction. the pcaij promoter is likely to be a sigma 70-type promoter; it has a sigma 70-type consensus sequence and did not require the alternative sigma factor, rpon, for induction. deletion analysis of the promoter region of a pcai-lacz transcriptional fusion indicated that no specific  dna sequences upstream of the -35 region were required for full induction. this implies that the binding site for the activator protein, pcar, is unusually close to the transcriptional start site of pcaij.

AB  == bph operons coding for biphenyl-polychlorinated biphenyl degradation in pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes kf707 and pseudomonas putida kf715 and tod operons  coding for toluene-benzene metabolism in p. putida f1 are very similar in gene organization as well as size and homology of the corresponding enzymes (g. j. zylstra and d. t. gibson, j. biol. chem. 264:14940-14946, 1989; k. taira, j. hirose, s. hayashida, and k. furukawa, j. biol. chem. 267:4844-4853, 1992), despite their discrete substrate ranges for metabolism. the gene components responsible for substrate specificity between the bph and tod operons were investigated. the large subunit of the terminal dioxygenase (encoded by bpha1 and todc1) and the ring meta-cleavage compound hydrolase (bphd and todf) were critical for their discrete metabolic specificities, as shown by the following results. (i) introduction of todc1c2 (coding for the large and small subunits of  the terminal dioxygenase in toluene metabolism) or even only todc1 into biphenyl-utilizing p. pseudoalcaligenes kf707 and p. putida kf715 allowed them to grow on toluene-benzene by coupling with the lower benzoate meta-cleavage pathway. introduction of the bphd gene (coding for 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoate hydrolase) into toluene-utilizing p. putida f1 permitted growth on biphenyl. (ii) with various bph and tod mutant strains, it was shown that enzyme components of ferredoxin (encoded by bpha3 and  todb), ferredoxin reductase (bpha4 and toda), and dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (bphb and todd) were complementary with one another. (iii) escherichia coli cells carrying a hybrid gene cluster of todclbpha2a3a4bc (constructed by replacing bpha1 with todc1) converted toluene to a ring meta-cleavage 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-hepta-2,4-dienoic acid, indicating that todc1 formed a functional multicomponent dioxygenase associated with bpha2 (a small subunit of the terminal dioxygenase in biphenyl metabolism), bpha3, and bpha4.

AB  == the meta-cleavage operon of the tol plasmid pww0 of pseudomonas putida contains 13 genes responsible for the oxidation of benzoate and toluates to krebs cycle intermediates via estradiol (meta) cleavage of (methyl)catechol. the functions of all the genes are known with the exception of xylt. we constructed pww0 mutants defective in the xylt gene, and found that these mutants were not able to grow on p-toluate while they were still capable of growing on benzoate and m-toluate. in  the xylt mutants, all the meta-cleavage enzymes were induced by p-toluate with the exception of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase whose activity was 1% of the p-toluate-induced activity in wild-type cells. addition of 4-methylcatechol to m-toluate-grown wild-type and xylt cells resulted in the inactivation of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase in these cells. in the wild-type strain but not in the xylt mutant, the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase activity was regenerated in a short time. the regeneration of the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase activity was also observed in h2o2-treated wild-type cells, but not in h2o2-treated xylt cells. we concluded that the xylt product is required for the regeneration of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase.

AB  == creatinase (creatine amidinohydrolase, ec 3.5.3.3), a homodimer of 45 kda subunit molecular mass, shows only limited functional stability, and is inaccessible to reconstitution after preceding deactivation, denaturation and dissociation. the enzyme has been characterized regarding its native and denatured states. studying its unfolding characteristics in the presence of "extrinsic factors", such as dte, bsa and glycerol, it was possible to define solvent conditions where the stability of the enzyme is significantly improved. apart from protecting essential thiol groups and charge screening effects, the stabilization is caused  mainly by preferential solvation. in the presence of 20% (w/v) glycerol, the kinetic analysis of the time course of denaturation indicates that a partially active folding intermediate, rather than the whole molecule, is involved in the stabilization. the mixed solvent improves the thermal stability, as well as the stability toward gdmcl and urea.

AB  == plasmid pest1463 carrying the promoterless pheba operon was cloned into pseudomonas putida paw85, and phenol-utilizing colonies were isolated on minimal  plates containing phenol as the only carbon and energy source. in these clones, chromosomally located tn4652 was transposed upstream from the coding sequencing of phea (encoding phenol monooxygenase). sequence analysis together with mapping  of the transcription start point of the pheba operon in the recombinant plasmids  revealed that fusions of the -10 sequences present in the pheba operon and -35 sequence located in the terminal inverted repeats of tn4652 had generated functional promoters under selective pressure in p. putida cells. these promoter  sequences show similarity to the escherichia coli rna polymerase sigma 70 promoter consensus sequence. in three of the six fusion promoters studied, the generation combined two distinct events: transposition of tn4652 into dna containing potential -10 sequences and point mutations in these sequences. these  mutations made the -10 sequences more like the sigma 70 promoter consensus sequences.

TI  == identification and characterization of the pupb gene encoding an inducible ferric-pseudobactin receptor of pseudomonas putida wcs358.
AB  == pseudomonas putida wcs358 can transport iron complexed to a wide variety of pseudobactins produced by other pseudomonas strains. the pupb gene encoding an outer membrane ferric-pseudobactin receptor was isolated from a genomic library of p. putida wcs358. the pupb receptor facilitated iron transport via two distinct heterologous siderophores, i.e. pseudobactin bn8 and pseudobactin bn7. the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence consisted of 804 amino acids (molecular weight 88,369) of which the n-terminal part was very similar to a prokaryotic leader peptide. the mature protein shared significant homology with the receptor for ferric-pseudobactin 358 (pupa) and contained three regions common to tonb-dependent receptor proteins of escherichia coli. interestingly, pupb expression was only observed in cells cultured in iron-deficient medium containing pseudobactin bn8 or pseudobactin bn7. this expression required a transcriptional unit, pupr, identified upstream of the structural pupb gene. transposon tn5 insertion mutants defective in pupb production still exhibited uptake of iron via pseudobactin bn8, although with reduced efficiency. apparently, an additional transport system for this ferric-siderophore complex operates in this strain. in addition to pseudobactin bn8 also other heterologous siderophores were capable of inducing synthesis of specific high-molecular-weight outer membrane proteins in strain wcs358, which suggests the existence of multiple siderophore-inducible iron transport systems in this strain.

TI  == expression of the agga locus of pseudomonas putida in vitro and in planta as detected by the reporter gene, xyle.
AB  == in vitro agglutinability by pseudomonas putida, isolate corvallis, with a plant root surface agglutinin is correlated with rapid adhesion of cells of the fluorescent pseudomonad to bean (phaseolus vulgaris) root surfaces. agglutinability in p. putida cells is regulated by nutrient status as well as growth phase. cells grown in three different nutrient complex media are agglutinable at early and mid-late logarithmic phase but become nonagglutinable at stationary phase. cells grown in a minimal medium are weakly agglutinable, but the addition of lysine, aspartic acid, or histidine increases agglutinability. cells in the same minimal medium supplemented with bean root surface components grow in a highly agglutinated state. previous data indicate both agglutination and rapid adhesion to roots by p. putida corvallis involves the agga locus, which contains two putative open reading frames (orf), orf-agg1 and orfagg2, on complementary strands. sequence and deletion analyses suggest orfagg1 is the most probable orf responsible for agglutination and adhesion. chimeric fusion of an escherichia coli lac promoter with orfagg1, but not with orfagg2, complemented agglutinability of an agga::tn5 p. putida agg mutant, providing further evidence  that orfagg1, not orfagg2, is responsible for agglutination. heterologous expression of orfagg1 yields a 50-kda precursor and a 48-kda mature periplasmic protein. fusions of orfagg1 and orfagg2 to the reporter gene, xyle, and detection of the reporter enzyme, catechol-2,3-oxygenase reveal an active promoter in the 5' noncoding region of orfagg1. the orfagg1 promoter is active during growth of the cells in liquid culture and is regulated by growth medium. greatest activity  of the catechol-2,3-oxygenase is observed in stationary phase when the cells are  nonagglutinable. expression of the orfagg1 promoter is detected in p. putida cells extracted from the root surface of bean at 48 and 72 hr after inoculation.

TI  == broad host range, regulated expression system utilizing bacteriophage t7 rna polymerase and promoter.
AB  == an iptf-regulated broad host range expression system was constructed using compatible broad host range plasmids, the t7 rna polymerase, and t7 promoter sequences. the system is implemented by the coexistence of two plasmids. the first contains the t7 rna polymerase gene under the control of lacl or lacl(q) genes and lacuv5 promoter. the second encodes the t7 promoter upstream of a multicloning site. incp1 or incp4 t7 promoter plasmids, and incp1, incp4 or incw  t7 rna polymerase plasmids were constructed. the expression from the incp1 promoter plasmids in the presence of the incp4 polymerase plasmids was tested by  in vivo lacz fusions and vivo labeling of proteins. in this combination, the use  of lac(q) improves the regulation levels in escherichia coli, whereas, in pseudomonas phaseolicola, a 28.5-fold regulation was obtained with lacl, although the level of lacz expression from the t7 promoter in p. phaseolicola is low compared with e. coli, it is similar to levels obtained with the pm promoter in pseudomonas putida when the differences in the copy number of the expression vectors are taken into consideration.

TI  == superoxide dismutase activity in root-colonizing pseudomonads.
AB  == several saprophytic fluorescent pseudomonads that are aggressive root colonizers  express similar specific activities of superoxide dismutase during growth in liquid culture. the pseudomonads have the potential to produce hydrogen peroxide  sensitive and hydrogen peroxide insensitive isoforms of superoxide dismutase with distinct mobilities in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. synthesis of the hydrogen peroxide insensitive form is enhanced by limited iron availability, by exposure to mn2+, and to a lesser extent by external sources of  superoxide anion. unlike pseudomonas aeruginosa, a root-colonizing strain of pseudomonas putida did not show regulation of isoform pattern by phosphate availability. a plasmid potentially encoding the pseudomonad hydrogen peroxide sensitive form complemented the superoxide dismutase deficiency in a mutant of escherichia coli lacking expression of both fe and mn genes. contact between the  plant root and pseudomonad or e. coli cells that lack or express superoxide dismutase did not influence superoxide anion production from root surface enzymes. the pseudomonad and the superoxide dismutase deficient and producing e.  coli strains survived exposure to the root equally well. only the hydrogen peroxide sensitive isoform of superoxide dismutase was detected in p. putida cells associated with bean root surfaces.

TI  == molecular analysis of the plasmid-borne bed gene cluster from pseudomonas putida  ml2 and cloning of the cis-benzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase gene.
AB  == pseudomonas putida ml2 contains a large catabolic plasmid, phmt112, carrying genes that encode the dioxygenase and dehydrogenase involved in the catabolism of benzene via the ortho or beta-ketoadipate pathway. phmt112 was derived from a larger and less stable plasmid in p. putida ml2 following growth on succinate as  carbon and energy source but was, however, stably maintained in p. putida even in the absence of selection for growth on benzene. cleavage sites for the restriction endonucleases drai, xbai, and bamhi were mapped on the plasmid. a region of the plasmid, downstream of the benzene dioxygenase genes (bedc1c2ba), was found to encode the cis-benzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase gene (bedd). recombinant escherichia coli containing bedc1c2bad genes was found to express benzene dioxygenase and dehydrogenase activity, indicated by the production of catechol when incubated in the presence of benzene. hybridization using benzene dioxygenase genes as probes was used to construct a restriction map of the 35.5-kb xhoi-drai fragment on which the bed operon was located.

TI  == pseudomonas aeruginosa promoters which contain a conserved gg-n10-gc motif but appear to be rpon-independent.
AB  == the proc gene of pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes the constitutive delta 1-pyrroline 5-carboxylate reductase (the third enzyme of proline biosynthesis) and ranks among the numerous pseudomonas genes which are poorly transcribed in escherichia coli. the promoters of the proc gene were located by deletion mapping. the 5' ends of the proc transcripts originating from one promoter were determined by primer extension. this promoter has a gg-n10-gc motif with a 16 bp  spacing between the gc doublet and the transcription start site. such spacing is  unusually long for sigma 54-dependent promoters. in rpon mutants of p. aeruginosa and p. putida a proc'--'lacz fusion was expressed at wild-type levels, suggesting that sigma 54 rna polymerase is not involved in proc transcription. the expression of another p. aeruginosa gene, anr (for anaerobic regulation of nitrate respiration and anaerobic arginine degradation), also appeared to be independent of rpon in pseudomonas and occurred at a very low level in e. coli. the proc and anr promoters have sequence similarities in addition to the conserved gg--n10--gc motif and may also be related to some alg (alginate) promoters of p. aeruginosa. we propose that the proc and anr promoters are activated by proteins, including perhaps an alternative sigma factor, which are present in pseudomonas but absent from e. coli.

TI  == precise deletions in large bacterial genomes by vector-mediated excision (vex). the trfa gene of promiscuous plasmid rk2 is essential for replication in several  gram-negative hosts.
AB  == we have developed a simple and efficient method of vector-mediated excision (vex) for in vivo generation of precisely defined deletions in large bacterial genomes. the system uses homologous recombination with small cloned fragments on specialized pvex plasmids to insert directly repeated bacteriophage p1 loxp sites at positions flanking the region to be deleted. in the presence of cre recombinase, the loxp sites are efficiently recombined to produce the deletion. deletion endpoints can be directed to specific nucleotides because they are defined by the termini of small homology-bearing fragments cloned into the pvex plasmids. we have used vex to delete trfa, the only known replication initiator gene of the 56.4 kb broad host-range plasmid rk2. the rk2 delta trfa mutant was found to be conjugation proficient, but unable to replicate in the rk2 hosts acinetobacter calcoaceticus, caulobacter crescentus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, rhizobium meliloti, or rhodobacter sphaeroides. these results show that trfa is essential for replication in these hosts and indicate that the broad host-range of rk2 does not involve multiple replicons.

TI  == nucleotide sequence and over-expression of morphine dehydrogenase, a plasmid-encoded gene from pseudomonas putida m10.
AB  == pseudomonas putida m10 was originally isolated from factory waste liquors by selection for growth on morphine. the nadp(+)-dependent morphine dehydrogenase that initiates morphine catabolism is encoded by a large plasmid of 165 kb. treatment of p. putida m10 with ethidium bromide led to the isolation of a putative plasmid-free strain that was incapable of growth on morphine. the structural gene for morphine dehydrogenase, mora, has been located on the plasmid by oligonucleotide hybridization, by coupled transcription-translation of cloned  restriction fragments and by nucleotide sequence analysis and is contained within a 1.7 kb sphi fragment that has been cloned into escherichia coli. the cloned dehydrogenase enzyme is expressed at high levels in e. coli resulting in a 65-fold increase in morphine dehydrogenase activity in cell-free extracts compared with p. putida m10. morphine dehydrogenase was rapidly purified to homogeneity, as judged by sds/page, by a one-step affinity chromatography procedure on mimetic orange 3 a6xl. the properties of the purified enzyme were identical with those previously reported for p. putida m10 morphine dehydrogenase. the mora gene was sequenced and the deduced amino acid sequence confirmed by n-terminal amino acid sequencing of the over-expressed protein. the  predicted amino acid sequence of mora, deduced from the nucleotide sequence, indicated that morphine dehydrogenase did not belong to the non-metal-requiring short-chain class of dehydrogenases, but was more closely related to the aldo-ketoreductases.

TI  == identification and characterization of the exbb, exbd and tonb genes of pseudomonas putida wcs358: their involvement in ferric-pseudobactin transport.
AB  == catechol-cephalosporins are siderophore-like antibiotics which are taken up by cells of pseudomonas putida wcs358 via the ferric-siderophore transport pathway.  mutants of strain wcs358 were isolated that are resistant to high concentrations  of these antibiotics. these mutants failed to grow under iron-limiting conditions, and could not utilize different ferric-siderophores. the mutants fall in three complementation groups. the nucleotide sequence determination identified three contiguous open reading frames, which were homologous to the exbb, exbd and tonb genes of escherichia coli respectively. the deduced amino acid sequence of p. putida exbb showed 58.6% homology with its e. coli homologue, but, unlike the  e. coli protein, it has a n-terminal extension of 91 amino acids. the exbd proteins are 64.8% homologous, whereas the tonb proteins only show 27.7% homology. the p. putida exbb gene could complement an e. coli exbb mutation, but  the tonb proteins were not interchangeable between the species. it is concluded that p. putida wcs358 contains an energy-coupling system between the membranes, for active transport across the outer membrane, which is comprised of a tonb-like energy-transducing protein and two accessory proteins. this system is similar to, but not completely compatible with, the e. coli system.

TI  == xyls domain interactions can be deduced from intraallelic dominance in double mutants of pseudomonas putida.
AB  == the xyls protein is the positive regulator of the tol plasmid-encoded meta-cleavage pathway for the metabolism of alkylbenzoates in pseudomonas putida. this protein is activated by a variety of benzoate analogues. to elucidate the functional domains of the regulator and their interactions, several fusions of the xyls c-terminus to ms2 polymerase and of the n-terminus to beta-galactosidase were constructed but all are inactive. in addition, 15 double mutant xyls genes were constructed in vitro by fusing parts of various mutant genes to produce mutant regulators exhibiting c-terminal and n-terminal amino acid substitutions.  the phenotypic properties of the parental single mutant genes, and those of the double mutant genes, suggest that the c-terminal region is involved in binding to dna sequences at the promoter of the meta-cleavage pathway operon, and that the benzoate effector binding pocket includes critical residues present at both the n-terminal and c-terminal ends of the protein. the intraallelic dominance of the  ile229 (ser229-->ile) and val274 (asp274-->val) substitutions over the n-terminal his41 (arg41-->his) substitution, and the intraallelic dominance of thr45 (arg45-->thr) over ile229 and val274, support the proposal that these two regions of the regulator interact functionally. combination of the leu88 (trp88-->leu) and arg256 (pro256-->arg) substitutions did not suppress the semiconstitutive phenotype conferred by leu88, but resulted in a protein with altered ability to recognize benzoates. in contrast, the leu88 semiconstitutive phenotype was suppressed by val288 (asp288-->val), and the double mutant was susceptible to activation by benzoates.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the gene (pcab) for 3-carboxymuconate lactonizing enzyme (cmle; 3-carboxymuconate cycloisomerase; ec 5.5.1.2) from pseudomonas putida has been cloned into pmg27ns, a temperature-sensitive expression vector, and expressed in escherichia coli n4830. the specific activity and kinetic parameters of the recombinant cmle were  comparable to those previously reported. a comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of cmle with sequences available in the pir and genbank databases revealed that cmle has highly significant sequence homology to the class ii fumarase family, particularly to adenylosuccinate lyase from bacillus subtilis. cmle has no significant homology to muconate lactonizing enzyme (mle) from p. putida, its sister enzyme in the beta-ketoadipate pathway. these findings fully corroborate a prediction made by us on the basis of mechanistic and stereochemical analyses of cmle and mle [chari, r. v. j., whitman, c. p., kozarich, j. w., ngai, k.-l., & ornston, l. n. (1987) j. am. chem. soc. 109, 5514-5519] and suggest that cmle and mle were recruited into this specialized pathway from two different enzyme families.

TI  == evidence that the hrpb gene encodes a positive regulator of pathogenicity genes from pseudomonas solanacearum.
AB  == the hrp gene cluster of pseudomonas solanacearum gmi1000 strain encodes functions that are essential for pathogenicity on tomato and for the elicitation of the hypersensitive response on tobacco. in this study, we present the nucleotide sequence of one of the hrp genes (hrpb) located at the left-hand end of the cluster and we show that hrpb encodes a positive regulator controlling the expression of hrp genes. hrpb has a coding capacity for a 477-amino-acid polypeptide, which shows significant similarity to several prokaryotic transcriptional activators including the arac protein of escherichia coli, the xyls protein of pseudomonas putida and the virf protein of yersinia enterocolitica. the predicted hrpb gene product belongs to a family of bacterial  regulators different from the previously described hrps protein of the hrp gene cluster of pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola. genetic evidence demonstrates that the hrpb gene product acts as a positive regulator of the expression in minimal medium of all but one of the putative transcription units of the hrp gene cluster and also controls the expression of genes located outside this cluster. we also show in this paper that the transcription of hrpb is induced in minimal medium and is partly autoregulated.

TI  == expression of the 4-chlorobenzoate dehalogenase genes from pseudomonas sp.-cbs3 in escherichia coli and identification of the gene translation products.
AB  == the genes encoding the 4-chlorobenzoate dehalogenase of pseudomonas sp. strain cbs3 were, in an earlier study, cloned in escherichia coli dh1 with the cosmid vector ppsa843 and then mobilized to the 4-chlorobenzoate dehalogenase minus strain pseudomonas putida kt2440. in this paper we report on the expression of 4-chlorobenzoate dehalogenase in these clones and on the polypeptide composition  of the active enzyme. the dehalogenase activity in whole cells suspended in 3.2 mm 4-chlorobenzoate (30 degrees c) was determined to be approximately 27 units (micromoles 4-hydroxybenzoate produced per minute) per 100 g of e. coli-ppsa843 cells and approximately 28 units per 100 g of p. putida-ppsa843 cells. dehalogenase activity in fresh cellular extracts (ph 7.4, 30 degrees c) prepared  from the e. coli and p. putida clones was unstable and at least 20-fold lower than that observed with the whole cells. the polypeptide components of the dehalogenase were identified by selective expression of the cloned dehalogenase genes and analysis of the gene translation products. analysis of dehalogenase activity in omega insertion mutants and deletion mutants circumscribed the dehalogenase genes to a 4.8-kilobase (4.8 kb) stretch of the 9.5-kb dna fragment. selective expression of the dehalogenase genes from a cloned 4.8-kb dna fragment  in a maxicell system revealed a 30-kda polypeptide as one of the components of the dehalogenase system. selective expression of the dehalogenase genes using the t7 polymerase promoter system revealed the 30-kda polypeptide and 57- and 16-kda  polypeptide products. determination of which of the three polypeptides were translated in deletion mutants provided the relative positions of the encoding genes on a single dna strand and the direction in which they are transcribed.

TI  == in vitro interactions of pseudomonas rna polymerases with tac and rna i promoters.
AB  == the activities of rna polymerases from pseudomonas putida and pseudomonas aeruginosa were compared with that of escherichia coli rna polymerase in an in vitro transcription system. all three enzymes initiated transcription at the tac  promoter and the rna i promoter of e. coli. we measured the rate of open complex  formation between the rna polymerases and the promoters, and the saturation level of open complex formation at equilibrium in single-round transcription. the relative rates of open complex formation were p. putida > e. coli > p. aeruginosa and the relative saturation levels of open complex formation at equilibrium were  e. coli > p. putida > p. aeruginosa for the tac and rna i promoters. the interaction of the rna polymerases with the promoters was also studied by dnase i footprinting. the patterns of protection of the pseudomonas rna polymerases on the tac promoter were similar to that of e. coli rna polymerase. however, the protection patterns of the pseudomonas rna polymerases on the rna i promoter were slightly different from that of e. coli rna polymerase.

TI  == bacterioplankton community structure and dynamics after large-scale release of nonindigenous bacteria as revealed by low-molecular-weight-rna analysis.
AB  == a set of freshwater mesocosms (1.7 m3 each) was inoculated with large amounts of  escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, and their culture medium to substantially disturb the natural microbial community. to monitor microbial community dynamics, low-molecular-weight rna (5s rrna and trna) obtained directly from bacterioplankton was analyzed by using high-resolution electrophoresis. the introduced bacteria showed no significant effect on the community structure of the natural bacterial assemblage and its dynamics for 16 days. in contrast, the addition of culture medium resulted within 2 days in a reduction of community diversity due to dominance of a single 5s rrna band from an indigenous bacterium. partial sequencing of several 5s rrnas demonstrated the molecular homogeneity of  most of the abundant bands and enabled the identification of corresponding bacterial isolates and/or species. the dominating bacterium (around 54% of the total 5s rrna) in the nutrient-amended mesocosms could be identified by partial sequencing as a member of the aeromonas hydrophila complex. another bloom of heterotrophic bacteria belonging to the cytophaga johnsonae complex was detected  in the nutrient-amended mesocosms after 13 days. the dominance of this c. johnsonae-like bacterium could even be seen in the environmental trnas of the bacterioplankton, where its specific trnas prevailed from day 13 onward. this event was also independent of the introduced nonindigenous bacteria because it occurred at the same time in all nutrient-amended mesocosms. by contrast, in the  unamended experiments, a different small 5s rrna could by observed from day 10 onward with less pronounced dominance.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase, an enzyme composed of 62 amino acid residues per monomer.
AB  == the xylh gene encoding 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-ot) has been located on a  subclone of the pseudomonas putida mt-2 tol plasmid pww0 and inserted into an escherichia coli expression vector. several of the genes of the metafission pathway encoded by pww0 have been cloned in e. coli, but the overexpression of their gene products has met with limited success. by utilizing the e. coli alkaline phosphatase promoter (phoa) coupled with the proper positioning of a ribosome-binding region, we are able to express functional 4-ot in yields of at least 10 mg of pure enzyme/liter of culture. 4-ot has been previously characterized and shown to be an extremely efficient catalyst (whitman, c. p., aird, b. a., gillespie, w. r., and stolowich, n. j. (1991) j. am. chem. soc. 113, 3154-3162). kinetic and physical characterization of the e. coli-expressed protein show that it is identical with that of the 4-ot isolated from p. putida.  the functional unit is apparently a pentamer of identical subunits, each consisting of only 62 amino acid residues. this is the smallest enzyme subunit reported to date. the amino acid sequence, determined in part from automated edman degradation and also deduced from the primary sequence of xylh, did not show homology with any of the sequences in the current data bases nor with any of the sequences of enzymes that catalyze similar reactions. we propose that the active site of 4-ot may be established by an overlap of subunits and comprised of amino acid residues belonging to several, if not all, of the subunits.

TI  == gonococcal transferrin-binding protein 1 is required for transferrin utilization  and is homologous to tonb-dependent outer membrane receptors.
AB  == the pathogenic neisseria species are capable of utilizing transferrin as their sole source of iron. a neisserial transferrin receptor has been identified and its characteristics defined; however, the biochemical identities of proteins which are required for transferrin receptor function have not yet been determined. we identified two iron-repressible transferrin-binding proteins in neisseria gonorrhoeae, tbp1 and tbp2. two approaches were taken to clone genes required for gonococcal transferrin receptor function. first, polyclonal antiserum raised against tbp1 was used to identify clones expressing tbp1 epitopes. second, a wild-type gene copy was cloned that repaired the defect in a  transferrin receptor function (trf) mutant. the clones obtained by these two approaches were shown to overlap by dna sequencing. transposon mutagenesis of both clones and recombination of mutagenized fragments into the gonococcal chromosome generated mutants that showed reduced binding of transferrin to whole  cells and that were incapable of growth on transferrin. no tbp1 was produced in these mutants, but tbp2 expression was normal. the dna sequence of the gene encoding gonococcal tbp1 (tbpa) predicted a protein sequence homologous to the escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida tonb-dependent outer membrane receptors.  thus, both the function and the predicted protein sequence of tbp1 were consistent with this protein serving as a transferrin receptor.

AB  == pseudomonas putida f1 and pseudomonas sp. strain js150 initiate toluene degradation by incorporating molecular oxygen into the aromatic nucleus to form cis-1,2-dihydroxy-3-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene. when toluene-grown cells were incubated with 2- and 3-nitrotoluene, the major products identified were 2- and 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol, respectively. the same cells oxidized 4-nitrotoluene to 2-methyl-5-nitrophenol and 3-methyl-6-nitrocatechol. escherichia coli jm109(pdtg601), which contains the toluene dioxygenase genes from p. putida f1 under the control of the tac promoter, oxidized the isomeric nitrotoluenes to the same metabolites as those formed by p. putida f1 and pseudomonas sp. strain js150. these results extend the range of substrates known to be oxidized by this  versatile enzyme and demonstrate for the first time that toluene dioxygenase can  oxidize an aromatic methyl substituent.

TI  == multiple periplasmic catalases in phytopathogenic strains of pseudomonas syringae.
AB  == phytopathogenic strains of pseudomonas syringae are exposed to plant-produced, detrimental levels of hydrogen peroxide during invasion and colonization of host  plant tissue. when p. syringae strains were investigated for their capacity to resist h2o2, they were found to contain 10- to 100-fold-higher levels of total catalase activity than selected strains belonging to nonpathogenic related taxa (pseudomonas fluorescens and pseudomonas putida) or escherichia coli. multiple catalase activities were identified in both periplasmic and cytoplasmic fluids of exponential- and stationary-phase p. syringae cells. two of these activities were unique to the periplasm of p. syringae pv. glycinea. during the stationary growth phase, the specific activity of cytoplasmic catalases increased four- to eightfold. the specific activities of catalases in both fluids from exponential-phase cells increased in response to treatment with 0.25 to 10 mm h2o2 but decreased when higher h2o2 concentrations were used. in stationary-growth phase cultures, the specific activities of cytoplasmic catalases increased remarkably after treatment with 0.25 to 50 mm h2o2. the growth of p. syringae into stationary phase and h2o2 treatment did not induce synthesis of additional catalase isozymes. only the stationary-phase cultures of  all of the p. syringae strains which we tested were capable of surviving high h2o2 stress at concentrations up to 50 mm. our results are consistent with the involvement of multiple catalase isozymes in the reduction of oxidative stress during plant pathogenesis by these bacteria.

TI  == molecular characterization of the entner-doudoroff pathway in escherichia coli: sequence analysis and localization of promoters for the edd-eda operon.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the entire escherichia coli edd-eda region that encodes the enzymes of the entner-doudoroff pathway was determined. the edd structural gene begins 236 bases downstream of zwf. the eda structural gene begins 34 bases downstream of edd. the edd reading frame is 1,809 bases long and  encodes the 602-amino-acid, 64,446-da protein 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase. the deduced primary amino acid sequences of the e. coli and zymomonas mobilis dehydratase enzymes are highly conserved. the eda reading frame is 642 bases long and encodes the 213-amino-acid, 22,283-da protein 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase. this enzyme had been previously purified and sequenced by others on the basis of its related enzyme activity, 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase. the data presented here provide proof that the two enzymes are identical. the primary amino acid sequences of the e. coli, z. mobilis, and pseudomonas putida aldolase enzymes are highly conserved. when e. coli is grown on gluconate, the edd and eda genes are cotranscribed. four putative promoters within the edd-eda region were identified by transcript mapping and computer analysis. p1, located upstream of edd, appears to be the primary gluconate-responsive promoter of the edd-eda operon, responsible for induction of the entner-doudoroff pathway, as mediated by the gntr product. high  basal expression of eda is explained by constitutive transcription from p2, p3, and/or p4 but not p1.

AB  == beta-ketoadipate:succinyl-coenzyme a transferase (beta-ketoadipate:succinyl-coa transferase) (ec 2.8.3.6) carries out the penultimate step in the conversion of benzoate and 4-hydroxybenzoate to tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates in bacteria utilizing the beta-ketoadipate pathway. this report describes the characterization of a dna fragment from pseudomonas putida that encodes this enzyme. the fragment complemented mutants defective in the synthesis of the coa transferase, and two proteins of sizes appropriate to encode the two nonidentical subunits of the enzyme were produced in escherichia coli when the fragment was placed under the control of a phage t7 promoter. dna sequence analysis revealed two open reading frames, designated pcai and pcaj, that were separated by 8 bp, suggesting that they may comprise an operon. a comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the p. putida coa transferase genes with the sequences of two other bacterial coa transferases and that of succinyl-coa:3-ketoacid coa transferase from pig heart suggests that the homodimeric structure of the mammalian enzyme may have resulted from a gene fusion of the bacterial alpha and  beta subunit genes during evolution. conserved functional groups important to the catalytic activity of coa transferases were also identified.

(1974) eur. j. biochem. 50, 245-252). using antiserum to the purified protein to screen e. coli genomic expression libraries, we have cloned a gene (designated fdx) encoding this protein. the dna sequence of the gene predicts a polypeptide of 110 residues after removal of the initiator methionine (polypeptide m(r) = 12,186, holoprotein m(r) = 12,358). the deduced amino acid sequence is strikingly similar to those of the ferredoxins found in animal mitochondria which function with cytochrome p450 enzymes and to the ferredoxin from pseudomonas putida which functions with p450cam. the overall sequence identity is approximately 36% when compared with human mitochondrial and p. putida ferredoxins, and the identities include 4 cysteine residues proposed to coordinate the iron cluster. the protein was overproduced approximately 500-fold  using an expression plasmid, and the holoprotein was assembled and accumulated in amounts exceeding 30% of the total cell protein. the overexpressed ferredoxin exhibits absorption, circular dichroism, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra closely resembling those of the animal ferredoxins and p. putida ferredoxin.

AB  == transcription from the promoter of a positive regulatory gene, xyls, on the tol plasmid of pseudomonas putida is activated by another positive regulator, xylr, in the presence of m-xylene and is dependent on rna polymerase containing the ntra protein (sigma 54). deletion analysis of the upstream region of the xyls gene revealed an upstream regulatory sequence (urs), located between 145 and 188  bp upstream from the transcription start site. the urs is active in either orientation and can be placed 3.9 kb further upstream without loss of activity. dependence of activation on helical periodicity was observed in the region between the urs and the promoter of the xyls gene, suggesting dna loop formation  between these two sites, which are located about 100 bp apart. the expression of  xylr was autogenously repressed by xylr protein. this autogenous repression is decreased in an ntra- background, irrespective of the presence of the xyls promoter in cis, indicating that ntra protein, or ntra-containing rna polymerase  that is not bound to the xyls promoter, is involved in the binding of xylr protein to the urs.

AB  == plasmids with mutations in trfa, the gene encoding the replication initiation protein of the broad-host-range plasmid rk2, were isolated and characterized. mutants identified from a nitrosoguanidine bank were defective in supporting the  replication of a wild-type rk2 origin in escherichia coli. most of the mutations  were clustered in a region of trfa corresponding to the carboxy-terminal quarter  of the trfa protein. 5' and 3' deletion mutants of trfa were also constructed. a  c-terminal deletion of three amino acids of the tr a protein was completely nonfunctional for rk2 replication. however, a deletion of 25 amino acids from the start of the 33-kda trfa protein was still competent for replication. further characterization of the point and deletion trfa mutants in vivo revealed that a subset was capable of supporting rk2 replication in other gram-negative bacteria, including pseudomonas putida, agrobacterium tumefaciens, and azotobacter vinelandii. selected mutant trfa proteins were partially purified and characterized in vitro. velocity sedimentation analysis of these partially purified trfa proteins indicated that the wild-type protein and all mutant trfa proteins examined exist as dimers in solution. results from in vitro replication  assays corroborated the experimental findings in vivo. gel retardation results clearly indicated that the point mutant trfa-33:151s, which was completely defective in replication of an rk2 origin in all of the bacterial hosts tested in vivo, and a carboxy-terminal deletion mutant, trfa-33:c delta 305, were not able  to bind iterons in vitro. in addition to the partially defective or could not be  distinguished from the wild-type protein in binding to the origin region. the mutant proteins with apparently normal dna-binding activity in vitro either were  inactive in all four gram-negative bacteria tested or exhibited differences in functionality depending on the host organism. these mutant trfa proteins may be altered in the ability to interact with the replication proteins of the specific  host bacterium.

AB  == high-resolution resonance raman spectra of the ferric, ferrous, and carbonmonoxy  (co)-bound forms of wild-type escherichia coli-expressed pseudomonas putida cytochrome p450cam and its p420 form are reported. the ferric and ferrous species of p450 and p420 have been studied in both the presence and absence of excess camphor substrate. in ferric, camphor-bound, p450 (mos), the e. coli-expressed p450 is found to be spectroscopically indistinguishable from the native material. although substrate binding to p450 is known to displace water molecules from the  heme pocket, altering the coordination and spin state of the heme iron, the presence of camphor substrate in p420 samples is found to have essentially no effect on the raman spectra of the heme in either the oxidized or reduced state.  a detailed study of the raman and absorption spectra of p450 and p420 reveals that the p420 heme is in equilibrium between a high-spin, five-coordinate (hs,5c) form and low-spin six-coordinate (ls,6c) form in both the ferric and ferrous oxidation states. in the ferric p420 state, h2o evidently remains as a heme ligand, while alterations of the protein tertiary structure lead to a significant reduction in affinity for cys(357) thiolate binding to the heme iron. ferrous p420 also consists of an equilibrium between hs,5c and ls,6c states, with the spectroscopic evidence indicating that h2o and histidine are the most likely axial ligands. the spectral characteristics of the co complex of p420 are found to be almost identical to those of a low ph of mb. moreover, we find that the 10-ns transient raman spectrum of the photolyzed p420 co complex possesses a band at 220 cm-1, which is strong evidence in favor of histidine ligation in the co-bound state. the equilibrium structure of ferrous p420 does not show this band, indicating that fe-his bond formation is favored when the iron becomes more acidic upon co binding. raman spectra of stationary samples of the co complex of  p450 reveal vfe-co peaks corresponding to both substrate-bound and substrate-free species and demonstrate that substrate dissociation is coupled to co photolysis.  analysis of the relative band intensities as a function of photolysis indicates that the co photolysis and rebinding rates are faster than camphor rebinding and  that co binds to the heme faster when camphor is not in the distal pocket.

TI  == construction of a cassette enabling regulated gene expression in the presence of  aromatic hydrocarbons.
AB  == a high-level expression cassette has been constructed from a tol plasmid derived  from pseudomonas putida carrying all cis- and trans-acting regulatory elements necessary for transcriptional gene activation in the presence of aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene. foreign dna can be inserted at unique kpni, saci, and ecori sites 7, 13, and 15 nucleotides downstream of a ribosome binding site.  the cassette, flanked by bamhi and ecori restriction sites, was inserted into a broad-host-range vector and its efficacy demonstrated in various purple bacteria  by monitoring the expression of a reporter gene spectrophotometrically and by sds-page. high-level induction (80- to 600-fold) was detected in enterobacteriaceae and in pseudomonas but was absent or low in agrobacterium tumefaciens and rhizobium leguminosarum.

TI  == upstream binding sequences of the xylr activator protein and integration host factor in the xyls gene promoter region of the pseudomonas tol plasmid.
AB  == the xylr and xyls genes, which encode the positive regulators of the tol plasmid  catabolic pathways, are adjacent genes on the tol plasmid and are transcribed from divergent promoters. transcription from the xyls gene promoter, ps, is positively regulated by effector-activated xylr protein and requires the specific rna polymerase sigma 54 subunit (rpon). deletions and point mutations in the ps upstream region localized the site of xylr interaction to the region between -133 bp and -207 bp (with respect to the transcriptional start of the xyls messenger), which contains an inverted sequence repeat largely homologous to the motif recognised by xylr in the xylr-regulated 'upper' catabolic pathway promoter, pu.  gel retardation experiments showed binding of ihf to the ps promoter region. corresponding sequences showing good homology to the ihf-binding consensus were identified close to the ps promoter (between -35 bp and -47 bp, ps proximal site) and further upstream overlapping the xylr recognition sequence (ps distal site).  in the latter case ihf recognition motifs were found well conserved on both strands at nearly the same position (between -140 bp and -152 bp on the upper and between -141 bp and -153 bp on the lower strand). expression from ps, either under inducing or non-inducing conditions, was, however, only slightly influenced by the absence of ihf in an ihf-deficient mutant and thus activation of ps, like  that of other sigma 54-dependent promoters which are rich in ts, does not absolutely require ihf protein.

TI  == expression and regulation of a dnaa homologue isolated from pseudomonas putida.
AB  == a gene homologous to the escherichia coli dnaa gene was isolated from pseudomonas putida and its transcription was investigated in e. coli as well as in p. putida. in both species the p. putida dnaa gene is transcribed from two promoters, one of which shows strong homology to promoters recognized by the sigma 54 factor found  in both bacteria. in e. coli transcription of the p. putida dnaa gene can be repressed by overproduction of e. coli dnaa protein, presumably due to the presence of several dnaa-box-like sequences found in the promoter region. likewise the p. putida dnaa protein is able to regulate expression of the e. coli dnaa gene but we failed to demonstrate autoregulation of the p. putida dnaa gene. a point mutation was introduced into the p. putida dnaa gene, equivalent to the atp binding site mutation present in e. coli dnaa5 and dnaa46 mutants, and this alteration abolished the ability of the protein to repress the expression of the  e. coli dnaa gene. these results indicate that dnaa proteins from other species than e. coli have maintained the ability to recognize the dnaa box sequence and that the conservation between the dnaa proteins reflects functionally similar domains.

TI  == cloning and partial sequencing of an operon encoding two pseudomonas putida haloalkanoate dehalogenases of opposite stereospecificity.
AB  == we have cloned fragments of dna (up to 13 kb), from pseudomonas putida aj1, that  code for two stereospecific haloalkanoate dehalogenases. these enzymes are highly specific for d and l substrates. the two genes, designated hadd and hadl, have been isolated and independently expressed in escherichia coli and p. putida hosts by using broad-host-range vectors. they are closely adjacent and inducible in what appears to be an operon with an upstream open reading frame of unknown function. nucleotide sequence determination of hadd predicts a mature, cytoplasmic protein of 300 amino acid residues (molecular weight of 33,601). this has no significant homology with the l-specific haloalkanoate dehalogenases from  pseudomonas sp. strain cbs3 (b. schneider, r. muller, r. frank, and f. lingens, j. bacteriol. 173:1530-1535, 1991) nor with any other known dna or protein sequences.

TI  == genes and their organization in the replication origin region of the bacterial chromosome.
AB  == genes and their organization are conserved in the replication origin region of the bacterial chromosome. to determine the extent of the conserved region in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which diverged 1.2 billion years ago, we have further sequenced the region upstream from the dnaa genes in bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas putida. fifteen open reading frames (orfs) and 11 orfs were identified in the 13.6 kb and the 9.8 kb fragments in b. subtilis and p. putida, respectively. eight consecutive p. putida genes, except for one small orf (homologous to gene 9k of escherichia coli) in between, are homologous in sequence and relative locations to genes in b. subtilis. altogether, 12 genes and their organization are conserved in b. subtilis and p. putida in the origin region. we found that the conserved region terminated on one side after the orf290 in p. putida (orf282 in b. subtilis). in the b. subtilis chromosome, five  additional orfs were found in between the conserved genes, suggesting that they are added after gram-positive bacteria were diverged from the gram-negative bacteria. one of the orfs is a duplicate of the conserved gene. the third non-translatable region containing multiple repeats of dnaa-box (second in the case of p. putida) was found flanking gida in both organisms. this result shows clearly that e. coli oric and flanking genes gida and gidb have been translocated by the inversion of some 40 kb fragment.

TI  == construction of a broad host range shuttle vector for gene cloning and expression in actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and other pasteurellaceae.
AB  == we have constructed a pair of broad host range expression vectors, pjff224-nx and pjff224-xn, based on plasmid rsf1010, which enable cloning and efficient expression of genes in actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and pasteurella haemolytica and in escherichia coli. the vectors consist of the minimal autonomous replicon of the broad host range plasmid rsf1010 and a type ii chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene for chloramphenicol resistance selection. in addition, they contain a gene expression cassette based on the e. coli bacteriophage t4 gene 32 promoter region and a transcription stop signal, which are separated by a segment of multiple cloning sites in both orientations. electroporation and subsequent selection for chloramphenicol resistance was used  for the introduction of the vectors in a. pleuropneumoniae and p. haemolytica. a  promoterless xy/e gene from the pseudomonas putida tol plasmid was cloned onto pjff224-nx. this plasmid enabled efficient expression of active catechol2,3oxygenase in a. pleuropneumoniae and p. haemolytica. it was stably maintained in a. pleuropneumoniae without antibiotic selection, showing less than 0.1% loss after 100 generations, while native rsf1010 and other rsf1010-based vectors were unstable in this host.

TI  == localization and functional analysis of structural and regulatory dehalogenase genes carried on deh from pseudomonas putida pp3.
AB  == pseudomonas putida pp3 expressed two dehalogenases, dehi and dehii. the dehi gene (dehi) was located on a mobile dna element (deh) which inserted at high frequencies into target plasmids from its chromosomal location. from a recombinant tol plasmid (pww0) containing a 6.0-kb deh element inserted into the  plasmid's 5.6-kb ecori-g restriction endonuclease fragment, an 11.6-kb ecori fragment was cloned. subcloning analysis and insertion mutagenesis produced a structural map of the deh element and located the dehalogenase functions. the gene dehi was transcribed from a regulated promoter on deh which was expressed in p. putida and escherichia coli. the direction of transcription of dehi was determined, and it was also found to be under positive control, activated by an adjacent regulatory gene (dehri). expression of dehi in clones containing the intact deh supported good growth on 2-monochloropropionate (2mcpa). subclones lacking dehri expressed dehi at levels which allowed only slow growth on 2mcpa, even when dehi expression was initiated from vector promoters. expression of dehi in p. putida containing the intact deh element required rpon, suggesting that it  was omega 54 dependent. the intact deh element transferred to p. putida on a suicide plasmid donor pawt34 (pbr325 replicon), and dehi was stably inherited, without vector dna sequences, in transformants selected on 2mcpa. this indicated  that the cloned deh element contained functions associated with recombination.

TI  == the dehalogenase gene dehi from pseudomonas putida pp3 is carried on an unusual mobile genetic element designated deh.
AB  == as a result of the production of two dehalogenases (dehi and dehii), pseudomonas  putida pp3 utilized halogenated alkanoic acids, such as 2-monochloropropionic acid (2mcpa), as sole sources of carbon and energy. the dehi gene (dehi) was carried on a mobile genetic element (deh) located on the chromosome of strain pp3. deh recombined with target plasmid dnas at high frequencies (e.g. 3.8 x 10(-4) per rp4.5 plasmid transferred). the regulated expression of dehi was detected in p. putida, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli strains containing derivative plasmids of rp4.5 and pww0 recombined with deh. movement of deh from the unstable rp4 derivatives pnj5000 and pmr5 resulted in the insertion  of deh into the chromosome of reca+ strains of p. putida but not in reca+ nor reca- strains of e. coli. rescue of deh from the chromosome of p. putida kt2441 onto plasmid rp4 involved recombination at a frequency (2.7 x 10(-4) per rp4 plasmid transferred) comparable to that observed in strain pp3. the deh element was not classified as a conventional transposon because it did not move as a discrete dna fragment: dehi-containing inserts in plasmid dna targets varied in size between 6 and 13 kb. in addition, deh exhibited a marked preference for insertion into a specific site on the plasmid pww0, but its transposition, independent of host recombinational systems, remains to be demonstrated. however, the transposonlike characteristics of deh included the conservation of restriction endonuclease sites, high-frequency recombination with different target replicons (plasmid and chromosomal dna), and promiscuous insertion into plasmid rp4-based replicons. therefore, it is proposed that deh is an unusual mobile genetic element.

TI  == sequence and complementation analysis of recf genes from escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, pseudomonas putida and bacillus subtilis: evidence for an essential phosphate binding loop.
AB  == we have compared the recf genes from escherichia coli k-12, salmonella typhimurium, pseudomonas putida, and bacillus subtilis at the dna and amino acid  sequence levels. to do this we determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the recf gene from salmonella typhimurium and we completed the nucleotide sequence of recf gene from pseudomonas putida begun by fujita et al. (1). we found that the recf proteins encoded by these two genes contain respectively 92% and 38% amino acid identity with the e. coli recf protein. additionally, we have found that the s. typhimurium and p. putida recf genes will complement an e. coli recf mutant, but the recf gene from bacillus subtilis [showing about 20% identity with e. coli (2)] will not. amino acid sequence alignment of the four proteins identified four highly conserved regions. two of these regions are part of a putative phosphate binding loop. in one region (position 36), we changed the lysine codon (which is  essential for atpase, gtpase and kinase activity in other proteins having this phosphate binding loop) to an arginine codon. we then tested this mutation (recf4101) on a multicopy plasmid for its ability to complement a recf chromosomal mutation and on the e. coli chromosome for its effect on sensitivity  to uv irradiation. the strain with recf4101 on its chromosome is as sensitive as  a null recf mutant strain. the strain with the plasmid-borne mutant allele is however more uv resistant than the null mutant strain. we conclude that lysine-36 and possibly a phosphate binding loop is essential for full recf activity. lastly we made two chimeric recf genes by exchanging the amino terminal 48 amino acids of the s. typhimurium and e. coli recf genes. both chimeras could complement e. coli chromosomal recf mutations.

TI  == structure of the dnaa and dnaa-box region in the mycoplasma capricolum chromosome: conservation and variations in the course of evolution.
AB  == we have previously shown that the dnaa gene and the dnaa-box region were conserved in bacteria representative of all three major branches of the eubacterial phylogenic tree: high g + c gram+, low-g + c gram+ and gram-. in the  present work, we determined the structure of the dnaa region of mycoplasma capricolum and found that the dnaa gene and at least two other genes, rpmh and dnan, were conserved in this bacterium. an unusually high level of amino acid (aa) substitutions was observed in m. capricolum dnaa. it was the case even in those aa which were well conserved in other bacterial species. the nontranslatable region upstream from the dnaa gene was also conserved in this bacterium, as it was universally found in both gram+ and gram- bacteria. an additional nontranslatable region downstream from the dnaa gene, which is common  to gram+ bacteria, was also found in m. capricolum, consistent with the proposal  that m. capricolum is gram+ in origin. these regions were rich in a + t and contained ten dnaa-box-like sequences (9-mers that differ from ttatccaca by one or two bases).

TI  == cloning, sequence and transcriptional analysis of the structural gene for lpd-3,  the third lipoamide dehydrogenase of pseudomonas putida.
AB  == the third lipoamide dehydrogenase structural gene of pseudomonas putida, lpd3, was isolated from a library of p. putida ppg2 dna cloned in escherichia coli tb1. the nucleotide sequence of lpd3 and its flanking regions indicate that lpd3 is not part of an operon, which is unique for a prokaryotic lipoamide dehydrogenase. an open reading frame was found 207 bases upstream from the start of transcription, but is encoded on the strand opposite lpd3. there is no evidence of an open reading frame immediately downstream from lpd3. the coding region of lpd3 consists of 1401 bp, providing for 466 amino acids plus a stop codon with a  g/c content of 62.4%. the transcriptional start site was located 33-bp upstream from the start of translation. the third lipoamide dehydrogenase (lpd-3) shares amino acid identity with the other two lipoamide dehydrogenases of p. putida, 45% with that of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and pyruvate multienzyme complexes, and 45.9% with the lipoamide dehydrogenase of the branched-chain oxoacid complex. lpd-3 is more closely related to eukaryotic lipoamide dehydrogenases since it has 53.6% amino acid sequence identity with pig and human lipoamide dehydrogenases and 51.1% identity with yeast lipoamide dehydrogenase. lpd-3 was not produced in  wild-type p. putida ppg2 under a variety of growth conditions. however, lpd-3 was produced in p. putida ppg2 carrying psp14, a pkt240-based clone with the entire lpd3 gene plus 104 bases of the leader. the only demonstrated role of lpd-3 in p. putida is as a substitute for lipoamide dehydrogenase of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and pyruvate multienzyme complexes when the latter is inactive or missing.

AB  == a system to isolate lexa-like genes of bacteria directly was developed. it is based upon the fact that the presence of a lexa(def) mutation is lethal to sula+  cells of escherichia coli. this system is composed of a sula- lexa(def) hsdr- strain and a lexa-conditional killer vector (plasmid pua165) carrying the wild-type sula gene of e. coli and a polylinker in which foreign dna may be inserted. by using this method, the lexa-like genes of salmonella typhimurium, erwinia carotovora, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and p. putida were cloned. we also found that the lexa repressor of s. typhimurium presented the highest affinity for the sos boxes of e. coli in vivo, whereas the lexa protein of p. aeruginosa had the lowest. likewise, all of these lexa repressors were cleaved by the activated reca protein of e. coli after dna damage. furthermore, under high-stringency conditions, the lexa gene of e. coli hybridized with the lexa genes of s. typhimurium and e. carotovora but not with those of p. aeruginosa and p. putida.

AB  == dnaa protein (a trans-acting element) and its binding sequence, dnaa-box: (a cis-acting element) are two elements essential for the initiation of chromosomal  replication in escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria. recently these two elements have been found to be conserved in three gram-positive bacteria (bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus and mycoplasma capricolum) as well as in gram-negative pseudomonads. dnaa protein was also found to be essential in the initiation of the replication of the b. subtilis chromosome, and regions containing multiple repeats of dnaa-box (dnaa-box region) are found to be active  as autonomously replicating elements both in b. subtilis and pseudomonads. in this microreview we compare first the structures of these dnaa-box regions and their locations on the chromosome and then functional aspects of dnaa protein and dnaa-box regions in the initiation and regulation of chromosomal replication. from these observations we propose evolutionary relationships between replication origins of eubacteria.

AB  == the xylose isomerase (xyla) and the xylulose kinase (xylb) genes from streptomyces rubiginosus were isolated, and their nucleotide sequences were determined. the xyla and xylb genes encode proteins of 388 and 481 amino acids, respectively. these two genes are transcribed divergently from within a 114-nucleotide sequence separating the coding regions. regulation of the xyl genes in s. rubiginosus was examined by fusing their promoters to the pseudomonas putida catechol dioxygenase gene and integrating the fusions into the minicircle  integration site on the s. rubiginosus chromosome. the expression of catechol dioxygenase was then measured under a variety of conditions. the results indicated that transcription of the xyl genes was induced by d-xylose and repressed by glucose. data from quantitative s1 mapping were consistent with this conclusion and suggested that xyla had one and xylb had two transcription initiation sites. the transcription initiation site of xyla was 40 bp upstream of the coding region. the two transcription initiation sites of xylb were 20 and 41  bp 5' of its translation initiation codon. under control of appropriate regulatory elements, the cloned xyl genes are capable of complementing either escherichia coli xylose isomerase- or xylulose kinase-deficient strains. the deduced amino acid sequence of the s. rubiginosus xyla protein is highly homologous to sequences of other microbial xylose isomerases.

TI  == dna sequence determination of the tol plasmid (pwwo) xylgfj genes of pseudomonas  putida: implications for the evolution of aromatic catabolism.
AB  == the meta operon of the pseudomonas putida tol plasmid (pwwo) encodes all enzymes  of a meta-cleavage pathway for the metabolism of benzoic acids to krebs-cycle intermediates. we have determined and analysed the nucleic acid sequence of a 3442 bp region of the meta operon containing the xyl-gfj genes whose products are involved in the post meta-ring fission transformation of catechols. homology analysis of the xylgfj gene products revealed evidence of biochemical relatedness, suggested enzymatic mechanisms, and permitted us to propose evolutionary events which may have generated the current variety of aromatic degradative pathways. the xylg gene, which specifies 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (hmsd), was found to encode a protein of 51.7 kda. the predicted protein sequence exhibits significant homology to eukaryotic aldehyde dehydrogenases (adhs) and to the products of two other pseudomonas catabolic genes, i.e. xylc and alkh. expansion of the adh superfamily to include these prokaryotic enzymes permitted a broader analysis of functionally critical adh residues and phylogenetic relationships among superfamily members. the importance of three regions of these enzymes previously thought to be critical to adh activity was reinforced by this analysis. however glutamine-487, also thought to  be critical, is less well conserved. the revised adh phylogeny proposed here suggests early catabolic adh divergence with subsequent interkingdom gene exchange. the xylf gene, which specifies 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase  (hmsh), was delineated by n-terminal sequence analysis of the purified gene product and is shown to encode a protein of 30.6 kda. homology analysis revealed  sequence similarity to a chromosomally encoded serine hydrolase, especially in the region of the previously identified active-site serine residue, suggesting that hmsh may also possess a serine hydrolytic enzymatic mechanism. likewise, the xylj gene, which specifies 2-hydroxy-pent-2,4-dienoate hydratase (hph), was delineated by n-terminal sequence analysis of purified hph, and was found to encode a 23.9 kda protein. sequence comparisons revealed that both hmsh and hph have analogues in the tod gene cluster, which specifies a toluene/benzene degradative pathway. although the newly identified todf and todj genes had been at least partially sequenced (zylstra and gibson, 1989), the open reading frames  had not been positively identified. the presence of todj provides strong evidence that the reactions following ring fission in the tod pathway are identical to those of the tol pathway.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == recombinant tol plasmid pwwo-eb62 allows pseudomonas putida to grow on p-ethylbenzoate. this plasmid can be transferred to other microorganisms, and its catabolic functions for the metabolism of alkylbenzoates are expressed in a limited number of gram-negative bacteria, including members of pseudomonad rrna group i and escherichia coli. transfer of the recombinant plasmid to erwinia chrysanthemi was observed, but transconjugants failed to grow on alkylbenzoates because they lost catabolic functions. pseudomonads belonging to rrna groups ii,  iii, and iv, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and alcaligenes sp. could not act as recipients for tol, either because the plasmid was not transferred or because it  was not stably maintained. the frequency of transfer of pwwo-eb62 from p. putida  as a donor to pseudomonads belonging to rrna group i was on the order of 1 to 10(-2) transconjugant per recipient, while the frequency of intergeneric transfer ranged from 10(-3) to 10(-7) transconjugant per recipient. the profile of potential hosts was conserved when the donor bacterium was escherichia coli or erwinia chrysanthemi instead of p. putida. no intergeneric gene transfer of the recombinant tol plasmid was observed in soils; however, intraspecies transfer did take place. intraspecies transfer of tol in soils was affected by the type of soil used, the initial inoculum size, and the presence of chemicals that could affect the survival of the donor or recipient bacteria.

TI  == construction of cloning cartridges for development of expression vectors in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == a cloning cartridge was constructed that can be inserted into a plasmid of choice to form an expression vector in which gene expression is inducible with an inexpensive inducer, sodium salicylate, at low concentrations. this cartridge consists of a 3.6-kb restriction fragment which contains the positive regulatory  gene nahr from plasmid nah7, a promoter, pg, that nahr regulates, a multiple cloning site, a transcription terminator, and a gene conferring tetracycline resistance. within promoter pg of the cloning cartridge, a sequence of three nucleotides upstream of the atg sequence encoding the initiation codon was altered to create an ndei recognition site (catatg) for cloning of the 5' end of  a gene without affecting the distance between the transcription start site and the gene coding region. in addition, the 5' end of a gene can be converted into an ndei recognition site without altering the amino acid sequence it encodes and  then cloned into this cartridge for regulated expression. several other synthetic restriction sites were also inserted downstream of the ndei site for accepting the 3' end of a cloned gene. a derivative of this cloning cartridge lacking the ndei sequence was also constructed for cloning and expression of a restriction fragment containing a gene(s) of unknown sequence. use of the cloning cartridges  in a broad-host-range plasmid has allowed successful cloning and inducible expression of several genes in all of the gram-negative bacterial tested to date. protein production to at least 10% of the total soluble cell proteins was observed from a cloned gene expressed in pseudomonas putida.

TI  == activation of the pseudomonas tol plasmid upper pathway operon. identification of binding sites for the positive regulator xylr and for integration host factor protein.
AB  == expression of the pseudomonas putida tol plasmid upper pathway operon requires a  promoter that belongs to the -12/-24 class. stimulation of transcription from this promoter is positively controlled by the effector-activated xylr protein and requires a form of rna-polymerase holoenzyme containing the rpon-encoded sigma factor, sigma 54. xylr-dependent stimulation of transcription from the pseudomonas tol upper pathway promoter was examined using deletions, insertions,  and in vivo dimethyl sulfate footprinting. two upstream activator sequences were  identified in the -160 (uas1) and -130 (uas2) regions. deletion of these two regions abolished transcription activation, although conservation of the uas2 element alone allowed limited transcription stimulation. separation of uas1 from  uas2 by half a turn or a full turn significantly reduced xylr stimulation of transcription from the upper pathway operon promoter. an inverted repeated atttgn2caaat (where n is any nucleoside), which most likely represented the xylr  recognition sequence, was identified. binding of xylr was observed in vivo in the absence of effector, but changes in the binding pattern were induced in the presence of m-methylbenzyl alcohol, a xylr effector. in vivo footprinting analysis revealed that changes in the methylation pattern of g and t also occurred in the -50 to -90 region, which is probably occupied by integration host factor (ihf) protein. ihf was required for maximal expression from the tol upper  pathway operon promoter in escherichia coli. separation of the ihf site from uas2 by a full helix turn did not significantly affect stimulation of transcription, which is consistent with this region playing a conformational role, rather than a regulatory one, in promoter function.

AB  == a 43,000 molecular-weight, glucose-inducible, organic acid-repressible protein (oprb) was identified in the outer membrane of pseudomonas putida. oprb was surface expressed in whole cells, had a high beta-sheet content, and was heat modifiable, as demonstrated by 125i-labeling, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. oprb was extracted from outer membrane preparations by using 2% lubrol px with 10 mm edta and purified by deae-sephacel ion exchange chromatography following ammonium sulfate precipitation. reconstitution experiments with black lipid membranes showed that oprb formed small, cation-selective pores which bound glucose (ks = 110 mm) and other carbohydrates. however, the binding site of oprb appeared to be distinct from that of the maltodextrin-specific porin lamb from escherichia coli.

TI  == overproduction, purification, and characterization of chlorocatechol dioxygenase, a non-heme iron dioxygenase with broad substrate tolerance.
AB  == we show here that purified chlorocatechol dioxygenase from pseudomonas putida is  able to oxygenate a wide range of substituted catechols with turnover numbers ranging from 2 to 29 s-1. this enzyme efficiently cleaves substituted catechols bearing electron-donating or multiple electron-withdrawing groups in an intradiol manner with kcat/km values between 0.2 x 10(7) and 1.4 x 10(7) m-1 s-1. these unique catalytic properties prompted a comparison with the related but highly specific enzymes catechol 1,2-dioxygenase and protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase. the chlorocatechol dioxygenase gene (clca) from the pseudomonas plasmid pac27 was subcloned into the expression vector pkk223-3, allowing production of chlorocatechol dioxygenase to approximately 7-8% of total cellular protein. an average of 4 mg of purified enzyme has been obtained per gram of wet cells. protein and iron analyses indicate an iron stoichiometry of 1 iron/57.5-kda homodimer, alpha 2fe. the electronic absorption spectrum contains a broad tyrosinate to iron charge transfer transition centered at 430 nm (epsilon = 3095  m-1 cm-1 based on iron concentration) which shifts to 490 nm (epsilon = 3380 m-1  cm-1) upon catechol binding. the resonance raman spectrum of the native enzyme exhibits characteristic tyrosine ring vibrations. electron paramagnetic resonance data for the resting enzyme (g = 4.25, 9.83) is consistent with high-spin iron (iii) in a rhombic environment. this similarity between the spectroscopic properties of the fe(iii) centers in chlorocatechol dioxygenase and the more specific dioxygenases suggests a highly conserved catalytic site. we infer that the unique catalytic properties of chlorocatechol dioxygenase are due to other characteristics of its substrate binding pocket.

TI  == cloning of pectate lyase gene pel from pseudomonas fluorescens and detection of sequences homologous to pel in pseudomonas viridiflava and pseudomonas putida.
AB  == pectate lyase (pl) depolymerizes pectin and other polygalacturonates (pgas) and is thought to play a role in bacterial invasion of plants. production of pl by the soft-rotting pathogen pseudomonas fluorescens cy091 is regulated by ca2+. in  the presence of ca2+, this bacterium constitutively synthesizes pl in media containing glucose, glycerol, or pga and excretes over 87% of total pl into culture fluids. in the absence of ca2+, the organism fails to use pga as a carbon source and produces very low levels of pl in media containing glucose or glycerol. of the small amount of pl produced by the bacterium in ca(2+)-deficient media, over 78% was detected within the cells, indicating that ca2+ is critical not only for the production but also for the secretion of pl. the pel gene, encoding an alkaline pl (pi 10.0, mr 41,000) was cloned and located on the overlapping region of a 4.3-kb sali and a 7.1-kb ecori fragment. the 7.1-kb ecori fragment appears to contain a promoter for pel gene expression. a 1.7-kb sali-xhoi subfragment of the 4.3-kb sali fragment was cloned into puc18 to give protm2. escherichia coli cells carrying protm2 produce 50 to 100 times more pl than do cells carrying other pectolytic constructs. production of pl by e. coli (protm2) was not affected by carbon sources or by ca2+. the pi and mr of pl from  e. coli corresponded to values for its counterpart from p. fluorescens. a 0.7-kb  bglii-clai fragment encoding the pel structural sequence was used to detect pel homologs in various species of fluorescent pseudomonads. homologous sequences were observed in 10 of 11 strains of p. fluorescens, p. viridiflava, and p. putida. the pel gene in fluorescent pseudomonads is well conserved and may exist  and remain repressed in certain strains or species which exhibit nonpectolytic phenotypes under laboratory conditions.

TI  == characterization of the pseudomonas sp. strain p51 gene tcbr, a lysr-type transcriptional activator of the tcbcdef chlorocatechol oxidative operon, and analysis of the regulatory region.
AB  == plasmid pp51 of pseudomonas sp. strain p51 contains two gene clusters encoding the degradation of chlorinated benzenes, tcbab and tcbcdef. a regulatory gene, tcbr, was located upstream and divergently transcribed from the chlorocatechol oxidative gene cluster tcbcdef. the tcbr gene was characterized by dna sequencing and expression studies with escherichia coli and pet8c and appeared to encode a 32-kda protein. the activity of the tcbr gene product was analyzed in pseudomonas putida kt2442, in which it appeared to function as a positive regulator of tcbc expression. protein extracts of both e. coli overproducing tcbr and pseudomonas sp. strain p51 showed specific dna binding to the 150-bp region that is located between the tcbr and tcbc genes. primer extension mapping demonstrated that the transcription start sites of tcbr and tcbc are located in this region and that the divergent promoter sequences of both genes overlap. amino acid sequence comparisons indicated that tcbr is a member of the lysr family of transcriptional activator proteins and shares a high degree of homology with other activator proteins involved in regulating the metabolism of aromatic compounds.

TI  == up-promoter mutations in the trpba operon of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == in pseudomonas aeruginosa, the operon encoding tryptophan synthase (trpba) is positively regulated by the trpi protein and an intermediate in tryptophan biosynthesis, indoleglycerol phosphate (ingp). a gene fusion in which the trpba promoter directs expression of the pseudomonas putida xyle gene was constructed.  by using a p. putida f1 tode mutant carrying this fusion on a plasmid, three cis-acting mutations that increased xyle expression enough to allow the tode strain to grow on toluene were isolated. the level of xyle transcript from the trpba promoter was increased in all three mutants. all three mutations are base substitutions located in the -10 region of the trpba promoter; two of these mutations make the promoter sequence more like the escherichia coli rna polymerase sigma 70 promoter consensus sequence. the activities of the wild-type  and mutant trpba promoters, as monitored by xyle expression, were assayed in p. putida ppg1 and in e. coli. the up-regulatory phenotypes of the mutants were maintained in the heterologous backgrounds, as was trpi and ingp dependence. these results indicate that the p. aeruginosa trpba promoter has the key characteristics of a typical e. coli positively regulated promoter. the results also show that the p. aeruginosa and p. putida trpi activator gene products are functionally interchangeable.

AB  == transcription from promoter pu of the upper catabolic operon of the pseudomonas putida tol plasmid which specifies conversion of toluene/xylenes to benzoate/toluates is activated by the tol-encoded regulator xylr protein in the presence of substrates of the catabolic pathway and in conjunction with the sigma 54(ntra)-containing form of rna polymerase. this regulatory circuit was faithfully reproduced in escherichia coli in single copy gene dosage by integrating the corresponding controlling determinants into the chromosomes of several k12 derivatives by means of specialized transposons. in vivo monitoring of the activity of a pu-lacz fusion in e. coli strains with different genetic backgrounds demonstrated that integration host factor (ihf) is involved in pu regulation and that hyperproduction of the xylr protein leads to a decrease of pu activity in a manner in which deletion of the putative dna-binding domain of the  xylr does not impair its inhibitory effect when hyperproduced. one discrete ihf binding site and two potential xylr sites (consensus sequence 5'-ttgancaaatc-3'), bracketted by short stretches of dnase i-hypersensitive bonds, were detected upstream of the transcription initiation site. a model accounting for the features found is proposed which includes the ihf-promoted looping of upstream xylr-dna complexes so that they contact the sigma 54(ntra)-rna polymerase bound at -12/-24 positions.

TI  == cloning and sequence analysis of the lpd-glc structural gene of pseudomonas putida.
AB  == pseudomonas putida is able to produce three lipoamide dehydrogenases: (i) lpd-glc, which is the e3 component of the pyruvate and 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes and the l-factor for the glycine oxidation system; (ii) lpd-val, which is the specific e3 component of the branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase complex and is induced by growth on leucine, isoleucine, or valine; and (iii) lpd-3, which was discovered in a lpdg mutant and whose role is unknown. southern hybridization with an oligonucleotide probe encoding the highly conserved redox-active site produced three bands corresponding to the genes encoding these three lipoamide dehydrogenases. the complete structural gene for lpd-glc, lpdg, was isolated, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. the latter consists of 476 codons plus a stop codon, taa. the structural gene for lpd-glc is preceded by a partial open reading frame with strong similarity to the e2 component of 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase of escherichia coli. this suggests  that lpdg is part of the 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase operon. lpd-glc was expressed in pseudomonas putida js348 from php4 which contains a partial open reading frame corresponding to the e2 component, 94 bases of noncoding dna, and the structural gene for lpdg. this result indicates that lpdg can be expressed separately from the other genes of the operon.

AB  == pseudomonas sp. strain p51 contains two gene clusters located on catabolic plasmid pp51 that encode the degradation of chlorinated benzenes. the nucleotide  sequence of a 5,499-bp region containing the chlorocatechol-oxidative gene cluster tcbcdef was determined. the sequence contained five large open reading frames, which were all colinear. the functionality of these open reading frames was studied with various escherichia coli expression systems and by analysis of enzyme activities. the first gene, tcbc, encodes a 27.5-kda protein with chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase activity. the tcbc gene is followed by tcbd, which encodes cycloisomerase ii (39.5 kda); a large open reading frame (orf3) with an unknown function; tcbe, which encodes hydrolase ii (25.8 kda); and tcbf, which encodes a putative trans-dienelactone isomerase (37.5 kda). the tcbcdef gene cluster showed strong dna homology (between 57.6 and 72.1% identity) and an organization similar to that of other known plasmid-encoded operons for chlorocatechol metabolism, e.g., clcabd of pseudomonas putida and tfdcdef of alcaligenes eutrophus jmp134. the identity between amino acid sequences of functionally related enzymes of the three operons varied between 50.6 and 75.7%,  with the tcbcdef and tfdcdef pair being the least similar of the three. measurements of the specific activities of chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenases encoded by tcbc, clca, and tfdc suggested that a specialization among type ii enzymes has taken place. tcbc preferentially converts 3,4-dichlorocatechol relative to other chlorinated catechols, whereas tfdc has a higher activity toward 3,5-dichlorocatechol. clca takes an intermediate position, with the highest activity level for 3-chlorocatechol and the second-highest level for 3,5-dichlorocatechol.

(1990) biochem. biophys. res. commun. 169, 1049-1054]. the amino  acid sequence between positions 8 and 37 of salicylate hydroxylase shows homology with known adp binding sites of other fad-containing oxidoreductases, thus confirming its biochemical function. the sequence of the pseudomonas putida salicylate hydroxylase was compared with those of other similar flavoproteins. a  small dna segment (831 base pairs) disrupts the continuity of the known gene order nahg and nahh, the latter encoding catechol 2,3-dioxygenase. the complete nucleotide sequence of the intergenic region spanning genes nahg and nahh has been determined and its biological role proposed.

TI  == a series of wide-host-range low-copy-number vectors that allow direct screening for recombinants.
AB  == a series of controlled expression vectors was constructed based on the wide-host-range plasmid pmmb66eh. some of these new vectors code for the alpha-peptide of beta-galactosidase and allow the direct screening of recombinant clones by inactivation of alpha-complementation. the bla gene was replaced in some plasmids by the cat gene of tn9 coding for chloramphenicol resistance, extending the use into beta-lactam-resistant strains. they all feature either the tac or taclac (tac-lac uv5 in tandem) promoters in front of a polylinker followed by the rrnb transcriptional stop point. these vectors were tested by subcloning the xyle gene coding for the pseudomonas putida catechol 2,3-oxygenase and the escherichia coli lamb gene coding for the lambda receptor. the expression of these genes in e. coli indicated that the tac promoter is five times stronger than the taclac promoter and that both were tightly regulated. the tac promoter in pseudomonas syringae pv glycinea and xanthomonas campestris pv vesicatoria had a strength similar to that in e. coli, while the taclac promoter was much weaker, reaching only 6.5 and 3% of the level of expression of the tac promoter, respectively. the taclac promoter, however, proved to be useful for the cloning in e. coli of dna fragments that were unstable in vectors with stronger promoters and higher copy number. expression of the lamb gene in vibrio cholerae strain trh7000 was not sufficient to permit cosmid transduction. two subunits of the e.  coli mannose permease, coded by the ptsp and ptsm genes, are also required for cosmid dna penetration into the recipient cells.

TI  == molecular characterization and expression analysis of the anthranilate synthase gene of pseudomonas syringae subsp. savastanoi.
AB  == the trpe gene, which encodes the large component of the enzyme anthranilate synthase, was isolated from a pseudomonas syringae subsp. savastanoi (p. savastanoi) cosmid library. cosmids that complemented an escherichia coli trpe mutation contained a gene whose product is 86% homologous at the deduced amino acid level to trpe of pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas putida. amino acid sequence comparison with other trpe sequences revealed the existence of conserved regions between the procaryotic and eucaryotic polypeptide sequences analyzed, regions that might be of functional importance. we also report on studies on the  expression pattern of this gene. we analyzed the promoter activity of a trpe::lacz transcriptional fusion, the relative amount of trpe steady-state mrna, and the activity of anthranilate synthase from cells grown in minimal medium with or without exogenously added tryptophan and in complete medium. we concluded that under the conditions tested, expression of the trpe gene of p. savastanoi is independent of the concentration of tryptophan in the culture medium. implications of such an expression pattern on the virulence of this bacterium are discussed.

TI  == cloning and characterization of plasmid-encoded genes for the degradation of 1,2-dichloro-, 1,4-dichloro-, and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene of pseudomonas sp. strain p51.
AB  == pseudomonas sp. strain p51 is able to use 1,2-dichlorobenzene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as sole carbon and energy sources. two gene clusters involved in the degradation of these compounds were identified on a catabolic plasmid, pp51, with a size of 110 kb by using hybridization. they were further characterized by cloning in escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida kt2442, and alcaligenes eutrophus jmp222. expression studies in these organisms showed that the upper-pathway genes (tcba and tcbb) code for the conversion of 1,2-dichlorobenzene and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene to 3,4-dichlorocatechol and 3,4,6-trichlorocatechol, respectively, by means of a dioxygenase system and a dehydrogenase. the lower-pathway genes have the order tcbc-tcbd-tcbe and encode a catechol 1,2-dioxygenase ii, a cycloisomerase ii, and a hydrolase ii, respectively. the combined action of these enzymes degrades 3,4-dichlorocatechol and 3,4,6-trichlorocatechol to a chloromaleylacetic acid. the release of one chlorine atom from 3,4-dichlorocatechol takes place during lactonization of 2,3-dichloromuconic acid.

TI  == [quantitation of acinetobacter calcoaceticus in mixed bacterial cultures by an enzyme immunoassay].
AB  == an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using polyclonal antibodies from rabbits has been developed for quantification of acinetobacter calcoaceticus. bacteria were added to the wells of a microtiter plate coated with anti-acinetobacter immunoglobulin. for detecting bound cells the peroxidase-labelled immunoglobulin  fraction was used. over a distinct range there is a linear correlation between bound bacteria and measured absorbance allowing a quantification of bacteria in an order from 10(7) to 10(8) per milliliter. the specificity of the assay was evaluated by the heterologous bacteria pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, escherichia coli and citrobacter freundii. only a minimal cross-reactivity was observed. within a certain range of error it is possible to quantitate acinetobacter calcoaceticus in mixtures with one or several other bacterial species. mixed with bacteria of one other species the differences to the value for acinetobacter calcoaceticus alone do not exceed +/-  10% with a tendency to lower values. mixed with several other species only negative differences up to -15% were obtained. treatment of acinetobacter calcoaceticus with 0.5% formaldehyde results in a loss of reactivity up to 15%. in conclusion, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is a useful method for quantitating bacteria not only with respect to the high sensitivity, specificity  and good reproducibility but also for the minimal technical equipment and the short assay time.

TI  == growth-phase-dependent expression of the pseudomonas putida tol plasmid pww0 catabolic genes.
AB  == pseudomonas putida tol plasmid pww0 catabolic genes are clustered into two operons. the first, the upper operon, is controlled by the xylr regulatory gene,  whereas the second, the meta operon, is controlled by the xyls regulatory gene. the xyls gene itself is subjected to control by xylr. in this study, we show that the tol catabolic operons were poorly induced in cells growing at the early-exponential-growth phase but strongly induced in cells at late-exponential-growth phase. we constructed fusions of four tol promoters, pm (the promoter of the meta operon), pu (the promoter of the upper operon), ps (the promoter of the xyls regulatory gene), and pr (the promoter of the xylr regulatory gene) with lacz and examined, in escherichia coli and p. putida, the expression of these promoters in relation to the growth phase. expression from pm, pu, ps, and pr was almost constant if the host cells did not carry either xyls or xylr. similarly, expression of pm and pu in p. putida in the absence of xyls and xylr was constant during the growth of the cells. xyls-dependent transcription of pm and xylr-dependent transcription of ps and pu, in contrast, varied with the growth phase. this observation suggested that the interaction of  xyls and xylr with target promoters or with rna polymerases was influenced by the growth phase. the nature of the signal which triggers the growth-phase-dependent  regulation was not clear. a change in the oxygen partial pressure was not responsible for the regulation. e. coli mutants defective in rela, crp, and cya exhibited growth-phase-dependent expression of the tol catabolic genes, indicating that cyclic amp and rela-dependent synthesis of ppgpp are not involved in this phenomenon.

TI  == upstream regulatory sequence for transcriptional activator xylr in the first operon of xylene metabolism on the tol plasmid.
AB  == transcription of the first operon coding for m-xylene-degrading enzymes on the tol plasmid of pseudomonas putida is activated by the xylr gene product in the presence of m-xylene. the operon has the consensus sequence of the ntr/nif promoters at -24 and -12 regions, and the transcription is dependent on an rna polymerase containing a sigma factor ntra (rpon or sigma 54). deletion derivatives of the upstream sequence of the operon promoter were made in vitro and connected with the xyle gene on a plasmid. their promoter activities were analyzed in escherichia coli by monitoring catechol 2,3-dioxygenase activity, the xyle gene product. a cis-acting dna element was identified, which is required for activation of the operon promoter by xylr protein in the presence of the inducer. this regulatory sequence of about 40 base-pairs in length was located 150 base-pairs upstream from the transcription start site. analysis of the mutants containing insertions between the upstream regulatory sequence and the promoter sequence demonstrated strong dependence of the activation upon helical periodicity of dna. the regulatory sequence functioned in the inverse orientation or at a distance of more than 1 x 10(3) base-pairs upstream from the promoter though less efficient. these results indicated that this upstream regulatory sequence might be the binding site for xylr protein. dna-loop formation through protein-protein interaction between xylr protein attached to the upstream sequence and the ntra-containing rna polymerase bound by the promoter sequence was suggested for activation of the operon transcription. a sequence similar to the regulatory sequence of the first operon of xylene metabolism was found in the upstream region of the xyls gene, which is also activated by xylr protein in the  presence of m-xylene.

TI  == transposon vectors containing non-antibiotic resistance selection markers for cloning and stable chromosomal insertion of foreign genes in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == a simple procedure for cloning and stable insertion of foreign genes into the chromosomes of gram-negative eubacteria was developed by combining in two sets of plasmids (i) the transposition features of tn10 and tn5; (ii) the resistances to  the herbicide bialaphos, to mercuric salts and organomercurial compounds, and to  arsenite, and (iii) the suicide delivery properties of the r6k-based plasmid pgp704. the resulting constructions contained unique noti or sfii sites internal  to either the tn10 or the tn5 inverted repeats. these sites were readily used for cloning dna fragments with the help of two additional specialized cloning plasmids, puc18not and puc18sfi. the newly derived constructions could be maintained only in donor host strains that produce the r6k-specified pi protein,  which is an essential replication protein for r6k and plasmids derived therefrom. donor plasmids containing hybrid transposons were transformed into a specialized  lambda pir lysogenic escherichia coli strain with a chromosomally integrated rp4  that provided broad-host-range conjugal transfer functions. delivery of the donor plasmids into selected host bacteria was accomplished through mating with the target strain. transposition of the hybrid transposon from the delivered suicide  plasmid to a replicon in the target cell was mediated by the cognate transposase  encoded on the plasmid at a site external to the transposon. since the transposase function was not maintained in target cells, such cells were not immune to further transposition rounds. multiple insertions in the same strain are therefore only limited by the availability of distinct selection markers. the utility of the system was demonstrated with a kanamycin resistance gene as a model foreign insert into pseudomonas putida and a melanin gene from streptomyces antibioticus into klebsiella pneumoniae. because of the modular nature of the functional parts of the cloning vectors, they can be easily modified and further  selection markers can be incorporated. the cloning system described here will be  particularly useful for the construction of hybrid bacteria that stably maintain  inserted genes, perhaps in competitive situations (e.g., in open systems and natural environments), and that do not carry antibiotic resistance markers characteristic of most available cloning vectors (as is currently required of live bacterial vaccines).

TI  == genetic analysis of chromosomal operons involved in degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons in pseudomonas putida tmb.
AB  == the catabolic pathway for the degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons encoded by pseudomonas putida tmb differs from the tol plasmid-encoded pathway as far as regulation of the upper pathway is concerned. we found, by analyzing tn5-induced  mutants and by southern blot hybridization with appropriate probes derived from the tol plasmid pww0, that the catabolic genes of strain tmb were located on the  bacterial chromosome and not on the 84-kb plasmid harbored by this strain. the catabolic genes of tmb and pww0 had sequence homology, as shown by southern blot  hybridization, but differed significantly in their restriction patterns. the analysis of the mutants suggests that a regulatory mechanism similar to that present in pww0 coexists in tmb with a second mode of regulation which is epistatic on the former and that the chromosomal region carrying the catabolic genes is prone to rearrangements and deletions.

(1988) biochemistry 27, 540] are organized in an operon (mdlcba). mandelate racemase has regions of sequence similarity to muconate lactonizing enzymes i and ii from p. putida. (s)-mandelate dehydrogenase is predicted to be 393 amino acids in length and to have a molecular weight of 43,352; it has regions of sequence similarity to glycolate oxidase from spinach and ferricytochrome b2 lactate dehydrogenase from yeast. benzoylformate decarboxylase is predicted to be 499 amino acids in length and to have a molecular weight of 53,621; it has regions of sequence similarity to enzymes that decarboxylate pyruvate with thiamin pyrophosphate as cofactor. these observations support the hypothesis that the mandelate pathway evolved by recruitment of enzymes from preexisting metabolic pathways. the gene for benzoylformate decarboxylase has been expressed in escherichia coli with the trc promoter, and homogeneous enzyme has been isolated  from induced cells.

TI  == transcriptional analysis of the promoter region of the pseudomonas putida branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase operon.
AB  == branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase is a multienzyme complex produced by pseudomonas putida when it is grown in a minimal medium containing branched-chain amino acids. a 1.87-kilobase (kb) dna fragment was cloned and sequenced which contained 0.24 kb of the e1 alpha structural gene and 1.6 kb of upstream dna. there were 854 base pairs (bp) of noncoding dna upstream of bkda1, the first gene of the bkd operon, and 592 bp between the transcriptional and translational starts. the g + c content of the noncoding region was 56.7% compared with 65.2% for all the structural genes of the operon. a partial open reading frame was found on the strand opposite that of the bkd operon beginning at base 774. when the bkd promoter was cloned into the promoter probe vector pkt240, streptomycin resistance was obtained in p. putida but not escherichia coli with the promoter in both orientations, which indicates either that the bkd promoter is bidirectional or that there are two promoters in this region. a series of ordered deletions on both sides of the proposed site of the start of transcription revealed that almost 700 bp upstream of the start of translation were required for expression. streptomycin resistance was also obtained in an rpon mutant of p. putida kt2440 containing constructs with the intact bkd promoter, indicating that the bkd operon does not require the rpon sigma factor for expression. another construct containing the bkd promoter, bkda1, and bkda2 in pkt240 was used to transform p. putida js113, a mutant which was unable to produce the e1 subunits of the branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase. in this case, very high inducible  expression of the bkd operon was obtained.

AB  == a 4175-bp ecori fragment of dna that encodes the alpha and beta chains of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide) component (e1) of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex of bacillus stearothermophilus has been cloned in escherichia coli. its nucleotide sequence was determined. open reading frames (pdha, pdhb) corresponding to the e1 alpha subunit (368 amino acids, mr 41,312, without the initiating methionine residue) and e1 beta subunit (324 amino acids, mr 35,306, without the initiating methionine residue) were identified and confirmed with the aid of amino acid sequences determined directly from the purified polypeptide chains. the e1 beta gene begins just 3 bp downstream from the e1 alpha stop codon. it is followed, after a longer gap of 73 bp, by the start of another but incomplete open reading frame that, on the basis of its known amino acid sequence, encodes the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (e2) component of the complex. all three genes are preceded by potential ribosome-binding sites and the gene cluster is located immediately downstream from a region of dna showing numerous possible promoter sequences. the e1 alpha and e1 beta subunits of the b. stearothermophilus pyruvate dehydrogenase complex exhibit substantial sequence similarity with the e1 alpha and e1 beta subunits of pyruvate and branched-chain  2-oxo-acid dehydrogenase complexes from mammalian mitochondria and pseudomonas putida. in particular, the e1 alpha chain contains the highly conserved sequence  motif that has been found in all enzymes utilizing thiamin diphosphate as cofactor.

TI  == mutations leading to constitutive expression from the tol plasmid meta-cleavage pathway operon are located at the c-terminal end of the positive regulator protein xyls.
AB  == the xyls protein is the positive activator of the tol plasmid meta-cleavage pathway operon for the metabolism of alkylbenzoates in pseudomonas putida. the regulator stimulates transcription from the tol meta pathway operon promoter (pm) when activated by benzoate effectors or in the absence of effectors when overproduced. xyls mutant alleles that encode regulators which constitutively mediate expression from pm were isolated and characterized. the mutant proteins all exhibit single amino acid substitutions adjacent to putative alpha-helix-turn-alpha-helix domains at their c-terminal ends. the xyls mutant proteins can still be partially activated by the usual and unusual benzoate effectors for the wild-type regulator and when activated stimulate higher levels  of transcription from pm.

AB  == streptomyces griseolus atcc 11796 contains two inducible, herbicide-metabolizing  cytochromes p-450 previously designated p-450su1 and p-450su2 (p-450cva1 and p-450cvb1, respectively, using nomenclature of nebert et al. [d. w. nebert, m. adesnik, m. j. coon, r. w. estabrook, f. j. gonzalez, f. p. guengerich, i. c. gunsalus, e. f. johnson, b. kemper, w. levin, i. r. phillips, r. sato, and m. r.  waterman, dna 6:1-11, 1987]). using antibodies directed against cytochrome p-450su1, its n-terminal amino acid sequence, and amino acid composition, we cloned the suac gene encoding cytochrome p-450su1. similar information about the  cytochrome p-450su2 protein confirmed that a gene cloned by cross-hybridization to the suac gene was the subc gene encoding cytochrome p-450su2. the suac and subc genes were expressed in escherichia coli, dna for both genes was sequenced,  and the deduced amino acid sequences were compared with that of the well-characterized cytochrome p-450cam from pseudomonas putida. both cytochromes  p-450su1 and p-450su2 contain several regions of strong similarity with the amino acid sequence of p-450cam, primarily in regions of the protein responsible for attachment and coordination of the heme prosthetic group.

TI  == sequence analysis of the huth gene encoding histidine ammonia-lyase in pseudomonas putida.
AB  == the complete nucleotide sequence of the huth gene, encoding histidine ammonia-lyase (histidase), in pseudomonas putida atcc 12633 has been determined from the appropriate portions of the hut region that had been cloned into escherichia coli. the resulting dna sequence revealed an open reading frame of 1,530 base pairs, corresponding to a protein subunit of approximate molecular weight 53,600, in the location previously identified for the histidase gene by tn1000 mutagenesis. translation began at a gtg codon, but direct protein sequencing revealed that the initiating amino acid was removed posttranslationally to provide an n-terminal threonine; 11 additional residues completely agreed with the predicted amino acid sequence. this sequence excluded  the possibility that a dehydroalanine unit, the postulated coenzyme for histidase, is attached at the n terminus of histidase subunits. comparison of the p. putida histidase gene sequence with that of a bacillus subtilis region encoding histidase revealed 42% identity at the protein level. although the hutu  (urocanase) and huth (histidase) genes are induced by urocanate and normally are  transcribed as a unit beginning with hutu, analysis of the region immediately upstream of the histidase gene revealed a potential weak promoter that may possibly be used to maintain a basal level of histidase for the generation of inducer (urocanate) when histidine levels are elevated.

TI  == organization and sequence analysis of the 2,4-dichlorophenol hydroxylase and dichlorocatechol oxidative operons of plasmid pjp4.
AB  == growth of alcaligenes eutrophus jmp134 on 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate requires a 2,4-dichlorphenol hydroxylase encoded by gene tfdb. catabolism of either 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate or 3-chlorobenzoate involves enzymes encoded by the chlorocatechol oxidative operon consisting of tfdcdef, which converts 3-chloro- and 3,5-dichlorocatechol to maleylacetate and chloromaleylacetate, respectively.  transposon mutagenesis has localized tfdb and tfdcdef to ecori fragment b of plasmid pjp4 (r. h. don, a. j. wieghtman, h.-j. knackmuss, and k. n. timmis, j. bacteriol. 161:85-90, 1985). we present the complete nucleotide sequence of tfdb  and tfdcdef contained within a 7,954-base-pair hindiii-ssti fragment from ecori fragment b. sequence and expression analysis of tfdb in escherichia coli suggested that 2,4-dichlorophenol hydroxylase consists of a single subunit of 65  kilodaltons. the amino acid sequences of proteins encoded by tfdd and tfde were found to be 63 and 53% identical to those of functionally similar enzymes encoded by clcb and clcd, respectively, from plasmid pac27 of pseudomonas putida. p. putida(pac27) can utilize 3-chlorocatechol but not dichlorinated catechols. a region of dna adjacent to clcd in pac27 was found to be 47% identical in amino acid sequence to tfdf, a gene important in catabolizing dichlorocatechols. the region in pac27 does not appear to encode a protein, suggesting that the absence  of a functional trans-chlorodienelactone isomerase may prevent p. putida(pac27) from utilizing 3,5-dichlorocatechol.

TI  == a new family of rsf1010-derived expression and lac-fusion broad-host-range vectors for gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == a series of broad-host-range expression and lac fusion vectors, based on rsf1010  derivatives, was constructed. the expression vectors contain various promoters (pnm, plac, ptac and ps1) for expression of foreign genes. the efficiency of the  promoters was determined in escherichia coli, rhizobium meliloti, rhizobium leguminosarum and pseudomonas putida by beta-galactosidase activity measurements. of the promoters assayed in e. coli, the most effective is the tac promoter, whereas in soil bacteria the appropriate promoter for overexpression of foreign genes is the nmr promoter. the gmr gene, serving as a selectable marker for the plasmids, was efficiently expressed in r. meliloti as revealed by sodium dodecyl  sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and thus, pgm was also used to construct an expression vector. the translational fusion vectors allow the identification and characterization of promoter-carrying cloned fragments on the  translational level, whereas the transcriptional fusion vectors can be used to identify and to study promoters on cloned fragments. all lac fusion vectors contain the e. coli lacz gene or the complete lac operon facilitating quantification of expression.

TI  == a family of positive regulators related to the pseudomonas putida tol plasmid xyls and the escherichia coli arac activators.
AB  == the xyls family consists of a least 8 different transcriptional regulators. six of these proteins are positive regulators for the catabolism of carbon sources (benzoate and sugars) in escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida and erwinia carotovora, and two of them are involved in pathogenesis in escherichia coli and  yersinia enterocolitica. based on protein alignments, the members of this family  exhibit a long stretch of homology at the c-terminal end. the regulators involved in the catabolism of carbon sources stimulate transcription from their respectively regulated promoters only in the presence of effectors. in two of the regulators, mutations at the non-homologous n-terminus alter affinity and specificity for effectors while mutations at the conserved c-terminus part decrease activation of transcription from their corresponding regulated promoters. it is thus probable that the variable n-terminus end in this family of regulators contains the motif involved in effector recognition, while the c-terminal end is involved in dna-binding. these proteins seem to be related by common ancestry and may act through similar mechanisms of positive regulation effected through similar folding patterns.

TI  == putidaredoxin reductase and putidaredoxin. cloning, sequence determination, and heterologous expression of the proteins.
AB  == the oxidation of camphor by cytochrome p-450cam requires the participation of a flavoprotein, putidaredoxin reductase, and an iron-sulfur protein, putidaredoxin, to mediate the transfer of electrons from nadh to p-450 for oxygen activation. a  2.2-kilobase pair bamhi-stui fragment from whole cell dna of camphor-grown pseudomonas putida has been cloned and sequenced. translation of the sequence revealed two open reading frames that could code for putidaredoxin reductase and  putidaredoxin. in the case of putidaredoxin, the translated sequence matched the  published sequence (tanaka, m., haniu, m., yasunobu, k. t., dus, k., and gunsalus, i. c. (1974) j. biol. chem. 249, 3689-3701) with the exception of one amino acid. codon usage in these proteins, like the proteins of other pseudomonads, is strongly biased to g + c in the third nucleotide. a potential transcription termination site was found 3' to the putidaredoxin coding region. the "fad-binding" amino acid consensus sequence, present in other flavoproteins,  was found in putidaredoxin reductase beginning at residue 11 and a second occurrence of this sequence was found beginning with amino acid 156. the second sequence could represent the nad-binding site. the regions encoding putidaredoxin reductase and putidaredoxin were subcloned and independently expressed in escherichia coli at the level of 0.4 and 4.8 mg of enzymatically active protein/g wet weight of cells, respectively. site-directed mutagenesis was used to change the rare start codon, gtg, of putidaredoxin reductase to atg which resulted in an 18-fold increase in the level of expression of this protein to 7.4 mg/g wet weight of cells. the construction of these two clones, which express these important proteins, will facilitate studies of their interaction with each other  and with p-450cam.

TI  == microcosm for assessing survival of genetically engineered microorganisms in aquatic environments.
AB  == laboratory-contained microcosms are important for studying the fate and survival  of genetically engineered microorganisms. in this study, we describe a simple aquatic microcosm that utilizes survival chambers in a flowthrough or static renewal system. the model was used to study the survival of genetically engineered and wild-type strains of escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida in the lake water environment. temperature-dependent studies indicated that the genetically engineered microorganisms survived better or at least as well as their wild-type counterparts at 15, 25, and 30 degrees c. the genetic determinants of the genetically engineered microorganisms also remained fairly stable within the host cell under the tested conditions. in the presence of organisms indigenous to lake water, e. coli was eliminated after 20 days, whereas p. putida showed an initial decline but was able to stabilize its population after 5 days. a herbicide, hydrothol-191, caused a significant decline in numbers of p. putida, but no significant difference was observed between the genetically  engineered microorganisms and the wild-type strain. the microcosm described is simple, can be easily adapted to study a variety of environmental variables, and  has the advantage that the organisms tested are constantly exposed to test waters that are continuously renewed.

TI  == identification and localization of 3-phenylcatechol dioxygenase and 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoate hydrolase genes of pseudomonas putida and expression in escherichia coli.
AB  == the bphc and bphd genes of pseudomonas putida involved in the catabolism of polychlorinated biphenyls or biphenyl were identified, localized, and studied for expression in escherichia coli. this was achieved by cloning a 2.4-kilobase (kb)  dna fragment of recombinant cosmid poh101 into hindiii site of puc plasmids downstream of a lacz promoter and measuring the enzyme activities of 3-phenylcatechol dioxygenase (3-pdase; a product of bphc) and the meta-cleavage product 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoate hydrolase (a product of bphd).  the amount of 3-pdase produced in e. coli was about 20 times higher than that of  the enzyme produced by the parent, p. putida. determination of expression of the  bphc and bphd genes through their own promoter sequences or by using the lacz promoter of puc plasmids was done by cloning the dna that encodes bphc and bphd genes in a hindiii site of a promoter selection vector (pkk232-8) upstream of the gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat). the recombinant plasmid (paw787) constructed by inserting the 2.4-kb dna in pkk232-8 expressed both 3-pdase and cat activities. another hybrid construct (paw786) in which the dna insert was cloned in the opposite orientation lacked cat activity but produced normal amounts of 3-pdase activity. on the basis of these results, we suggest that the bphc and bphd genes were expressed by using promoter sequences that are  independent of the promoter that expresses cat activity in e. coli. the locations of the bphc and bphd genes were determined by insertional inactivation of the open reading frames of structural genes bphc and bphd by tn5 mutagenesis.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == a purification procedure has been developed for an extradiol dioxygenase expressed in escherichia coli, which was originally derived from a pseudomonas putida strain able to grow on toluidine. physical and kinetic properties of the enzyme have been investigated. the enzyme has a subunit mr of 33,500 +/- 2000 by  sds/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. gel filtration indicates a molecular mass under non-denaturing conditions of 120,000 +/- 20,000. the n-terminal sequence (35 residues) of the enzyme has been determined and exhibits 50% identity with other extradiol dioxygenases. fe(ii) is a cofactor of the enzyme, as it is for other extradiol dioxygenases. the reactivity of this enzyme towards catechol and  methyl-substituted catechols is somewhat different from that seen for other catechol 2,3-dioxygenases, with 3-methylcatechol cleaved at a higher rate than catechol or 4-methylcatechol. km values for these substrates with this enzyme are all around 0.3 microm. the enzyme exhibits a bell-shaped ph profile with pka values of 6.9 +/- 0.1 and 8.7 +/- 0.1. these results are compared with those found for other extradiol dioxygenases.

TI  == evolutionary differences in chromosomal locations of four early genes of the tryptophan pathway in fluorescent pseudomonads: dna sequences and characterization of pseudomonas putida trpe and trpgdc.
AB  == pseudomonas putida possesses seven structural genes for enzymes of the tryptophan pathway. all but one, trpg, which encodes the small (beta) subunit of anthranilate synthase, have been mapped on the circular chromosome. this report describes the cloning and sequencing of p. putida trpe, trpg, trpd, and trpc. in  p. putida and pseudomonas aeruginosa, dna sequence analysis as well as growth and enzyme assays of insertionally inactivated strains indicated that trpg is the first gene in a three-gene operon that also contains trpd and trpc. in p. putida, trpe is 2.2 kilobases upstream from the trpgdc cluster, whereas in p. aeruginosa, they are separated by at least 25 kilobases (t. shinomiya, s. shiga, and m. kageyama, mol. gen. genet., 189:382-389, 1983). the dna sequence in p. putida shows an open reading frame on the opposite strand between trpe and trpgdc; this  putative gene was not characterized. evidence is also presented for sequence similarities in the 5' untranslated regions of trpe and trpgdc in both pseudomonads; the function of these regions is unknown, but it is possible that they play some role in regulation of these genes, since all the genes respond to  repression by tryptophan. the sequences of the anthranilate synthase genes in the fluorescent pseudomonads resemble those of p-aminobenzoate synthase genes of the  enteric bacteria more closely than the anthranilate synthase genes of those organisms; however, no requirement for p-aminobenzoate was found in the pseudomonas mutants created in this study.

TI  == identification and characterization of genes for a second anthranilate synthase in pseudomonas aeruginosa: interchangeability of the two anthranilate synthases and evolutionary implications.
AB  == two anthranilate synthase gene pairs have been identified in pseudomonas aeruginosa. they were cloned, sequenced, inactivated in vitro by insertion of an  antibiotic resistance gene, and returned to p. aeruginosa, replacing the wild-type gene. one anthranilate synthase enzyme participates in tryptophan synthesis; its genes are designated trpe and trpg. the other anthranilate synthase enzyme, encoded by phna and phnb, participates in the synthesis of pyocyanin, the characteristic phenazine pigment of the organism. trpe and trpg are independently transcribed; homologous genes have been cloned from pseudomonas putida. the phenazine pathway genes phna and phnb are cotranscribed. the cloned phna phnb gene pair complements trpe and trpe(g) mutants of escherichia coli. homologous genes were not found in p. putida ppg1, a non-phenazine producer. surprisingly, phna and phnb are more closely related to e. coli trpe and trpg than to pseudomonas trpe and trpg, whereas pseudomonas trpe and trpg are more closely related to e. coli pabb and paba than to e. coli trpe and trpg. we replaced the wild-type trpe on the p. aeruginosa chromosome with a mutant form having a considerable portion of its coding sequence deleted and replaced by a tetracycline resistance gene cassette. this resulted in tryptophan auxotrophy; however, spontaneous tryptophan-independent revertants appeared at a frequency of 10(-5) to 10(6). the anthranilate synthase of these revertants is not feedback inhibited by tryptophan, suggesting that it arises from phnab. phna mutants retain a low level of pyocyanin production. introduction of an inactivated trpe gene into a phna mutant abolished residual pyocyanin production, suggesting that  the trpe trpg gene products are capable of providing some anthranilate for pyocyanin synthesis.

TI  == pseudomonas chromosomal replication origins: a bacterial class distinct from escherichia coli-type origins.
AB  == the bacterial origins of dna replication have been isolated from pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas putida. these origins comprise a second class of bacterial origins distinct from enteric-type origins: both origins function in both pseudomonas species, and neither functions in escherichia coli; enteric origins do not function in either pseudomonad. both cloned sequences hybridize to chromosomal fragments that show properties expected of replication origins. these origin plasmids are highly unstable, are present at low copy number, and show mutual incompatibility properties. dna sequence analysis shows that both origins  contain several 9-base-pair (bp) e. coli dnaa protein binding sites; four of these are conserved in position and orientation, two of which resemble the r1 and r4 sites of the e. coli origin. conserved 13-bp direct repeats adjacent to the analogous r1 site are also found. no gatc sites are in the p. aeruginosa origin and only four are in the p. putida origin; no other 4-bp sequence is present in high abundance. both origins are found between sequences similar to the e. coli and bacillus subtilis dnaa, dnan, rpmh, and rnpa genes, a gene organization identical to that for b. subtilis and unlike that of e. coli. a second autonomously replicating sequence was obtained from p. aeruginosa that has some properties of bacterial origins.

TI  == nucleotide sequencing and characterization of pseudomonas putida catr: a positive regulator of the catbc operon is a member of the lysr family.
AB  == pseudomonas putida utilizes the catbc operon for growth on benzoate as a sole carbon source. this operon is positively regulated by the catr protein, which is  encoded from a gene divergently oriented from the catbc operon. the catr gene encodes a 32.2-kilodalton polypeptide that binds to the catbc promoter region in  the presence or absence of the inducer cis-cis-muconate, as shown by gel retardation studies. however, the inducer is required for transcriptional activation of the catbc operon. the catr promoter has been localized to a 385-base-pair fragment by using the broad-host-range promoter-probe vector pkt240. this fragment also contains the catbc promoter whose -35 site is separated by only 36 nucleotides from the predicted catr translational start. dot blot analysis suggests that catr binding to this dual promoter-control region, in addition to inducing the catbc operon, may also regulate its own expression. data from a computer homology search using the predicted amino acid sequence of catr,  deduced from the dna sequence, showed catr to be a member of a large class of procaryotic regulatory proteins designated the lysr family. striking homology was seen between catr and a putative regulatory protein, tfds.

TI  == activation of chi recombinational hotspots by recbcd-like enzymes from enteric bacteria.
AB  == chi sites, 5'g-c-t-g-g-t-g-g-3', enhance homologous recombination in escherichia  coli and are activated by the recbcd enzyme. to test the ability of chi to be activated by analogous enzymes from other bacteria, we cloned recbcd-like genes from diverse bacteria into an e. coli recbcd deletion mutant. clones from seven species of enteric bacteria conferred to this deletion mutant recombination proficiency, chi hotspot activity in lambda red- gam- vegetative crosses, and recbcd enzyme activities, including chi-dependent dna strand cleavage. three clones from pseudomonas aeruginosa and ps. putida conferred recombination proficiency and atp-dependent nuclease activity, but neither chi hotspot activity nor chi-dependent dna cleavage. these results imply that chi has been conserved as a recombination-promoting signal for recbcd-like enzymes in enteric bacteria but not in more distantly related bacteria such as pseudomonas spp. we discuss the possibility that other, presently unknown, nucleotide sequences serve the same function as chi in pseudomonas spp.

TI  == trichloroethylene degradation by escherichia coli containing the cloned pseudomonas putida f1 toluene dioxygenase genes.
AB  == toluene dioxygenase from pseudomonas putida f1 has been implicated as an enzyme capable of degrading trichloroethylene. this has now been confirmed with escherichia coli jm109(pdtg601) that contains the structural genes (todc1c2ba) of toluene dioxygenase under the control of the tac promoter. the extent of trichloroethylene degradation by the recombinant organism depended on the cell concentration and the concentration of trichloroethylene. a linear rate of trichloroethylene degradation was observed with the e. coli recombinant strain. in contrast, p. putida f39/d, a mutant strain of p. putida f1 that does not contain cis-toluene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, showed a much faster initial rate  of trichloroethylene degradation which decreased over time.

TI  == physically associated enzymes produce and metabolize 2-hydroxy-2,4-dienoate, a chemically unstable intermediate formed in catechol metabolism via meta cleavage  in pseudomonas putida.
AB  == the meta-cleavage pathway of catechol is a major mechanism for degradation of aromatic compounds. in this pathway, the aromatic ring of catechol is cleaved by  catechol 2,3-dioxygenase and its product, 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde, is further metabolized by either a hydrolytic or dehydrogenative route. in the dehydrogenative route, 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde is oxidized to the enol form of 4-oxalocrotonate by a dehydrogenase and then further metabolized to acetaldehyde and pyruvate by the actions of 4-oxalocrotonate isomerase, 4-oxalocrotonate decarboxylase, 2-oxopent-4-enoate hydratase, and 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase. in this study, the isomerase, decarboxylase, and hydratase encoded in the tol plasmid pww0 of pseudomonas putida mt-2 were purified and characterized. the 28-kilodalton isomerase was formed by association of extremely small identical protein subunits with an apparent molecular weight of 3,500. the decarboxylase and the hydratase were 27- and 28-kilodalton polypeptides, respectively, and were copurified by high-performance-liquid chromatography with anion-exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and gel filtration columns. the structural genes for the decarboxylase (xyli) and the hydratase (xylj) were cloned into escherichia coli. the elution profile in anion-exchange chromatography of the decarboxylase and the hydratase isolated from e. coli xyli+xylj- and xyli-xylj+ clones, respectively, were different from those isolated from xyli+ xylj+ bacteria. this suggests that the carboxylase and the hydratase form a complex in vivo. the keto but not the enol form of 4-oxalocrotonate was a substrate for the decarboxylase. the product of decarboxylation was 2-hydroxypent-2,4-dienoate rather than its keto form, 2-oxopent-4-enoate. the hydratase acts on the former but not the latter isomer. because 2-hydroxypent-2,4-dienoate is chemically unstable, formation of a complex between the decarboxylase and the hydratase may assure efficient transformation of this unstable intermediate in vivo.

TI  == [plasmids for biphenyl, chlorobiphenyl and metatoluylate degradation from pseudomonas putida].
AB  == pseudomonas putida strain su83, harbors the pbs311 plasmid coding for the degradation of biphenyl, 2- and 4-chlorbiphenyl, meta- and paratoluylate. the insertional mutants of the plasmid obtained by the transposon tn5 insertion were  isolated. one of the mutants was used for cloning of the biphenyl degradation genes. the plasmid pbs311:: tn5 dna was inserted into the bamhi site of the plasmid pbr322 and cloned. 11 recombinants of 354 tested were treated with 0.1% solution of 2,3-dioxybiphenyl. one of them has acquired the yellow colour testifying to conversion of 2,3-dioxyphenyl to "2-hydroxy-6-keto-6-phenylhexa-2,4-diene acid. the recombinant plasmid pbs312 from this clone is 10.5 kb in size, the size of the insert being 6.2 kb. escherichia coli su185 cells harbouring pbs312 are able to support metacleavage of 2,3-dioxybiphenyl, 3-methylcatechol and catechol, but not of 4-methylcatechol. the results suggest the cloned fragment to contain a gene for 2,3-dioxybiphenyl-1,2-dioxygenase, the third enzyme for biphenyl catabolism.

TI  == putidaredoxin competitively inhibits cytochrome b5-cytochrome p-450cam association: a proposed molecular model for a cytochrome p-450cam electron-transfer complex.
AB  == cytochrome b5 has been genetically engineered to afford a fluorescent derivative  capable of monitoring its association with cytochrome p-450cam from pseudomonas putida [stayton, p. s., fisher, m. t., & sligar, s. g. (1988) j. biol. chem. 263, 13544-13548]. in the mutant cytochrome b5, threonine is replaced by a cysteine at position 65 (t65c) and has been labeled with the environmentally sensitive fluorophore acrylodan. in this paper, the physiological p-450cam reductant putidaredoxin, an fe2s2.cys4 iron-sulfur protein, is shown to competitively inhibit the cytochrome b5 association, suggesting that cytochrome b5 and putidaredoxin bind to a similar site on the cytochrome p-450cam surface. since the crystal structures for both cytochrome b5 and cytochrome p-450cam have been solved to high resolution, the complex has been computer modeled, and a good fit  was found on the proximal surface of nearest approach to the p-450cam heme prosthetic group. the proposed model includes electrostatic contacts between conserved cytochrome b5 carboxylates glu-44, glu-48, asp-60, and the exposed heme propionate with cytochrome p-450cam basic residues lys-344, arg-72, arg-112, and  arg-364, respectively. putidaredoxin has similarly been shown to contain a carboxylate-based binding surface, and the current results suggest that if the model is correct, then it also interacts at the proposed site, probably utilizing similar p-450cam electrostatic contacts.

TI  == sodium hexametaphosphate sensitizes pseudomonas aeruginosa, several other species of pseudomonas, and escherichia coli to hydrophobic drugs.
AB  == many gram-negative bacteria are known to be remarkably resistant to hydrophobic noxious agents by virtue of their outer membranes (om). we investigated, by using four different assay methods, the ability of sodium hexametaphosphate (hmp) to disrupt this om barrier. (i) in the growth inhibition assay, hmp was found to sensitize strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa to all the hydrophobic probes tested  (rifampin, fusidic acid, dactinomycin, sodium dodecyl sulfate, and triton x-100). a concentration of 0.3% hmp decreased the mics of the probes by a factor of approximately 10, and maximally even a 30-fold sensitization was found with 1% hmp. (ii) in the bactericidal assay, 0.3% hmp decreased the mbc of the hydrophobic probe rifampin by a factor of approximately 30. (iii) in the bacteriolytic assay, 0.1% hmp sensitized the target bacteria to lysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate and triton x-100. (iv) in the fluorescent-probe binding assay, hmp drastically enhanced the binding of fluorescent n-phenyl naphthylamine to the membranes of the target cells. in addition to p. aeruginosa, p. fluorescens, p. putida, p. fragi, and escherichia coli were susceptible to the om permeability-increasing action of hmp, while p. cepacia was resistant.

TI  == cloning, sequencing, and expression of the gene for nadh-sensitive citrate synthase of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == the structural gene for the allosteric citrate synthase of pseudomonas aeruginosa has been cloned from a genomic library by using the escherichia coli citrate synthase gene as a hybridization probe under conditions of reduced stringency. subcloning of portions of the original 10-kilobase-pair (kbp) clone led to isolation of the structural gene, with its promoter, within a 2,083-bp length of  dna flanked by sites for kpni and bamhi. the nucleotide sequence of this fragment is presented; the inferred amino acid sequence was 70 and 76% identical, respectively, with the citrate synthase sequences from e. coli and acinetobacter  anitratum, two other gram-negative bacteria. deae-cellulose chromatography of p.  aeruginosa citrate synthase from an e. coli host harboring the cloned p. aeruginosa gene gave three peaks of activity. all three enzyme peaks had subunit  molecular weights of 48,000; the proteins were identical by immunological criteria and very similar in kinetics of substrate saturation and nadh inhibition. because the cloned gene contained only one open reading frame large enough to encode a polypeptide of such a size, the three peaks must represent different forms of the same protein. a portion of the cloned p. aeruginosa gene was used as a hybridization probe under stringent conditions to identify highly homologous sequences in genomic dna of a second strain classified as p. aeruginosa and isolates of p. putida, p. stutzeri, and p. alcaligenes. when crude extracts of each of these four isolates were mixed with antiserum raised against  purified p. aeruginosa citrate synthase, however, only the p. alcaligenes extract cross-reacted.

TI  == bacterial aromatic ring-cleavage enzymes are classified into two different gene families.
AB  == dioxygenases that catalyze the cleavage of the aromatic ring are classified into  two groups according to their mode of ring fission. substrates of ring-cleavage dioxygenases usually contain hydroxyl groups on adjacent aromatic carbons, and intradiol enzymes cleave the ring between these two hydroxyl groups. extradiol enzymes in contrast cleave the ring between one hydroxylated carbon and its adjacent nonhydroxylated carbon. in this study, we determined the complete nucleotide sequence of nahc, the structural gene for 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase encoded in the nah7 plasmid of pseudomonas putida. this enzyme is an  extradiol ring-cleavage enzyme that cleaves the first ring of 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene. the amino acid sequence of the dioxygenase deduced from the dna sequence demonstrated that the molecular weight of the enzyme is 33,882.  this result was in agreement with those of maxicell analyses that showed that the nahc product was a 36-kda protein. interestingly, the amino acid sequence of 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase was 50% homologous with that of 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase, which catalyzes extradiol cleavage of the first ring of 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl (furukawa, k., arimura, n., and miyazaki, t.  (1987) j. bacteriol. 169, 427-429). the amino acid sequence similarity of 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase with catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, which is an authentic extradiol dioxygenase, was rather low (16%). however, a statistical analysis by the method of s. b. needleman and c. d. wunsch [1970) j. mol. biol. 48, 443-453) clearly showed that these two dioxygenases are evolutionarily related. therefore, these extradiol enzymes are considered as products of the same gene superfamily. from the significant sequence similarity between intradiol enzymes, it has been shown (neidle, e. l., harnett, c., bonitz, s., and ornston,  l. n. (1988) j. bacteriol. 170, 4874-4880) that intradiol enzymes evolved from a  common ancestor. comparison of the amino acid sequence of extradiol enzymes with  those of intradiol dioxygenases did not show any significant global or localized  similarity.

AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the todc1c2bade genes which encode the first three enzymes in the catabolism of toluene by pseudomonas putida f1 was determined. the genes encode the three components of the toluene dioxygenase enzyme system: reductasetol (toda), ferredoxintol (todb), and the two subunits of the terminal dioxygenase (todc1c2); (+)-cis-(1s, 2r)-dihydroxy-3-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene dehydrogenase (todd); and 3-methylcatechol 2,3-dioxygenase (tode). knowledge of the nucleotide sequence of the tod genes was used to construct clones of escherichia coli jm109 that overproduce toluene dioxygenase (jm109(pdt-601]; toluene dioxygenase and (+)-cis-(1s, 2r)-dihydroxy-3-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene dehydrogenase (jm109(pdtg602]; and toluene dioxygenase, (+)-cis-(1s, 2r)-dihydroxy-3-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene dehydrogenase, and 3-methylcatechol 2,3-dioxygenase (jm109(pdtg603]. the overexpression of the tod-c1c2bade gene products was detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the three e. coli jm109 strains harboring the plasmids pdtg601,  pdtg602, and pdtg603, after induction with isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside, oxidized toluene to (+)-cis-(1s, 2r)-dihydroxy-3-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene, 3-methylcatechol, and 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-2,4-heptadienoate, respectively. the tod-c1c2bad genes show significant homology to the reported nucleotide sequence for benzene dioxygenase  and cis-1,2-dihydroxycyclohexa-3,5-diene dehydrogenase from p. putida 136r-3 (irie, s., doi, s., yorifuji, t., takagi, m., and yano, k. (1987) j. bacteriol. 169, 5174-5179). in addition, significant homology was observed between the nucleotide sequences for the todde genes and the sequences reported for cis-1,2-dihydroxy-6-phenylcyclohexa-3,5-diene dehydrogenase and 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl-1,2-dioxygenase from pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes kf707 (furukawa, k., arimura, n., and miyazaki, t.

TI  == a methyl-accepting protein is involved in benzoate taxis in pseudomonas putida.
AB  == pseudomonas putida is attracted to at least two groups of aromatic acids: a benzoate group and a benzoylformate group. members of the benzoate group of chemoattractants stimulated the methylation of a p. putida polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 60,000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. this polypeptide is presumed to be a methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein for several reasons: its molecular weight is similar to the molecular weights of  escherichia coli methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins, the amount of time required to attain maximal methylation correlated with the time needed for behavioral adaptation of p. putida cells to benzoate, and methylation was stimulated by benzoate only in cells induced for chemotaxis to benzoate. also, a  mutant specifically defective in benzoate taxis failed to show any stimulation of methylation upon addition of benzoate. benzoylformate did not stimulate protein methylation in cells induced for benzoylformate chemotaxis, suggesting that sensory input from this second group of aromatic-acid attractants is processed through a different kind of chemosensory pathway. the chemotactic responses of p. putida cells to benzoate and benzoylformate were not sensitive to external ph over a range (6.2 to 7.7) which would vary the protonated forms of these weak acids by a factor of about 30. this indicates that detection of cytoplasmic ph is not the basis for aromatic-acid taxis in p. putida.

TI  == involvement of pseudomonas putida rpon sigma factor in regulation of various metabolic functions.

AB  == the hutc gene in pseudomonas putida encodes a repressor protein that negatively regulates the expression of all hut genes. we have overexpressed this cloned hutc gene in escherichia coli to identify p. putida hut regions that could specifically bind the repressor. ten restriction fragments, some of which were partially overlapping and spanned the coding portions of the p. putida hut region, were labeled and tested for their ability to recognize repressor in a filter binding assay. this procedure identified three binding sites, thus supporting previous indications that there were multiple operons. a 1.0-kilobase-pair sali restriction fragment contained the operator region for the hutuhig operon, whereas a 1.9-kilobase-pair smai fragment contained the hutf operator. a 2.9-kilobase-pair xhoi segment appeared to contain the third operator, corresponding to a separate and perhaps little used control region for  hutg expression only. the addition of urocanate, the normal inducer, caused dissociation of all operator-repressor complexes, whereas n-formylglutamate, capable of specifically inducing expression of the hutg gene, inhibited binding only of repressor to fragments containing that gene. formylglutamate did not affect the action of urocanate on the repressor-hutuhig operator complex, indicating that it binds to a site separate from urocanate on the repressor. dna  footprinting and gel retardation analyses were used to locate more precisely the  operator for the hutuhig operon. a roughly 40-base-pair portion was identified which contained a 16-base-pair region of dyad symmetry located near the transcription initiation site for this operon.

(415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == analysis of nonpolar insertion mutations in the trfa gene of incp plasmid rk2 which affect its broad-host-range property.
AB  == replication of broad-host-range plasmid rk2 requires the protein product(s) of the plasmid-encoded trfa gene to initiate replication at oriv, the vegetative replication origin. the trfa gene contains two translational starts which direct  translation of two polypeptides, of 382 and 285 amino acids, which differ by the  97 amino acids at their n-terminus. nonpolar insertions which abolish expression  of the larger trfa polypeptide but otherwise retain the trfa gene's normal expression signals severely reduce plasmid replication efficiency in pseudomonas  aeruginosa and to a lesser extent in pseudomonas putida, but have very little effect in escherichia coli. this indicates that the organization of the trfa gene, producing two polypeptides products, plays an important part in the broad-host-range of plasmid rk2 by providing a degree of flexibility in the way the plasmid's replication system interacts with host biochemistry.

TI  == cloning of bacterial genes specifying degradation of 4-chlorobiphenyl from pseudomonas putida ou83.
AB  == genes capable of 4-chlorobiphenyl (4-cbp) degradation were cloned from 4-cbp-degrading pseudomonas putida ou83 by using a genomic library which was constructed in the broad-host-range cosmid vector pcp13. p. putida ac812 containing chimeric cosmid-expressing enzymes involved in the 4-cbp degradation pathway were identified by detecting 3-phenylcatechol dioxygenase activity (3-pda). chimeric cosmid clones poh83, poh84, poh85, poh87, and poh88 positive for 3-pda grew in synthetic basal medium containing 4-cbp (5 mm) as a carbon source. restriction digestion analysis of recombinant cosmids showed dna inserts  ranging from 6 to 30 kilobase pairs. southern hybridization data revealed that the cloned dna inserts originated from strain ou83. gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the metabolites of p. putida ac812(poh88) incubated with 4-cbp and 4'-chloro-3-phenylcatechol showed the formation of 4-chlorobenzoic acid and benzoic acid. these results demonstrate that the cloned dna fragments contain genes encoding for chlorobiphenyl dioxygenase (cbpa), dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (cbpb), 4'-chloro-3-phenylcatechol dioxygenase (cbpc), a meta-cleavage compound (a chloro derivative of 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoate) hydrolase (cbpd), and a new dechlorinating activity (dcpe). the location of the cbpc gene specifying 3-pda was determined by subcloning an ecori dna fragment (9.8 kilobase pairs) of poh88 in plasmid vector puc19. the cloned gene encoding 3-pda was expressed in escherichia coli hb101 and had substrate specificity only for 3-phenylcatechol and 4'-chloro-3-phenylcatechol.

TI  == evidence that the transcription activator encoded by the pseudomonas putida nahr  gene is evolutionarily related to the transcription activators encoded by the rhizobium nodd genes.
AB  == the nahr gene of the 83-kilobase naphthalene degradation plasmid nah7 of pseudomonas putida encodes a 34-kilodalton polypeptide which binds to the nah and sal promoters to activate transcription of the degradation genes in response to the inducer salicylate. the dna sequence of the nahr gene was determined, and a derived amino acid sequence of the nahr protein was obtained. a computer search for homologous proteins showed that within the first 124 amino-terminal residues, nahr has approximately 35% identity with the transcriptional activator proteins encoded by the nodd genes of rhizobium species. allowing for ultraconservative amino acid substitutions, greater than 47% overall similarity was found between nahr and nodd, while 32% similarity was found between nahr and another transcription activator, lysr of escherichia coli. the region of greatest similarity among all three proteins contained a probable helix-turn-helix dna-binding motif as suggested by homology with the proposed consensus sequence for cro-like dna-binding domains. the high level of amino acid identity between nahr and nodd, in conjunction with the observations that nahr and nodd are 45% homologous in dna sequence, are divergently transcribed from homologous promoters near the structural genes they control, and have similar dna-binding sites, strongly suggests that these two genes evolved from a common ancestor.

TI  == in vivo enzymology: a deuterium nmr study of formaldehyde dismutase in pseudomonas putida f61a and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == high-resolution deuterium nmr spectroscopy has been used to follow the detoxifying metabolism of [d2]formaldehyde in vivo in several bacterial species.  production of [d2]methanol in escherichia coli confirms that the oxidation and reduction pathways of metabolism are independent in this organism. efficient production of equimolar quantities of [d]formate and [d3]methanol in pseudomonas  putida f61a and staphylococcus aureus implicates a formaldehyde dismutase, or "cannizzarase", activity. these observations imply that the unusual formaldehyde  resistance in p. putida f61a is a direct result of efficient dismutation acting as a route for detoxification. cross-dismutation experiments yield an enzymic kinetic isotope effect of ca. 4 for h vs d transfer and a similar spectrum of substrate specificity to the isolated enzyme. [d]benzyl alcohol produced by cross-dismutation of [d2]formaldehyde and benzaldehyde in p. putida is demonstrated to have the r configuration by a novel deuterium nmr assay. additionally, s. aureus produces methyl formate as a product of formaldehyde detoxification, apparently by oxidizing the methanol hemiacetal of formaldehyde.

TI  == demonstration, characterization, and mutational analysis of nahr protein binding  to nah and sal promoters.
AB  == the nahr gene of plasmid nah7 of pseudomonas putida encodes a 36-kilodalton polypeptide which activates transcription of the nah and sal operons in response  to the inducer salicylate. a gel mobility shift assay was used to identify a dna-binding activity which was present only in extracts from either p. putida or  escherichia coli containing a functional nahr gene. the binding activity was highly specific for dna containing the nah or sal promoters, but the apparent affinity for the promoters was not altered by the presence of salicylate. dnase i protection experiments with a partially purified nahr protein preparation showed  that nahr protects both nah and sal promoter sequences between -82 and -47. the location and amount of protection were not dramatically altered by the presence of salicylate. in vitro mutagenesis was used to make mutations in the protected region of the sal promoter. analysis of the mutants showed that binding of nahr is required for transcription activation and identified two nucleotides in the protected region that are essential for binding and activation by nahr.

TI  == omegon-km: a transposable element designed for in vivo insertional mutagenesis and cloning of genes in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == to combine the features of the omega interposons with the advantages of in vivo transposition mutagenesis, we have constructed an artificial transposon, called omegon-km. the omegon-km transposon is carried on the plasmid pjff350 which can be conjugally mobilized into a broad range of gram-negative bacteria. omegon-km is flanked, in inverted orientation, by synthetic 28-bp repeats derived from the  ends of is1. in addition, each end of omegon-km has the very efficient transcription and translation terminators of the omega interposon. internally, omegon-km carries the selectable kanamycin (km)-neomycin resistance gene (alph a) which is expressed well in many gram-negative bacteria. the is1 transposition functions are located on the donor plasmid but external to omegon-km. thus, insertions of omegon-km are very stable because they lack the capacity for further transposition. omegon-km mutagenesis is performed by conjugal transfer of pjff350 from escherichia coli into any gram-negative recipient strain in which this plasmid is unable to replicate. those cells which have had a transposition event are selected by their resistance to km. very high frequencies of omegon-km  transposition were observed in pseudomonas putida. preliminary experiments with other gram-negative soil and water bacteria (rhizobium leguminosarum, paracoccus  denitrificans) yielded mutants at reasonable levels. the presence of an e. coli-specific origin of replication (ori) within omegon-km allows the rapid and easy cloning, in e. coli, of the nucleotide sequences flanking the site of the transposition event.

AB  == the arrangement of the histidine utilization (hut) genes in pseudomonas putida was established by examining the structure of a dna segment that had been cloned  into escherichia coli via a cosmid vector. southern blot analysis revealed that the restriction patterns of the hut genes cloned into e. coli and present in the  p. putida genome were identical, indicating that no detectable dna rearrangement  took place during the cloning. expression of the hut genes from a series of overlapping clones indicated the gene order to be hutg-huti-huth-hutu-hutc-hutf.  the transcription directions of the different hut genes were determined by cloning the genes under control of the lambda pl promoter. this showed that hutf, encoding formiminoglutamate hydrolase, was transcribed in a direction opposite to that of the other genes. inactivation of the cloned hut genes by tn1000 insertion revealed that the hut genes were divided into three major transcriptional units (hutf, hutc [the repressor gene], and hut uhig), but hutg may also be independently transcribed. when cloned individually with hutc on the same vector, hutf and hutu (which encodes urocanase) expression was induced by urocanate, indicating that these two genes each possess an operator-promoter element. tn1000 insertions (in the cloned genes) or tn5 insertions (in the p. putida genome) affecting the huti or huth gene only partially eliminated hutg expression. furthermore, hutg, which specifies n-formylglutamate amidohydrolase, was regulated by the hutc product when the two genes were cloned on the same vector and expressed in e. coli. therefore, hutg can be expressed independently from its own promoter, in keeping with earlier observations that n-formylglutamate amidohydrolase synthesis is not coordinated with that of urocanase and histidase  and can be induced by n-formylglutamate or urocanate.

TI  == the complete amino acid sequence and identification of the active-site arginine peptide of escherichia coli 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase.
AB  == the complete amino acid sequence of 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase from escherichia coli has been established in the following manner. after being reduced with dithiothreitol, the purified aldolase was alkylated with iodoacetamide and subsequently digested with trypsin. the resulting 19 peptide peaks observed by high performance liquid chromatography, which compared with 21  expected tryptic cleavage products, were all isolated, purified, and individually sequenced. overlap peptides were obtained by a combination of sequencing the n-terminal region of the intact aldolase and by cleaving the intact enzyme with cyanogen bromide followed by subdigestion of the three major cyanogen bromide peptides with either staphylococcus aureus v8 endoproteinase, endoproteinase lys  c, or trypsin after citraconylation of lysine residues. the primary structure of  the molecule was determined to be as follows. (formula; see text) 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase from e. coli consists of 213 amino acids with  a subunit and a trimer molecular weight of 22,286 and 66,858, respectively. no microheterogeneity is observed among the three subunits. the peptide containing the active-site arginine residue (vlahos, c. j., ghalambor, m. a., and dekker, e. e. (1985) j. biol. chem. 260, 5480-5485) was also isolated and sequenced; this arginine residue occupies position 49. the schiff base-forming lysine residue (vlahos, c. j., and dekker, e. e. (1986) j. biol. chem. 261, 11049-11055) is located at position 133. whereas the active-site lysine peptide of this aldolase  shows 65% homology with the same peptide of 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase from pseudomonas putida, these two proteins in toto show 49% homology.

AB  == the maintenance of the plasmid vectors ptg201 and ptg206 (which both carry the pseudomonas putida xyle gene) and pb lambda h3 in escherichia coli hosts was studied in free and immobilized continuous cultures. ptg201, containing the strong lambda pr promoter, was more quickly lost than plasmid ptg206, containing  the tetracycline resistance gene promoter. the instability of ptg201 seems to be  related to high expression of the cloned xyle genet. fluctuations in the proportion of ptg201-containing cells were observed in the free system, suggesting the appearance of adaptive descendants (with and without plasmid) from the initial strains. the loss of plasmid vectors from e. coli cells and the fluctuations in the proportion of plasmid-containing cells could be prevented by  immobilizing plasmid-containing bacteria in carrageenan gel beads.

AB  == in iron-limited environments, the plant-growth-stimulating pseudomonas putida wcs358 produces a yellow-green fluorescent siderophore called pseudobactin 358. the transcriptional organization and the iron-regulated expression of a major gene cluster involved in the biosynthesis and transport of pseudobactin 358 were  analyzed in detail. the cluster comprises a region with a minimum length of 33.5  kilobases and contains at least five transcriptional units, of which some are relatively large. the directions of transcription of four transcriptional units were determined by rna-rna hybridization and by analysis in escherichia coli minicells. the latter also demonstrated that large polypeptides were encoded by these transcriptional units. the results allowed us to localize several promoter  regions on the dna. the iron-dependent expression of at least two genes within this cluster appears to be regulated at the transcriptional level.

TI  == cloning, dna sequence analysis, and expression in escherichia coli of the gene for mandelate racemase from pseudomonas putida.
AB  == the gene for mandelate racemase (ec 5.1.2.2) from pseudomonas putida (atcc 12633) was cloned in pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 15692). the selection for the cloned gene was based upon the inability of p. aeruginosa to grow on (r)-mandelate as sole carbon source by virtue of the absence of mandelate racemase in its mandelate pathway. fragments of p. putida dna obtained by digestion of chromosomal dna with sau3a were ligated into the bamhi site of the gram-negative  vector pkt230 and transformed into the p. aeruginosa host. a transformant able to utilize (r)-mandelate as sole carbon source was characterized, and the plasmid was found to contain approximately five kilobase pairs of p. putida dna. subcloning of this dna revealed the position of the gene for the racemase within  the cloned dna from p. putida. the dideoxy-dna sequencing procedure was used to determine the sequence of the gene and its translated sequence. the amino acid sequence and molecular weight for mandelate racemase deduced from the gene sequence (38 570) are in excellent agreement with amino acid composition and molecular weight data for the polypeptide recently determined with enzyme isolated from p. putida; these recent determinations of the polypeptide molecular weight differ significantly from the originally reported value of 69,500 [fee, judith a., hegeman, g.d., & kenyon, g.l. (1974) biochemistry 13,2528], which was  used to demonstrate that alpha-phenylglycidate, an active site directed irreversible inhibitor, binds to the enzyme with a stoichiometry of 1:1.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == controlled and functional expression of the pseudomonas oleovorans alkane utilizing system in pseudomonas putida and escherichia coli.
AB  == the oct plasmid encodes enzymes for alkane hydroxylation and alkanol dehydrogenation. structural components are encoded on the 7.5-kilobase pair alkbac operon, whereas positive regulatory components are encoded by alkr. we have constructed plasmids containing fusions of cloned alkbac and alkr dna and used these fusion plasmids to study the functional expression of the alkbac operon and the regulatory locus alkr in pseudomonas putida and in escherichia coli. growth on alkanes requires a functional chromosomally encoded fatty acid degradation system in addition to the plasmid-borne alk system. while such a system is active in p. putida, it is active in e. coli only in fadr mutants in which fatty acid degradation enzymes are expressed constitutively. using such mutants, we found that e. coli as well as p. putida grew on octane as the sole source of carbon and energy when they were supplied with the cloned complete alk  system. the alkr locus was strictly necessary in e. coli as well as in p. putida  for expression of the alkbac operon. the alkbac operon could, however, be further reduced to a 5-kilobase pair operon without affecting the alk phenotype in either species to a significant extent. although with this reduction the plasmid-encoded alkanol dehydrogenase activity was lost, chromosomally encoded alkanol dehydrogenases in p. putida and e. coli compensated for this loss. the induction  kinetics of the alk system was studied in detail in p. putida and e. coli. we used specific antibodies raised against alkane hydroxylase to follow the appearance of this protein following induction with octane. we found the induction kinetics of alkane hydroxylase to be similar in both species. a steady-state level was reached after about 2 h of induction in which time the alkane hydroxylase accounted for about 1.5% of total newly synthesized protein. thus, alkbac expression is very efficient and strictly regulated to both p. putida and e. coli.

TI  == purification and properties of formylglutamate amidohydrolase from pseudomonas putida.
AB  == formylglutamate amidohydrolase (fgase) catalyzes the terminal reaction in the five-step pathway for histidine utilization in pseudomonas putida. by this action, n-formyl-l-glutamate (fg) is hydrolyzed to produce l-glutamate plus formate. urocanate, the first product in the pathway, induced all five enzymes, but fg was able to induce fgase alone, although less efficiently than urocanate did. this induction by fg resulted in the formation of an fgase with electrophoretic mobility identical to that of the fgase induced by urocanate. a 9.6-kilobase-pair hindiii dna fragment containing the p. putida fgase gene was cloned into the corresponding site on plasmid pbeu1 maintained in escherichia coli. insertion of the fragment in either orientation on the vector resulted in expression, but a higher level was noted in one direction, suggesting that the fgase gene can be expressed from either of two vector promoters with different efficiencies or from a single vector promoter in addition to a less efficient pseudomonas promoter. fgase was purified 1,110-fold from the higher-expression clone in a yield of 10% through six steps. divalent metal ions stimulated activity, and among those tested (co, fe, zn, ca, ni, cd, mn, and mg), co(ii) was the best activator, followed by fe(ii). fgase exhibited a km of 14 mm for fg and  a specific activity of 100 mumol/min per mg of protein in the presence of 5 mm substrate and 0.8 mm cocl2 at 30 degrees c. the enzyme was maximally active in the range of ph 7 to 8. fgase was found to be a monomer of molecular weight 50,000. n-acetyl-l-glutamate was not a substrate for the enzyme, but both it and  n-formyl-l-aspartate were competitive inhibitors of formylglutamate hydrolysis, exhibiting ki values of 6 and 9 mm, respectively. the absence of fgase activity as an integral part of histidine breakdown in most other organisms and the somewhat uncoordinated regulation of fgase synthesis with that of the other hut enzymes in pseudomonas suggest that the gene encoding its synthesis may have evolved separately from the remaining hut genes.

AB  == the effect of high-level expression of the regulatory gene xyls of the pseudomonas putida tol plasmid on the activation of the xyldlegf operon was investigated in escherichia coli. the xyls gene was placed downstream from the tac promoter, and the resultant fusion was cloned in cis to the xyldlegf operon.  the expression of the operon was monitored by the level of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, whose structural gene xyle was placed directly after the operator-promoter region of xyldlegf. xyls transcription was also determined by reverse transcriptase mapping of mrna. overproduction of the xyls gene product elicited constitutive high expression of the xyldlegf operon even in the absence  of the inducer for the operon. the results were consistent with a cascade model for the positive control of the xyldlegf operon by the xylr and xyls genes (s. inouye, a. nakazawa, and t. nakazawa, proc. natl. acad. sci. usa, in press): m-xylene, a substrate of the degradative pathway, binds to the xylr gene product; the m-xylene-xylr product complex activates the xyls gene; and the xyls product thus synthesized de novo activates the xyldlegf operon.

TI  == expression of the regulatory gene xyls on the tol plasmid is positively controlled by the xylr gene product.
AB  == the regulatory gene xyls on the tol plasmid of pseudomonas putida activates the transcription of the xyldlegf operon for the m-toluate-degrading pathway in the presence of m-toluate. the gene also activates the transcription of the same operon in the presence of m-xylene or m-methylbenzyl alcohol, but for this activation another regulatory gene, xylr, is required. in this study we examined  the xyls expression by determining the mrna by reverse transcriptase mapping and  by monitoring the enzyme activity of the xyle gene product, which was expressed under the control of the xyls promoter. the results of the above experiments provide evidence that xylr positively controls the transcription of xyls in the presence of m-xylene or m-methylbenzyl alcohol. the xyls product thus amplified may in turn activate the xyldlegf operon. the nucleotide sequence of the xyls promoter resembles that of the promoter of the xylcab operon for the m-xylene-degrading pathway, which is also activated by xylr in the presence of m-xylene or m-methylbenzyl alcohol. in addition, we have demonstrated that the expression of xylr is negatively controlled by its own product. on the basis of these findings, we propose a revised model for the regulation of expression of xyl genes on the tol plasmid.

TI  == genetic analysis of mannityl opine catabolism in octopine-type agrobacterium tumefaciens strain 15955.
AB  == the genetic organization of functions responsible for mannityl opine catabolism of the ti plasmid of agrobacterium tumefaciens strain 1,5955 was investigated. a  partial hindiii digest of pti1,5955 was cloned into a broad host range cosmid and the clones obtained were tested for ability to confer mannityl opine degradation  upon agrobacterium. inserts containing genes for catabolism of mannopinic acid, mannopine, agropine, and agropinic acid were obtained, spanning a segment of 43 kb on the ti plasmid. two clones conferring upon agrobacterium the ability to catabolize the mannityl opines were mobilized to several rhizobium sp., to pseudomonas putida and p. fluorescens and to escherichia coli. the catabolic functions were phenotypically expressed in all rhizobium sp. tested, and in p. fluorescens, but not in p. putida or in e. coli.

TI  == structure of the pseudomonas putida alkbac operon. identification of transcription and translation products.
AB  == the structural genes of the pseudomonas oleovorans alk (alkane utilization) system, which are localized on the alkbac operon, were cloned as a 16.9-kilobase  pair ecori fragment. we have measured the length and determined the position of the alkbac operon on this fragment by electron microscopy of r-loops. furthermore, the 7.3-kilobase pair long alkbac operon was analyzed for translation products in escherichia coli minicells. using a spectrum of overlapping subclones, six different proteins were identified. starting from the  alkbac promotor, these polypeptides had molecular masses of 41, 15, 49, 58, 59, and 20 kda, respectively. the 41-kda protein was identified as alkane hydroxylase by reaction with a specific antibody. the 15- and 49-kda peptides are soluble components of the alkane hydroxylase complex. the 58-kda protein is most likely involved in alkanol dehydrogenase activity.

TI  == the xyls gene positive regulator of tol plasmid pwwo: identification, sequence analysis and overproduction leading to constitutive expression of meta cleavage operon.
AB  == the pseudomonas putida tol plasmid pwwo carries an operon that specifies a meta-cleavage pathway for the catabolism of benzoate and toluates whose transcription is positively regulated by the xyls gene product. stimulation of transcription of the operon is thought to result from activation of this protein  by pathway substrates/effectors. in the present study, overexpression of the xyls gene has led to identification of the regulator as a 33 kda protein. overexpression of xyls also resulted in partially constitutive, i.e. effector-independent expression of the meta-cleavage operon. determination of the polynucleotide sequence of the xyls gene revealed amino acid sequence homology with several dna binding proteins, particularly with the arac products of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium and with the nifa and ntrc products of klebsiella pneumoniae. homologous sequences were mainly located in an alpha-helix-turn-alpha-helix domain of the polypeptide. interestingly, amino acid sequence homology was also found with sigma factors of e. coli (ntra and htpr products) and bacillus subtilis (spoiig and phage spoi gp34 products) and other rna polymerase core-interacting proteins, such as the e. coli nusa product.

TI  == molecular analysis of regulatory and structural xyl genes of the tol plasmid pww53-4.
AB  == pww53-4 is a cointegrate between rp4 and the catabolic plasmid pww53 from pseudomonas putida mt53, which contains 36 kbp of pww53 dna inserted close to the oriv gene of rp4; it encodes the ability to grow on toluene and the xylenes, characteristic of pww53, as well as resistance to tetracycline, kanamycin and carbenicillin, characteristic of rp4. a physical map of the 36 kbp insert of pww53 dna for 11 restriction enzymes is presented, showing that the relative positions of the two xyl operons are different from those on the archetypal tol plasmid pww0. the location of the genes for 4-oxalocrotonate decarboxylase (xyli) and 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (xylh) were shown by subcloning and enzyme assay to lie at the distal end of the meta pathway operon. although 2-oxopent-4-enoate  hydratase (xylj) and 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase (xylk) could be detected on a large cloned hindiii fragment, they could not be accurately located on smaller  subcloned dna, but the only credible position for them is between xylf and xyli.  the gene order in the meta pathway operon is therefore xyldlegf(j,k)ih. the regulatory genes xyls and xylr were located close to and downstream of the meta pathway operon, and the restriction map of the dna in this region, as has previously been shown for the two operons carrying the structural genes, shows similarities with the corresponding region on pww0. evidence is also presented for the existence of two promoters, termed p3 and p4, internal to the meta pathway operon which support low constitutive expression of the structural genes  downstream in pseudomonas hosts but not in e. coli.

TI  == maintenance and stability of introduced genotypes in groundwater aquifer material.
AB  == three indigenous groundwater bacterial strains and pseudomonas putida harboring plasmids tol (pwwo) and rk2 were introduced into experimentally contaminated groundwater aquifer microcosms. maintenance of the introduced genotypes was measured over time by colony hybridization with gene probes of various specificity. on the basis of the results of colony hybridization quantitation of  the introduced organisms and genes, all introduced genotypes were stably maintained at approximately 10(5) positive hybrid colonies g-1 of aquifer microcosm material throughout an 8-week incubation period. concomitant removal of the environmental contaminants, viz., toluene, chlorobenzene, and styrene, in both natural (uninoculated) and inoculated aquifer microcosms was also demonstrated. the results indicate that introduced catabolic plasmids, as well as indigenous organisms, can be stably maintained in groundwater aquifer material without specific selective pressure for the introduced genotypes. these results have positive implications for in situ treatment and biodegradation in contaminated aerobic groundwater aquifers.

TI  == analysis of transcription from the trfa promoter of broad host range plasmid rk2  in escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == reverse transcriptase mapping has been used to analyze transcription from the trfa promoter of broad host range plasmid rk2. the results show that trfa operon  mrna has the same 5' end in pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, and escherichia coli. the strengths of wild-type and mutant trfa promoters, which differ by defined base substitutions, have been compared and the positions of their transcriptional start sites determined. while these base substitutions do not alter the transcriptional start site, they do have marked effects on promoter strength which are broadly similar in each of the host species. a single base pair substitution, which lies in the region corresponding to the e. coli promoter consensus, brings about a large reduction in gene expression while the introduction of a second mutation, at a locus outside this region, has no further effect on promoter strength. the results indicate that these pseudomonas species  possess an rna polymerase which recognizes the same region of the trfa promoter as that utilized by e. coli rna polymerase. within the limits of these observations it is clear that the trfa operon is transcribed from a single promoter which can function efficiently in diverse species, a property which may  be important for its broad host range.

TI  == effect of a broad-host range plasmid on growth dynamics of escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida.
AB  == host-plasmid interactions were studied for the broad-host range plasmid, ptjs26,  a derivative of rk2. to isolate host and plasmid contributions to the growth dynamics and plasmid stability, separate experiments were performed with host and recombinant cells for two different gram-negative hosts, pseudomonas putida and escherichia coli, at two different temperatures, 30 and 37 degrees c. at the lower temperature (30 degrees c) the growth kinetics were not affected by the plasmid, but plasmid instability was observed. at the higher temperature (37 degrees c) growth rates and yields were lower than that for the hosts, but the plasmid was stable. this behavior can be explained by a combination of two phenomena. first, the copy number control mechanism may be temperature sensitive  and, second, plasmid segregation may be inefficient. for both e. coli and p. putida the growth dynamics of the recombinant system was dictated by the presence of the plasmid.

TI  == survival of selected bacterial species in sterilized activated carbon filters and biological activated carbon filters.
AB  == the survival of selected hygienically relevant bacterial species in activated carbon (ac) filters on a bench scale was investigated. the results revealed that  after inoculation of the test strains the previously sterilized ac absorbed all bacteria (10(6) to 10(7)). after a period of 6 to 13 days without countable bacteria in the effluent, the numbers of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and pseudomonas putida increased up to 10(4) to 10(5) cfu/ml of effluent and 10(6) to 10(7) cfu/g of ac. when klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis were used, no growth in filters could be observed. the numbers of e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and p. putida, however, decreased immediately  and showed no regrowth in nonsterile ac from a filter which had been continuously connected to running tap water for 2 months. under these conditions an autochthonous microflora developed on the carbon surface which could be demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy and culturing methods (heterotrophic plate count). these bacteria reduced e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and p. putida densities in the effluent by a factor of more than 10(5) within 1 to 5 days. the  hypothesis that antagonistic substances of the autochthonous microflora were responsible for the elimination of the artificial contamination could not be confirmed because less than 1% of the isolates of the autochthonous microflora were able to produce such substances as indicated by in vitro tests. competition  for limiting nutrients was thought to be the reason for the observed effects.

TI  == molecular cloning of genes encoding branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase of pseudomonas putida.
AB  == we cloned the structural genes for the individual subunits of the branched-chain  keto acid dehydrogenase multienzyme complex on a 7.8-kilobase ecori-ssti restriction fragment of pseudomonas putida chromosomal dna by cloning into the broad-host-range vector pkt230. a direct selection system for growth on valine-isoleucine agar was achieved by complementation of p. putida branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase mutants. the recombinant plasmid, pss1-1,  increased expression of branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase up to five times in wild-type p. putida. the complex was expressed constitutively in p. putida(pss1-1) but was inducible in escherichia coli hb101(pss1-1) by high valine. e. coli minicells transformed with pss1-1 produced three polypeptides which did not match the four polypeptides of the purified complex. to resolve this problem, we inserted p. putida dna from pss1-1 into puc18 and puc19. the puc-derived plasmids were used as dna templates in an e. coli transcription-translation system. four polypeptides were produced from the puc18-derived plasmid which had the correct molecular weights, showing that the structural genes had been cloned. since only weak bands were produced with the puc19-derived plasmid, the direction of transcription was established. the locations and order of all the structural genes of branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase were located by restriction enzyme mapping.

TI  == gene organization of the first catabolic operon of tol plasmid pww53: production  of indigo by the xyla gene product.
AB  == the entire operon coding for the enzymes responsible for conversion of toluenes to benzoates has been cloned from tol plasmid pww53 and the position of the genes accurately located. the coding region was 7.4 kilobase pairs (kbp) long, and the  gene order was operator-promoter region (op1)-a small open reading frame-xylc (1.6 kbp)-xyla (2.9 kbp)-xylb (1.8 kbp). within the coding region there was considerable homology with the isofunctional region of the archetypal tol plasmid pww0. a central region of 2.9 kbp complemented an xyla (for xylene oxygenase) mutant of pseudomonas putida mt-2 and was also capable of conferring the ability  to convert indole to indigo on strains of escherichia coli and p. putida. this reaction has been reported previously only for dioxygenases involved in aromatic  catabolism but not for monooxygenases. it is proposed that the region encodes xylene oxygenase activity capable of direct monohydroxylation of indole to 3-hydroxyindole (oxindole), which then spontaneously dimerizes to form indigo.

TI  == interposon mutagenesis of soil and water bacteria: a family of dna fragments designed for in vitro insertional mutagenesis of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == we have constructed a series of derivatives of the omega interposon [prentki and  krisch, gene 29 (1984) 303-313] that can be used for in vitro insertional mutagenesis. each of these dna fragments carries a different antibiotic or hg2+ resistance gene (apr, cmr, tcr, kmr or hgr) which is flanked, in inverted orientation, by transcription and translation termination signals and by synthetic polylinkers. the dna of these interposons can be easily purified and then inserted, by in vitro ligation, into a plasmid linearized either at random by dnase i or at specific sites by restriction enzymes. plasmid molecules which contain an interposon insertion can be identified by expression of its drug resistance. the position of the interposon can be precisely mapped by the restriction sites in the flanking polylinker. to verify their properties we have  used these omega derivatives to mutagenize a broad host range plasmid which contains the entire meta-cleavage pathway of the toluene degradation plasmid pww0 of pseudomonas putida. insertion of these interposons in the plasmid between the  promoter and the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (c23o) gene dramatically reduced the expression of this enzyme in escherichia coli. we also show that when a plasmid containing an omega interposon is transferred by conjugal mobilization from e. coli to p. putida, agrobacterium tumefaciens, erwinia chrysanthemi, paracoccus denitrificans or rhizobium leguminosarum, the appropriate interposon drug resistance is usually expressed and, compared to the non-mutated plasmid, much reduced levels of c23o activity are detected. thus, the selection and/or characterization of omega insertional mutations can be carried out in these bacterial species.

TI  == characterization of a plasmid-specified pathway for catabolism of isopropylbenzene in pseudomonas putida re204.
AB  == a pseudomonas putida strain designated re204, able to utilize isopropylbenzene as the sole carbon and energy source, was isolated. tn5 transposon mutagenesis by means of the suicide transposon donor plasmid plg221 yielded mutant derivatives defective in isopropylbenzene metabolism. these were characterized by the identification of the products which they accumulated when grown in the presence  of isopropylbenzene and by the assay of enzyme activities in cell extracts. based on the results obtained, the following metabolic pathway is proposed: isopropylbenzene----2,3-dihydro -2,3-dihydroxyisopropylbenzene----3-isopropylcatechol----2 -hydroxy-6-oxo-7-methylocta-2,4-dienoate----isobutyrate + 2-oxopent-4-enoate----amphibolic intermediates. plasmid dna was isolated from strain re204 and mutant derivatives and characterized by restriction enzyme cleavage analysis. isopropylbenzene-negative isolates carried a tn5 insert within a 15-kilobase region of a 105-kilobase plasmid designated pre4. dna fragments of  pre4 carrying genes encoding isopropylbenzene catabolic enzymes were cloned in escherichia coli with various plasmid vectors; clones were identified by (i) selection for tn5-encoded kanamycin resistance in the case of tn5 mutant plasmids, (ii) screening for isopropylbenzene dioxygenase-catalyzed oxidation of  indole to indigo, and (iii) use of a tn5-carrying restriction fragment, derived from a pre4::tn5 mutant plasmid, as a probe for clones carrying wild-type restriction fragments. these clones were subsequently used to generate a transposon insertion and restriction enzyme cleavage map of the isopropylbenzene  metabolic region of pre4.

TI  == amino acid sequence of the pyruvate and the glyoxylate active-site lysine peptide of escherichia coli 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase.
AB  == pure 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase of escherichia coli, a "lysine-type" trimeric enzyme which has the unique properties of forming an "abortive" schiff-base intermediate with glyoxylate (the aldehydic product/substrate) and of showing strong beta-decarboxylase activity toward oxalacetate, binds any one of its substrates (2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate, pyruvate, or glyoxylate) in a competitive manner. to determine whether the substrates bind at the same or different (juxta-positioned) sites and what degree of homology might exist between the active-site lysine peptide of this enzyme and that of other lysine-type (class i) aldolases or beta-decarboxylases, the azomethine formed separately by this aldolase with either [14c]pyruvate or [14c]glyoxylate was reduced with cnbh3-. after each enzyme adduct was digested with trypsin, the 14c-labeled peptide was isolated, purified, and subjected to amino acid analysis  and sequence determination. in each case, the same 14-amino acid lysine-peptide was isolated and found to have the following primary sequence: glu-phe-*lys-phe-phe-pro-ala-glu-ala-asn-gly-gly-val-lys (where * = the active-site lysine). hence, glyoxylate competes for, and inhibits aldolase activity by reacting with, the one active-site lysine residue/subunit. this active-site lysine peptide has a high degree (65%) of homology with that of 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase of pseudomonas putida but is not similar to that of any class i fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase or of acetoacetate beta-decarboxylase of clostridium acetobutylicum. furthermore, it was found that extensive reaction of glyoxylate with the n-terminal amino group of this enzyme may well be general complicating factor in sequence studies with proteins plus glyoxylate.

AB  == a range of tn1723 transposon mutants of the oriv region of broad-host-range plasmid rk2 have been isolated, and the internal ecori fragment of the transposon has been deleted from each to reduce the insertion size from 9.6 kb (tn1723) to 35 bp (delta tn1723). sequencing from the delta tn1723-derived ecori site has allowed the precise mapping of these insertions to various points dispersed through the origin region. using these mutants we have determined which regions of oriv rk2 are of functional importance to plasmid establishment following transformation of the host species escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, and p. aeruginosa. insertions into an a/t-rich region, and a region containing five direct repeat sequences prevented successful transformation of each host species  tested, but the continuity of sequences adjacent to the five repeats were essential only in e. coli and p. putida. the establishment and maintenance in e.  coli of a mini-rk2 replicon was found to be inhibited by transcription from an inducible promoter positioned to read into oriv rk2 against the direction of replication. assays of transcription emerging from tn1723 demonstrated significant levels from one end of the transposon only. four mutants with insertions downstream of oriv rk2 were unable to become established in e. coli, and contained tn1723 in the orientation which would supply transcription toward the oriv rk2 region. these results demonstrate both that the sequence requirements for oriv rk2 function differ between host bacterial species, and that origin function may be further influenced by the genetic environment in which it lies.

TI  == resolution of branched-chain oxo acid dehydrogenase complex of pseudomonas aeruginosa pao.
AB  == branched-chain oxo acid dehydrogenase was purified from pseudomonas aeruginosa strain pao with the objective of resolving the complex into its subunits. the purified complex consisted of four proteins, of mr 36,000, 42,000, 49,000 and 50,000. the complex was resolved by heat treatment into the 49,000 and 50,000-mr  proteins, which were separated by chromatography on deae-sepharose. the 49,000-mr protein was identified as the e2 subunit by its ability to catalyse transacylation with a variety of substrates, with dihydrolipoamide as the acceptor. p. aeruginosa, like p. putida, produces two lipoamide dehydrogenases. one, the 50,000-mr protein, was identified as the specific e3 subunit of branched-chain oxo acid dehydrogenase and had many properties in common with the  lipoamide dehydrogenase lpd-val of p. putida. the second lipoamide dehydrogenase  had mr 54,000 and corresponded to the lipoamide dehydrogenase lpd-glc of p. putida. fragments of c-terminal cnbr peptides of lpd-val from p. putida and p. aeruginosa corresponded closely, with only two amino acid differences over 31 amino acids. a corresponding fragment at the c-terminal end of lipoamide dehydrogenase from escherichia coli also showed extensive homology. all three peptides had a common segment of eight amino acids, with the sequence tihahptl. this homology was not evident in any other flavoproteins in the dayhoff data base which suggests that this sequence might be characteristic of lipoamide dehydrogenase.

AB  == this report describes the isolation and preliminary characterization of a 5.0-kilobase-pair (kbp) ecori dna restriction fragment carrying the catbcde genes from acinetobacter calcoaceticus. the respective genes encode enzymes that catalyze four consecutive reactions in the catechol branch of the beta-ketoadipate pathway: catb, muconate lactonizing enzyme (ec 5.5.1.1); catc, muconolactone isomerase (ec 5.3.3.4); catd, beta-ketoadipate enol-lactone hydrolase (ec 3.1.1.24); and cate, beta-ketoadipate succinyl-coenzyme a transferase (ec 2.8.3.6). in a. calcoaceticus, pcade genes encode products with the same enzyme activities as those encoded by the respective catde genes. in pseudomonas putida, the requirements for both catde and pcade genes are met by a  single set of genes, designated pcade. a p. putida mutant with a dysfunctional pcae gene was used to select a recombinant pkt230 plasmid carrying the 5.0-kbp ecori restriction fragment containing the a. calcoaceticus cate structural gene.  the recombinant plasmid, pan1, complemented p. putida mutants with lesions in catb, catc, pcad, and pcae genes; the complemented activities were expressed constitutively in the recombinant p. putida strains. after introduction into escherichia coli, the pan1 plasmid expressed the activities constitutively but at much lower levels that those found in the p. putida transformants or in fully induced cultures of a. calcoaceticus or p. putida. when placed under the control  of a lac promoter on a recombinant puc13 plasmid in e. coli, the a. calcoaceticus restriction fragment expressed catbcde activities at levels severalfold higher than those found in fully induced cultures of a. calcoaceticus. thus there is no  translational barrier to expression of the a. calcoaceticus genes at high levels  in e. coli. the genetic origin of the cloned catbcde genes was demonstrated by the fact that the 5.0-kbp ecori restriction fragment hybridized with a corresponding fragment from wild-type a. calcoaceticus dna. this fragment was missing in dna from an a. calcoaceticus mutant in which the cat genes had been removed by deletion. the properties of the cloned fragment demonstrate physical linkage of the catbcde genes and suggest that they are coordinately transcribed.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of the pseudomonas putida cytochrome p-450cam gene and its expression in escherichia coli.
AB  == cytochrome p-450cam catalyzes the stereospecific methylene hydroxylation of camphor to form 5-exohydroxycamphor and is encoded by the camc gene on the cam plasmid of pseudomonas putida, atcc 17453. the cytochrome p-450cam structural gene has been cloned by mutant complementation in p. putida (koga, h., rauchfuss, b., and gunsalus, i. c. (1985) biochem. biophys. res. commun. 130, 412-417). we report the complete nucleotide sequence of the camc gene along with 155 base pairs of 5' and 175 base pairs of 3' flanking sequence. upon comparison of the amino acid sequence derived from the gene sequence to the one obtained from the purified protein (haniu, m., armes, l. g., yasunobu, k. t., shastry, b. a., and gunsalus, i. c. (1982) j. biol. chem. 257, 12664-12671), five differences were found. the most significant was the addition of a trp and a thr residue between val-54 and arg-55, thereby increasing the amino acid numbering scheme by 2 after  val-54, bringing the total number of amino acids to 414. other differences were:  gln-274----glu-276, ser-359----his-361, and asn-405----asp-407. n-terminal amino  acid sequence analysis of the cloned cytochrome p-450cam enzyme expressed in escherichia coli under the lac promoter showed a faithful translation of the hemo-protein, with the n-terminal met removed by processing as found in p. putida. purification to homogeneity of the cloned protein was accomplished by the method used for the cam plasmid-encoded enzyme of p. putida. the g + c content of the camc gene was found to be 59.0%, caused by a preferred usage of g and c terminated codons. the gene encoding putidaredoxin reductase, cama, was located 22 nucleotides downstream from the cytochrome p-450cam gene. the cama gene initiated with a novel gug codon, the first such initiator documented in pseudomonas.

AB  == clones of escherichia coli (a4, a70, g60) and pseudomonas putida (a70, g30) with  an elevated resistance to the process of immobilization in polyacrylamide gel and to the action of monomeric acrylamide were selected from the parent e. coli ibpm  b115 and p. putida. the isolated cultures remained resistant to the above actions for a long time. the frequency at which cells with the elevated resistance appeared was comparable with the frequency of bacterial mutations. the plasmid analysis did not reveal the presence of plasmid dna in the cells of the isolated  cultures. the decrease in the viability index of bacterial populations caused by  their immobilization in polyacrylamide gel and by the action of monomeric acrylamide did depend on the growth phase. the cells were more resistant to these actions in the stationary phase. the isolated cultures were more resistant as compared to the parent cultures irrespective of the growth phase.

TI  == nucleotide sequence analysis of the phosphomannose isomerase gene (pmi) of pseudomonas aeruginosa and comparison with the corresponding escherichia coli gene mana.
AB  == phosphomannose isomerase (pmi) has been proposed to catalyze the first step of the alginic acid biosynthetic pathway in pseudomonas aeruginosa. the nucleotide sequence of the p. aeruginosa pmi gene contained on a 2.0-kb bamhi-ssti dna fragment has been determined. the gene was defined by the start and stop codons and by in vitro disruption of an open reading frame of 1440 bp corresponding to a polypeptide product with a predicted mr of 52 860. this polypeptide displayed an  apparent mr of approx. 56 000 upon electrophoresis of a maxicell extract on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. the codon utilization of the pmi gene was distinct in the wobble base preference and influenced by the high g + c content (66 mol%) of the p. aeruginosa dna. computer assisted matching analysis failed to demonstrate any significant homology at the nucleotide level between the p. aeruginosa pmi and escherichia coli mana (pmi) genes. however, sequences homologous to the p. aeruginosa pmi gene were found in other pseudomonas species, such as p. putida and p. mendocina, and in azotobacter vinelandii, all capable of producing alginic acid.

TI  == homology between nucleotide sequences of promoter regions of nah and sal operons  of nah7 plasmid of pseudomonas putida.
AB  == the in vivo transcription start sites of the nah and sal operons of the nah7 plasmid were determined by s1 nuclease mapping and the nucleotide sequence surrounding these transcription start sites was determined. since expression of both of these operons is coordinately controlled by the product of the transcriptional activator gene nahr, the sequences were compared to locate potential sites involved in common regulation. in the 100-base-pair region preceding transcription start sites of both operons, three regions of extensive homology were found and may be involved in nahr-mediated transcriptional control: between -80 and -60 with 81% homology; between -40 and -28 with 75% homology; between -1 and +15 with 70% homology. comparison of the promoter sequences of nah and sal with the analogous sequences of the xylabc and xyldefg operons of the tol plasmid showed little homology between the 5' regions of these two sets of positively regulated hydrocarbon degradation operons. in addition, the transcription start site of the nahr regulatory gene was located and its promoter sequence was determined. the nahr promoter overlapped at the -35 position of the  sal promoter; however, the nahr gene is transcribed in the opposite direction. sequences similar to the consensus sequences of escherichia coli promoters (at -35 and -10) were found in nah, sal, and nahr at the appropriate positions.

TI  == evolutionary conservation of genes coding for meta pathway enzymes within tol plasmids pww0 and pww53.
AB  == pseudomonas putida mt53 contains a tol plasmid, pww53, that encodes toluene-xylene catabolism. pww53 is nonconjugative, is about 105 to 110 kilobase  pairs (kbp) in size, and differs significantly in its restriction endonuclease digestion pattern and incompatibility group from the archetypal tol plasmid pww0. an rp4::pww53 cointegrate plasmid, pww53-4, containing about 35 kbp of pww53 dna, including the entire catabolic pathway genes, was formed, and a restriction map for kpni, hindiii, and bamhi was derived. the entire regulated meta pathway genes for the catabolism of m-toluate were cloned into pkt230 from pww53 on a 17.5-kbp  hindiii fragment. the recombinant plasmid supported growth on m-toluate when mobilized into plasmid-free p. putida paw130. a restriction map of the insert for 10 restriction enzymes was derived, and the locations of xyld, xyll, xyle, xylg,  and xylf were determined by subcloning and assaying for their gene products in both escherichia coli and p. putida hosts. good induction of the enzymes by m-toluate and m-methylbenzyl alcohol but not by m-xylene was measured in p. putida, but little or no regulation was found in e. coli. the restriction map and the gene order showed strong similarities with published maps of the dna encoding both the entire meta pathway operon (xyldlegfjih) and the regulatory genes xyls and xylr on the archetype tol plasmid pww0, suggesting a high degree of conservation in dna structure for the catabolic operon on the two different plasmids.

TI  == isolation and analysis of genes involved in siderophore biosynthesis in plant-growth-stimulating pseudomonas putida wcs358.
AB  == the plant-growth-stimulating pseudomonas putida wcs358 was mutagenized with transposon tn5. the resulting mutant colony bank was screened for mutants defective in the biosynthesis of the fluorescent siderophore. a total of 28 mutants, divided into six different classes, were isolated that were nonfluorescent or defective in iron acquisition or both. these different types of mutants together with the probable overall structure of the siderophore, i.e., a  small peptide chain attached to a fluorescing group, suggest a biosynthetic pathway in which the synthesis of the fluorescing group is preceded by the synthesis of the peptide part. a gene colony bank of p. putida wcs358 was constructed with the broad-host-range cosmid vector plafr1. this genomic library, established in escherichia coli, was mobilized into the 28 individual mutants, screening for transconjugants restored in fluorescence or growth under iron-limiting conditions or both. a total of 13 cosmids were found to complement  13 distinct mutants. the complementation analysis revealed that at least five gene clusters, with a minimum of seven genes, are needed for siderophore biosynthesis. some of these genes seem to be arranged in an operon-like structure.

TI  == regions of broad-host-range plasmid rk2 involved in replication and stable maintenance in nine species of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the replication and maintenance properties of the broad-host-range plasmid rk2 and its derivatives were examined in nine gram-negative bacterial species. two regions of rk2, the origin of replication (oriv) and a segment that encodes for a replication protein (trfa delta kild, designated trfa*), are sufficient for replication in all nine species tested. however, stable maintenance of this minimal replicon (less than 0.3% loss per generation under nonselection conditions) is observed only in escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, and azotobacter vinelandii. maintenance of this minimal replicon is unstable in rhizobium meliloti, agrobacterium tumefaciens, caulobacter crescentus, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides. a maintenance function has been localized to a 3.1-kilobase (kb) region of rk2 encoding three previously described functions: kora (trfb korb1 kord), incp1-(ii), and korb. the 3.1-kb maintenance region can increase or decrease the stability of maintenance of rk2 derivatives dependent on the host species and the presence or absence of the rk2 origin of conjugal transfer (orit). in the case of a. calcoaceticus, stable maintenance requires an rk2 segment that includes the promoter and the kild (kilb1) functions of the trfa operon in addition to the 3.1-kb maintenance region. the broad-host-range maintenance requirements of plasmid rk2, therefore, are encoded by multiple functions, and the requirement for one or more of these functions varies among gram-negative bacterial species.

TI  == cloning and expression in escherichia coli of histidine utilization genes from pseudomonas putida.
AB  == a library of the pseudomonas putida chromosome, prepared through the use of the cosmid pjb8 ligated to a partial sau3a digest of bacterial dna, followed by in vitro packaging into bacteriophage lambda particles, was used to construct a strain of escherichia coli which contained the genes for histidine utilization. this isolate produced a repressor product and all five enzymes required in pseudomonas spp. for histidine dissimilation, whereas none of these could be detected in the nontransduced parent e. coli strain. when this transductant was grown on various media containing histidine or urocanate as the inducer, it was observed that production of the cloned histidine degradative enzymes was influenced somewhat by the choice of nitrogen source used but not by the carbon source. the recombinant cosmid was isolated and found to consist of 21.1 kilobase pairs of dna, with approximately 16 kilobase pairs derived from pseudomonas dna and the remainder being from the pjb8 vector. digestion of this insert dna with ecori provided a 6.1-kilobase-pair fragment which, upon ligation in puc8 and transformation into an e. coli host, was found to encode histidine ammonia-lyase  and urocanase. the inducible nature of this production indicated that the hut repressor gene also was present on this fragment. insertional inactivation of the histidine ammonia-lyase and urocanase genes by the gamma-delta transposon has permitted location of these structural genes and has provided evidence that transcription proceeds from urocanase through histidine ammonia-lyase. mapping of the 16-kilobase-pair pseudomonas dna segment with restriction enzymes and subcloning of additional portions, one of which contained the gene for formiminoglutamate hydrolase and another that could constitutively express activities for both imidazolone propionate hydrolase and formylglutamate hydrolase, has provided evidence for the organization of all hut genes.

TI  == aromatic acids are chemoattractants for pseudomonas putida.
AB  == a quantitative capillary assay was used to show that aromatic acids, compounds that are chemorepellents for escherichia coli and salmonella sp., are chemoattractants for pseudomonas putida prs2000. the most effective attractants were benzoate; p-hydroxybenzoate; the methylbenzoates; m-, p-, and o-toluate; salicylate; dl-mandelate; beta-phenylpyruvate; and benzoylformate. the chemotactic responses to these compounds were inducible. taxis to benzoate and m-toluate was induced by beta-ketoadipate, a metabolic intermediate formed when benzoate is dissimilated via enzymes specified by chromosomal genes. benzoylformate taxis was induced by benzoylformate and l(+)-mandelate. taxis to mandelate, benzoylformate, and beta-phenylpyruvate was exhibited by cells grown on mandelate, but not by cells grown on benzoate. cells grown on benzoate were chemotactic to benzoate, the toluates, p-hydroxybenzoate, and salicylate. these results show that p. putida synthesizes at least two distinct chemoreceptors for  aromatic acids. although dl-mandelate was an effective attractant in capillary assays, additional experiments indicated that the cells were actually responding  to benzoylformate, a metabolite formed from mandelate. with the exception of mandelate taxis, chemotaxis to aromatic acids was not dependent on the expression of pathways for aromatic degradation. therefore, the tactic responses exhibited by cells cannot be attributed to an effect of the oxidation of aromatic acids on  the energy metabolism of cells.

TI  == genetic and physical analyses of caulobacter crescentus trp genes.
AB  == caulobacter crescentus trp mutants were identified from a collection of auxotrophs. precursor feeding experiments, accumulation studies, and complementation experiments resulted in the identification of six genes corresponding to trpa, trpb, trpc, trpd, trpe, and trpf. genetic mapping experiments demonstrated that the trp genes were in two clusters, trpcde and trpfba, and a 5.4-kilobase restriction fragment from the c. crescentus chromosome was isolated that contained the trpfba gene cluster. complementation experiments  with clones containing the 5.4-kilobase fragment indicated that trpf was expressed in escherichia coli and that all three genes were expressed in pseudomonas putida. this expression was lost in both organisms when the pbr322 tet gene promoter was inactivated, indicating that all three genes were transcribed in the same orientation from the tet promoter. thus, the c. crescentus promoters do not seem to be expressed in e. coli or p. putida. complementation of the c. crescentus trp mutants indicated that the tet promoter  was not necessary for expression in c. crescentus and suggested that at least two native promoters were present for expression of the trpf, trpb, and trpa genes. taken together, these results indicate that c. crescentus promoters may have structures that are significantly different from the promoters of other gram-negative species.

AB  == hybrid plasmids containing the regulated meta-cleavage pathway operon of tol plasmid pwwo were mutagenized with transposon tn1000 or tn5. the resulting insertion mutant plasmids were examined for their ability to express eight of the catabolic enzymes in escherichia coli. the physical locations of the insertions in each of 28 tn1000 and 5 tn5 derivative plasmids were determined by restriction endonuclease cleavage analysis. this information permitted the construction of a  precise physical and genetic map of the meta-cleavage pathway operon. the gene order xyld (toluate dioxygenase), l (dihydroxycyclohexidiene carboxylate dehydrogenase), e (catechol 2,3-dioxygenase), g (hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase), f (hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase), j (2-oxopent-4-enoate  hydratase), i (4-oxalocrotonate decarboxylase), and h (4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase) was established, and gene sizes were estimated. tn1000 insertions within catabolic genes exerted polar effects on distal structural genes of the operon, but not on an adjacent regulatory gene xyls.

TI  == sequence of the small subunit of yeast carbamyl phosphate synthetase and identification of its catalytic domain.
AB  == the yeast gene cpa1 coding for the small subunit of arginine-specific carbamyl phosphate synthetase has been cloned by complementation of a cpa 1 mutant with a  plasmid library of total yeast chromosomal dna. two of the plasmids, pjl113/st4 and pjl113/st15, contain dna inserts in opposite orientations with overlapping sequences of 2.6 kilobases. the nucleotide sequence of a 2.2-kilobase region of the dna insert carrying the cpa1 gene has been determined. the cpa1 gene has been identified to be 1233 nucleotides long and to code for a polypeptide of 411 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 45,358. the amino acid sequence encoded in cpa1 is homologous to the recently determined sequence of the small subunit of escherichia coli carbamyl phosphate synthetase (piette, j., nyunoya, h., lusty, c.j., cunin, r., weyens, g., crabeel, m., charlier, d., glandsdorff, n., and pierard, a. (1984) proc. natl. acad. sci. u.s.a. 81, 4134-4138) over the  entire length of the polypeptide chain. comparison of the amino acid sequences of the small subunits of yeast and e. coli carbamyl phosphate synthetases to the sequences of component ii of anthranilate and p-aminobenzoate synthases suggests  that these amidotransferases are evolutionarily related. the most highly conserved region of the yeast and e. coli enzymes includes a cysteine residue previously found to be at the active site of pseudomonas putida anthranilate synthase component ii (kawamura, m., keim, p.s., goto, y., zalkin, h., and heinrikson, r.l. (1978) j. biol. chem. 253, 4659-4668). based on the observed homologies in the primary sequences of the other amidotransferases examined, we propose a 13-amino acid long sequence to be part of the catalytic domain of this  class of enzymes.

TI  == novel system for recognizing and eliminating foreign dna in pseudomonas putida.
AB  == derivatives of pqsr49 (r1162::tn1) containing cloned fragments of escherichia coli chromosomal dna are stable in e. coli but unstable in pseudomonas putida. similar derivatives containing p. putida chromosomal dna are stable in both species. instability is a consequence of plasmid loss during growth and is not due to death or inhibition of growth of plasmid-containing cells. average copy numbers per cell of the unstable hybrid plasmids are similar to that of pqsr49, indicating that instability is not the result of reduced replication of plasmid dna. a plasmid unrelated to pqsr49, rk2, becomes unstable in the presence of the  unstable hybrids but only when it also contains foreign dna. the data suggest an  inducible mechanism in p. putida active in the elimination of plasmid-borne foreign dna from the cell.

TI  == the use of mudlac transposons as tools for vital staining to visualize clonal and non-clonal patterns of organization in bacterial growth on agar surfaces.
AB  == when a histochemical stain for beta-galactosidase activity is applied to growth of gram-negative bacteria on agar medium, the pigmentation is non-uniform and capable of revealing internal colony organization into different cell types. use  of an escherichia coli strain with a thermosensitive lac repressor indicates that colonies expand by addition of new cells at the periphery and that older cells which have synthesized beta-galactosidase early in development remain in the centre. mixed inocula of different strains show clonal exclusiveness as they proliferate outwards. mudlac transposons can create genetic fusions that place beta-galactosidase expression under a variety of regulatory systems. stained surface cultures of e. coli and pseudomonas putida strains carrying mudlac insertions in plasmids reveal a variety of flower-like staining patterns. these patterns display both clonal (i.e. sectorial) and non-clonal (circular and radial) features which are heritable within a given strain. the non-clonal aspects of the patterns reflect phenotypic differentiation without genetic change. these observations indicate that bacterial growth on agar surfaces is a highly regulated process similar, in many respects, to the development of specific multicellular tissues and organisms.

TI  == attachment of diaminopimelic acid to bdelloplast peptidoglycan during intraperiplasmic growth of bdellovibrio bacteriovorus 109j.
AB  == an early event in the predatory lifestyle of bdellovibrio bacteriovorus 109j is the attachment of diaminopimelic acid (dap) to the peptidoglycan of its prey. attachment occurs over the first 60 min of the growth cycle and is mediated by an extracellular activity(s) produced by the bdellovibrio. some 40,000 dap residues  are incorporated into the escherichia coli bdelloplast wall, amounting to ca. 2 to 3% of the total initial dap content of its prey cells. incorporation of dap occurs when e. coli, pseudomonas putida, or spirillum serpens are the prey organisms. the structurally similar compounds lysine, ornithine, citrulline, and  2,4-diaminobutyric acid are not attached. the attachment process is not affected  by heat-killing the prey nor by the addition of inhibitors of either energy generation (cyanide, azide, or arsenate), protein or rna synthesis (chloramphenicol and rifamycin), or de novo synthesis of cell wall (penicillin or vancomycin). approximately one-third of the incorporated dap is exchangeable with exogenously added unlabeled dap, whereas the remaining incorporated dpa is solubilized only during the lysis of the bdelloplast wall. examination of dap incorporation at low prey cell densities suggests that bdellovibrios closely couple the incorporation to an independent, enzymatic solubilization of dap by a  peptidase. the data indicate that dap incorporation is a novel process, representing the second example of the ability of the bdellovibrio to biosynthetically modify the wall of its prey.

AB  == measurements of the sucrose-permeable and -impermeable volumes during bdellovibrio bacteriovorus attack on escherichia coli or pseudomonas putida showed that the volume of the bdelloplast increased over that of the substrate cell. although the pattern of the increase differed with the two organisms, the volumes reached maximum at about 60 min into the bdellovibrio growth cycle. by this time, the cytoplasmic membranes of the attacked cells were completely permeable to sucrose. the kinetics of increase in sucrosepermeable volumes were similar to the kinetics of attachment and penetration (varon and shilo, j. bacteriol. 95:744-753, 1968). these data show that the original cytoplasmic and periplasmic compartmentalization of the substrate cell ceases to exist with respect to small hydrophilic molecules during bdellovibrio attack. in contrast, the effective pore size of the outer membrane of the substrate cell to small oligosaccharides remains unaltered during bdelloplast formation as was shown by direct measurements of its exclusion limits. the major porin protein of e. coli,  ompf, was recoverable from the bdelloplast outer membrane fraction until the onset of lysis. the braun lipoprotein was removed from the bdelloplast wall early, and ompa was lost in the terminal part of the bdellovibrio growth cycle.

(1983) j. biol. chem. 258, 2916-2922). a mutant plasmid was isolated which did not direct the synthesis of the active enzyme. this plasmid had a dna region corresponding to the nh2-terminal two-thirds of the polypeptide. from the deduced amino acid sequence, the secondary structure was predicted. around 10 base pairs upstream from the initiator codon for metapyrocatechase, there was a base sequence which was complementary to the 3'-end of 16 s rrnas from both e.coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. a preferential usage of c- and g-terminated codons was found in the coding region xyle, which contributed to the relatively high g + c content (57%)  of this gene.

TI  == chromogenic identification of genetic regulatory signals in bacillus subtilis based on expression of a cloned pseudomonas gene.

TI  == identification of chromosomally integrated tol dna in cured derivatives of pseudomonas putida paw1.
AB  == some plasmid-free tol- strains derived from pseudomonas putida paw1 (which carries the tol plasmid pww0) have a segment of tol dna located chromosomally. of three independently isolated strains, paw86 had an integrated tol segment of 16 kilobases and paw85 had two copies of this segment in different chromosomal locations, whereas the chromosomal dna of paw82 showed no homology with the tol plasmid. in cultures of the parental strain, it appears that a 56-kilobase tol dna segment is located chromosomally in some cells.

TI  == broad-host-range incp-4 plasmid r1162: effects of deletions and insertions on plasmid maintenance and host range.
AB  == r1162 is an 8.7-kilobase (kb) broad-host-range replicon encoding resistance to streptomycin and sulfa drugs. in vitro deletion of 1.8-kb dna between coordinates 3.0 and 5.3 kb did not affect plasmid maintenance, but a tn1 insertion at coordinate 6.3 kb led to a recessive defect in plasmid maintenance. the only cis-acting region necessary for plasmid replication appears to lie between the tn1 insertion at coordinate 6.3 kb and a second tn1 insertion at coordinate 6.5 kb. all r1162 sequences between position 6.5 kb and the ecori site at coordinate  8.7/0 kb were dispensible for replication in escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida. plasmids carrying insertions in a variety of restriction sites in an r1162::tn1 derivative were unstable in p. putida but stable in e. coli. tn5 insertions in r1162 showed a hot spot at coordinate 7.5 kb. a tn5 insertion at coordinate 8.2 kb appeared to mark the 3' end of the streptomycin phosphotransferase coding sequence. all r1162::tn5 derivatives showed specific instability in pseudomonas strains but not in e. coli. the instability could be relieved by internal deletions of tn5 sequences. in the haloaromatic-degrading pseudomonas sp. strain b13, introduction of an unstable r1162::tn5 plasmid led to loss of ability to utilize m-chlorobenzoate as a growth substrate. our results showed that alteration of plasmid sequence organization in nonessential regions can result in restriction of plasmid host range.

TI  == [expression of the genome of mu-like phage d3112 specific for pseudomonas aeruginosa in escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida cells].
AB  == the behavior of escherichia coli cells carrying rp4 plasmid which contains the genome of a mu-like d3112 phage specific for pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied.  two different types of d3112 genome expression were revealed in e. coli. the first is bp4-dependent expression. in this case, expression of certain d3112 genes designated as "kil" only takes place when rp4 is present. as a result, cell division stops at 30 degrees c and cells form filaments. cell division is not blocked at 42 degrees c. the second type of d3112 genome expression is rp4-independent. a small number of phage is produced independently of rp4 plasmid but this does not take place at 42 degrees c. no detectable quantity of the functionally active repressor of the phage was determined in e. coli (d3112). it  is possible that the only cause for cell stability of e. coli (d3112) or e. coli  (rp4::d3112) at 42 degrees c in the absence of the repressor is the fact of an extremely poor expression of d3112. in another heterologous system, p. putida both ways of phage development (lytic and lysogenic) are observed. this special state of d3112 genome in e. coli cells is proposed to be named "conditionally expressible prophage" or, in short, "conex-phage", to distinguish it from a classical lysogenic state when stability is determined by repressor activity. specific blockade of cell division, due to d3112 expression, was also found in p. putida cells. it is evident that the kil function of d3112 is not specific to recognize the difference between division machinery of bacteria belonging to distinct species or genera. protein synthesis is needed to stop cell division and during a short time period this process could be reversible. isolation of e. coli (d3112) which lost rp4 plasmid may be regarded as an evidence for d3112 transposition in e. coli. some possibilities for using the system to look for e.  coli mutants with modified expression of foreign genes are considered.

TI  == [integration of the genome of the mu-like pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophage d3112 into plasmid rp4 and its hybrid plasmid transfer into pseudomonas putida and escherichia coli c600 bacteria].
AB  == the genome of a mu-like bacteriophage d3112 specific for pseudomonas aeruginosa was integrated in vivo into the rp4 plasmid. the fact of integration has been proved by two experiments: 1. the loss of rp4 plasmid is accompanied by loss of d3112 prophage; 2. transfer of the plasmid by conjugation from pseudomonas aeruginosa into bacteria of other species - p. putida pgg1 or escherichia coli c600 leads to the occurrence of clones of these species which liberate phage capable of growing on the lawn of p. aeruginosa bacteria. the integrated state of d3112 inserted into rp4 is stable in p. aeruginosa, e. coli, p. putida. the transfer frequency of rp4 with integrated d3112 prophage into different bacteria  which do not contain homoimmune prophage is essentially lower than that of the rp4 having no d3112 prophage. specific manifestation of d3112 genome activity in  e. coli cells is the sensitivity of cell growth to lower temperature (30 degrees  c) of incubation.

TI  == molecular and functional analysis of the tol plasmid pwwo from pseudomonas putida and cloning of genes for the entire regulated aromatic ring meta cleavage pathway.
AB  == the genetic organization of the pseudomonas putida plasmid pwwo-161, which encodes enzymes for the degradation of toluene and related aromatic hydrocarbons, has been investigated by transposition mutagenesis and gene cloning. catabolic genes were localized to two clusters, one for upper pathway (hydrocarbon leads to carboxylic acid) enzymes and the other for lower pathway (carboxylic acid leads to tricarboxylic acid cycle) enzymes, that are separated by a 14-kilobase dna segment. the physical organization of the catabolic genes thus reflects their functional organization into two regulatory blocks. the pwwo-161 dna fragments sst i fragment c and fragment d were cloned in a broad host range vector to produce plasmid pkt530. this hybrid encodes toluate oxygenase and all meta cleavage pathway enzymes, and it enables p. putida mt-2 and escherichia coli k-12 cells to grow on m-toluate as sole carbon source. the pkt530 plasmid also carries xyls (a gene whose product has been postulated to regulate expression of the lower pathway genes) and the control sequences of the pathway that interact with  this product, because catechol 2,3-oxygenase synthesis is specifically induced by m-toluate in both p. putida and e. coli. evidence is presented that suggests the  promoter operator of the meta pathway gene functions less effectively with the rna polymerase or xyls product of e. coli than with the enzyme or product of p. putida.

AB  == host-vector systems have been developed for gene cloning in the metabolically versatile bacterial genus pseudomonas. they comprise restriction-negative host strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and p. putida and new cloning vectors derived from the high-copy-number, broad-host-range plasmid rsf1010, which are stably maintained in a wide range of gram-negative bacteria. these plasmids contain ecori, ssti, hindiii, xmai, xhoi, sali, bamhi, and clai insertion sites. all cloning sites, except for bamhi and clai, are located within antibiotic-resistance genes' insertional inactivation of these genes during hybrid plasmid formation provides a readily scored phenotypic change for the rapid identification of bacterial clones carrying such hybrids. one of the new vector plasmids is a cosmid that may be used for the selective cloning of large dna fragments by in vitro lambda packaging. an analogous series of vectors that are defective in their plasmid-mobilization function, and that exhibit a degree of biological containment comparable to that of current escherichia coli vector plasmids, are also described.

AB  == the xyldegf operon and the regulatory gene xyls of the tol plasmid found in pseudomonas putida mt-2 were cloned onto escherichia coli vector plasmids. a 9.5-kilobase fragment, derived from the tol segment of ptn2 deoxyribonucleic acid, carried the xyl genes d, e, g, and f, which encode toluate oxygenase, catechol 2,3-oxygenase, 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, and 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase, respectively. the enzymes were noninducible unless a 3-kilobase psti fragment, derived also from the tol segment, was provided in either cis or trans. the psti fragment appeared to contain the regulatory gene xyls, which produced a positive regulator. the regulator was activated by m-toluate or benzoate, but not by m-xylene or m-methylbenzyl alcohol. the map positions of xylg and xylf were also determined.

AB  == the composition of bdellovibrio bacteriovorus lipopolysaccharide (lps) was determined for cells grown axenically and intraperiplasmically on escherichia coli or pseudomonas putida. the lps of axenically grown bdellovibrios contained glucose and fucosamine as the only detectable neutral sugar and amino sugar, and  nonadecenoic acid (19:1) as the predominant fatty acid. additional fatty acids, heptose, ketodeoxyoctoic acid, and phosphate were also detected. lps from bdellovibrios grown intraperiplasmically contained components characteristic of both axenically grown bdellovibrios and the substrate cells. substrate cell-derived lps fatty acids made up the majority of the bdellovibrio lps fatty acids and were present in about the same proportions as in the substrate cell lps. glucosamine derived from e. coli lps amounted to about one-third of the hexosamine residues in intraperiplasmically grown bdellovibrio lps. however, galactose, characteristic of the e. coli outer core and o antigen, was not detected in the bdellovibrio lps, suggesting that only lipid a components of the  substrate cell were incorporated. substrate cell-derived and bdellovibrio-synthesized lps materials were conserved in the b. bacteriovorus outer membrane for at least two cycles of intraperiplasmic growth. when bdellovibrios were grown on two different substrate cells successively, lipid a components were taken up from the second while the components incorporated from the lipid a of the first were conserved in the bdellovibrio lps. the data show that substrate cell lipid a components were incorporated into b. bacteriovorus lipid a during intraperiplasmic growth with little or no change, and that these components, fatty acids and hexosamines, comprised a substantial portion of bdellovibrio lipid a.

TI  == glutamine synthetase of pseudomonads: some biochemical and physicochemical properties.
AB  == the glutamine synthetases from several pseudomonas species were purified to homogeneity, and their properties were compared with those reported for the enzymes from escherichia coli and other gram-negative bacteria. the glutamine synthetase from pseudomonas fluorescens was unique because it was nearly precipitated quantitatively as a homogeneous protein during dialysis of partially purified preparations against buffer containing 10 mm imidazole (ph 7.0) and 10 mm mncl2. the glutamine synthetases from pseudomonas putida and pseudomonas aeruginosa were purified by affinity chromatography on affi-blue gel. dodecamerous forms of the e. coli and p. fluorescens glutamine synthetases had identical mobilities during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. their dissociated subunits, however, migrated differently and were readily separated by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. this difference in subunit mobilities is not related to the state of adenylylation. regulation of the pseudomonas glutamine synthetase activity is mediated by an adenylylation-deadenylylation cyclic cascade system. a sensitive procedure was developed for measuring the average number of adenylylated subunits per enzyme molecule for the glutamine synthetase from p. fluorescens. this method takes advantage of the large differences in transferase activity of the adenylylated and unadenylylated subunits at ph 6.0 and of the fact that the activities of both kinds of subunits are the same at ph 8.45.

TI  == anabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase of escherichia coli and catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase of pseudomonas putida. steady-state kinetic analysis.
AB  == the anabolic and catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferases of pseudomonas putida  display an undirectional catalytic specialization: in citrulline synthesis for the anabolic enzyme, in citrulline phosphorolysis for the catabolic one. the irreversibility of the anabolic enzyme in vitro has been previously explained by  its kinetic properties, whereas the irreversibility of the catabolic transferase  in vivo was shown to be due to its allosteric behaviour. in this work a steady-state kinetic analysis has been carried out on the catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase at ph 6.8 in the presence of the allosteric activator, phosphate. the kinetic mechanism of escherichia coli ornithine carbamoyltransferase serving as a reference was also determined. for the e. coli  enzyme in the reverse direction, the initial velocity patterns converging on the  abscissa were obtained with either citrulline or arsenate as variable substrate.  the inhibition by the product ornithine was linear competitive with respect to citrulline and linear non-competitive with respect to arsenate. in the forward direction phosphate and its analogs induce an inhibition by ornithine which is partial and competitive with respect to carbamoylphosphate. together with the results of thermo-inactivation studies in the presence of each reactant, this observation suggests a random kinetic mechanism, but with most of the reaction flux following the path where carbamoylphosphate adds before ornithine, when substrates are present at km levels. the allosteric catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase of pseudomonas displays qualitatively the same pattern as the e. coli enzyme.

(1976) j. biol. chem, 251, 941-949) identified a cysteine residue required for the formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate. the protein has 3 cysteine residues at positions 54, 79, and 140. cysteine-79 was alkylated selectively by iodoacetamide and by the glutamine affinity analogue l-2-amino-4-oxo-5-chloropentanoic acid. based on this evidence cysteine-79 is the active site residue involved in formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate. comparison of the p. putida as ii sequence with that of the nh2-terminal 60 residues of the enzyme from escherichia coli shows 38% sequence identity.

AB  == we obtained genetic and molecular evidence of non-thermosensitive recombinants of rp4 (kmr tcr cbr/apr) and the thermosensitive tol plasmid. as first isolated in pseudomonas aeruginosa pao, the recombinant plasmid ptn1 specified noninducible synthesis of tol enzymes and was transmissible to escherichia coli on selection for the transfer of kanamycin resistance. the phenotypic expression of tol genes  of ptn1 in e. coli was low and also noninducible. a spontaneous segregant, ptn2,  appearing from ptn1, conferred inducible synthesis of tol enzymes. these plasmids carry all of the tol determinants as evidenced by the ability of pseudomonas putida carrying recombinant plasmids to grow on toluene, xylene, and m-toluate. in e. coli the expression of tol genes with normal regulation (ptn2) appears to be extremely low without induction, and the induced expression is comparable to that with defective regulation (ptn1). the measurement of the molecular weight of ptn2 by electron microscopy gave a value of about 74 x 10(6).

TI  == host factor for coliphage q beta rna replication: presence in procaryotes and association with the 30s ribosomal subunit in escherichia coli.
AB  == the host factor required for in vitro coliphage q beta rna replication, a heat-stable rna binding protein present in uninfected escherichia coli, has been  detected by both immunological and functional tests in acinetobacter calcoaceticus, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas putida. it was not detectable by these criteria in bacillus stearothermophilus, bacillus subtilis, caulobacter crescentus, micrococcus lysodeikticus, rhodopseudomonas capsulata or saccharomyces cerevisiae. in escherichia coli the host factor protein has been shown to be associated with ribosomes. it is demonstrated here that this association is specific for the 30s ribosomal subunit.

TI  == transposition of a beta-lactamase locus from rp1 into pseudomonas putida degradative plasmids.
AB  == the beta-lactamase gene from the rp1 plasmid transposes into at least two pseudomonas putida degradative plasmids. donor strains that carry rp1 (bla+ tet+  apha+) and a degradative plasmid yield transconjugants that have only the bla+ marker of rp1. this occurs in up to 80% of all bla+ transconjugants. segregation  of the bla+ marker requires the presence of a degradative plasmid in the donor and is only observed in transconjugants that have received degradative markers. the bla+ tet apha transconjugants show 100% linkage of bla+ to degradative markers in conjugation,transduction, and transformation crosses. a transduction cross of an (rp1), (sal) donor shows that 8% of all sal plasmids also carry the transposed bla+ marker. tn401 is the name we assign to the bla+ transposon from rp1 observed in pseudomonas. its identity with the rp1 bla+ transposon observed in escherichia coli is not known. in four cases, tn401 has inserted into the camphor genes of the cam-oct plasmid.

TI  == properties of anthranilate synthetase component ii from pseudomonas putida.
AB  == the interaction of pseudomanas putida anthranilate synthetase component ii (as ii) with glutamine, glutamine analogs, and iodoacetamide has been investigated in order to clarify the initial steps in the mechanism for glutamine utilization. as ii is alkylated and irreversibly inactivated by covalent attachment of approximately 1 eg of l-2-amino-4-oxo-5-chloropentanoic acid (chloroketone) or 1  eq of iodoacetamide. alkylation of as ii by chloroketone involves initial formation of an enzyme-inhibitor complex having a ki of 28 mum. alkylation of as  ii by iodoacetamide occurs without initial formation of a reversible complex. in  both cases glutamine protects against alkylation and exhibits competitive kinetics. when anthranilate synthetase component i (as i) is associated with as ii, the second substrate, chorismate, enhances alkylation of as ii by chloroketone. alkylation of as ii by iodoacetamide is unaffected by as i and chorismate. these results suggest a role of chorismate-as i complex to promote binding of glutamine to as ii or to facilitate conversion of an as ii-glutamine complex to the covalent glutamyl-as ii intermediate. this conclusion is supported by the fact that glutaminase activity of as ii, which requires formation of the glutamyl-as ii intermediate, is stimulated by as i and chorismate.

TI  == host factor for coliphage qbeta rna replication is present in pseudomonas putida.
AB  == host factor (hf)1, is a 12000 molecular weight polypeptide that is found in uninfected escherichia coli and is required as a hexamer along with qbeta replicase for in vitro replication of qbeta phage rna. it has recently been found to be associated with ribosomes and to bind tightly to poly(a). we report here the identification and purification of hf from pseudomonas putida. hf can be detected in crude extracts by both functional activity in the qbeta rna replication assay and by immunodiffusion with antibody made against e. coli hf. hf from e. coli and p. putida chromatograph similarly on deae-cellulose and phosphocellulose. they have similar but not identical molecular weights as judged by ses-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. like e. coli hf, p. putida hf was found to be associated with ribosomes and to bind tightly to poly(a). furthermore, the pure protein from p. putida has full funcitonal activity in the  in vitro qbeta rna replication assay. the findings that hf has been conserved during evolution, is associated with ribosomes, and binds poly(a), suggest that hf may be an important translational element in uninfected cells and that its role involves an interaction with rna.

TI  == transformation of pseudomonas putida and escherichia coli with plasmid-linked drug-resistance factor dna.
AB  == conditions optimal for the transformation of pseudomonas putida and e. coli with  a drug-resistance factor (rp 1) dna, which specifies resistance to carbenicillin, tetracycline, kanamycin, and neomycin, are described. the transformants retain all the fertility, incompatibility, and drug-resistance characteristics present in the parent. covalently-closed circular molecules of almost identical contour lengths have been isolated from the parent and the transformants. the frequency of transformation is drastically reduced by treatment of rp 1 dna with dnase and  by denaturation or sonication. shearing of rp 1 dna in vitro and their subsequent introduction in p. putida cells, by transformation, produces transformants that exhibit a wide range of drug-resistant phenotypes, including those which are resistant to neomycin but sensitive to kanamycin. isolation of such neomycin-resistant but kanamycin-sensitive transformants indicates that there might be two separate mechanisms specified by rp 1 for resistance to the two antibiotics.

TI  == immunological study of anthranilate synthetase.
AB  == an immunological study of anthranilate synthetase (asase) has been initiated using quantitative precipitation, enzyme neutralization, and immunodiffusion methods. cross-reactivity of anthranilate synthetase-anthranilate-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase (asase-prtase) from escherichia coli, klebsiella aerogenes, and salmonella typhimurium and asase from serratia marcescens and pseudomonas putida was detected with antibodies to ?e. coli trypsin-treated asase. cross-reactivity of antigens was also obtained with s. marcescens anti-asase. indices of dissimilarity verified the overall structural similarity of asase-prtase from e.  coli, k. aerogenes, and s. typhimurium and the divergence from s. marcescens asase. further divergence of these enzymes from asase in b. subtilis and p. putida was apparent. precipitation of asase components i and ii (asase coi and asase coii) was obtained using anti-asase or antiserum fractionated to contain component-specific antibodies. anti-asase inhibited enzyme activity to binding to determinants on both subunits. anti-asase coi inhibited the ammonia-dependent reaction and interfered with amide transfer from glutaminyl-asase coii. anti-asase coii inhibited the glutamine reaction by blocking amide transfer. enzyme neutralization experiments indicate more conservation of determinants at the active site region of asase coii compared to asase coi in the enterobacteria. a particulate form of asase-prtase in e. coli, k. aerogenes, and s. typhimurium could be distinguished by quantitative precipitation and immunodiffusion.

TI  == new gas chromatographic characterization procedure: preliminary studies on some pseudomonas species.
AB  == strains of saccharolytic and nonsaccharolytic pseudomonas species were examined by a new single-step gas chromatographic characterization procedure. cells were digested in a methanolic solution of tetramethylammonium hydroxide pentahydrate,  and the digestates were subjected to gas-liquid chromatographic analysis. the chromatograms were examined for similarities and differences in their overall patterns. a single component was defined for use as an internal qualitative and quantitative standardizing component in order to develop relative retention time-relative peak height profiles of each organism. comparison of these profiles enabled the characterization of strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. putida, p.  cepacia, p. pseudomallei, p. stutzeri, p. pseudoalcaligenes, p. alcaligenes, p. diminuta, p. denitrificans, and p. acidovorans. the p. maltophilia and p. putrefaciens digestates showed chromatograms which were superficially similar yet easily distinguished as belonging to different species. the chromatograms of these two organisms were very different from those of other pseudomonads.

TI  == kinetics of deoxyribonucleic acid destruction and synthesis during growth of bdellovibrio bacteriovorus strain 109d on pseudomonas putida and escherichia coli.
AB  == during the growth of bdellovibrio bacteriovorus on pseudomonas putida or escherichia coli in either 10(-3)m tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane or in dilute nutrient broth, the host deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) was rapidly degraded, and by 30 to 60 min after the initiation of the bdellovibrio development cycle essentially all host dna became nonbandable in cscl gradients. at this stage the  host dna degradation products were nondiffusable, and there was no appreciable pool of low-molecular-weight (cold acid soluble) dna fragments in the cells or in the suspending medium. bdellovibrio dna synthesis occurred only after degradation of host dna to a nonbandable form was complete. the synthesis occurred in a continuous fashion with p. putida as the host and in two separate periods with e. coli as host. by using e. coli containing a (3)h-thymidine label, it was shown that 73%, on the average, of the thymine residues of host dna were incorporated into bdellovibrio dna when e. coli was the only source of nutrient. in the presence of dilute nutrient broth, the host cells still served as the major source of precursors for bdellovibrio dna synthesis, with only 20% of the precursors arising from the exogenous nutrients. the data indicate an efficient and controlled utilization of host dna by the bdellovibrio. the host dna is apparently degraded early in the developmental cycle to oligonucleotides of intermediate molecular weight from which the biosynthetic monomers are generated  only as they become needed for bdellovibrio dna synthesis.

TI  == pseudomonas putida tryptophan synthetase.
AB  == the two protein components of pseudomonas putida tryptophan synthetase have been  purified to homogeneity. although there is general similarity between the pseudomonas enzyme and that of the enteric bacteria, many differences were found. components from escherichia coli and p. putida do not stimulate each other enzymatically, and the enzymes differ in their response to monovalent cations. serine deamination occurs best with the intact enzyme of p. putida, not with the  beta(2) subunit alone as in e. coli. the amino acid compositions of the alpha subunits differ appreciably. these findings extend earlier studies showing differences between enteric organisms and pseudomonads in the regulation and genetic organization of the enzymes of the tryptophan pathway.

TI  == pseudomonas putida tryptophan synthetase: partial sequence of the subunit.
AB  == there is 50% identity in the sequences of the first 50 residues of the alpha chains of escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida. no deletions or additions of residues are found in this region, except for the n-terminal methionine residue which is missing in the polypeptide isolated from p. putida. most of the residues which differ are chemically dissimilar, and half of them are specified by codons  which differ by more than a single base. the two residues known by mutational analysis to be essential for catalysis in e. coli are conserved in p. putida. the potential taxonomic usefulness of information of this sort is analyzed.

TI  == enzymes of the tryptophan synthetic pathway in pseudomonas putida.
AB  == the first four enzymatic activities of the tryptophan synthetic pathway in pseudomonas putida were found on separate molecules. gel filtration and density gradient centrifugation experiments did not disclose any associations or aggregations among them. these findings contrast with the situation found in the  enteric bacteria, where the first two activities are found in an aggregate and the third and fourth are catalyzed by a single enzyme. tryptophan synthetase, the last enzyme of the pathway, consists of two dissociable components. the affinity  of these components is less in p. putida than is the case in escherichia coli.
