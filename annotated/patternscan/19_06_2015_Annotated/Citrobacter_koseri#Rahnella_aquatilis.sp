TI  == extended spectrum ss-lactamase- and constitutively ampc-producing enterobacteriaceae on fresh produce and in the agricultural environment.
AB  == the attribution of fresh produce to the overall community-associated exposure of  humans to esbl- or ampc-producing bacteria is currently unknown. to address this  issue, the prevalence of esbl- and ampc-producing enterobacteriaceae on fresh produce produced in the netherlands was determined. seven vegetable types that are consumed raw were selected: blanched celery, bunched carrots, chicory, endive, iceberg lettuce, mushrooms, and radish. the vegetables were mostly obtained from supermarkets. to determine whether the agricultural environment is  the source of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae on fresh produce, iceberg lettuce was also obtained directly from three farms, in conjunction with soil and irrigation water. esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae isolated from vegetables and  environment were all environmental species: rahnella aquatilis (n = 119), serratia fonticola (n = 45) and pantoea agglomerans (n = 1). esbl genes of r. aquatilis and s. fonticola were identified as blarahn-1 and blarahn-2 and blafona-1, blafona-2, blafona-3/6 and blafona-5, respectively. for r. aquatilis and s. fonticola, different prevalence numbers were observed using different isolation methods, which could at least partially be explained by an inverse correlation between the level of cefotaxime resistance of these species and incubation temperature. r. aquatilis was isolated from 0 to 46% of soil samples and 11 to 83% of vegetable samples, and s. fonticola from 2 to 60% of soil samples and 0 to 1.3% of vegetable samples. third generation cephalosporin-resistant faecal enterobacteriaceae were isolated from 2.7%, 1.3% and 1.1% of supermarket vegetables, iceberg lettuce from farms, and agricultural  soil respectively. faecal enterobacteriaceae were all identified as citrobacter and enterobacter species and, with the exception of one citrobacter koseri strain, all had phenotypes indicative of constitutive ampc production. comparison of fresh produce and its agricultural environment indicates that the enterobacteriaceae population on fresh produce reflects that of the soil it is grown in. public health risks associated with exposure to esbl- and ampc-producing bacteria through consumption of uncooked fresh produce are diverse. they range from occasional ingestion of 3gc-resistant opportunistic pathogens which may result in difficult-to-treat infections, to frequent ingestion of relatively harmless esbl-producing environmental bacteria that may therewith constitute a continuously replenished intestinal reservoir facilitating dissemination of esbl genes to (opportunistic) pathogens.

TI  == identification of a chromosome-borne expanded-spectrum class a beta-lactamase from erwinia persicina.
AB  == from whole-cell dna of an enterobacterial erwinia persicina reference strain that displayed a penicillinase-related antibiotic-resistant phenotype, a beta-lactamase gene was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. it encoded a clavulanic-acid-inhibited ambler class a beta-lactamase, erp-1, with a pi value of 8.1 and a relative molecular mass of ca. 28 kda. erp-1 shared 45 to 50% amino  acid identity with the most closely related enzymes, the chromosomally encoded enzymes from citrobacter koseri, kluyvera ascorbata, kluyvera cryocrescens, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus vulgaris, proteus penneri, rahnella aquatilis, serratia fonticola, yersinia enterocolitica, and the plasmid-mediated enzymes ctx-m-8 and ctx-m-9. the substrate profile of the noninducible erp-1 was similar  to that of these beta-lactamases. erp-1 is the first extended-spectrum beta-lactamase from an enterobacterial species that is plant associated and plant pathogenic.
