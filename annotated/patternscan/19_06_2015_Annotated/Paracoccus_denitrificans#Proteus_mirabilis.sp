TI  == chloride dependence of growth in bacteria.
AB  == chloride is an abundant anion on earth but studies analyzing a possible function  of chloride in prokaryotes are scarce. to address the question, we have tested 44 different gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria for a chloride dependence or chloride stimulation of growth. none required chloride for growth at their optimal growth (salt) conditions. however, in hyperosmotic media containing high  concentrations of na+, 11 bacteria (aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus megaterium, bacillus subtilis, corynebacterium glutamicum, escherichia coli, paracoccus denitrificans, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, thermus thermophilus, and vibrio fischeri) had a strict chloride dependence for growth or were significantly stimulated by chloride. these data show that chloride is essential for growth at high salt (na+) concentrations in various species of the domain bacteria.
