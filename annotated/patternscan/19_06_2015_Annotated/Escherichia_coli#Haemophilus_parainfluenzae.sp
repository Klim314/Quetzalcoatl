TI  == spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of common pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in mainland of china.
AB  == background: bacteria-induced respiratory infection has been long considered to be the major cause of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aecopd). therefore, a clear picture about the distribution and drug-resistance of pathogenic bacteria in the lower airways should be helpful for treatment of the disease. so far, data on this topic among chinese are lacking. methods: a surveillance study was performed in consecutive patients with aecopd at five areas in china between october 2006 and april 2008. the sputum from these patients was cultured and isolated for bacteria. agar dilution method was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of levofoxacin and other 15 antibiotics against these strains. results: three hundred and fifty-nine pathogenic bacterial strains were isolated among 884 patients with aecopd. the predominant bacteria were pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.3%), haemophilus influenzae (14.2%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (11.7%), followed by haemophilus parainfluenzae (9.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (7.8%), moraxella catarrhalis (6.4%) and escherichia coli (3.6%). the majority of bacterial pathogens isolated in this study were susceptible to fuoroquinolones, ceftazidime, cefepime and imipenem. conclusions: gram-negative bacilli are the leading pathogens in patients with aecopd in china. haemophilus parainfluenzae may be one of the most important pathogens in aecopd. this study provides evidence for local surveillance of aecopd pathogens and appropriate choice of antimicrobials in china.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of ceftaroline and comparator agents tested against bacterial isolates causing skin and soft tissue infections and community-acquired respiratory tract infections isolated from the asia-pacific region and south africa (2010).
AB  == ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a cephalosporin with in vitro bactericidal activity against resistant gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and multidrug-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, and common gram-negative organisms, including wild-type enterobacteriaceae. we evaluated the in vitro activity of ceftaroline and selected comparator agents against bacterial isolates collected from patients with skin and soft tissue infections (ssti) and community-acquired respiratory tract infections (carti) in the asia-pacific region and south africa. a total of 2351 isolates, 1100 from ssti and 1251 from carti, were collected from 25 medical centers distributed across 8 countries as part of the 2010 aware ceftaroline surveillance program and tested for susceptibility by reference broth microdilution methods. ceftaroline was very active against s. aureus (mic50/90, 0.25/1 mug/ml; 93.4% susceptible), including  mrsa (mic50/90, 1/2 mug/ml; 80.6% susceptible). against beta-hemolytic streptococci, ceftaroline demonstrated greater activity (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) than penicillin (mic90, 0.06 mug/ml). ceftaroline was also highly active against  viridans group streptococci (mic90, 0.12 mug/ml). similarly to ceftriaxone, ceftaroline activity against escherichia coli (mic50/90, >32/>32 mug/ml) and klebsiella spp. (mic50/90, 0.12/>32 mug/ml) was compromised by the high prevalence of isolates with an esbl phenotype in the region, particularly in china. ceftaroline was the most potent beta-lactam tested against s. pneumoniae (mic50/90 of 0.015/0.25 mug/ml; 99.8% susceptible by clinical and laboratory standards institute [clsi] criteria), and it was also highly potent against haemophilus influenzae (mic50/90, </= 0.008/0.03 mug/ml; 100% susceptible by clsi criteria). ceftaroline was also active against h. parainfluenzae (mic50/90, </= 0.008/0.015 mug/ml) and moraxella catarrhalis (mic50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/ml). in summary, ceftaroline showed potent in vitro activity against a large collection of bacterial isolates (2351) associated with ssti and carti from the asia-pacific region and south africa.

TI  == evaluation of commercial universal rrna gene pcr plus sequencing tests for identification of bacteria and fungi associated with infectious endocarditis.
AB  == two new commercially available universal rrna gene pcr plus sequencing tests, sepsitest and universal microbe detection (umd; molzym, bremen, germany), were evaluated using blood specimens and heart valves from 30 patients with suspected  infectious endocarditis (ie). the sensitivity of pcr (85%) was nearly twice as high as that of culture (45%), which in 10/20 ie cases presumably stayed negative as a consequence of growth inhibition of the pathogens by antibiotics. further, pcr provided the basis for reclassification of 5/10 non-ie cases into ie cases. culture-negative infections were identified by pcr, including single infections due to streptococci and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, haemophilus parainfluenzae) and mixed infections involving two gram-positive bacteria or candida spp. with gram-positive bacteria. the new commercial tests proved to be of value for the rapid diagnosis of ie, particularly in cases of culture-negative infections. issues regarding the feasibility of these tests for routine use are discussed.

TI  == identification of bacterial dna in noninfectious pleural fluid with a highly sensitive pcr method.
AB  == background: bacterial dna due to bacterial translocation has been identified in noninfectious ascitic fluid samples. objective: this study investigated the possible presence of bacterial dna in the pleural fluid of patients with pleural  effusions of noninfectious origin, using a highly sensitive pcr-based method. methods: pleural fluid samples from 175 patients (average age +/- sd: 69 +/- 14 years) with noninfectious pleural effusion (62 transudates, 113 exudates) were analyzed. bacterial dna was detected using nested pcr with amplification of a fragment of the gene r16s, with 2 amplification protocols, i.e. low sensitivity (10 and 40 cycles) and high sensitivity (40 and 40 cycles). results: with the less sensitive amplification process, only 1 sample was positive (haemophilus parainfluenzae in a patient with hepatic hydrothorax). with the highly sensitive  nested pcr method, bacterial dna was identified in the pleural fluid, of both transudative and exudative origin, of 75 of the 175 patients (43%). in cases of isolation of a single bacterium, the more frequent were escherichia coli, salmonella enterica and streptococcus pneumoniae. conclusions: regardless of its  origin, bacterial dna can be identified in almost half of noninfectious pleural effusions by using a highly sensitive pcr-based method. the possible clinical significance or prognostic value of these findings deserves to be evaluated.

TI  == construction of a novel shuttle vector for use in haemophilus influenzae and h. parainfluenzae.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae is an important human pathogen. a number of complete genome sequences of various haemophili are available; however, functional studies have been limited by the lack of an effective shuttle vector which functions in all strains. here, we have constructed a shuttle vector, pej6, which transfers genes between escherichia coli and h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae. the vector contains an origin of replication from pls88 which is functional in e. coli and h. influenzae. in addition it contains an rp4 mobilisation region. the vector can be introduced by electroporation and conjugation into capsulate and non-typeable h. influenzae and is functional for allelic replacement and mutant complementation. the vector will be useful for investigating gene function in haemophilus spp.

TI  == [distribution and drug resistance of the isolated bacteria from children with acute respiratory infection].
AB  == objective: to study the distribution and drug resistance of the isolated bacteria from children with acute respiratory infection (ari) in dalian. methods: between  january 2006 and february 2007, 930 children with ari were enrolled, including 364 with acute upper respiratory infection (auri), and 566 with acute lower respiratory infection (alri). the auri children, who did not receive antimicrobial agent treatment or received oral antimicrobial agents 1-2 times, had bacterial cultures of pharyngeal swab. the alri children, who received intravenous antibacterial agents more than 3 days, had bacterial cultures of sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf). isolated bacteria were identified by the atb system (bio-merieux, france). antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out by means of kirby-bauer. results: a total of 404 isolates (43.4%) were identified. haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 22.5%, 12.1% and 7.4% respectively. in the isolates from auri, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 43.9%, 22.0% and 9.1% respectively; escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia and nonfermenters accounted for 4.5%, 8.3% and 3.0% respectively. in the isolates from alri, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 12.1%, 7.4% and 6.6% respectively; escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and nonfermenters  accounted for 16.9%, 13.2% and 21.8% respectively. the resistant rates of haemophilus to ampicillin and tmp-smz were 29.3% and 32.9% respectively, and to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefalotin, cefaclor, cefuroxime and cefotaxime were  12.1%, 10.0%, 10.0%, 11.4% and 5.7%, respectively. the resistant rate of haemophilus to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefaclor, tetracycine and tmp-smz in the alri group were significantly higher than that in the auri group (p<0.05 or 0.01). conclusions: in dalian, haemophilus was the main isolate of children with ari. the distribution of bacteria was different between alri and auri. in alri, gram-negative bacilli were in a higher proportion, and the resistant rates of haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefaclor were higher.

TI  == [infection pathogen analysis of 2388 patients in an open hematology ward from 1993 to 2004].
AB  == objective: to investigate the incidence of infection and pathogens in hematology  ward. methods: the data of incidence, pathogen, and outcome of infection of 2388  hospitalized patients in an open hematology ward of peking union medical college  hospital from 1993 to 2004 were analyzed retrospectively. results: the overall incidence of infection was 34.3% according to the person-times of hospitalization, 24.4% for nosocomial infection and 9.9% for community-acquired infection. most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infection were gram  negative. the most common bacteria in the sputum samples included enterobacter (27%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%) and coagulase negative staphylococcus (mrscon, 12%), the most common bacteria in the blood samples included escherichia coli (43%), enterobacter cloacae (11%), and klebsiella (11%). whereas in the community-acquired infection the most common bacteria in the sputum samples were  haemophilus parainfluenzae (15%), mrscon (28%), and staphylococcus epidermidis (10%), and the most common bacteria in the blood samples were mrscon (28%), e. coli (28%), and klebsiella (9.4%). fungi were more often found in nosocomial infection, especially in the sputum samples. 12-year follow up showed that in nosocomial infection pseudomonas aeruginosa remained the most common bacteria in  the sputum samples, whereas e. coli and enterobacter cloacae became the major bacteria in the blood samples. in community-acquired infection, the proportion of staphylococcus aureus, that of klebsiella in blood samples, and that of e. coli in throat swab samples increased in recent years. the incidence of fungi infection had increased in both nosocomial infection and community acquired infection. the mortality of nosocomial infection was 6.1%, higher than that of the community-acquired infection, however, not statistically significant (p = 0.17). there was a trend of decrease in the mortality of community-acquired infection but did not in the nosocomial infection. conclusion: the patients in hematology ward are susceptible to infection, especially nosocomial infection that has a higher mortality rate in comparison with the community-acquired infection, however, not statistically significant. the pathogens of nosocomial infection are most likely g- bacteria, fungi and other bacteria resistant to most antibiotics. the mortality rate of nosocomial infection remains almost unchanged  in the 12-year follow up.

TI  == remarkable conservation of translation initiation factors: if1/eif1a and if2/eif5b are universally distributed phylogenetic markers.
AB  == initiation of protein biosynthesis is an essential process occurring in cells throughout the three phylogenetic domains, bacteria, archaea, and eucarya. if1/eif1a and if2/eif5b, two conserved translation initiation factors are involved in this important step of protein biosynthesis. the essentiality, universal distribution, conservation, and interspecies functional homology of both factors are a unique combination of properties ideal for molecular phylogenetic studies as demonstrated by the extensively compared ssu rrnas. here, we assess the use of if1/eif1a and if2/eif5b in universal and partial phylogenetic studies by comparison of sequence information from species within all three phylogenetic domains and among closely related strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae. we conclude that the amino acid sequence of if1/eif1a-if2/eif5b is a universal phylogenetic marker and that the nucleotide sequence of the if2/eif5b g-domain is more credible than ssu rrna for the construction of partial phylogenies among closely related species and strains. because of these two application levels, if1/eif1a-if2/eif5b is a phylogenetic "dual level" marker.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == a novel heme protein, the cu,zn-superoxide dismutase from haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  == haemophilus ducreyi, the causative agent of the genital ulcerative disease known  as chancroid, is unable to synthesize heme, which it acquires from humans, its only known host. here we provide evidence that the periplasmic cu,zn-superoxide dismutase from this organism is a heme-binding protein, unlike all the other known cu,zn-superoxide dismutases from bacterial and eukaryotic species. when the h. ducreyi enzyme was expressed in escherichia coli cells grown in standard lb medium, it contained only limited amounts of heme covalently bound to the polypeptide but was able efficiently to bind exogenously added hemin. resonance raman and electronic spectra at neutral ph indicate that h. ducreyi cu,zn-superoxide dismutase contains a 6-coordinated low spin heme, with two histidines as the most likely axial ligands. by site-directed mutagenesis and analysis of a structural model of the enzyme, we identified as a putative axial ligand a histidine residue (his-64) that is present only in the h. ducreyi enzyme and that was located at the bottom of the dimer interface. the introduction of a  histidine residue in the corresponding position of the cu,zn-superoxide dismutase from haemophilus parainfluenzae was not sufficient to confer the ability to bind  heme, indicating that other residues neighboring his-64 are involved in the formation of the heme-binding pocket. our results suggest that periplasmic cu,zn-superoxide dismutase plays a role in heme metabolism of h. ducreyi and provide further evidence for the structural flexibility of bacterial enzymes of this class.

TI  == [a consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-negative bacilli].
AB  == the results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the japanese ministry of health and welfare during the period of january 1993 to july 1995, were analyzed for typical gram-negative  bacilli in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. during these 3 years, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes and proteus mirabilis showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to fosfomycin (fom) and citrobacter freundii. klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes showed slightly increasing tendency to minocycline (mino). while haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefmetazole (cmz). however, these annual changes were almost negligible. generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against gram-negative bacilli. however, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. on the other hand, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st), cmz, latamoxef (lmox), gentamicin (gm) and amikacin (amk) showed good activities against some of the gram-negative bacilli to which no indications are approved. in conclusion, bedside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of antimicrobial agents is necessary.

TI  == cefaclor: a contemporary look at susceptibility of key pathogens from around the  globe.
AB  == the orally administered cephalosporin antibiotic, cefaclor, has been available for clinical use in many countries since 1979. because widespread antibiotic use  is often cited as a factor in the emergence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, we sought to determine the degrees of resistance to cefaclor expressed by key pathogens recently isolated in 10 countries widely distributed around the world. using the e-test, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) were  determined for cefaclor and several comparator antibiotics against approximately  700 fresh clinical isolates of each of six bacterial species. the results demonstrated that > 90% of haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase producing and non-producing), haemophilus parainfluenzae (beta-lactamase producing and non-producing), moraxella catarrhalis (> 90% beta-lactamase producing), and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and 85% of escherichia coli were susceptible to cefaclor at the nccls interpretive breakpoints. mic distributions  showed that there has been no change in the activity of cefaclor against penicillin-susceptible strains of streptococcus pneumoniae since 1977.

TI  == outer membrane protein d15 is conserved among haemophilus influenzae species and  may represent a universal protective antigen against invasive disease.
AB  == we have cloned and sequenced the d15 gene from two strains of haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) and two strains of nontypeable h. influenzae (nthi). the  nucleotide and deduced protein sequences of d15 are highly conserved, with only a small variable region identified near the carboxyl terminus of the protein. analysis of upstream sequences revealed that the h. influenzae d15 gene may be part of a large potential operon of closely spaced open reading frames, including one with significant homology to the escherichia coli cds gene encoding cdp-diglyceride synthetase. southern blot analysis demonstrated that the d15 gene is also present in h. influenzae types a, c, d, e, and f and in haemophilus parainfluenzae. a recombinant d15 (rd15) protein was expressed in good quantity in e. coli from the inducible t7 promoter, and monospecific anti-rd15 antibodies  were raised. immunoblot analysis of h. influenzae serotypes a, b, c, d, e, and f, nthi, and h. parainfluenzae lysates revealed that they all expressed a cross-reactive d15-like protein. purified rd15 was found to be highly immunogenic in mice, guinea pigs, and rabbits, and passive transfer of anti-rd15 antibodies protected infant rats from challenge with h. influenzae type b or type a in infant rat models of bacteremia. thus, d15 is a highly conserved antigen that is  protective in animal models and it may be a useful component of a universal subunit vaccine against haemophilus infection and disease.

TI  == rapid, sensitive, microbial detection by gene amplification using restriction endonuclease target sequences.

TI  == hpaii methyltransferase is mutagenic in escherichia coli.
AB  == a genetic reversion assay to study c-to-t mutations within cg sites in dna is described. it was used to demonstrate that the presence of hpaii methyltransferase (mtase) in escherichia coli causes a substantial increase in c-to-t mutations at cg sites. this is similar to the known mutagenic effects of e. coli mtase dcm within its own recognition sequence. with this genetic system,  a homolog of an e. coli dna repair gene in haemophilus parainfluenzae was tested  for antimutagenic activity. unexpectedly, the homolog was found to have little effect on the reversion frequency. the system was also used to show that hpaii and sssi mtases can convert cytosine to uracil in vitro. these studies define 5-methylcytosine as an intrinsic mutagen and further elaborate the mutagenic potential of cytosine mtases.

TI  == clarification of the structure of the ampicillin-resistance plasmid rsf0885 from  haemophilus influenzae hr-885 serotype b.
AB  == the nonconjugative ampicillin-resistance plasmid rsf0885 has been reported to be  as small as 2.9 mda and as large as 4.1 mda with at least two restriction enzyme  maps reported. in addition, the source of the original plasmid has been reported  to be haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae. characterization of  the source strains and sequencing data of the plasmids revealed that h. influenzae serotype b was the original source strain and that is1-k in the larger plasmid was presumably acquired when the smaller plasmid was maintained in escherichia coli in s. falkow's laboratory during the late 1970s.

TI  == efficacy of fleroxacin versus amoxicillin in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  == in a multicenter study the efficacy and safety of oral fleroxacin at 400 mg once  a day and amoxicillin at 500 mg three times daily for 7 days were compared for the treatment of patients with acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to drug-susceptible bacteria. a total of 194 patients were enrolled, 102 in the fleroxacin group and 92 in the amoxicillin group. of those enrolled, 22 in the fleroxacin group and 30 (29 for clinical efficacy) in the amoxicillin group were included in the efficacy analysis. all were included in the safety analysis. clinical success was noted in 21 (95%) of 22 fleroxacin-treated patients and 22 (76%) of 29 amoxicillin-treated patients. bacteriologic cure was obtained in 21 (95%) of 22 of the fleroxacin group and 18  (60%) of 30 of the amoxicillin group. one haemophilus parainfluenzae strain persisted with fleroxacin. persisting organisms with amoxicillin included haemophilus influenzae (four), haemophilus parainfluenzae (three), escherichia coli (two), streptococcus pneumoniae (one), neisseria species (one), and proteus  mirabilis (one). adverse events were reported by 41% of 102 patients receiving fleroxacin and 15% of 92 patients receiving amoxicillin. insomnia, dizziness, and nausea occurred more frequently with fleroxacin. fleroxacin may be indicated for  the treatment of acute bacterial infection in chronic bronchitis known to be due  to haemophilus species and moraxella catarrhalis. the 92% incidence of resistance among the s. pneumoniae isolates recovered from all enrolled patients suggests that fleroxacin may not be useful for such infections.

TI  == antigenic diversity in haemophilus ducreyi as shown by western blot (immunoblot)  analysis.
AB  == the antigenic diversity within a panel of 63 haemophilus ducreyi isolates was examined by western blot (immunoblot) analysis with a pool of 238 well-characterized human antisera. when a serum pool adsorbed on a mixture of haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, and h. parahaemolyticus was used, the  immunoprofiles suggested that prominent antigenic proteins involved in the human  immune response have apparent molecular masses of 63, 42, 34 to 30, and 28.5 to 28 kda. preliminary subcellular localization revealed that these antigens are associated with the cellular membrane. two subsets of antigens were discriminated by detergent extraction. there was no evidence that the antigen composition is altered by changing the growth conditions. with a serum pool adsorbed on the haemophilus spp. mixture supplemented with actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  pasteurella ureae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and escherichia coli, antigenic determinants more specific for h. ducreyi were identified. an immunodominant 28.5- to 28-kda protein was expressed by all h. ducreyi isolates. in the range from 34 to 30 kda, 56 isolates revealed a dominant protein with variable molecular mass. by using both proteins (28.5 to 28 kda and 34 to 30 kda) as immunotypic markers, seven different immunopatterns were identified. antigenic diversity among isolates from different geographical origins as well as from a single area was observed.

AB  == panipenem/betamipron (papm/bp) is a combination drug of papm, a new parenteral carbapenem antibiotic and bp, an amino acid derivative at a weight ratio of 1:1.  its in vitro antibacterial activities against clinically isolated respiratory pathogenic bacteria were determined. it was superior to imipenem (ipm) in the in  vitro antibacterial activities against haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus including mrsa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli. papm had antibacterial activities almost equal to those of ipm against streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus spp. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, its antibacterial activity was about 1/4 that of ipm. the clinical usefulness of papm/bp was studied by dissolving it in a solution containing lactate and administering the solution by intravenous drip infusion to 12 cases of respiratory tract infections. out of 11 cases with respiratory tract infections excluding cytomegalovirus pneumonia, the efficacy rate was 90.9%, with 4 cases of excellent and 6 cases of good responses. in terms of its bacteriological efficacies, eradication of pathogenic bacteria including super-infection were observed in 2 out of 4 strains, but 2 strains of p. aeruginosa remained unchanged. six strains appeared as superinfected bacteria during and after administration of this preparation substituting original pathogens. side-effects  were not observed in the 12 cases, and in laboratory tests, slight transient increases of s-got and s-gpt were found in 1 case. in conclusion, papm/bp is a very useful parenteral antibiotic against respiratory tract infections and can be one of the drugs of the first choice.

TI  == copper-zinc superoxide dismutase of haemophilus influenzae and h. parainfluenzae.
AB  == copper-zinc superoxide dismutase ([cu,zn]-sod) is widely found in eukaryotes but  has only rarely been identified in bacteria. here we describe sodc, encoding [cu,zn]-sod in haemophilus influenzae and h. parainfluenzae, frequent colonists and pathogens of the human respiratory tract. in capsulate h. influenzae, sodc was found in only one division of the bacterial population, and although the protein it encoded was clearly [cu,zn]-sod from its deduced sequence, it lacked enzymatic activity. in h. parainfluenzae, in contrast, active enzyme was synthesized which appeared to be secreted beyond the cytoplasm when the gene was  expressed in escherichia coli minicells. the origin of gene transcription differed between the haemophilus species, but protein synthesis from cloned genes in vitro was comparable. a c-t transition was found in the h. influenzae sequence compared with the h. parainfluenzae sequence, leading to a histidine, known to be crucial in eukaryotic [cu,zn]-sod for copper ion coordination and so for enzymatic activity, to be changed to tyrosine. this is speculated to be the cause of inactivity of the h. influenzae enzyme. secreted sods have only been described in a few bacterial species, and this is the first identification of [cu,zn]-sod in a common human upper respiratory tract colonist. the role of secreted bacterial sods is unknown, and we speculate that in haemophilus species the enzyme may confer survival advantage by accelerating dismutation of superoxide of environmental origin to hydrogen peroxide, disruptive to the normal mucociliary clearance process in the host.

TI  == cloning and characterization of the hpaii methylase gene.
AB  == the hpaii restriction-modification system from haemophilus parainfluenzae recognizes the dna sequence ccgg. the gene for the hpaii methylase has been cloned into e. coli and its nucleotide sequence has been determined. the dna of the clones is fully protected against cleavage by the hpaii restriction enzyme in vitro, indicating that the methylase gene is active in e. coli. the clones were isolated in an mcra-strain of e. coli; attempts to isolate them in an mcra+ strain were unsuccessful. the clones do not express detectable hpaii restriction  endonuclease activity, suggesting that either the endonuclease gene is not expressed well in e. coli, or that it is not present in its entirety in any of the clones that we have isolated. the derived amino acid sequence of the hpaii methylase shows overall similarity to other cytosine methylases. it bears a particularly close resemblance to the sequences of the hhai, bsufi and mspi methylases. when compared with three other methylases that recognize ccgg, the variable region of the hpaii methylase, which is believed to be responsible for sequence specific recognition, shows some similarity to the corresponding regions of the bsufi and mspi methylases, but is rather dissimilar to that of the spr methylase.

TI  == dna probe technology for rapid detection of haemophilus influenzae in clinical specimens.
AB  == in a previous study, we reported that a 5-kilobase haemophilus influenzae dna fragment involved in penicillin-binding protein expression could be used as a probe for specific detection of h. influenzae strains (f. malouin and l. e. bryan, mol. cell. probes 1:221-232, 1987). here, we report the ability of this probe to detect h. influenzae in clinical specimens. in a bacterial dot experiment, there was strong hybridization of the 32p-labeled probe to nonencapsulated and serotype a through f h. influenzae strains. the detection of  h. influenzae in body fluids was then evaluated by using pooled human serum, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and sputum as dilution media for h. influenzae, haemophilus aegyptius, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and escherichia coli cells. at 65 degrees c, the probe hybridized to h. influenzae and h. aegyptius (greater than or equal to 10(5) cells) in all fluids. there was no hybridization with the  e. coli negative control, and h. parainfluenzae hybridized when greater than or equal to 10(7) cells were used. experiments performed at 73 and 80 degrees c permitted elimination of h. parainfluenzae hybridization. the detection of h. influenzae in 232 sputa from patients with respiratory tract infections was very  specific (96 to 97%) and sensitive (74 to 100%) when the total time of the procedure was sufficient (6 to 24 h) and when the experiments were performed at 80 degrees c. in addition, the probe detected three of three and four of four h.  influenzae-infected cerebrospinal fluids and blood cultures, respectively, and did not react with pneumococcus- or streptococcus-infected cerebrospinal fluids.  finally, by using a small-scale procedure, the probe rapidly detected h. influenzae in cerebrospinal fluid and sputum specimens (4 and 8 h, respectively). these results imply prompt diagnosis of h. influenzae infections caused by nonencapsulated and serotype a through f strains.

TI  == constitutive expression of tetracycline resistance mediated by a tn10-like element in haemophilus parainfluenzae results from a mutation in the repressor gene.
AB  == the tn10-like constitutively expressed tetracycline resistance determinant from a haemophilus parainfluenzae strain was cloned in escherichia coli. toxicity resulting from expression on multicopy plasmids necessitated its being cloned on  a low-copy plasmid vector or in cells containing the tn10-encoded repressor. constitutive expression of tetracycline resistance was found to result from the synthesis of a truncated inactive repressor molecule. instead of the 23-kilodalton repressor found in other tn10-containing strains, this determinant  encoded a 14.5-kilodalton molecule. the dna sequence of the 700-base-pair region  spanning the repressor gene and promoter-operator regions of the haemophilus determinant was identical to that of the same region of tn10, except for the absence of a single t x a base pair in the repressor gene. this deletion leads to premature termination of the protein. antisera to the repressor suggested that the repressor was also absent in a second independently isolated h. parainfluenzae strain bearing a tn10-like constitutive tetracycline resistance determinant.

AB  == cefuzonam (l-105, czon), a new injectable cephalosporin, was used in 12 pediatric patients with infections. the following is a summary of the results: the 12 cases included 3 cases of tonsillitis (pathogen: haemophilus parainfluenzae in 1 case,  haemophilus influenzae in 2 cases), 4 cases of pneumonia (staphylococcus aureus in 1 case, pathogen unknown in 3 cases), 2 cases of nephropyelitis (escherichia coli in 2 cases), 1 case of purulent lymphadenitis (pathogen unknown), 1 case of  purulent thyroiditis (mixed infection of streptococcus milleri, haemophilus aphrophilus and anaerobes), and 1 case of vulvar abscess (e. coli). dose levels of czon were 42.9 approximately 93.3 mg/kg/day divided into 3 or 4 times and the  drug was intravenously injected for 6 to 12 days. clinical efficacies were excellent in 4 cases, good in 5 cases, and poor in 3 cases, with the efficacy rate of 75.0%. the 3 cases with poor efficacy consisted of 1 case each of pneumonia complicated with chronic granulomatosis, purulent thyroiditis associated with piriform recess fistula, and purulent lymphadenitis of armpit developed after surgical operation of congenital heart disease. in the first 2 cases satisfactory efficacy was not obtained by chemotherapy alone, and complete  cure was seen after surgical operation. side effects were not observed clinically. one case each of slight prolongation of prothrombin time and transient elevations of got and gpt values were noted but no severe abnormalities were found in laboratory tests.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam in the field of pediatrics].
AB  == fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam (l-105, czon), a newly semisynthesized cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics and the following results were obtained. antibacterial activities of czon against clinically isolated strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and h. influenzae were compared with those of cefmenoxime (cmx), latamoxef (lmox), cefoperazone (cpz), cefmetazole (cmz), cefotiam (ctm) and cefazolin (cez). czon was nearly as active as cez against s. aureus and s. epidermidis and superior to other antibiotics against other gram-positive cocci. against gram-negative rods, czon was as active as cmx and superior to other 5 antibiotics compared. serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of czon at doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 1, 5 and 4 cases, respectively, were determined. mean serum concentrations of czon at these dose levels were 11.0, 43.8 and 111.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 2.4, 10.3 and 30.3 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 0.17, 0.72 and 1.28 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, with serum half-lives of 1.79, 0.88 and 1.19 hours, respectively. mean cumulative urinary excretion rates  within 6 hours after administration were 47.9, 56.3 and 40.3%, respectively. thirty-four pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (tonsillitis 2,  acute bronchitis 1, pneumonia 14, pyothorax 1, sepsis 1, suppurative lymphadenitis 1, uti 13 and enteritis 1) were treated with czon at a daily dose of 40-94 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d.. the overall clinical efficacy rate was 94.1%. no adverse reactions were observed except 2 cases with mild diarrhea. abnormal laboratory findings were also mild; slight elevation of got and gpt in 2, eosinophilia in 1 and thrombocytosis in 1. these results clearly indicate the usefulness of czon in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.

TI  == emergence of beta-lactamase producing anaerobic bacteria in the tonsils during penicillin treatment.
AB  == the emergence of beta-lactamase producing bacteria in the microflora in the oropharyngeal cavity was studied in ten healthy volunteers treated with 1 g phenoxymethylpenicillin b.i.d. for ten days. beta-lactamase activity in saliva was also investigated. a significant increase in the number of beta-lactamase producing strains of bacteroides species and fusobacterium nucleatum was observed. one beta-lactamase producing staphylococcus aureus strain was recovered in one of the volunteers before the penicillin administration started and three staphylococcus aureus strains produced beta-lactamase after ten days of antibiotic treatment. beta-lactamase-production in haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae or branhamella catarrhalis was not observed before, during or after the antibiotic treatment. beta-lactamase activity was noted in the broth cultures from one volunteer colonized with a beta-lactamase producing escherichia coli strain. beta-lactamase activity in saliva was observed in all volunteers, the activity increasing significantly in parallel to the increase of  beta-lactamase producing bacterial strains. beta-lactamase activity in saliva was completely inhibited in vitro by clavulanic acid and p-chloromercurbenzoate and about 70-80 per cent of the activity was inhibited by cefoxitin. the increase of  beta-lactamase producing bacteria in the oropharynx as a consequence of penicillin treatment raises doubt as to whether penicillin is the drug of choice  in the treatment of tonsillitis caused by group a streptococci when previous treatment has failed.

TI  == transposon tn10-like tetracycline resistance determinants in haemophilus parainfluenzae.
AB  == tetracycline resistance (tcr) determinants from three different strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae expressed 10-fold higher levels of resistance when mated into escherichia coli. no plasmid was found in any of the e. coli recipients, even in matings in which a plasmid was identified in the donor haemophilus sp. the tcr determinant from haemophilus sp. caused instability of resident plasmids in the recipient e. coli: all plasmids were lost within 30 generations in antibiotic-free media. however, by serial subculture in antibiotics, stable resident plasmids were obtained which carried the tcr determinant from haemophilus sp. and were transferable by conjugation and transformation among e. coli strains. all haemophilus determinants hybridized with a probe for the tcr determinant on tn10, which bears inducible tcr. however, haemophilus determinants were constitutively resistant to tetracycline in the haemophilus donors and in the e. coli recipients. this constitutive expression was recessive to wild-type tn10 in the same cell, indicating that the constitutive phenotype resulted from the absence of an active repressor. restrictive enzyme analysis of various e. coli plasmid derivatives bearing a tcr  determinant from haemophilus sp. demonstrated that the inserted dna was of similar size (8.95 to 9.35 kilobases), close to that of tn10. heteroduplex analysis and dna:dna hybridization confirmed that the tcr determinant from haemophilus sp. had greater than 90% homology with the tn10 determinant, including the dna sequence for the repressor.

TI  == treatment of 160 cases of acute bacterial meningitis with cefotaxime.
AB  == one hundred and sixty cases of acute bacterial meningitis were treated with cefotaxime. patients were between 9 days and 79 years old: 7 new borns, 37 infants, 43 children, 19 adolescents and 54 adults. fifty-eight patients (36%) were in coma when admitted. aetiology was determined in 110 patients (68.8%): neisseria meningitidis in 42, streptococcus pneumoniae in 36, haemophilus influenzae in 16, salmonella spp. in 7, staphylococcus aureus in 2, enterobacter  spp. in 2 and haemophilus parainfluenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii and klebsiella pneumoniae in one patient each. all isolates were sensitive to cefotaxime, with mic's for 26 strains ranging from 0.01 to 0.50 mg/l. one hundred and fifty-six of the 160 patients were treated with cefotaxime alone and the four others with cefotaxime in association with an  aminoglycoside in three and rifampicin in one. cefotaxime was administered by intravenous infusion, in a daily dose 100 to 300 mg/kg. duration of treatment ranged from 8 days to 6 weeks, with a mean of 15 days. one hundred and forty-nine patients (93.1%) were cured, two after a relapse. three patients had sequelae. most (88.5%) had sterile csf within 72 h after starting treatment. eleven patients (6.9%) died, eight within the first 48 h. the only side-effects observed were mild transient eosinophilia in some patients and rash and leukopenia in 2 each. the study demonstrates that cefotaxime is effective in the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis.

TI  == the use of beta-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of septicaemia and endocarditis.
AB  == despite the availability of numerous beta-lactam antibiotics, benzylpenicillin remains the most important beta-lactam antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis. penicillin alone and in combination with an aminoglycoside is effective in the treatment of endocarditis due to all streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus aprophilus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, cardiobacterium hominis, listeria monocytogenes. oral phenoxymethylpenicillin in combination with streptomycin is effective in treating endocarditis due to viridans streptococci. ampicillin is effective in endocarditis due to haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, h. paraphrophilus, listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli. oral amoxicillin with gentamicin has been used to treat enterococcal endocarditis. the penicillinase-resistant penicillins are effective in treating s. aureus endocarditis. carbenicillin or ticarcillin in combination with tobramycin or gentamicin are used to treat endocarditis due to serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the use of piperacillin in combination with tobramycin against p. aeruginosa endocarditis has been associated with failure and increased resistance. the cephalosporins have been used to treat endocarditis caused by susceptible organisms. there have been few data on the efficacy of the newer cephalosporins in treating endocarditis. they have been used to treat septicaemia due to susceptible organisms with good results.

TI  == iga1 proteases of haemophilus influenzae: cloning and characterization in escherichia coli k-12.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae is one of several bacterial pathogens known to release iga1 proteases into the extracellular environment. each h. influenzae isolate produces one of at least three distinct types of these enzymes that differ in the specific peptide bond they cleave in the hinge region of human iga1. we have isolated the gene specifying type 1 iga1 protease from a total genomic library of h. influenzae, subcloned it into plasmid vectors, and introduced these vectors into escherichia coli k-12. the enzyme synthesized by e. coli was active and had  the same specificity as that of the h. influenzae donor. unlike that of the donor, e. coli protease activity accumulated in the periplasm rather than being transported extracellularly. the position of the protease gene in h. influenzae dna and its direction of transcription was approximated by deletion mapping. tn5  insertions, and examination of the polypeptides synthesized by minicells. a 1-kilobase probe excised from the iga1 protease gene hybridized with dna restriction fragments of all h. influenzae serogroups but not with dna of a nonpathogenic h. parainfluenzae species known to be iga1 protease negative.

TI  == molecular nature of a plasmid specifying beta-lactamase production in haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  == we characterized pjb1, the plasmid previously reported to mediate beta-lactamase  production in haemophilus ducreyi. we studied its relationship to pmr0360 and rsf0885, the plasmids responsible for beta-lactamase production in neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus parainfluenzae, respectively. although pjb1 was maintained as a multicopy pool in escherichia coli, it was not stably maintained  in the absence of antibiotic selection. electron microscope heteroduplex studies  showed that it carried 100% of the transposable ampicillin resistance sequence tna. this sequence was transposed to plasmid pub307 at a low rate. heteroduplexes between pmr0360 and pjb1 showed that they contained 3.3 megadaltons of homologous sequences. two sets of nonhomologous sequences, one a tna sequence and the other  a non-tna sequence, took the form of insertion loops. for plasmids pmr0360 and rsf0885, previously shown to be highly related, the nonhomologous sequences took  the form of a substitution loop. we concluded that all three plasmids shared major portions of their sequences but differed in discrete segments. pjb1 was the first such plasmid to have a physically and functionally intact tna sequence.

TI  == penicillinase-producing neisseria gonorrhoeae in the netherlands: epidemiology and genetic and molecular characterization of their plasmids.
AB  == penicillinase-producing neisseria gonorrhoeae strains were isolated in the netherlands with increasing frequency during the period of 1976 to 1979. about 3% of the gonococci isolated in the first half of 1979 produced penicillinase. in contrast to the period of 1976 to 1977, most penicillinase-producing n. gonorrhoeae infections during the period of 1978 to 1979 were contracted in the netherlands. the results of genetic and molecular studies on 80 penicillinase-producing n. gonorrhoeae strains were similar to earlier observations of others: resistance plasmids of only two sizes, 4.5 and 3.3 megadaltons (md), occurred in penicillinase-producing n. gonorrhoeae strains, and these encoded for the tem-1 enzyme. the 4.5-md plasmid could be transferred to escherichia coli when it coexisted with a plasmid of 24 md. the latter plasmid was present in the vast majority of the strains carrying the 4.5-md plasmid. one  strain carried a cryptic 7.5-md plasmid in addition to the commonly found 2.5-md  plasmid. two penicillinase-producing strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae isolated were found to carry a 3.3-md plasmid species which was indistinguishable from the 3.3-md gonococcal resistance plasmids. no plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid  was found in two strains of penicillinase-producing branhamella catarrhalis, and  these strains produced a penicillinase different from the tem-1 enzyme.

TI  == an eleven-base-pair sequence determines the specificity of dna uptake in haemophilus transformation.
AB  == only certain dna fragments are taken up efficiently by component haemophilus cells; this implies that efficient uptake requires the presence of a specific nucleotide sequence on the incoming dna (sisco and smith, 1979). to determine the structure of this "uptake site", we have isolated and sequenced four small fragments of cloned h. parainfluenzae dna which retain the ability to be taken up by cells. these fragments have a sequence of eleven base pairs in common, 5'-aagtgcggtca-3' and ethylation of certain phosphoryl groups in this sequence causes significant decreases in fragment uptake. we conclude that this is the sequence of the uptake site.

AB  == a 4-h micro-id technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative gram-negative rods from positive blood cultures was compared to subculture and species identification of single colonies by api 20e and micro-id, using standardized inocula. a total of 127 patients (220 positive cultures) were studied. isolates included 96 escherichia coli, 46 klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 klebsiella oxytoca, 8 enterobacter aerogenes, 17 enterobacter cloacae, 19 serratia marcescens, 2 serratia liquefaciens, 8 proteus mirabilis, 1 salmonella species, 1 morganella morganii, 6 haemophilus influenzae, 2 haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 bacteroides fragilis, 3 acinetobacter calcoaceticus biotype anitratus, and 1 pseudomonas maltophilia. in 90% of the cultures, identification  by micro-id was identical to that obtained after subculture; if the 15 non-enterobacterial isolates were excluded, the corresponding figure was 96.6%. enterobacteria identified incorrectly by direct micro-id were three s. marcescens (two identified as s. liquefaciens, one as hafnia alvei), two s. liquefaciens (both identified as e. cloacae), and two k. pneumoniae (one identified as klebsiella ozaenae, the other as serratia rubidaea). none of the 15 non-enterobacterial cultures were correctly identified by micro-id (non-identifiable, or classified as providencia/yersinia/klebsiella species). although biochemical discrepancies between direct and final micro-id tests occurred in 41% of the enterobacterial cultures, this did not seriously interfere with identification. direct species identification of enterobacteriaceae from blood cultures by direct micro-id is accurate and easily performed and identified organisms within 4 h compared to at least 24 h by most other methods; the direct  micro-id technique would be rendered even more valuable by the additional capability of identifying non-enterobacterial gram-negative isolates.

TI  == [fundamental and clinical studies of cefoperazone in children (author's transl)].
AB  == as a result of conducting experimental and clinical tests with the newly developed cephalosporin, cefoperazone (cpz), the following conclusions were obtained: (1) when tested against 10 strains of staphylococcus aureus and 16 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, the antibacterial activity of cpz was found to be weaker than that of cez. against 5 strains of a-beta-streptococcus and 4 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, both cpz and cez exhibited similar excellent antibacterial activity. cpz was effective against 18 strains of escherichia coli though its activity was influenced by the amount of inoculated bacteria present. against 15 strains of haemophilus influenzae and 10 strains of  haemophilus parahaemolyticus, cpz was found to be more effective than cez though  several high-resistant strains were noted. cpz also showed more excellent antibacterial activity than cez against 4 strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae,  5 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 strains of salmonella sp., 4 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 strains of proteus sp. (2) the mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of cpz to three children was 70 minutes. (3) one hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of  cpz to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. in one case,  the csf/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) the average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) eighteen pediatric patients received cpz in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. they were rti in 7, uri in 5, uti in 5, ssss in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. the clinical effectiveness of cpz was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. one patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. the three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis. (6) side effects were 1 case of eosinophilia, 2 cases of elevation of got and gpt, and 1 case of mild elevation of got. all were considered to be minor.

TI  == sequence-specific dna uptake in haemophilus transformation.
AB  == haemophilus cells efficiently take up haemophilus dna from the medium during transformation but do not take up other dnas. to study the mechanism of this specificity we have cloned an 8.1-kilobase (kb) fragment of h. parainfluenzae dna in the escherichia coli--pbr322 host--vector system and reisolated the dna fragment for use as a defined probe. the 5'32p end-labeled 8.1-kb dna is efficiently absorbed by competent haemophilus cells whereas vector dna present in the mixture is not, implying that the 8.1-kb dna contains sequence-specific recognition sites that are needed for dna uptake. absorbed dna can be recovered from cells as a 32p-labeled duplex of unaltered size for several minutes after uptake. we have determined the number and location of uptake sites in the 8.1-kb  dna by constructing a restriction endonuclease cleavage map and assaying fragments for uptake. only two small fragments retain the ability to be absorbed. these fragments, 120 and 140 base pairs long, are 3.8 kb apart on the 8.1-kb fragment. we assume that each of these fragments contains a short common sequence, perhaps 8--12 base pairs long, that is the actual recognition site. we  have shown by dna competition assays, with the 8.1-kb dna as a standard, that about 600 copies of the uptake sites are present in the haemophilus genome.

TI  == bactericidal factor produced by haemophilus influenzae b: partial purification of the factor and transfer of its genetic determinant.
AB  == when aerobically grown on complex media, haemophilus influenzae b and unencapsulated variants, rb strains, produced a bactericidal factor that was active against other haemophilus species and certain genera of the enterobacteriaceae. a total of 341 clinical isolates of haemophilus were tested for susceptibility to the factor. ninety-three percent of h. influenzae (nontypable), 75% of h. haemolyticus, 71% of h. parainfluenzae, and 22% of h. parahaemolyticus were susceptible. h. influenaze b strains were resistant producers of the bactericidal factor and h. influenzae f strains were susceptible nonproducers. only one strain each of h. aegyptius and h. aphrophilus was isolated and each was susceptible and resistant, respectively. 143 clinical isolates of the enterobacteriaceae were tested and of those 82% of escherichia coli, 85% of salmonella sp., and all citrobacter sp., shigella sp., and yersinia  sp. were sensitive to the bactericidal factor produced by h. influenzae b. attempts to isolate the bactericidal activity from mechanically disrupted, solubilized, or osmotically shocked cells failed to release active bactericidal factor. however, we partially purified the bactericidal factor from the spent culture medium of aerobically grown h. influenzae b by a series of extractions. the ability to produce the bactericidal factor was transferable to nonproducer strains without also genetically transforming for type b encapsulation. the converse was also true in that type b capsules were produced by transformed h. influenzae rd strains but no bactericidal factor was detected from these strains. additionally, nitrosoguanidine-induced mutants of h. influenzae b lost the ability to produce bactericidal factor without loss of their type-specific capsule, demonstrating that production of the bactericidal factor was genetically separable from production of the type capsule of h. influenzae b.

TI  == interaction of rna polymerase with promoters from bacteriophage fd.
AB  == replicative form dna of bacteriophage fd, which had been fragmented with the restriction endonuclease ii from hemophilus parainfluenzae (endo r- hpaii), was reacted with escherichia coli rna polymerase; the resulting stable preinitiation  complexes were analysed using the filter binding assay followed by gel electrophoresis. at 120mm kcl the first-order rate constants for complex decay were determined to be 10(-2)-10(-6)s-1. the second-order rate constants for complex formation were found to be about 10(6) -10(7) m-1 s-1. from these values  association constants for the individual promoters were calculated to be 2 x 10(-8) -2 x 10(-11) m-1. the rate of formation and the stability of promoter complexes was enhanced in superhelical dna. no evidence was found for stable promoter-specific closed complexes consisting of enzyme and helical dna. this and the kinetic data suggest that the unwinding of base pairs is already important early in promoter selection, and not only for the formation of the final open complex. the initiation of rna synthesis form the preinitiation complex was faster than complex dissociation and complex formation for all promoters. consequently, the initiation efficiency of a promoter is determined by the rate of complex formation, and not by its 'affinity' for the enzyme. no correlation was found between the relative order of the fd promoters for the binding and the  dissociation reaction. this is explained by different structural determinants, for the two reactions, which are located in different parts of the promoter dna.

TI  == transfer of a plasmid-specified beta-lactamase gene from haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == a number of ampicillin-resistant strains of haemophilus influenzae could donate a gene specifying the type iiia (tem) beta-lactamase to haemophilus parainfluenzae, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. donor strains rapidly lost their ability to transfer ampicillin resistance on storage or subculture. such strains  also apparently contained a single species of covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid of contour length 1.2 mum, equivalent to about 2.5 x 10(6)  daltons. no species of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid large enough to encode sex factor activity was detected. despite this, transfer occurred to several bacterial genera in the presence of deoxyribonuclease, suggesting that transmissibility was by conjugation. the beta-lactamase gene was generally unstable after transfer and was lost in the absence of selection. where stable transcipients were found, this was evidently by insertion of the beta-lactamase gene into the host chromosome. in p. aeruginosa insertion was always accompanied  by induction of auxotrophy for adenine, suggesting insertion at a specific site.  it is believed that insertion also occurred at one site on the chromosome of escherichia coli. crypticity measurements for beta-lactamase activity showed that there was little or no penetration barrier to beta-lactam drugs in haemophilus. this may explain the long delay in the acquisition of ampicillin resistance by this organism.

AB  == we studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing  with other antibiotics. beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci  are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. staph, aureus and staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin,  and no resistant strain to this drug was found. haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and h. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. escherichia coli, klebsiella, citrobacter, serratia and five species of proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. a few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in e. coli, citrobacerr, serratia, pr. morganii and pr. rettgeri. pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of proteus. antibacterial activity of gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. gentamicin-resistant strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.

TI  == human papillomavirus dna: physical map.
AB  == human papillomavirus (hpv) dna form i (supercoiled) was prepared from plantar warts. hpv dna was cleaved with restriction enzymes obtained from the following sources: escherichia coli (ecori), hemophilus influenzae strain rd (both unfractionated hind and aeparated hindii and hindiii enzymes) and hemophilus parainfluenzae (hpai). the cleavage products were analyzed by polyacrylamide gradient slab gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. hpv dna was cleaved into two fragments by ecori (87% and 13% of the genome) and into six fragments, ranging in size from 33.5 to 1.2% of the genome, by hind endonucleases. the six hind fragments result from the cleavage of three sequences recognized by hindii,  two of which are also cleaved by hpai, and of three sequence recognized by hindiii. the order of these fragments was determined by comparing their size with that of the fragments obtained with hindii, hindiii, hpai, and the mixture of hindiii + hpal. the two ecori cleavage sites were located on two adjacent hind fragments and one of these sites has been taken for the zero point to construct a physical map. the treatment of superhelical hpv dna with bacteriophage t4 gene 32 protein yields circular structures with a denaturation loop. the cleavage of these complexes with ecori and hindiii has shown two easily denatured regions which were located on the cleavage map.

TI  == mapping of cleavage sites for restriction endonucleases in lambdadv plasmids.
AB  == restriction nucleases from escherichia coli carrying the resistance transfer factor ri, from hemophilus influenzae, hemophilus parainfluenzae, and bacillus subtilis were used for the generation of specific dna fragments from lambdadv plasmids. cleavage maps were established for various plasmids containing different but overlapping parts of bacteriophage lambdadna by analysis of digestion patterns obtained in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the correlation between the plasmid cleavage maps and the genetic map of lambda was based upon the location of the ecori cleavage site at 81.3% of lambda fractional  length and the position of promoters pl and pr on the plasmid dna fragments.

TI  == adenovirus transcription. ii. rna sequences complementary to simian virus 40 and  adenovirus 2dna in ad2+nd1- and ad2+nd3-infected cells.
AB  == the genomes of the two nondefective adenovirus 2/simian virus 40 (ad2/sv 40) hybrid viruses, nondefective ad2/sv 40 hybrid virus 1 (ad2+nd1) and nondefective  hybrid virus 3 (ad2+nd3), were formed by a deletion of about 5% of ad2 dna and insertion of part of the sv40 genome. we have compared the cytoplasmic rna synthesized during both the early and late stages of lytic infection of human cells by these hybrid viruses to that expressed in ad2-infected and sv40-infected cells. separated strands of the six fragments of 32p-labeled ad2 dna produced by  cleavage with the restriction endonuclease ecori (isolated from escherichia coli) and the four fragments of 32p-labeled sv40 dna produced by cleavage with both a restriction nuclease isolated from haemophilus parainfluenzae, hpa1, and ecori were prepared by electrophoresis of denatured dna in agarose gels. the fraction of each fragment strand expressed as cytoplasmic rna was determined by annealing  fragmented 32p-labeled strands to an excess of cellular rna extracted from infected cells. the segment of ad2 dna deleted from both hybrid virus genomes is  transcribed into cytoplasmic mrna during the early phase of ad2 infection. hence, we suggest that ad2 codes for at least one "early" gene product which is nonessential for virus growth in cell culture. in both early ad2+nd1 and ad2+nd3-infected cells, 1,000 bases of ad2 dna adjacent to the integrated sv40 sequences are expressed as cytoplasmic rna but are not similarly expressed in early ad2-infected cells. the 3' termini of this early hybrid virus rna maps in the vicinity of 0.18 on the conventional sv40 map and probably terminates at the  same position as early lytic sv40 cytoplasmic rna. therefore, the base sequence in this region of sv40 dna specifies the 3' termini of early messenger rna present in both hybrid virus and sv40-infected cells.

TI  == r-factor mediated beta-lactamase production by haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == production of beta-lactamase by 15 strains of haemophilus influenzae has been investigated. all the strains produce a constitutive beta-lactamase, which readily hydrolyses penicillin g, ampicillin, and cephaloridine. the beta-lactamase produced by these strains is indistinguishable from the type-iiia  enzyme commonly found in strains of escherichia coli. the beta-lactamase gene has been transferred from the enzyme-producing strains of haemophilus to strains of h. parainfluenzae and a strain of e. coli.

TI  == specificity in deoxyribonucleic acid uptake by transformable haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == cells of haemophilus influenzae strain rd competent for genetic transformation irreversibly bound approximately five molecular fragments of h. influenzae deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) per cell; under identical conditions, dna derived from escherichia coli b was not taken up (<1 molecule per 50 cells). similarly, dna from xenopus laevis was not taken up by competent h. influenzae. of the heterologous dnas tested, only dna from h. parainfluenzae interfered with the uptake of h. influenzae dna, as judged by competition experiments employing either dna binding or genetic transformation as the test system. the extracellular heterologous dna did not suffer either single- or double-strand breakage upon exposure to competent h. influenzae.

TI  == polyoma dna: a physical map.
AB  == the action of restriction enzymes on polyoma dna was studied with uniformly (32)p-labeled viral dna obtained from either infected 3t6 or secondary mouse-embryo cells. three restriction enzymes were used to construct a physical map of the polyoma genome. an enzyme from hemophilus parainfluenzae, hpa(ii), cleaved polyma dna into eight unique fragments (hpa(ii)-1 to hpa(ii)-8), ranging  in size from 27.3 to 1.8% of the genome. an enzyme from hemophilus influenzae, hin(iii), gave two fragments (56 and 44%); and a third enzyme from escherichia coli, ecor(i), cut at a single unique site. the physical map of the polyma genome was constructed from methods involving: (1) further digestion of the fragments produced by enzymes ecor(i) and hin(iii) with hpa(ii), and (2) analysis of the products of partial digestion with hpa(ii). analysis by electron microscopy of replicating dna molecules (less than 50% replicated) cut with the hin(iii) enzyme, in combination with other studies, has indicated that the origin of dna replication is located at 71 +/- 3 map units from the ecor(i) cleavage site, probably in hpa(ii)-5.

TI  == comparison of jc and bk human papovaviruses with simian virus 40: restriction endonuclease digestion and gel electrophoresis of resultant fragments.
AB  == jc virus was found to have a buoyant density of 1.20 g/cm(3) in linear sucrose-d(2)o and 1.35 g/cm(3) in cesium chloride isopycnic gradients. dna extracted either from jc-infected cultures or from gradient-purified virions occupied a dense position relative to linear dna in cesium chloride/ethidium bromide gradients, and the circular configuration of the extracted dna was confirmed by electron microscopy, with a measured molecular weight of 2.93 x 10(6). dna from bk virus was similarly prepared and compared to jc and to an sv40 dna standard by digestion with restriction endonuclease preparations from haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and escherichia coli. digests were electrophoretically analyzed on gradient polyacrylamide slab gels or agarose gels, and the three viruses were found to have distinctly different cleavage patterns by this form of analysis: jc and bk viruses were almost entirely different from sv40 and significantly different from each other. thus, jc and bk  human papovaviruses appear to be discrete new members of the papovavirus group, rather than sv40 variants.

TI  == method for isolating mutants overproducing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and  its precursors.
AB  == a procedure has been developed for isolating mutants which are defective with respect to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad) metabolism. it is based on the well known v-factor requirement of haemophilus parainfluenzae. this procedure was used to isolate a series of mutants from escherichia coli. the pyridine metabolism of wild-type and mutant e. coli cells falls in one of four distinct classes. class a includes wild-type e. coli and represents strains that are normal with respect to pyridine metabolism. class b mutants have altered internal pools of nad. the intracellular nad concentration of different class b mutants varies over a 10-fold range. class c mutants excrete pyridine mononucleotides, and class d mutants excrete nad. the production of pyridine nucleotides by class  c and d mutants exceeds that of wild-type e. coli by a factor of at least ten. the mutant strains generally have normal generation times and achieve normal cell densities in minimal medium.

TI  == cardiolipin-specific phospholipase d of haemophilus parainfluenzae. ii. characteristics and possible significance.
AB  == a phospholipase specific for cardiolipin (cl) was found in the membrane of haemophilus parainfluenzae. the enzyme hydrolyzed cl to phosphatidic acid (pa) and phosphatidylglycerol (pg), indicating that it was a phospholipase d (an enzyme activity believed to be confined to higher plants). in addition to its substrate specificity, this enzyme was unusual in its requirement for mg(2+) (k(m) of 1.3 mm) for maximal activity and its inhibition by chelating agents, heavy metals, some detergents, and organic solvents. when inhibitors of phospholipase activity were added to the growth medium, cl accumulated and pg disappeared in the membrane, suggesting that the phospholipase d was active in vivo. the activity of phospholipase d in cell-free homogenates was greater than expected from earlier studies of cl metabolism and greater than the other phospholipase activities detected in the homogenate. the high activity of the cl-specific phospholipase d suggests there might be a very active degradation of  cl to pg and pa and an active resynthesis of cl from the hydrolysis products.

TI  == genetic integration in the heterospecific transformation of haemophilus influenzae cells by haemophilus parainfluenzae deoxyribonucleic acid.
AB  == the in vivo chemical linkage of haemophilus parainfluenzae deoxyribonucleic acid  (dna) with the h. influenzae genome has been found to occur at a much higher level than is suggested by the low efficiency of the heterospecific transformation of an antibiotic resistance marker. this linkage, about 60% of the level with homospecific dna, was found to involve alkali-stable bonding. the amount of host dna label released (about 60%) was about the same as that released during homospecific transformation. also, over 60% of the h. influenzae cells adsorbing h. parainfluenzae dna could not form colonies upon plating. this lethality of the heterospecific transformation was not immediate but followed considerable metabolic activity of the host cells. these data are presented to show that the "limited-pairing" hypothesis may be only a partial explanation for  the low efficiency of heterospecific transformation. another hypothesis is presented which takes into account the lethal effect of this kind of transformation.
