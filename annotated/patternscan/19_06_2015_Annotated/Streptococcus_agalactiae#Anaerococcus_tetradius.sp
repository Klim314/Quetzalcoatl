TI  == efficacy and safety of intravenous azithromycin followed by oral azithromycin for the treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease and perihepatitis in japanese  women.
AB  == pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) is mainly caused by ascending infection from the vaginal flora including the sexually transmitted organisms, neisseria gonorrhoeae and chlamydia trachomatis, and lower genital tract endogenous anaerobes, leading to serious consequences including infertility and ectopic pregnancy. to evaluate the efficacy and safety of azithromycin in the treatment of pid that requires initial intravenous therapy, we conducted a multicenter, unblinded, non-comparative phase 3 trial. intravenous azithromycin (500 mg, once  daily) for 1 or 2 days followed by oral azithromycin (250 mg once daily) to complete a total of 7 days treatment was administered to 60 japanese women with acute pid. the clinical and bacteriological responses were assessed at the end of treatment, and on days 15 and 29. the most commonly detected baseline causative pathogens were c. trachomatis (12 strains), prevotella bivia (10 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (7 strains), n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (6 strains each). the clinical success rate on day 15 was 94.1% (48/51 subjects including perihepatitis). the clinical efficacy and bacterial eradication rates against c. trachomatis and n. gonorrhoeae (including 2 quinolone-resistant strains) were both 100%. common treatment-related adverse events were diarrhoea, injection site pain, and nausea. all adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. azithromycin intravenous-to-oral switch therapy demonstrated excellent clinical and bacteriological effects for pid caused by various etiologic agents including quinolone-resistant strains and strains with low susceptibility to azithromycin at in vitro testing. the therapy was well tolerated in the treatment of pid in japanese women. registration number: nct00871494.

TI  == enteral tube feeding alters the oral indigenous microbiota in elderly adults.
AB  == enteral tube feeding is widely used to maintain nutrition for elderly adults with eating difficulties, but its long-term use alters the environment of the oral ecosystem. this study characterized the tongue microbiota of tube-fed elderly adults by analyzing the 16s rrna gene. the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) profiles of 44 tube-fed subjects were compared with those of 54 subjects fed orally (average age, 86.4 +/- 6.9 years). bar-coded pyrosequencing data were also obtained for a subset of the subjects from each group (15 tube-fed subjects and 16 subjects fed orally). the t-rflp profiles demonstrated that the microbiota of the tube-fed subjects was distinct from that  of the subjects fed orally (permutational multivariate analysis of variance [permanova], p < 0.001). the pyrosequencing data revealed that 22 bacterial genera, including corynebacterium, peptostreptococcus, and fusobacterium, were significantly more predominant in tube-fed subjects, whereas the dominant genera  in the subjects fed orally, such as streptococcus and veillonella, were present in much lower proportions. opportunistic pathogens rarely detected in the normal  oral microbiota, such as corynebacterium striatum and streptococcus agalactiae, were often found in high proportions in tube-fed subjects. the oral indigenous microbiota is disrupted by the use of enteral feeding, allowing health-threatening bacteria to thrive.

TI  == a case of necrotizing fasciitis due to streptococcus agalactiae, arcanobacterium  haemolyticum, and finegoldia magna in a dog-bitten patient with diabetes.
AB  == we report a case of necrotizing fasciitis involving streptococcus agalactiae, arcanobacterium haemolyticum, and finegoldia magna in a 36-yr-old female diabetic patient, which started after a minor dog bite to the toe of the patient. this case suggested that a trivial infection after a minor dog bite in an immunocompromised patient such as diabetes patient could result in a significant  complication such as necrotizing fasciitis. the life-threatening infection was cured by timely above-the-knee amputation, as well as penicillin g and clindamycin therapy.

TI  == a retrospective analysis of isolates from patients with vaginitis in a private greek obstetric/gynecological hospital (2003-2006).
AB  == background: vaginitis is a common cause of complaints in women in various parts of the world. through our literature search, we identified noteworthy differences in the etiology of vaginitis based on the geographic location. this study was conducted to describe microbial etiology in a population of symptomatic women with vaginitis in greece. material/methods: data for pathogens isolated from cultures of vaginal fluid specimens or identified with microscopy testing of such specimens of women with symptomatic vaginitis who were examined at "lito" private obstetric/gynecological hospital, athens, greece, during the period 1/2003-12/2006 were analyzed retrospectively. results: during this period, 1632 women were examined. the mean age of the patients was 28 years, ranging from 18 to 57 years. three hundred and eighty five from 1632 cultures/tests contributed no pathogen, whereas 1247/1632 cultures/tests were positive. of the isolates, in  which twelve species were identified, 504 (40.4%) were gardnerella vaginalis, 530 (42.5%) candida spp, and 101 (8.1%) trichomonas vaginalis. less usual isolates were escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus spp., streptococcus viridans, staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococcus spp., and staphylococcus saprophyticus. conclusions: the authors believe that this study adds to the relevant literature of information regarding the pathogens implicated in patients with symptomatic vaginitis by reporting data from a cohort of patients in greece. ninety-one percent of the isolated and identified pathogens from vaginal cultures of symptomatic greek women included candida albicans, gardnerella vaginalis, and  trichomonas vaginalis, with the first two species representing the great majority.

TI  == identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of micro-organisms recovered from cutaneous lesions of human american tegumentary leishmaniasis in minas gerais, brazil.
AB  == an evaluation of the microbiota present in cutaneous ulcers from 31 patients with a clinical and parasitological diagnosis of american tegumentary leishmaniasis (atl) was carried out by the standard filter paper disc technique, including antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacterial isolates. microbial examination indicated that 21 patients (67.7%) were contaminated with one to four bacteria and some of them also with yeast. a total of 142 micro-organisms were isolated. staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently recovered bacterium (95.2% of positive patients) and was found to produce type b (70% of the staphylococcal isolates) and type c (50%) enterotoxins as well as toxic shock syndrome toxin (60%). proteus mirabilis (33.3% of the positive patients), streptococcus pyogenes (19.0 %), h(2)s-negative proteus species (19.0%), klebsiella oxytoca (14.3%), enterobacter species (9.5%), peptostreptococcus species (9.5%), pseudomonas species (4.8%), prevotella bivia (4.8%), escherichia coli (4.8%), streptococcus agalactiae (4.8%), bacteroides fragilis (4.8%), candida albicans (9.5%) and candida tropicalis (4.8%) were also isolated. surprisingly, staph. aureus isolates were susceptible to almost all tested drugs, although some of them were  resistant to penicillin (69%) and ampicillin + sulbactam (68%). concerning obligate anaerobes, all the gram-negative isolates (25% of the total) were resistant to metronidazole. the results of the present study show that microbial  secondary contaminants, particularly staph. aureus, should be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of atl lesions.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the  clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis  (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective  on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop  against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity  of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae,  was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or  cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and  penicillins. a total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa),  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, and peptostreptococcus spp. czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases  in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin.
AB  == background: telithromycin is one of the ketolides, characterised by a 3-keto group instead of l-cladinose and a c(11)-c(12) carbamate link by an alkyl chain to a pyridinum and imidazolium ring side chain. we evaluated in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin against gynaecological pathogens. methods: in the vitro study, the antibacterial activity of telithromycin against  180 isolates (isolated in the year 2000) of streptococcus agalactiae (n = 33), enterococcus faecalis (n = 22), neisseria gonorrhoeae (n = 30), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (n = 20), finegoldia magna (n = 20), bacteroides fragilis (n = 25) and prevotella bivia (n = 30) was compared with that of erythromycin a, clarithromycin, azithromycin, ampicillin and levofloxacin. in the in vivo study, the efficacy of telithromycin was evaluated using experimental intra-abdominal abscesses in mice caused by b. fragilis (minimum inhibitory concentration of telithromycin 0.5 mg/l). results: in the in vitro study, telithromycin inhibited more than 50% of clinical isolates of s. agalactiae, e. faecalis, n. gonorrhoeae, p. anaerobius, f. magna, b. fragilis and p. bivia at concentrations of 0.016, 0.063, 0.063, 0.032, 0.032, 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. telithromycin inhibited more than 90% of these clinical isolates at concentrations of 0.016, 4, 0.125, 0.063, 0.063, 4 and 1 mg/l, respectively. in the in vivo study, telithromycin inhibited abscess formation and significantly decreased viable cell counts in abscesses in comparison with the untreated group. conclusions: these in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities suggest that telithromycin could be a potential candidate for the treatment of bacterial infections complicated by chlamydial infection.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime against clinical isolates in 2000 and 2001].
AB  == as the post-marketing surveillance of cefpodoxime proxetil (banan), mics of cefpodoxime (cpdx, an active form of banan) against 1090 clinical isolates of 22  species from 15 medical institutions all over japan from june 2000 to march 2001  were measured using the broth microdilution method approved by the japanese society of chemotherapy and compared with those of oral cephem antibacterials, cefaclor, cefdinir, cefditoren, and cefcapene. in this study, remarkable change in the activity of cpdx was observed in streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus  influenzae compared with the susceptibility in the studies before banan was launched. this cause is considered to be the increase in the incidence of the following resistant strains: penicillin-intermediate s. pneumoniae (47.3%), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp, 15.1%), and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (blnar) h. influenzae (24.0%), which were scarcely isolated  in 1989 when banan was launched. other tested drugs also exhibited low activity against these resistant strains. however, cpdx showed comparatively good activity with mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml against prsp. against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and moraxella catarrhalis, cpdx also showed comparatively good activity with mic90 of < or = 4 micrograms/ml, which was almost equal to that in the studies before its  marketing. against quinolones-resistant neisseria gonorrhoeae, cpdx showed excellent activity with mic90 of 0.5 microgram/ml. against members of the family  enterobacteriaceae except for citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii, cpdx showed good activity. however, in escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. proteus spp., and providencia spp., there are some high-resistant strains to all tested drugs including cpdx. against peptostreptococcus spp., mic90 of cpdx was 8 micrograms/ml and its mic range was  widely distributed from 0.03 to 32 micrograms/ml, which were similar to those in  the studies before its marketing. in this study, cpdx showed the decrease in the  activity against several species as did other drugs tested, but against most of species tested, cpdx maintained good activity. furthermore, it is necessary to pay much attention to the trend of resistant strains.

TI  == vaginal bacterial flora activates rat peritoneal mast cells.
AB  == sixteen strains of physiological and pathological vaginal bacteria were tested for their ability to secrete histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. we noticed that mycoplasma hominis-induced histamine release was very high (up to 53.6%). the stimulation of rat mast cells with staphylococccus cohnii, staphylococcus coagulase(-) (two strains), ureaplasma urealyticum, peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides capillosus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae resulted in lower but significant histamine secretion (11.2%-17.5%). other bacteria strains (staphylococcus epidermidids, enterococcus  faecalis, escherichia coli, actinomyces naeslundii (two strains) and lactobacillus fermentum (two strains) caused very low (4.2% - 8.8%) histamine release.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic effect of lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == objective: to assess antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. study design: antagonistic activity of different lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for  infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. the activity was tested against test organisms associated with  bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and prevotella bivia. results: many of the 146 lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as s aureus and  e coli, and a marked number of lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes p anaerobius and p bivia. only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of e faecalis and s agalactiae. indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. the specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. conclusion: lactobacillus strains taken  from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. the specific occurrence rates of active lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new injectable carbapenem, s-4661, against gynaecological pathogens.
AB  == carbapenems are often used to treat infections in obstetrics and gynaecology because of their activity against anaerobes. s-4661, a new injectable carbapenem  antibiotic, has favourable pharmacokinetic properties and is not hydrolysed by dehydropeptidase i. we investigated the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of s-4661 against strains of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia, which are major pathogens in the fields of obstetrics and gynaecology. the mic(50) and  mic(90) of s-4661 for these strains were 0.25 and 1 mg/l, respectively. the in vivo efficacy of s-4661 was evaluated in a rat model of intrauterine infection, namely pyometra caused by e. coli and b. fragilis. the accumulation of neutrophils in the uterus in the s-4661-treated group was less marked and the number of bacteria significantly lower than those in the untreated group. these results suggest that s-4661 may be useful for treating polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynaecology.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of biapenem in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == biapenem is a new injectable carbapenem antibiotic which has favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and is stable to hydrolysis by dehydropeptidase i. biapenem inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. the mic(90) of biapenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa was lower than that of panipenem, equivalent to that of imipenem, and greater than that of meropenem. the in vivo efficacy of biapenem was evaluated using the experimental infection model of uterine endometritis. the accumulation of neutrophils in the uterus in the biapenem- treated group was less marked than in the nontreated group, as well as bacteriological response. these results suggest that the new antimicrobial agent  biapenem might be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.

AB  == presence of microorganisms in the female lower genital tract (lgt) in concentrations that modify the established normal equilibrium produce different symptoms that make necessary to consult the gynecologist. it is currently accepted that infections of the lgt are due to microorganisms that are normally integrating the internal flora, except for the erroneously called "sexually transmitted diseases" that are caused by external microorganisms. this means that all those microorganisms usually present without causing any disease manifestations may, under certain circumstances and determined concentrations, originate or be associated to infections. lactobacillus sp. and corynebacterium sp. are normally the most frequent microorganisms in the vagina together with streptococcus (aerobe), streptococcus agalactiae and others like enterococcus, peptostreptococcus, bacteroides sp., bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, pseudomonas, klebsiella, fusobacterium, escherichia coli. different antibiotic schemes are proposed for different infections (bacterial vaginosis, gonococcia, chlamydial infections, pelvic inflammatory disease). they  are discussed in different sections. trovafloxacin has shown to be effective in the treatment of infections due to chlamydia with excellent clinical results and  a good tolerance. it was effective as single dose therapy in the treatment of acute gonococcia with therapeutic success in 99% of the treated patients. new fluoroquinolones are also effective in the treatment of infections due to aerobial pathogens. the use of trovafloxacin in the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease would present great advantages: on one hand, it would cover  the wide spectrum of microorganisms responsible for the infection and, on the other, would permit an early switch to oral therapy once the acute phase is over.

TI  == in vitro activities of pazufloxacin, a novel injectable quinolone, against bacteria causing infections in obstetric and gynecological patients.
AB  == t-3762 is an injectable new quinolone with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. pazufloxacin (t-3761) is an active form of t-3762. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of pazufloxacin for 50% of the clinical isolates tested were 3.13 microg/ml for streptococcus agalactiae, 6.25 microg/ml for gardnerella vaginalis, 0.025 microg/ml for escherichia coli, 0.78 microg/ml for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6.25 microg/ml for peptostreptococcus magnus, 6.25 microg/ml for bacteroides fragilis and 12.5 microg/ml for prevotella bivia. the mics of t-3762 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 3.13 microg/ml for s. agalactiae, 6.25 microg/ml for g. vaginalis, 0.10 microg/ml for e. coli, 12.5 microg/ml for p. aeruginosa, 25 microg/ml for p. magnus, 12.5 microg/ml for b. fragilis and 25 microg/ml for p. bivia. the results of this study suggest that, subject to confirmation by clinical trials, t-3762, in combination with an agent  with reliable activity against anaerobic bacteria, is suitable as an empirical therapy of patients with obstetric and gynecological infections.

TI  == in vitro activities of e1101, a novel oral cephalosporin, against bacteria causing infections in obstetric and gynecological patients.
AB  == e1101 is a new oral cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. it inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli and peptostreptococcus magnus at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. e1101 was the most active agent against s. agalactiae and e. coli.  since none of the compounds was sufficiently active against the bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia isolates, they are not appropriate in the treatment of patients with infections caused by these organisms. the results of this study  suggest that, subject to confirmation by clinical trials, e1101, in combination with an agent with reliable activity against anaerobic bacteria, is suitable as empirical therapy of patients with obstetric and gynecological infections.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of am-1155 in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == am-1155 is a new 8-methoxyquinolonecarboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. it inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. the  antibacterial activity of am-1155 was almost equal to that of sparfloxacin. the in vivo efficacy of am-1155 was evaluated using a polymicrobial pyometra (e. coli and b. fragilis) model of rats. the accumulation of neutrophils to the uterus in  the am-1155-treated group was less marked than that of the nontreated group, as well as the bacteriological response. these results suggest that the new antimicrobial agent am-1155 might be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.

TI  == [trend of bacterial meningitis in children over a 14 year period (1981 through 1994) in japan--an analysis based on studies in 27 institutions].
AB  == we observed 266 children with purulent meningitis in 27 institutions in japan during the 14 years from 1981 on dividing these years into 3 periods, 1981-1985,  1986-1990 and 1991-1994, and studied the trend of causative organisms identified  in 254 among the 266 patients. their ages were less than 3 months after birth in  50 children and 3 months or older in 216: there were 141 boys and 125 girls. the  causative organisms were h. influenzae in 134 patients and s. pneumoniae in 50, most of them being aged 3 months or older. next to the above bacteria ranked s. agalactiae in 29 and e. coli in 12, many of the patients were aged less than 3 months. staphylococcus spp. was found in 7 patients and about 70% of them were aged 3 months or older. l. monocytogenes was found in 4 patients and n. meningitidis in 3 and they were aged 3 months or older in both patient groups. s. pyogenes, enterococcus spp., peptostreptococcus spp., p. mirabilis and enterobacter spp. were detected each in 1 patient. the causative organism was unknown in 21 patients and there was no double infection. h. influenzae were detected in 18 patients in 1981-1985 period (36.7%), in 56 in 1986-1990 (54.9%) and in 60 in 1991-1994 (63.8%) showing an increasing tendency, but s. pneumoniae  exhibited neither an increasing nor decreasing tendency. there was a decreasing tendency with s. agalactiae and e. coli, but the details were not clear because there were few patients aged less than 3 months. although the period of coexistence of 4 main bacterial species was not made clear in this study. listeria is considered to develop mainly in the early childhood, and we believe that the conventional way of using a cephem preparation and ampicillin combined for patients under 6 years need not be altered. however, panipenem (phonetic) is  likely to be effective for insensible s. pneumoniae for the time being.

TI  == tissue penetration of meropenem in patients undergoing gynecologic surgery.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess the tissue-penetrating ability of a new beta-lactam antibiotic, meropenem, in 64 patients undergoing elective gynecologic surgery. patients received a single 500-mg dose intravenously before surgery. plasma and tissue concentrations of meropenem were highest at approximately 1 hour, and good tissue penetration was seen in the variety of specimens evaluated. the median plasma concentration at approximately 1 hour was 13.3 micrograms/ml. the median fluid and tissue concentrations at approximately 1 hour were as follows: cervix, 8.5 micrograms/g; endometrium, 2.3 micrograms/g; fallopian tube, 1.9 micrograms/g; myometrium, 3.6 micrograms/g; ovary, 2.3 micrograms/g; and uterus, 2.3 micrograms/g. these tissue concentrations exceed the mics of meropenem for 90% of typical pathogens associated with gynecologic infections. meropenem readily penetrates gynecologic tissue. a single 500-mg dose provides adequate tissue concentrations for treatment of gynecologic infections caused by  susceptible pathogens.

TI  == bacteriological epidemiology and treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == one hundred symptomatic women with clinical bacterial vaginosis (bv) were enrolled in this study. the bacteriological epidemiology of bv and efficacy of oral or vaginal administration of antimicrobial agents for treatment of bv were investigated. the epidemiology of bv was investigated before antimicrobial therapy. fifty patients were treated with oral administration of metronidazole (mtn), 500 mg twice a day, and 50 patients with 2% clindamycin (cldm) phosphate in a vaginal cream, 5 g once a day for 7 days. the major organisms occurring were streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus species, bacteroides species, prevotella species, and mobiluncus species and opportunistic pathogens such as staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis. the therapeutic efficacy of cldm cream on bv appeared  to be preferable to oral mtn from clinical and bacteriological aspects. the clinical and bacteriological effectiveness of mtn and cldm in the treatment of bv suggests that anaerobes might play a major role in causing the clinical symptoms  in patients with bv.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of rokitamycin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == we obtained bacterial strains which were clinically isolated and identified from  outpatients with various infections in medical institutions throughout japan. possible antibacterial activities of rokitamycin (rkm) were examined against these isolates. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined through  a comparative study with reference drugs. the results of the study are summarized as follows. 1. resistance patterns of 400 isolates which were highly resistant to macrolides (mls) with mic values > 100 micrograms/ml were classified into 55 patterns. staphylococcus spp. showed cross resistance to 14-membered ring mls with 100% cross resistance observed between erythromycin (em) and clarithromycin  (cam), and 85.2% between em and oleandomycin (ol). fewer isolates showed strong resistance to 16-membered ring mls than to 14-membered ring mls. cross resistances observed among the staphylococcus isolates were 100% between acetylmidecamycin (mdm-ac) and kitasamycin (leucomycin (lm)), 93.9% between mdm-ac and josamycin (jm), and 53.3% between mdm-ac and rkm. streptococcus spp. and peptococcus spp. showed very similar resistance patterns to both 14- and 16-membered ring mls, but resistance patterns to rkm were quite different. most of anaerobic streptococci and bacteroides fragilis group had similar resistance patterns to 14- and 16-membered ring mls, but in some cases a pattern similar to  that of staphylococcus spp. was observed. 2. when ml-resistant bacteria isolated  during 1975 to 1980 were compared to those isolated in 1986 and 1989, it was observed that resistance of staphylococcus aureus remained almost unchanged, that of streptococcus pyogenes was lower in the later years than during 1975 to 1980,  but that of streptococcus pneumoniae increased. 3. most of ml-resistances of the  resistant isolates were inducible, but extents of induction varied depending on drugs tested. strong inductions were observed when 14-membered ring mls were used, but inductions were minimal with 16-membered ring mls. rkm appeared to induce resistance to the least extent. from these results, it appears that the rkm is quite useful clinically even in the 1990s.
