TI  == dynamics and diversity of the 'atopobium cluster' in the human faecal microbiota, and phenotypic characterization of 'atopobium cluster' isolates.
AB  == this study monitored the dynamics and diversity of the human faecal 'atopobium cluster' over a 3-month period using a polyphasic approach. fresh faecal samples  were collected fortnightly from 13 healthy donors (six males and seven females) aged between 26 and 61 years. fish was used to enumerate total (eub338mix) and 'atopobium cluster' (ato291) bacteria, with counts ranging between 1.12x10(11) and 9.95x10(11), and 1.03x10(9) and 1.16x10(11) cells (g dry weight faeces)(-1),  respectively. the 'atopobium cluster' population represented 0.2-22 % of the total bacteria, with proportions donor-dependent. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) using 'atopobium cluster'-specific primers demonstrated faecal populations of these bacteria were relatively stable, with bands identified as collinsella aerofaciens, collinsella intestinalis/collinsella stercoris, collinsella tanakaei, coriobacteriaceae sp. peav3-3, eggerthella lenta, gordonibacter pamelaeae, olsenella profusa, olsenella uli and paraeggerthella hongkongensis in the dgge profiles of individuals. colony pcr was used to identify 'atopobium cluster' bacteria isolated from faeces (n = 224 isolates). 16s rrna gene sequence analysis of isolates demonstrated collinsella aerofaciens represented the predominant (88 % of isolates) member of the 'atopobium cluster' found in human faeces, being found in nine individuals. eggerthella lenta was identified in three individuals (3.6 % of isolates). isolates of collinsella tanakaei, an 'enorma' sp. and representatives of novel species belonging to the 'atopobium cluster' were also identified in the study. phenotypic characterization of the isolates demonstrated their highly saccharolytic nature and heterogeneous phenotypic profiles, and 97 % of the isolates displayed lipase activity.

TI  == functional metagenomics reveals novel salt tolerance loci from the human gut microbiome.
AB  == metagenomics is a powerful tool that allows for the culture-independent analysis  of complex microbial communities. one of the most complex and dense microbial ecosystems known is that of the human distal colon, with cell densities reaching  up to 10(12) per gram of faeces. with the majority of species as yet uncultured,  there are an enormous number of novel genes awaiting discovery. in the current study, we conducted a functional screen of a metagenomic library of the human gut microbiota for potential salt-tolerant clones. using transposon mutagenesis, three genes were identified from a single clone exhibiting high levels of identity to a species from the genus collinsella (closest relative being collinsella aerofaciens) (colaer_01955, colaer_01957 and colaer_01981), a high g+c, gram-positive member of the actinobacteria commonly found in the human gut.  the encoded proteins exhibit a strong similarity to gale, murb and mazg. furthermore, pyrosequencing and bioinformatic analysis of two additional fosmid clones revealed the presence of an additional gale and mazg gene, with the highest level of genetic identity to akkermansia muciniphila and eggerthella sp.  yy7918, respectively. cloning and heterologous expression of the genes in the osmosensitive strain, escherichia coli mkh13, resulted in increased salt tolerance of the transformed cells. it is hoped that the identification of atypical salt tolerance genes will help to further elucidate novel salt tolerance mechanisms, and will assist our increased understanding how resident bacteria cope with the osmolarity of the gastrointestinal tract.
