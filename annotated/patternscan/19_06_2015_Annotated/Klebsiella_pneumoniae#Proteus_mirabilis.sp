TI  == susceptibility trends and molecular characterization of gram-negative bacilli associated with urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections in jordan and lebanon: smart 2011-2013.
AB  == objectives: to investigate phenotypic and genotypic patterns of antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative bacilli associated with urinary tract infection (uti) and intra-abdominal infection (iai) in medical centres of jordan and lebanon. methods: gram-negative bacilli from the smart study, collected between the years 2011 and 2013, were first identified at local laboratories. these isolates were shipped to a central laboratory where re-identification, susceptibility testing, and molecular characterization were performed using standard methods. results: among the 523 uti-associated isolates, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis were the most frequent (70%, 14%, and 5%, respectively). e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most frequent species among the 527 iai-associated isolates (46%, 14%, and 12%, respectively). incidence rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers among uti-associated e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis were 43%, 54%, and 4%, respectively. corresponding rates among iai-associated isolates were 49%, 56%, and 12%, respectively. acinetobacter baumannii and p. aeruginosa isolates showed very disturbing low susceptibility patterns. ctx-m-15  was the most prevalent esbl produced. seventeen isolates were non-susceptible to  carbapenems (estimated prevalence of 1.6%). conclusions: the alarmingly high rates of esbl production and emergence of carbapenemases emphasize the urgent need to develop antimicrobial stewardship initiatives and to maintain antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems.

TI  == carriage rates and characteristics of enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in healthy individuals: comparison of applicants for long-term care and individuals screened for employment purposes.
AB  == aims: we compared the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers in the faecal samples of 1,109 healthy individuals screened for employment purposes and in 531 asymptomatic individuals applying for long-term care (ltc). methods: eosin-methylene blue agar plates supplemented with 2 mg/l cefotaxime were used to determine which individuals were esbl producers. esbl phenotype was confirmed by double-disk synergy test and esbl genes were identified by sequencing. esbl producers were characterized by co-resistance and  integron carriage. results: esbl producers were more frequent in the ltc applicants than in the employment screening individuals (7.2 vs. 2.0%; p < 0.0001), with 43 escherichia coli, 18 klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 klebsiella oxytoca and 1 proteus mirabilis being found. in the employment screening individuals, only e. coli was found. most esbl genes (79.4%, 50/63) were blactx-m type; blactx-m-15 was more frequent in the ltc applicants (p < 0.001). regarding esbl genes and integron diversity, e. coli isolates from the ltc applicants were more  similar to k. pneumoniae than to e. coli from the employment screening individuals. conclusion: these differences in the characteristics of esbl producers may represent different sources of colonization. most ltc applicants harboured k. pneumoniae or e. coli that were probably hospital-acquired whereas the e. coli isolates of many healthy individuals showed similarities to environmental e. coli.

TI  == urinary tract infections: epidemiology, mechanisms of infection and treatment options.
AB  == urinary tract infections (utis) are a severe public health problem and are caused by a range of pathogens, but most commonly by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus saprophyticus. high recurrence rates and increasing antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens threaten to greatly increase the economic burden of these infections. in this review, we discuss how basic science studies are elucidating  the molecular details of the crosstalk that occurs at the host-pathogen interface, as well as the consequences of these interactions for the pathophysiology of utis. we also describe current efforts to translate this knowledge into new clinical treatments for utis.

TI  == ceftazidime-avibactam activity tested against enterobacteriaceae isolates from u.s. hospitals (2011 to 2013) and characterization of beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) inhibited 99.9% (20,698/20,709) of enterobacteriaceae isolates at </=8 mug/ml. this compound was  active against resistant subsets, including ceftazidime-nonsusceptible enterobacter cloacae (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mug/ml) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) phenotype isolates. an esbl phenotype was noted among 12.4% (1,696/13,692 isolates from targeted species) of the isolates, including 776 escherichia coli (12.0% for this species; mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), 721 klebsiella pneumoniae (16.3%; mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), 119 klebsiella oxytoca (10.3%; mic50/90, 0.06/0.25 mug/ml), and 80 proteus mirabilis (4.9%; mic50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/ml) isolates. the most common enzymes detected among esbl phenotype isolates from 2013 (n = 743) screened using a microarray-based assay were ctx-m-15-like (n = 307), kpc (n = 120), shv esbls (n = 118), and ctx-m-14-like (n = 110). kpc producers were highly resistant to comparators, and ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.5/2 mug/ml) and tigecycline (mic50/90, 0.5/1 mug/ml; 98.3% susceptible) were the most active agents against these strains. meropenem (mic50/90, </=0.06/</=0.06 mug/ml) and ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) were active against ctx-m-producing isolates. other enzymes were also observed, and ceftazidime-avibactam displayed good activity against the isolates producing less common enzymes. among 11 isolates displaying ceftazidime-avibactam mic values of >8 mug/ml, three were k. pneumoniae strains producing metallo-beta-lactamases (all ceftazidime-avibactam mics, >32 mug/ml), with two ndm-1 producers and one k. pneumoniae strain carrying the blakpc-2 and blavim-4 genes. therapeutic options for isolates producing beta-lactamases may be limited, and ceftazidime-avibactam, which displayed good activity against strains, including those producing kpc enzymes, merits further study in infections where such organisms occur.

TI  == bacterial-resistance among outpatients of county hospitals in china: significant  geographic distinctions and minor differences between central cities.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to survey antibacterial resistance in outpatients of chinese county hospitals. a total of 31 county hospitals were selected and samples continuously collected from august 2010 to august 2011. drug sensitivity  testing was conducted in a central laboratory. a total of 2946 unique isolates were collected, including 634 strains of escherichia coli, 606 klebsiella pneumoniae, 476 staphylococcus aureus, 308 streptococcus pneumoniae, and 160 haemophilus influenzae. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in e. coli (42.3% strains), k. pneumoniae (31.7%), and proteus mirabilis (39.0%). ciprofloxacin-resistance was detected in 51.0% of e. coli strains. salmonella spp. and shigella spp. were sensitive to most antibacterial agents. less than 8.0% of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were resistant to carbapenem. for s. aureus strains, 15.3% were resistant to methicillin, and some strains of s. pneumoniae showed resistance to penicillin (1.6%), ceftriaxone (13.0%), and erythromycin (96.4%). beta-lactamase was produced by 96.5% of moraxella catarrhalis strains, and 36.2% of h. influenzae isolates were resistant to ampicillin. azithromycin-resistant h. influenzae, imipenem-resistant but meropenem-sensitive proteus, and ceftriaxone- and carbapenem non-sensitive m. catarrhalis were recorded. in conclusion, cephalosporin- and quinolone-resistant  strains of e. coli and klebsiella pneumonia and macrolide-resistant gram-positive cocci were relatively prominent in county hospitals. the antibacterial resistance profiles of isolates from different geographical locations varied significantly,  with proportions in county hospitals lower than those in their tertiary counterparts in the central cities, although the difference is diminishing.

TI  == rates of susceptibility of carbapenems, ceftobiprole, and colistin against clinically important bacteria collected from intensive care units in 2007: results from the surveillance of multicenter antimicrobial resistance in taiwan (smart).
AB  == background: data on susceptibility to ceftobiprole and colistin, and the complete evolutionary trends of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of important carbapenem agents among important pathogens collected in intensive care units (icus) in taiwan are lacking. methods: we surveyed the mic distribution patterns  of ceftobiprole and colistin and susceptibility profiles of some important pathogens collected from patients hospitalized in intensive care units (icus) of  major teaching hospitals throughout taiwan in 2007. we also investigated the rates of nonsusceptibility to powerful carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem) among four important species of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus mirabilis) collected during the same period. mic breakpoints recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute in 2014 were applied. results: colistin showed excellent in vitro activity (susceptibility rate, 96%) against acinetobacter baumannii isolates but  moderate (73-77% susceptibility rate) activity against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and e. cloacae. the ceftobiprole mic90 value was 4 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 16 mug/ml for p. aeruginosa. the  phenotype of methicillin resistance did not markedly increase the mic value of ceftobiprole among s. aureus isolates. interestingly, the proportion of isolates  that displayed nonsusceptibility to imipenem was significantly higher among p. mirabilis isolates than among isolates of the other three enterobacteriaceae species, regardless of the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. conclusion: continuous monitoring of susceptibility profiles of icu pathogens to  important antibiotics is warranted to provide appropriate antimicrobial regimens  against infections in the icu.

TI  == inhibition of quorum sensing mediated biofilm development and virulence in uropathogens by hyptis suaveolens.
AB  == bacterial urinary tract infections (utis) are the most common nosocomial infections, accounting for about 40 % of all hospital-acquired infections. the bacterial spectrum of nosocomial utis is broad and the treatment of utis is becoming difficult owing to the emergence of drug resistance. therefore, it is reasonable to investigate novel and alternative therapeutic strategies to treat utis. since utis are caused by uropathogens with quorum sensing (qs)-dependent biofilm forming abilities, interruption of qs systems may be a novel approach to  combat drug resistance. in the present study, a methanol extract (and hexane extract derived from it) of the medicinal plant hyptis suaveolens (l.) were shown to have anti-qs activity against the biosensor strain chromobacterium violaceum (atcc 12472). furthermore, the hexane extract of h. suaveolens (hehs) inhibited biofilm formation by uropathogens such as escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia marcescens. hehs promotes the loosening of biofilm architecture and strongly inhibits in vitro biofilm formation by uropathogens, which was more apparent from microscopic images. in addition to this, hehs reduces the production of qs-dependent virulence factors like protease and hemolysin, along with motility. the partial purification and gc-ms analysis of the active fraction revealed the presence of several therapeutically important compounds which may synergistically act on the uropathogens and possibly reduce the qs-dependent phenotypes. these findings suggest hehs as potential phytotherapeutic agent which can be employed to formulate protective strategies against biofilm linked infections caused by uropathogens.

TI  == identification and phenotypic characterization of the most frequent bacterial etiologies in chronic skin ulcers.
AB  == chronic wounds represent an important burden on the healthcare system, requiring  frequent hospitalizations and expensive treatments. it is now recognized that a primary factor contributing to a non-healing trajectory and a low therapeutic response is the biofilm infection. the purpose of this study was to identify the  bacterial isolates collected from chronic skin wounds of hospitalized patients and to evaluate their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, virulence factors, as well as the ability to develop biofilms in vitro. a number of 44 wound samples were collected from 39 patients. the isolated strains belonged to seven different microbial species, i.e.: staphylococcus aureus (32 strains), followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), escherichia coli (3), klebsiella pneumoniae (2), proteus mirabilis (1), citrobacter freundii (1), group g beta-hemolytic streptococci (1). in comparison to the other isolates, p. aeruginosa strains exhibited the highest capacity to develop complex biofilm structures in vitro, followed by s. aureus, with insignificant differences between mrsa and non-methicillin resistant isolates. the enterobacteriaceae strains expressed less virulent phenotypes, lower adherence to epithelial cells and biofilm forming capacity, but also significant resistance phenotypes with a potential of unfavorable epidemiological outcome. the isolation of mrsa, esbl-producing microorganisms and multiple antibiotic resistant p. aeruginosa suggests the potential risk of nosocomial spread and the potential severe outcome in case of bacteremia and sepsis. this study represents an important step in elucidating the host-wound microbiome interaction, by describing various resistance and virulence threats of microorganisms colonizing and/or infecting the chronic wounds. however, in order to establish a statistical relevant correlation, larger studies are needed.

TI  == microbiological assessment of well waters in samaru, zaria, kaduna, state, nigeria.
AB  == background: majority of the human population in semi-urban and urban areas in nigeria are heavily reliant on well water as the main source of water supply for  drinking and domestic use due to inadequate provision of potable pipe borne water. these groundwater sources can easily be fecally contaminated and thus, increase the incidence and outbreaks of preventable waterborne diseases. this study was carried out to determine the bacteriological quality of some well waters in samaru, z. materials and methods: samaru, zaria located in northern nigeria, is a semi-urban university satellite town blessed with abundant ground and surface water. five sampling sites were randomly selected for this study. a total of 10 samples: two from each of the sites were collected fortnightly for 1  month (may-june, 2013). samples were analyzed using presumptive multiple tube fermentation and confirmatory tests for total and fecal coliforms. the well water samples were also cultured for salmonella, shigella, and vibrio chole. results: the total coliform count for all the samples analyzed was >180+/100 ml. all the well water samples from the study locations were contaminated with one or more bacterial pathogens, escherichia coli 20%, klebsiella pneumoniae 100% and proteus mirabilis 40%. salmonella, shigella, or v. cholerae were not isolated from any of the well water samples. conclusions: the results from this study showed contamination of all the wells studied with fecal coliforms thus, indicating the  possible presence of other enteric pathogens and a potential source for waterborne disease outbreaks. well water in samaru is not safe for drinking without additional treatment like disinfection or boiling. periodic testing and constant monitoring of well waters should also be done to meet up with the world  health organization standards in the provision of safe, clean drinking water .

TI  == drug resistance and molecular epidemiology of aerobic bacteria isolated from puerperal infections in bangladesh.
AB  == puerperal infection is a common complication during postnatal period in developing countries. bacterial species, drug resistance, and genetic characteristics were investigated for a total of 470 isolates from puerperal infections in bangladesh for a 2-year period (2010-2012). the most common species was escherichia coli (n=98), followed by enterococcus faecalis (n=54), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=33), proteus mirabilis (n=32), staphylococcus aureus (n=27), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=22), and enterobacter cloacae (n=21). s.  aureus and acinetobacter baumannii were isolated at a higher frequency from wound infections after cesarean section, while e. coli, e. cloacae, and k. pneumoniae were isolated from community-acquired endometritis and urinary tract infections.  resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was frequent for enterobacteriacae, and was mainly mediated by blactx-m-1 group beta-lactamases. the ctx-m gene in e. coli from the four phylogroups was identified as blactx-m-15, and phylogroup b2 isolates with blactx-m-15 were classified into st131 with o25b allele, harboring  aac(6')-ib-cr and various virulence factors. carbapenemase genes blandm-1 and blandm-7 were identified in one isolate each of phylogroup a e. coli. methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates had type iv or v sccmec, including isolates of st361 (cc672), which is related to an emerging st672 clone in the indian subcontinent. this study revealed the recent epidemiological status of aerobic bacteria causing puerperal infections in bangladesh, providing useful information to improve clinical practice and infection control.

TI  == preparation and characterization of new biologically active polyurethane foams.
AB  == biologically active polyurethane foams are the fast-developed alternative to many applications of biomedical materials. due to the polyurethane structure features  and foam technology it is possible to incorporate into their structure the biologically active compounds of target purpose via structural-chemical modification of macromolecule. a series of new biologically active polyurethane foams (pufs) was synthesized with polyethers (mm 2500-5000), polyesters mm (500-2200), 2,4(2,6) toluene diisocyanate, water as a foaming agent, catalysts, foam stabilizers and functional compounds. different functional compounds: 1,4-di-n-oxy-2,3-bis-(oxymethyl)-quinoxaline (domq), partial sodium salt of poly(acrylic acid) and 2,6-dimethyl-n,n-diethyl aminoacetatanilide hydrochloride  were incorporated into the polymer structure/composition due to the chemical and/or physical bonding. structural peculiarities of pufs were studied by ftir spectroscopy and x-ray scattering. self-adhesion properties of pufs were estimated by measuring of tensile strength at break of adhesive junction. the optical microscopy method was performed for the puf morphology studies. toxicological estimation of the pufs was carried out in vitro and in vivo. the antibacterial action towards the gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli atc 25922, e. coli atc 2150, klebsiella pneumoniae 6447, staphylococcus aureus 180, pseudomonas aeruginosa 8180, proteus mirabilis f 403,  p. mirabilis 6054, and proteus vulgaris 8718) was studied by the disc method on the solid nutrient. physic-chemical properties of the pufs (density, tensile strength and elongation at break, water absorption and vapor permeability) showed that all studied pufs are within the operational requirements for such materials  and represent fine-cellular foams. spectral studies confirmed the incorporation of domq into the puf's macrochain. pufs are characterized by microheterogeneous structure. they are antibacterially active, non-toxic materials with high affinity to the tissue body, self-adhesive properties and local anesthetic effect.

TI  == enterobacteria identification and detection of diarrheagenic escherichia coli in  a port complex.
AB  == the port complex of maranhao (pcm) is the second largest port complex in brazil,  receiving ships with large volumes of ballast water. to evaluate the microbiological quality of its waters, physicochemical parameters (ph and salinity), the number of coliforms (thermotolerants and totals), and the presence of enterobacterias and diarrheagenic escherichia coli strains were analyzed. in order to identify the presence of e. coli virulence genes target regions of the stx, elt, est, aggr, cvd432, ipah and eae nucleotide sequences were studied. the  presence of totals and thermotolerants coliforms were positive. analyzing the salinity parameter, a significant increase in total coliforms was observed during the rainy season. we identified the species escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella ozaenae, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae and edwardsiella tarda. out of the 51 e. coli isolated, two were positive for the elt gene and one was positive  for the cvd432 sequence, features of enterotoxigenic and enteroaggregative strains, respectively. this study reveals that the pcm is contaminated by enterobacteria and diarrheagenic e.coli thus providing evidence regarding the risk of these bacteria being carried by ships to other countries, and draws attention to the input of fecal bacteria brought by ships in the port waters of maranhao.

TI  == beta-lactamases produced by amoxicillin-clavulanate-resistant enterobacteria isolated in buenos aires, argentina: a new blatem gene.
AB  == resistance to beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors in enterobacteria is a growing problem that has not been intensively studied in argentina. in the present work, 54/843 enterobacteria collected in a teaching hospital of buenos aires city were ampicillin-sulbactam-resistant isolates remaining susceptible to  second- and third-generation cephalosporins. the enzymatic mechanisms present in  the isolates, which were also amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (amc)-resistant (18/54) were herein analyzed. sequencing revealed two different variants of blatem-1, being blatem-1b the most frequently detected allelle (10 escherichia coli, 3 klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 proteus mirabilis and 1 raoultella terrigena) followed by blatem-1a (1 k. pneumoniae). amoxicillin-clavulanate resistance seems to be mainly associated with tem-1 overproduction (mostly in e. coli) or co-expressed with oxa-2-like and/or shv beta-lactamases (k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis). a new blatem variant (tem-163) was described in an e. coli strain having an amc mic value of 16/8mug/ml. tem-163 contains arg275gln and his289leu amino acid substitutions. on the basis of the high specific activity and low ic50 for clavulanic acid observed, the resistance pattern seems to be due to overproduction of the new variant of broad spectrum beta-lactamase rather than to an inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-like behavior.

TI  == gorilla gorilla gorilla gut: a potential reservoir of pathogenic bacteria as revealed using culturomics and molecular tools.
AB  == wild apes are considered to be the most serious reservoir and source of zoonoses. however, little data are available about the gut microbiota and pathogenic bacteria in gorillas. for this propose, a total of 48 fecal samples obtained from 21 gorilla gorilla gorilla individuals (as revealed via microsatellite analysis)  were screened for human bacterial pathogens using culturomics and molecular techniques. by applying culturomics to one index gorilla and using specific media supplemented by plants, we tested 12,800 colonies and identified 147 different bacterial species, including 5 new species. many opportunistic pathogens were isolated, including 8 frequently associated with human diseases; mycobacterium bolletii, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and clostridium botulinum. the genus treponema accounted for 27.4% of the total reads identified  at the genus level via 454 pyrosequencing. using specific real-time pcr on 48 gorilla fecal samples, in addition to classical human pathogens, we also observed the fastidious bacteria bartonella spp. borrelia spp., coxiella burnetii and tropheryma whipplei in the gorilla population. we estimated that the prevalence of these pathogens vary between 4.76% and 85.7%. therefore, gorillas share many bacterial pathogens with humans suggesting that they could be a reservoir for their emergence.

TI  == asymptomatic bacteriuria escherichia coli are live biotherapeutics for uti.
AB  == urinary tract infections (uti) account for approximately 8 million clinic visits  annually with symptoms that include acute pelvic pain, dysuria, and irritative voiding. empiric uti management with antimicrobials is complicated by increasing  antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens, but live biotherapeutics products (lbps), such as asymptomatic bacteriuria (asb) strains of e. coli, offer the potential to circumvent antimicrobial resistance. here we evaluated asb e. coli as lbps, relative to ciprofloxacin, for efficacy against infection and visceral pain in a murine uti model. visceral pain was quantified as tactile allodynia of  the pelvic region in response to mechanical stimulation with von frey filaments.  whereas ciprofloxacin promoted clearance of uropathogenic e. coli (upec), it did  not reduce pelvic tactile allodynia, a measure of visceral pain. in contrast, asb e. coli administered intravesically or intravaginally provided comparable reduction of allodynia similar to intravesical lidocaine. moreover, asb e. coli were similarly effective against uti allodynia induced by proteus mirabilis, enterococccus faecalis and klebsiella pneumoniae. therefore, asb e. coli have anti-infective activity comparable to the current standard of care yet also provide superior analgesia. these studies suggest that asb e. coli represent novel lbps for uti symptoms.

TI  == aerobic bacterial microbiota isolated from the cloaca of the european pond turtle (emys orbicularis) in poland.
AB  == we conducted a comparative analysis of the aerobic cloacal bacteria of european pond turtles (emys orbicularis) living in their natural environment and juvenile  turtles reared under controlled conditions in a breeding center. we included 130  turtles in the study. the aerobic bacteria isolated from the cloaca of the juvenile turtles were less diverse and more prevalent than the bacteria isolated  from free-living adults. we isolated 17 bacterial species from juvenile captive turtles, among which the dominant species were cellulomonas flavigena (77/96), enterococcus faecalis (96/96), escherichia coli (58/96), and proteus mirabilis (41/96). from the adult, free-living turtles, we isolated 36 bacterial species, some of which are a potential threat to public health (e.g., salmonella enterica  serovars newport, daytona, and braenderup; listeria monocytogenes; yersinia enterocolitica; yersinia ruckeri; klebsiella pneumoniae; vibrio fluvialis; and serratia marcescens), and pathogens that are etiologic agents of diseases of ectothermic animals (e.g., aeromonas sobria, aeromonas caviae, hafnia alvei, edwardsiella tarda, and citrobacter braakii; the last two species were isolated from both groups of animals). the cloacal bacterial biota of the european pond turtle was characterized by numerous species of bacteria, and its composition varied with turtle age and environmental conditions. the small number of isolated bacteria that are potential human pathogens may indicate that the european pond turtle is of relatively minor importance as a threat to public health.

TI  == epidemiology of enterobacteriaceae producing ctx-m type extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl).
AB  == over the past 20 years, some enterobacteriaceae mainly escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis have demonstrated acquisition of plasmids secreting esbl. ctx-m type esbl have been isolated worldwide and their incidence has increased dramatically and is still increasing leading to a major therapeutic issue. currently more than 150 allelic variants of ctx-m have been identified. these enzymes are classified in five major phylogenetic groups based  on their gene sequences: ctx-m -1, ctx-m-2, ctx-m-8, ctx-m-9, ctx-m-25; two additional groups have been reported recently: ctx-m-74 and ctx-m-75. the important dissemination of these enzymes has led to an increased use of carbapenems. their global community and nosocomial dissemination is often associated with a virulent e. coli clone st131 producing ctx-m-15.

TI  == [phenotypic detection of beta-lactamases production in enterobacteriaceae].
AB  == introduction: beta-lactam antibiotics are the most commonly used antibacterial drugs. however, many bacteria have developed resistance to these antibiotics, and the most common form of resistance is the production of beta-lactamase enzymes. many members of the enterobacteriaceae family produce different types of these enzymes. objective: the aim of this study was to perform phenotypic detection of  production and identification of beta-lactamase type in enterobacteriaceae isolated from different clinical specimens from patients hospitalized in the clinical center of serbia. methods: the strains of enterobacteriaceae were collected between november 2011 and january 2012 in the laboratory of the clinical center of serbia.the isolates were identified according to the standard  microbiology procedures and confirmed by the vitek2 automated system. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the disk diffusion method,  and the phenotypic detection of production and identification of beta-lactamases  was performed according to previously described methodologies. results: in this study, a total of 172 enterobacteriaceae strains were isolated. further testing was performed on 54/145 (37.2%) strains showing decreased susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics: 13/85 (15.3%) escherichia coli, 31/46 (67.4%) klebsiella pneumoniae and 10/14 (71.4%) proteus mirabilis. among them, 40/145 (27.6%) strains produced extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), 9/145 (6.2%)--ampc, 1/145 (0.7%)--k1 beta-lactamase and 4/145 (2.8%)--carbapenemases. carbapenemases  were predominantly detected in k. pneumoniae (75%). conclusion: enterobacteriaceae produce different types of beta-lactamases, and the most common type in our study was esbls. production of carbapenemases detected in enterobacteriaceae is also an associated problem.

AB  == the aim of this study was to characterize by a multi-level approach extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates other than e. coli from portuguese hospitals. eighty-eight esbl-producing clinical isolates (69 klebsiella pneumoniae, 13 enterobacter cloacae complex, 3 klebsiella oxytoca, 1 enterobacter asburiae, 1 proteus mirabilis and 1 serratia marcescens) recovered from hospitals located in the north (a) or centre (b, c) regions during two time periods (2006-7 and 2010) were analyzed. standard methods were used for bacterial identification, antibiotic susceptibility testing, esbl characterization, clonal (pfge, mlst) and plasmid (s1-pfge, i-ceui-pfge, replicon typing, hybridization) analysis. isolates produced mostly ctx-m-15 (47%) or shv-12 (30%), and less frequently other shv- (15%; shv-2, -5, -28, -55, -106) or  tem- (9%; tem-10, -24, -199)-types, with marked local and temporal variations. the increase of ctx-m-15 and diverse shv esbl-types observed in hospital a was associated with the amplification of multidrug-resistant (mdr) k. pneumoniae epidemic clones (st15, st147, st336). shv-12 and tem-type esbls were mostly identified in diverse isolates of different enterobacteriaceae species in hospitals b and c in 2006-7. particular plasmid types were linked to blactx-m-15  (incr or non-typeable plasmids), blashv-12 (incr or inchi2), blashv-28/-55/-106 (incfiik1 or incfiik5), blatem-10 (incl/m) or blatem-24 (inca/c), mostly in epidemic clones. in our country, the amplification of ctx-m-15 and diverse shv-type esbl among non-e. coli enterobacteriaceae is linked to international mdr k. pneumoniae clones (st15, st147, st336) and plasmid types (incr, incfiik). furthermore, we highlight the potential of incfiik plasmids (here firstly associated with blashv-2/-28/-55/-106) to disseminate as antibiotic resistance plasmids.

TI  == the influence of urinary ph on antibiotic efficacy against bacterial uropathogens.
AB  == objective: to determine the effects of ph on the activity of clinically relevant  antibiotics against bacterial uropathogens. numerous factors affect antibiotic efficacy within the urinary tract including ph. because human urine can substantially vary from acidic (ph 4.5) to alkaline (ph 8) conditions and can be  easily clinically manipulated, it would be a great advantage to better understand the role of ph in antibiotic treatment of urinary tract infection. materials and  methods: this in vitro study investigated the activity of 24 widely used antimicrobial agents against bacterial strains comprising 6 major uropathogenic species (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) over the  range of ph 5-8. standard disk-diffusion and broth-microdilution assays were used. one-way analysis of variance was applied to determine significance (p <.05). results: for 18 of the 24 agents, ph was shown to play a significant role  in overall inhibitory activity. although most agents behaved similarly across most or all of the uropathogens tested, several only showed ph-dependent effects  against certain organisms. the fluoroquinolones, co-trimoxazole, aminoglycosides, and macrolides all functioned optimally at alkaline ph, whereas the tetracyclines, nitrofurantoin, and many of the beta-lactams tested exhibited their highest activity under more acidic conditions. sulfamethoxazole, oxacillin, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, vancomycin, imipenem, and clindamycin were largely unaffected by ph. conclusion: clinicians should consider the urinary ph of their patients when treating urinary tract infection, especially in complicated scenarios. future clinical investigations examining urinary ph and antibiotic efficacy may result in the application of decreased antibiotic dosages and regimen durations, potentially reducing antibiotic resistance development.

TI  == bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
AB  == the ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. the frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. a specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (eps) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial  cells. much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would  allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. the use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.

AB  == forty-five derivatives of thiosemicarbazide were synthesized, and their antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was evaluated. some of the described compounds exhibited interesting activity against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria, whereas only two derivatives had the ability to inhibit the growth of gram-negative species (escherichia coli atcc 25922, klebsiella pneumoniae atcc 13883, proteus mirabilis atcc 12453). the most  potent antimicrobial activity was observed in the cases of salicylic acid hydrazide derivatives. the differences in activity inspired us to conduct conformational analysis using molecular mechanics level. the obtained results suggest that the molecule geometry, especially at the n4-terminus of thiosemicarbazide skeleton, determines the antibacterial activity. unfortunately, in opposition to what we expected, only one of the tested compounds inhibited the activity of the topoiv enzyme, and none of them was active against dna gyrase.

AB  == background: increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics is one of the most serious problems in current medicine. an important factor contributing to the growing prevalence of multiresistant bacteria is application of antibiotics. this study aimed at analyzing the development of resistance of enterobacteriaceae to selected beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside antibiotics in the university hospital olomouc and assessing the effect of selection pressure of these antibiotics. methods: for the period between 1 january 2000 and 31 december 2011, resistance of klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis to third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, meropenem,  piperacillin/tazobactam, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides was retrospectively studied. for the assessment of selection pressure of antibiotics, a parameter of  defined daily dose in absolute annual consumption (dddatb) based on the atc/ddd classification and in relative annual consumption (rdddatb) as the number of defined daily doses per 100 bed-days was used. the relationship between frequency of strains resistant to a particular antibiotic and antibiotic consumption was assessed by linear regression analysis using spearman's correlation. the level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. results: a total of 113,027 isolates from the enterobacteriaceae family were analyzed. there was a significant effect of selection pressure of the primary antibiotic in the following cases: piperacillin/tazobactam in klebsiella pneumoniae, gentamicin in  klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli and amikacin in escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae. also, there was significant correlation between resistance  to ceftazidime and consumption of piperacillin/tazobactam in klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. no relationship was found between consumption of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and resistance to ceftazidime or between fluoroquinolone consumption and resistance to ciprofloxacin. conclusion:  the study showed the effects of both direct and indirect selection pressure on increasing resistance to gentamicin, amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. given the fact that no correlation was found between resistance to fluoroquinolones and consumption of either primary or secondary antibiotics, we assume that the increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones is probably due to circulation of resistance genes in the bacterial population and that this resistance was not affected by reduced use of these antibiotics.

TI  == role of the bacterial vaccine solco-urovac(r) in treatment and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections of bacterial origin.
AB  == urinary tract infections (uti) represent a serious medical problem with considerably high rate of morbidity. recurrent episodes of urinary tract infection (ruti) may commonly develop in the way of relapse or reinfection. for patients, ruti is always associated with costs, discomfort and decreased quality  of life. standard treatment of ruti is through antibiotics and usually such treatment is required repeatedly. repeat course of antibiotics leads to increase  of resistance of uropathogenic strains. according to the european association of  urology, "the present state of microbial resistance development is alarming". our post-marketing trial was designed to demonstrate the substantial effect of the bacterial vaccine solco-urovac(r) both with independent administration and in conjunction with standard antibacterial medication within therapy and prevention  of ruti. total of 115 patients (men and non-pregnant women) were enrolled in our  open-label post-marketing trial. each patient had more than one year history of ruti and in the past had already taken appropriate course of standard therapy. the trial group included 50 patients: 32 men, 18 women (average age +/- 32.5). 32 patients (men) of the trial group received vaccination with solco-urovac(r) together with the standard antibacterial medication. according to bacteriologic tests, in 62% cases infection was caused by escherichia coli, and in 38% cases by morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis. 18 patients within the trial group were women with no recurrence episode at the start and during the trial period. each woman was involved as the  intercourse partner of the respective man within the trial group. the women received only vaccination with solco-urovac(r). 65 patients of the control group  had more than one year history of ruti and had been treated earlier, too. patients of the control group received appropriate antibacterial medication without solco-urovac(r). after therapy and follow-up examination, results in the  both groups were classified, also in consideration of the pathogen-specified subgroups, and then summarized and compared respectively. during the follow-up period no case of ruti was noticed in women. in total, analysis of the medical records of 50 patients of the trial group demonstrated no case of ruti in 46 patients during the follow-up period. altogether, the rate of improvement of symptoms was as follows: the trial group - 92%, the control group - 74%. through  comparison with the past medical histories of patients, the higher rate of improvement and longer absence of ruti episodes after treatment were certainly associated with the effect of solco-urovac(r). the results of our post-marketing  trial allow recommending solco-urovac(r) for appropriate reference within the georgian national guideline on urologic infections.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase rates in aerobic gram-negative bacteria causing intra-abdominal infections in vietnam: report from the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart 2009-2011).
AB  == treatment options for multidrug-resistant pathogens remain problematic in many regions and individual countries, warranting ongoing surveillance and analysis. limited antimicrobial susceptibility information is available for pathogens from  vietnam. this study determined the bacterial susceptibility of aerobic gram-negative pathogens of intra-abdominal infections among patients in vietnam during 2009-2011. a total of 905 isolates were collected from 4 medical centers in this investigation as part of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends. antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) rates among the appropriate species were determined by a central laboratory using clinical and laboratory standards institute methods. among the species collected, escherichia coli (48.1% esbl-positive) and klebsiella pneumoniae (39.5% esbl-positive) represented the majority (46.4%) of the isolates submitted for this study. ertapenem mic90 values were lowest for these 2 species at 0.12 and 0.25mug/ml and remained unchanged for esbl-positive isolates. imipenem mic90 values were also the same for all isolates and esbl-positive strains at 0.25 and 0.5mug/ml, respectively. ertapenem mic90 values for additional species with sufficient numbers for analysis, including enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, were 1, 0.06, >4, and >4mug/ml, respectively. analysis of beta-lactamases in a subset of 132 phenotypically esbl-positive enterobacteriaceae demonstrated that ctx-m variants, particularly ctx-m-27 and ctx-m-15, were the predominant enzymes. high resistance rates in vietnam hospitals dictate continuous monitoring as antimicrobial inactivating enzymes continue to spread throughout asia and globally.

TI  == antimicrobial consumption and resistance in five gram-negative bacterial species  in a hospital from 2003 to 2011.
AB  == background: the misuse of antimicrobial agents increases drug resistance in bacteria. methods: the correlation between antimicrobial agent consumption and related resistance in the gram-negative bacteria acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis was analyzed during the period 2003-2011. results: among these five bacteria, overall e. coli and k. pneumoniae were more commonly isolated from bloodstream than the other species. regarding enterobacteriaceae, e. coli and k.  pneumoniae showed annual increases of resistance to the tested antimicrobial agents; conversely, p. mirabilis exhibited reduced resistance to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and cefepime. in contrast to the relatively low antimicrobial resistance in p. aeruginosa, a. baumannii revealed high resistance, which was over 85% resistant rate to the tested antimicrobial agents and over 80% carbapenem resistance in 2011. e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis differed  in development of antimicrobial resistance after consumption of the antimicrobial agents. k. pneumoniae developed resistance to all antimicrobial groups, whereas resistance in p. mirabilis was not related to any antimicrobial consumption. p. aeruginosa developed resistance to beta-lactam antimicrobials and aminoglycosides, whereas a. baumanii developed resistance to carbapenems after their use. conclusion: the development of antimicrobial resistance was related to antimicrobial agents and bacterial species.

TI  == in vitro studies of epithelium-associated crystallization caused by uropathogens  during urinary calculi development.
AB  == infectious urinary stones account for about 10% of all urinary stones. in 50% of  cases urolithiasis is a recurrent illness, which can lead to the loss of a kidney if not properly treated. one of the reasons for recurrence of the disease may be  the ability of bacteria to invade urothelial cells, persist in the host cells and serve as potential reservoirs for infection. various uropathogens are associated  with the formation of bacteria-induced urinary stones but proteus mirabilis is the most commonly isolated (70%). an in vitro model was used in this study to analyze intracellular growth and crystallization in the presence of p. mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. human ureter (hu 609) and bladder (hcv 29) epithelial cell lines were infected with bacteria and incubated (3-72 h) in the presence of synthetic urine and amikacin to prevent extracellular bacterial growth. during the incubation the number of bacteria (cfu/ml) inside epithelial cells and the intensity of crystallization were established. crystallization was determined as an amount of a calcium radioisotope. the chosen strains of uropathogens were able to invade both types of epithelial cells but the hu 609 cells were invaded to a higher extent. however, crystallization occurred only in the presence of p. mirabilis strains which were invasive and urease-positive. the highest intensity of cell-associated crystallization was observed when the number of bacteria within the urothelium remained stable during the time of incubation. these results show that p. mirabilis has an ability to form crystals inside the host cells. under these conditions bacteria are protected from antibiotic killing, which leads to persistent and recurrent infections. we also suspect that this phenomenon may be an important stage of kidney stones formation.

TI  == ceftolozane/tazobactam activity tested against aerobic gram-negative organisms isolated from intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections in european and united states hospitals (2012).
AB  == ceftolozane/tazobactam is under clinical development for treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (iai), complicated urinary tract infections (uti) and  ventilator-associated pneumonia. we evaluated the in vitro activity of ceftolozane/tazobactam and comparator agents tested against gram-negative aerobic bacteria causing iai and healthcare-associated uti (hca-uti). the organisms were  consecutively collected from january to december 2012 from 59 medical centers located in the united states (usa) and 15 european countries by the program to assess ceftolozane/tazobactam susceptibility (pacts). the collection included 809 organisms from iai and 2474 organisms from hca-uti, and susceptibility testing was performed by reference broth microdilution methods as described by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) m07-a9 document. overall, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most  frequently isolated pathogens from both infection types. ceftolozane/tazobactam was very active against e. coli (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/l; 98.5-99.9% inhibited at an mic of </=8 mg/l) and retained activity against many of the multidrug-resistant (mdr; mic50/90, 0.5/2->32 mg/l) and esbl-phenotype strains (mic50/90, 0.5/2-32 mg/l). ceftolozane/tazobactam was active against most k. pneumoniae strains (mic50/90, 0.25/16 mg/l, 88.9-89.6% inhibited at an mic of </=8 mg/l), but some esbl-phenotype (mic50/90, 4-8/>32 mg/l) and mdr (mic50/90, 16/>32 mg/l) isolates exhibited elevated mic values. ceftolozane/tazobactam was the most active agent tested against p. aeruginosa (mic50/90, 0.5/4 mg/l; 93.4-95.7% inhibited at </=8 mg/l) and retained potency against many mdr (mic50/90, 2-4/>32 mg/l), ceftazidime-nonsusceptible (mic50/90, 2-4/>32 mg/l) and meropenem-nonsusceptible (mic50/90, 2/>32 mg/l) strains. ceftolozane/tazobactam was also active against klebsiella oxytoca (mic50/90, </=0.12-0.25/0.5-1 mg/l), enterobacter spp. (mic50/90, 0.25-0.5/4-8 mg/l), citrobacter spp. (mic50/90, 0.25/2-32 mg/l), proteus mirabilis (mic50/90, 0.5/0.5 mg/l), indole-positive proteae (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5-1 mg/l), and serratia spp. (mic50/90, 0.5/1-2 mg/l).  in summary, ceftolozane/tazobactam demonstrated potent in vitro activity when tested against contemporary aerobic gram-negative pathogens causing iai and hca-uti in usa and european medical centers.

TI  == bacterial isolates associated with pelvic inflammatory disease among female patients attending some hospitals in abuja, nigeria.
AB  == background: pelvic inflammatory disease refers to any infection in the female lower reproductive tract that spreads to the upper reproductive tract. the disease comprises a spectrum of inflammatory disorders of the upper female genital tract, including any combination of endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess and pelvic peritonitis. pid is not a notifiable disease in most countries, so accurate statistics are not available. this situation is not in any way different here in nigeria and more so in the federal capital territory, abuja where this research was conducted, there had never been any published report so far on pid. it therefore became pertinent that such studies be carried out to evaluate the bacterial organisms which may be associated with the disease in this part of nigeria so that health care providers could take a better look at this affliction in women. materials and methods: endocervical swabs totalling 100 were aseptically collected from patients with confirmed pelvic inflammatory disease (pid), attending some hospitals in abuja, nigeria for detection of bacterial pathogens based on cultural and biochemical characterisation tests. antibiogram was also conducted on the identified bacterial isolates. results: out of the 100 samples analysed, 43% yielded pure cultures of bacterial isolates, 2% yielded mixed cultures while no bacterial growths were recorded from the remaining 55% samples. organisms encountered were  staphylococcus aureus (16%), escherichia coli (10%), streptococcus faecalis (8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%), streptococcus pyogenes (3%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), proteus rettgeri (2%) and proteus mirabilis (1%). the highest percentage occurrence of pathogenic isolates was observed in polygamous married patients (90%). the age group most affected falls within the mean age 30.5 years (68%) while the least affected group falls within the mean age 40.5 years (5%). there was a significant difference in the acquisition of pid in relation to marital status (p < 0.05). however there was no significant difference in the acquisition of the disease with respect to age (p > 0.05). antibiogram patterns of pathogenic isolates revealed varied resistance to most of the antibiotics employed. cefotaxime (a new generation cephalosporin antibiotic) was established in this study as the best antimicrobial agent for treatment of pid due to gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from the women examined. conclusion: in conclusion, pelvic inflammatory disease is a major health problem in developed or developing countries of the world. pid is not a notifiable disease, as accurate statistics on disease prevalence are rarely available. there is therefore no doubt thousands of young women have salpingitis every year and their sheer number makes it an important health problem. pid hence can be said to be a very serious  complication of sexually transmitted disease which should be critically and promptly handled by healthcare providers. the right type sample should be aseptically collected and be appropriately handled for laboratory investigation.  treatment of pid should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made. immediate administration of antibiotics has been effective in the long-term sequelae associated with pid, especially new generation antibiotics, such as cefotaxime as recorded in this study.

AB  == background: traditional antibiograms guide clinicians in selecting appropriate empiric antimicrobials, but they lack data on syndrome/disease-specific susceptibility, isolate location, polymicrobial infections, and patient risk factors. the aim of this study was to develop a urinary-specific antibiogram and  to evaluate the impact of risk factors on antimicrobial susceptibility. methods:  this retrospective descriptive study used culture and susceptibility data from january 1 to december 31, 2012. a urinary antibiogram specific for escherichia coli (ec), proteus mirabilis (pm), klebsiella pneumoniae (kp), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa) was developed. urinary and standard antibiogram susceptibilities  were compared. urinary isolates were then stratified by risk factors-residence before admission, age, systemic antimicrobial use for </=30 days, hospitalization for </=30 days, and hospital unit-to determine the impact on antimicrobial susceptibility. results: there were 2,284 urinary isolate encounters. overall antimicrobial susceptibility was increased, and the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolates was significantly greater (kp, 14% vs 7% [p = .001]; ec, 13% vs 9% [p < .001]; pm, 18% vs 10% [p = .004]) in the urinary antibiogram vs the standard antibiogram. health care facility residence had the greatest impact on susceptibility for all urinary isolates, especially on fluoroquinolone susceptibility for ec and pm. conclusions: using a  syndromic antibiogram and incorporating patient risk factors into susceptibility  data may be more useful in guiding clinicians in selecting more appropriate empiric therapy.

TI  == blakpc gene detection in clinical isolates of carbapenem resistant enterobacteriaceae in a tertiary care hospital.
AB  == introduction: carbapenem resistance among enterobacteriaceae, especially in klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli, is an emerging problem worldwide. a common mechanism of carbapenem resistance is the production of class-a, klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc). aims and objectives: the present study focused on determining the antibiotic resistance pattern and prevalence of bla kpc gene coding for kpc in carbapenem resistant enterobacteriaceae. methodology:  forty six carbapenem resistant isolates belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae were tested for antibiotic sensitivity pattern. modified hodge test (mht) and pcr for bla kpc gene detection were performed on these isolates. of these, 22 were klebsiella pneumoniae, 21 were escherichia coli, 2 were citrobacter species and 1 was proteus mirabilis results: forty three (93.4%) out  of the 46 isolates were resistant to meropenem, 34 (73.9%) were resistant to imipenem and 30 (65.2%) were resistant to both imipenem and meropenem. modified hodge test was positive in 38 (82.6%) out of 46 isolates and blakpc gene was detected in 31 (67.4%) isolates. bla kpc gene was detected in 28 out of the 38 mht positive isolates.

TI  == therapeutic challenges of esbls and ampc beta-lactamase producers in a tertiary care center.
AB  == background: resistance to broad-spectrum beta lactams mediated by extended spectrum beta lactamases (esbls) and ampc beta lactamases (ampc betals) enzymes is an increasing problem worldwide. determination of their prevalence is essential to formulate an effective antibiotic policy and hospital infection control measures. present study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of esbl and ampc betal producers in icu of a tertiary care center. methods: a total  of 262 clinical isolates comprising of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis that were recovered from various clinical specimens over a  one year period, were studied. antibiogram profile was determined to conventionally used antibiotics, along with recommended tests for detection of esbl and ampc betal production. results: 40.07% (105/262) were found to be esbl producers, 14.8% (39/262) were ampc bl producers. the coexistence of esbl and ampc betal producers was detected in 9.9% (26/262) of the isolates. conclusion: screening of multidrug resistant bacteria especially belonging to the enterobacteriaceae poses considerable therapeutic challenges in critical care patients because of the production of esbl and ampc betal. strategies to keep a check on the emergence of such drug resistant microbes by hospital environmental  surveillance and laboratory monitoring should form an important aspect of hospital infection control policy guidelines.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial efficacy of 21 indian timber-yielding plants against multidrug-resistant bacteria causing urinary tract infection.
AB  == objectives: to screen methanolic leaf extracts of 21 timber-yielding plants for antibacterial activity against nine species of uropathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples of a hospital (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). methods: bacterial strains were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity  tests by the kirby-bauer's disc diffusion method. the antibacterial potentiality  of leaf extracts was monitored by the agar-well diffusion method with multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains of nine uropathogens. results: two gram-positive isolates, e. faecalis and s. aureus, were resistant to 14 of the 18 antibiotics used. gram-negative isolates a. baumannii, c. freundii, e. aerogenes, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, and p. aeruginosa were resistant to 10, 12, 9, 11, 11, 10, and 11 antibiotics, respectively, of the 14 antibiotics used. methanolic leaf extracts of anogeissus acuminata had the maximum zone of inhibition size-29 mm against s. aureus and 28 mm against e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa. cassia tora had 29 mm as the zone of inhibition size for e. faecalis, e. aerogenes, and p. aeruginosa. based on the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values, the most effective 10 plants against uropathogens could be arranged in decreasing order as follows: c. tora >  a. acuminata > schleichera oleosa > pterocarpus santalinus > eugenia jambolana >  bridelia retusa > mimusops elengi > stereospermum kunthianum > tectona grandis >  anthocephalus cadamba. the following eight plants had moderate control capacity:  artocarpus heterophyllus, azadirachta indica, dalbergia latifolia, eucalyptus citriodora, gmelina arborea, pongamia pinnata, pterocarpus marsupium, and shorea  robusta. e. coli, followed by a. baumannii, c. freundii, e. aerogenes, p. mirabilis, and p. aeruginosa were controlled by higher amounts/levels of leaf extracts. phytochemicals of all plants were qualitatively estimated. conclusions: a majority of timber-yielding plants studied had in vitro control capacity against mdr uropathogenic bacteria.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of isolates from paediatric intensive care units in zagreb.
AB  == aim: meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) program is a longitudinal global surveillance study to monitor in vitro data on microbial susceptibility in centers that prescribe meropenem. results of the six years period (2002-2007) for the antimicrobial efficacy of meropenem compared to other  broad-spectrum agents against gram-negative and gram-positive isolates collected  at pediatric intensive care units of the university hospital center zagreb in croatia were reported. methods: a total of 110 gram-negative and 43 gram-positive pathogens from pediatric specimens were tested. the minimum-inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by broth microdilution method according to  clsi. results: there was no resistance to either imipenem or meropenem observed for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. high resistance rates of k. pneumoniae to ceftazidime and gentamicin (50%) are a raising concern. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most resistant gram-negative species with two (12%) of the strains resistant to meropenem, three (18%) to imipenem, 10 (47%) to gentamicin and six (35%) to piperacillin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin. according to our results meropenem remains an appropriate antibiotic for the treatment of severe infections caused by gram-negative bacteria in pediatric population. conclusions: the results indicate that meropenem has excellent potency and spectrum of activity despite being prescribed for a long time for the treatment of seriously ill patients, and still appears to be a reliable option for the initial empirical therapy of serious nosocomial infections in children. however, later studies have shown the emergence of carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria after 2008.

TI  == recommendations for the empirical treatment of complicated urinary tract infections using surveillance data on antimicrobial resistance in the netherlands.
AB  == background: complicated urinary tract infections (c-utis) are among the most common nosocomial infections and a substantial part of the antimicrobial agents used in hospitals is for the treatment of c-utis. data from surveillance can be used to guide the empirical treatment choices of clinicians when treating c-utis. we therefore used nation-wide surveillance data to evaluate antimicrobial coverage of agents for the treatment of c-uti in the netherlands. methods: we included the first isolate per patient of urine samples of hospitalised patients  collected by the infectious disease surveillance information system for antibiotic resistance (isis-ar) in 2012, and determined the probability of inadequate coverage for antimicrobial agents based on species distribution and susceptibility. analyses were repeated for various patient groups and hospital settings. results: the most prevalent bacteria in 27,922 isolates of 23,357 patients were escherichia coli (47%), enterococcus spp. (14%), proteus mirabilis  (8%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (7%). for all species combined, the probability of inadequate coverage was <5% for amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combined with gentamicin and the carbapenems. when including gram-negative bacteria only, the probability of inadequate coverage was 4.0%, 2.7%, 2.3% and 1.7%, respectively, for amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, a second or a third generation cephalosporin in combination with gentamicin, and the carbapenems (0.4%). there were only small variations in results among different patient groups and hospital settings. conclusions: when excluding enterococcus spp., considered as less virulent, and the carbapenems, considered as last-resort drugs, empirical treatment for c-uti with the best chance of adequate coverage are one of the studied beta-lactam-gentamicin combinations. this study demonstrates the applicability of routine surveillance data for up-to-date clinical practice guidelines on empirical antimicrobial therapy, essential in patient care given the evolving bacterial susceptibility.

TI  == evaluation of the clinical and laboratory standards institute phenotypic confirmatory test to detect the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases from 4005 escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis isolates.
AB  == a subset of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis isolates collected for the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends that were positive for the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) phenotypic confirmatory  test (n = 3245) or had an ertapenem mic of >/=0.5 microg ml(-1) (n = 293), or both (n = 467), were analysed for esbl genes. most esbl phenotype e. coli or k. pneumoniae possessed an esbl gene (95.8 and 88.4 %, respectively), and this was 93.1 % if carbapenem-non-susceptible k. pneumoniae were removed. this rate was lower for p. mirabilis (73.4 %) and k. oxytoca (62.5 %). virtually all esbl-positive isolates (99.5 %) were cefotaxime non-susceptible [clsi or european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) breakpoints)]. fewer isolates (82 %) were ceftazidime non-susceptible (clsi breakpoints). in addition, 21.1 % of e. coli, 25 % of k. oxytoca and 78.7 % of p. mirabilis isolates were ceftazidime susceptible but esbl positive. this suggests that clsi breakpoints for ceftazidime are too high to detect esbls. the lower eucast breakpoints detected esbls in e. coli and k. oxytoca better, but 59.6 % of esbl-positive isolates of p. mirabilis were ceftazidime susceptible. for isolates with ertapenem mics >/=0.5 microg ml(-1), more accurate esbl phenotype analysis was observed for e. coli and k. pneumoniae (sensitivity >95 % for both, specificity 94.4 and 54.1 %, respectively). if carbapenemase-positive k. pneumoniae were excluded, the specificity increased to 78 %. the positive predictive values for the esbl phenotypic test with e. coli and k. pneumoniae were 97.6 and 81.8 %, respectively, and negative predictive values were 75.9 and 95.2 %, respectively.  we therefore suggest that it would be prudent to confirm phenotypic esbl-positive p. mirabilis, k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca with molecular analysis.

TI  == diafiltration maldi-tof mass spectrometry method for culture-independent detection and identification of pathogens directly from urine specimens.
AB  == objectives: with the aim of rapid, culture-independent identification of microorganisms directly from urine specimens, we developed a diafiltration matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) method. methods: in this procedure, urine specimens are desalted,  fractionated, and concentrated prior to ms analysis. the analytic performance characteristics of the diafiltration method were assessed in a prospective trial  whereby 100 fresh urine specimens were processed using diafiltration maldi-tof ms. concomitant with this, conventional culture was performed with results blinded to the ms operator. results: the diafiltration method correctly identified urine specimens positive for uropathogens (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis) and correctly classified all specimens negative for clinically relevant bacteriuria, including a subset of contaminated urine specimens and a subset with growth of clinically insignificant flora. the sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 67% and 100%, respectively. the detection limit of this method was 10(5) to 10(6) colony-forming units/ml. conclusions: using the diafiltration method, we were able to improve the turnaround time for microorganism identification from 24 to 48 hours (for conventional culture) to 2 to 3 hours. although methodological refinements are under way to further improve the clinical sensitivity and turnaround time, the 100% positive predictive value of this method suggests that  it could be used to guide the selection of antimicrobial agents.

TI  == evaluation of bacteriostatic potency of expired oral paediatric antibiotics and implications on infant health.
AB  == introduction: in spite of significant risks, as well as non-clinical importance due to loss of potency, stiff penalties against administration of expired medications are still not appropriately enforced by health policy makers in many  developing countries, possibly because of little evidence to support that expired medications are hazardous. the purpose of this study therefore, was to investigate the effect of expiration dates on in vitro bacteriostatic potentials  of oral paediatric antibiotics. methods: comparative bacteriostatic potentials of 31 expired and seven corresponding unexpired oral paediatric antibiotics were determined on infantile diarrhoeagenic bacteria, using a modification of agar well-diffusion method. results: verall total percentage in vitro resistance rates against expired and unexpired paediatric antibiotics respectively were - e. coli  (</=100% vs. </=15.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (</=100% vs. </=31.3%), proteus mirabilis (</=91.7% vs. </=41.7%) and staphylococcus aureus (</=100% vs. </=18.2%). resistance rates of 45.5-55.8% (sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim 5), 39.5-63.6% (amoxycillin 6), 46.5-54.5% (cotrimoxazole 7), 37.5-63.6% (ampicillin  + cloxacillin 18), and higher resistance rates of >/=75.0-100% were exhibited towards remaining expired antibiotics. higher total resistance and multiple antibiotic resistance (mar) rates were also recorded against expired antibiotics  (45.2-93.5%) compared to unexpired antibiotics (28.6-57.2%), except for few strains of e. coli and proteus mirabilis. furthermore, unexpired paediatric antibiotics exhibited wider zones of inhibition towards the test diarrhoeagenic bacteria (>/=25.0 mm diameter). conclusion: this study provided preliminary microbiological results on the appreciable reduction in in vitro bacteriostatic potentials, as well as higher resistance and multiple antibiotic resistance rates among expired oral paediatric antibiotics on infantile diarrhoeagenic bacteria. apart from less-efficacy, administration of expired antibiotics can lead to increased antibiotic resistance and clinical treatment failure, as well as adverse drug reactions.

TI  == contemporary diversity of beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae in the nine u.s. census regions and ceftazidime-avibactam activity tested against isolates producing the most prevalent beta-lactamase groups.
AB  == escherichia coli (328 isolates), klebsiella pneumoniae (296), klebsiella oxytoca  (44), and proteus mirabilis (33) isolates collected during 2012 from the nine u.s. census regions and displaying extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (esbl) phenotypes were evaluated for the presence of beta-lactamase genes, and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were analyzed. the highest esbl rates were  noted for k. pneumoniae (16.0%, versus 4.8 to 11.9% for the other species) and in the mid-atlantic and west south central census regions. ctx-m group 1 (including  ctx-m-15) was detected in 303 strains and was widespread throughout the united states but was more prevalent in the west south central, mid-atlantic, and east north central regions. kpc producers (118 strains [112 k. pneumoniae strains]) were detected in all regions and were most frequent in the mid-atlantic region (58 strains). thirteen kpc producers also carried blactx-m. shv genes encoding esbl activity were detected among 176 isolates. other beta-lactamase genes observed were ctx-m group 9 (72 isolates), fox (10), tem esbl (9), dha (7), ctx-m group 2 (3), ndm-1 (2 [colorado]), and ctx-m groups 8 and 25 (1). additionally, 62.9% of isolates carried >/=2 beta-lactamase genes. kpc producers were highly resistant to multiple agents, but ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.5/2 mug/ml)  and tigecycline (mic50/90, 0.5/1 mug/ml) were the most active agents tested. overall, meropenem (mic50, </=0.06 mug/ml), ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50, 0.12 to 0.5 mug/ml), and tigecycline (mic50, 0.12 to 2 mug/ml) were the most active antimicrobials when tested against this collection. ndm-1 producers were resistant to all beta-lactams tested. the diversity and increasing prevalence of  beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae have been documented, and ceftazidime-avibactam was very active against the vast majority of beta-lactamase-producing strains isolated from u.s. hospitals.

TI  == fosfomycin trometamol: a review of its use as a single-dose oral treatment for patients with acute lower urinary tract infections and pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria.
AB  == fosfomycin trometamol (fosfomycin tromethamine) [monuril((r)), monurol((r)), monural((r))] is approved in numerous countries worldwide, mainly for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (utis). fosfomycin has good in vitro activity against common uropathogens, such as escherichia coli (including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing e. coli), proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus saprophyticus, and the susceptibility of uropathogens to fosfomycin has remained relatively stable over  time. a single oral dose of fosfomycin trometamol 3 g (the approved dosage) achieves high concentrations in urine. results of recent randomized trials indicate that single-dose fosfomycin trometamol had similar clinical and/or bacteriological efficacy to 3- to 7-day regimens of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, cotrimoxazole or nitrofurantoin in women with uncomplicated lower utis. in addition, single-dose fosfomycin trometamol had similar bacteriological efficacy  to a 5-day course of cefuroxime axetil or a 7-day course of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria, and  similar clinical and/or bacteriological efficacy to a 5-day course of cefuroxime  axetil or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or a 3-day course of ceftibuten in pregnant women with a lower uti. single-dose fosfomycin trometamol was generally well tolerated, with gastrointestinal adverse events (e.g. diarrhoea, nausea) reported most commonly. in conclusion, single-dose fosfomycin trometamol is an important option for the first-line empirical treatment of uncomplicated lower utis.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == relationship between the distribution of cefepime minimum inhibitory concentrations and detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production among clinically important enterobacteriaceae isolates obtained from patients in intensive care units in taiwan: results from the surveillance of multicenter antimicrobial resistance in taiwan (smart) in 2007.
AB  == background: the data on susceptibility of important cephalosporins against four enterobacteriaceae members producing potential extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) collected from taiwanese intensive care units are lacking. methods: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefepime were determined using agar dilution method, against escherichia coli (n = 344), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 359), enterobacter cloacae (n = 103), and proteus mirabilis (n = 78). susceptibilities of these isolates to three cephalosporins were assessed according to mic breakpoints recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) in 2013. the double-disk synergy test using disks containing cefepime (30 mug) with or without clavulanate (10 mug) was applied to  confirm production of esbl for isolates with cephalosporin mic >/= 2 mug/ml. results: a total of 175 isolates were verified as esbl producers. the rates of cefepime susceptibility among the esbl-producing isolates, according to clsi (eucast) criteria, were 56.7% (22.4%) for e. coli, 61.3% (12.0%) for k. pneumoniae, 57.9% (31.6%) for e. cloacae, and 71.4% (7.1%) for p. mirabilis. using different cefepime mic breakpoints (mics >/= 16 mug/ml recommended by clsi  criteria and >/= 2 mug/ml by eucast criteria) to define nonsusceptibility, we found that both criteria were poorer at predicting esbl producers among k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae than among the other two species. in addition, we also  found that the cefepime mic level of 1.0 mug/ml best distinguished non-esbl- from esbl-producing k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae. conclusion: to detect esbls, clsi should revise the cefepime mic breakpoint against enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and phytochemical constituents of leaf extracts of cassia  auriculata.
AB  == plants produce a wide variety of phytochemical constituents, which are secondary  metabolites and are used either directly or indirectly in the pharmaceutical industry. 'for centuries, man has effectively used various components of plants or their extracts for the treatment of many diseases, including bacterial infections. in the present study methanol, chloroform and aqueous extracts of cassia auriculata leaf were subjected for antimicrobial activity by well-diffusion method against six bacterial strains namely bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. the results revealed that the methanol and chloroform extracts exhibited strong inhibitory activity against all the tested organisms (zone of inhibition of 12-20 mm), except pseudomonas aeruginosa (zone of inhibition 10 mm or nil). the aqueous extracts showed moderate activity by 'zone of inhibition </=12 or nil). the extracts were screened for their phytochemical constituents by standard protocols' and were shown to contain carbohydrates, proteins, alkaloids, flavonoids, steroids, saponins and tannins. the antibacterial activity of these extracts is possibly linked to the presence of flavonoids, steroid, saponins and/or tannins. further studies are needed to determine the precise active principles from cassia auriculata.

TI  == emergence of new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (ndm-1) producing and multidrug resistant uropathogens causing urinary tract infections in andaman islands, india.
AB  == the present study was undertaken to understand the distribution and the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the uropathogens in the remote islands of india. patients' demographical data, urine culture results, and resistance rates were analyzed and multidrug resistant isolates were characterized. significant bacteriuria was found in 16 (17.7%, 95% confidence interval [ci] 8.47-23.53%) samples, which includes escherichia coli 9 (56.3%); klebsiella pneumoniae 3 (18.8%); enterobacter sp. 2 (12.5%) and proteus mirabilis 2 (12.5%). the uropathogens showed a wide resistance involving 3-21 drugs with 15 different  resistance patterns. among the 16 isolates, 13 (81.3%, 95% ci 62.13-100.37%) and  11 (68.8%, 95% ci 46.04-91.46%) isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporins, respectively. multiple mutations were detected in quinolone resistance determining region (qrdr) of the fluoroquinolone resistant isolates and all third generation cephalosporin resistant isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. a total of 7 (44%, 95% ci 17.02-70.98%) isolates was found to harbor plasmid mediated quinolone resistance  determinants the present study reports for the first time the presence of the new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (ndm-1) gene in two isolates of p. mirabilis in these islands. detection of multidrug resistant and ndm-1 producing isolates from cases of urinary tract infection in these remote islands lends support to the belief that the existence of these highly resistant strains is perhaps more widespread than previously thought and underscores the need for immediate implementation of antibiotic policy integrated with a continuous surveillance system. the study strengthens the need for a continuous surveillance system of antibiotic resistance in these remote islands.

TI  == plant-based hydrocarbon esters from tragia involucrata possess antimicrobial and  anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  == antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of hydrocarbon esters obtained from tragia involucrata were evaluated by disk-diffusion (250 microg/ml), and broth-dilution (500-7.8 microg/ml), methods against bacteria. among the compounds, shellsol showed the most potent activity against burkholderia pseudomallei (khw), aeromonas hydrophila, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. interestingly, vinyl hexylether was active against food-spoilage bacteria (bacillus cereus and proteus vulgaris), 2, 4-methyl hexane also exerted antimicrobial activity against k. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, b. pseudomallei, alcaligens viscolactis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. 2-methylnonane  and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane showed only weak activity. for example, shellsol showed bacteriostatic effect (mic of 7.8 microg/ml) against a. hydrophila, vinyl hexylether (mic of 15.6 microg/ml) against p. mirabilis, and 2, 4-methyl hexane (mic of 31.25 microg/ml) on b. pseudomallei. cytotoxic effects of compounds were  assayed in human skin and monkey kidney cells (62.5-2000 microg/ml) by an xtt assay. the vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol did not show any toxicity up to 1000 microg/ml concentrations. the 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane induced morphological changes (e.g. cell disintegration and lysis) of both cell types at a 2000 microg/ml. the vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol were devoid of toxic effects; however, 2-methylnonane induced weight loss and severe necrosis as evidenced by histopathological and serum biochemical analysis in rats. interestingly, shellsol showed the maximum inhibition of carrageenan-induced, paw oedema in rats. in conclusion, findings of this study clearly indicate that biologically active hydrocarbon esters, such as shellsol, vinyl hexylether, and 2, 4-dimethyl hexane  isolated from t. involucrata, may effectively control the growth of certain food-borne and food-spoilage pathogens.

TI  == bacterial pathogens in first febrile urinary tract infection affect breakthrough  infections in infants with vesicoureteral reflux treated with prophylactic antibiotics.
AB  == objective: to investigate the risk factors for recurrent urinary tract infections (utis) in infants with vesicoureteral reflux (vur) and whether bacterial pathogen affected breakthrough uti or not. methods: we compared children with infantile vur with recurrent uti (33 males, 11 females, mean age 3.2 months) and without recurrent uti (40 males, 7 females, mean age 4.8 months). the following were compared between the 2 groups: sex, timing of uti episode, bacterial growth on urine culture, degree and bilaterality of the reflux, hydronephrosis, renal scar, and delayed ureteral excretion of refluxed contrast on voiding cystourethrogram (vcug). results: univariate cox survival-time regression showed that younger age  at first uti, a non-escherichia coli strain, bilateral and vur, high-grade vur, and hydronephrosis on initial ultrasonography (usg) significantly increased the risks of recurrent uti (p <.05 each). in multivariate analysis, timing of the uti episode (p = .015), a non-e. coli strain (p = .003), high grade (p = .012), and bilateral vur (p = .002) were independently associated with increased risk of recurrent uti. non-e. coli strains were identified in 60% and 33% of infants with and without recurrent uti, respectively. conclusion: during the first year of life, the earlier the first uti then the higher the chance is for recurrent utis. higher grades of reflux, bilateral vur, and the first infection by a non-e. coli  strain all significantly increase the risk of recurrent utis.

AB  == community-acquired infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing bacteria, particularly ctx-m-producing escherichia coli, are a rising concern worldwide. there are few data from japan on the acquisition of esbls in the community or the influx of these bacteria into hospitals. therefore, we examined the prevalence of esbl carriage in outpatients, in order to estimate  the spread of esbls in community settings. we analysed bacterial isolates from outpatient samples at our institution over a 9-year period from 2003 to 2011, with respect to epidemiological data on esbl-producing bacteria and their genotypic features. out of 5137 isolates, 321 (6.3 %) were esbl producers, including e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. the detection rates of the esbl-producing isolates gradually increased and reached 14.3, 8.7 and 19.6 % for e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis strains, respectively, in  2011. genotyping analysis showed that many of the strains produced multiple beta-lactamases, including tem, shv and ctx-m, rather than just ctx-m. the ctx-m-9 group was dominant among the ctx-m genotypes; further, the ctx-m-1 and m-2 groups were also detected (~30 %). this is believed to be the first report from japan showing a definite increase in esbl detection in outpatients. in addition, our findings suggest the simultaneous community spread of diverse esbl  genotypes, not an expansion of particular esbl genes.

TI  == carbapenem susceptibilities and non-susceptibility concordance to different carbapenems amongst clinically important gram-negative bacteria isolated from intensive care units in taiwan: results from the surveillance of multicentre antimicrobial resistance in taiwan (smart) in 2009.
AB  == to investigate the in vitro susceptibilities to various carbapenems amongst clinical gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients in intensive care units of ten major teaching hospitals in taiwan in 2009, a survey was conducted to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem and doripenem against isolates of enterobacteriaceae (n = 594), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 185), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 192) and burkholderia cepacia (n = 23) using the agar dilution method. susceptibilities were determined according to 2009, 2011 and 2012 mic breakpoints recommended by the clsi as well as 2012 mic breakpoints recommended by eucast. based on clsi 2012 criteria, the ertapenem susceptible rate was 93%, 81%, 68% and 92% for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens, respectively. all proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii isolates  were susceptible to ertapenem; however, 64% of p. mirabilis and all m. morganii isolates were non-susceptible to imipenem. meropenem and doripenem had better activities than imipenem against ertapenem-non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae isolates. e. coli, k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae with ertapenem mics>/=4 mg/l were synchronously not susceptible to imipenem, meropenem and doripenem. imipenem susceptibility was 65% and 29% for p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii, respectively.  additionally, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii isolates with imipenem mics>/=8 mg/l were also not susceptible to meropenem and doripenem. these data provide a better understanding of choosing appropriate carbapenem agents to treat infections caused by ertapenem-non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae as well as p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii isolates with imipenem mics>/=4 mg/l.

TI  == serum in vivo and in vitro activity of single dose of ertapenem in surgical obese patients for prevention of ssis.
AB  == background: despite progress made in the control of post-operative infections, the incidence of surgical site infections (ssis) is still high. an improper perioperative antibiotic use can expose patients to the risk of resistant microorganisms, and, in surgical obese patients, the drug dosage and infusion time are critical points. the aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness  of ertapenem in the prophylaxis of ssis in obese patients undergoing general or bariatric surgery. methods: a total of 63 obese patients, candidates for several  surgical interventions, were enrolled and divided into two groups. patients received antibiotic prophylaxis before surgery: the case group received venous infusion of ertapenem; the control group received standard prophylaxis. serum samples were tested for antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. results: after single-dose ertapenem in obese patients, we registered in vitro activity of sera against the growth of non-extended beta lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, and non-esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae. moreover, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus viridans  were also inhibited. we found in vivo efficacy according to clinical monitoring:  at the weekly and monthly follow-ups, one patient in the case group and six patients in the control group presented superficial incisional ssis. conclusions: these preliminary results are suggestive of the efficacy of ertapenem in perioperative prophylaxis of ssis in obese patients; however, they need to be confirmed by further investigations and more defined trials.

TI  == microbial uropathogens and their antibiotic resistance profile from hospitalized  patients in central alabama.
AB  == urinary tract infections remain a common problem in inpatient care. they are highly challenging to provide effective initial therapy without sensitivity data. the purpose of this study was to survey the uropathogens and their sensitivity profile at a hospital in central alabama and to guide experiential antibiotic selection. this was the first reported study on bacterial uropathogens and their  antibiotic resistance profile at this central alabama hospital. the survey period was between july 2009 and june 2010, a total of 473 urine cultures were reviewed  and susceptibility testing was determined using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) microdilution method. the results indicated that escherichia coli (45.5%) was the most common organism, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (18.2%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.1%), proteus mirabilis (7.8%), enterobacter cloacae (4.2%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (3.0%),  klebsiella oxytoca and citrobacter freundii (1.5%), morganella morganii (1.3%), and the other species (7.0%). for the 215 e. coli isolates, imipenem and cephalosporins (except for cefazolin) had the highest sensitivity (99-100%, p < 0.05). in contrast, ampicillin had the highest resistance (57%, p < 0.05) as compared to other antibiotics (about 30%) including ampicillin/ sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. the major finding of this study was that ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole had comparable sensitivity patterns for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae, the most common uropathogens at this central alabama hospital. additionally, this study found that e. coli had a resistant rate of 31% to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin compared to the resistance rate of 28.4% and 15.8% in earlier reports (lee et al. 2010; rattanaumpawan et al. 2010), likely indicating the continuing evolution of resistance due to antibiotic exposure. it is imperative to monitor the resistance of p. aeruginosa considering their high resistance to imipenem found in this study.

TI  == american journal of gastroenterology lecture: intestinal microbiota and the role  of fecal microbiota transplant (fmt) in treatment of c. difficile infection.
AB  == the vital roles that intestinal flora, now called microbiota, have in maintaining our health are being increasingly appreciated. starting with birth, exposure to the outside world begins the life-long intimate association our microbiota will have with our diet and environment, and initiates determination of the post-natal structural and functional maturation of the gut. moreover, vital interactions of  the microbiota with our metabolic activities, as well as with the immunological apparatus that constitutes our major defense system against foreign antigens continues throughout life. a perturbed intestinal microbiome has been associated  with an increasing number of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal diseases including clostridium difficile infection (cdi). it has become recognized that fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) can correct the dysbiosis that characterizes chronic cdi, and effect a seemingly safe, relatively inexpensive, and rapidly effective cure in the vast majority of patients so treated. in addition, fmt has been used to treat an array of other gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disorders, although experience in these other non-cdi diseases is in its infancy. more work needs to be done with fmt to ensure its safety and optimal route of administration. there is a conceptual sea change that is developing in our view of bacteria from their role only as pathogens to that of being critical to health maintenance in a changing world. future studies are certain to narrow the spectrum of organisms that need to be given to patients to  cure disease. fmt is but the first step in this journey.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

AB  == objectives: to evaluate the effect of plum juice on struvite calculus formation in vitro and to explore the effect of plum juice on urease-producing bacteria and urease activity. the compliance of available drugs is low for struvite calculus after surgical treatment and functional food may represent a good choice as an alternative therapy. materials and methods: antibacterial activity was assessed using a microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility test. urease activity was determined by measuring ammonia production. struvite crystals were induced by proteus mirabilis in artificial urine with natural and ph-adjusted plum juice. the optical density (od)(600) and ph of artificial urine were examined, as well the shape and weights of crystals. results: natural plum juice showed an antibacterial effect on urease-producing bacteria, whereas the ph-adjusted juice  did not. a concentration-dependent inhibition on urease activity was found for both natural and ph-adjusted juice. natural plum juice at a high concentration of 0.5% showed an obvious inhibition on the increase of od(600) and ph of the artificial urine, and crystal formation was prevented by up to or more than 8 h,  depending on the concentration of juice. crystal weight in the natural plum juice groups was decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. the ph-adjusted plum juice did not show any effect on od(600) and ph, although the presence of juice changed the crystal habit, indicating that the juice slowed the growth rate of crystals. conclusions: natural plum juice at high and moderate concentrations prevented the formation of p. mirabilis-induced crystals for up to 8 h in artificial urine. although ph-adjusted and low-concentration natural juice did not prevent the occurrence of crystals, both types of juice slowed their growth rate.

TI  == cross-reacting antibacterial auto-antibodies are produced within coronary atherosclerotic plaques of acute coronary syndrome patients.
AB  == coronary atherosclerosis, the main condition predisposing to acute myocardial infarction, has an inflammatory component caused by stimuli that are yet unknown. we molecularly investigated the nature of the immune response within human coronary lesion in four coronary plaques obtained by endoluminal atherectomy from four patients. we constructed phage-display libraries containing the igg1/kappa antibody fragments produced by b-lymphocytes present in each plaque. by immunoaffinity, we selected from these libraries a monoclonal antibody, arbitrarily named fab7816, able to react both with coronary and carotid atherosclerotic tissue samples. we also demonstrated by confocal microscopy that  this monoclonal antibody recognized human transgelin type 1, a cytoskeleton protein involved in atherogenesis, and that it co-localized with fibrocyte-like cells transgelin+, cd68+, cd45+ in human sections of coronary and carotid plaques. in vitro fibrocytes obtained by differentiating cd14+ cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells also interacted with fab7816, thus supporting the hypothesis of a specific recognition of fibrocytes into the atherosclerotic lesions. interestingly, the same antibody, cross-reacted with the outer membrane proteins of proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae (and possibly with homologous proteins of other enterobacteriaceae present in the microbiota). from all the other three libraries, we were able to clone, by immunoaffinity selection, human monoclonal antibodies cross-reacting with bacterial outer membrane proteins and with transgelin. these findings demonstrated that in human atherosclerotic plaques a local cross-reactive immune  response takes place.

TI  == epidemiology and genetic characteristics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria causing urinary tract infections  in long-term care facilities.
AB  == objectives: to assess risk factors for acquiring extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria (esbl+ gn) causing urinary tract  infections (utis) in long-term care facilities (ltcfs). methods: a prospective case-case-control study was carried out. in the first study, cases were defined as patients harbouring esbl+ gn, while, in the second study, cases were defined as patients harbouring esbl-negative (esbl-) gn. controls were selected by simple random sampling from patients without gn infection. esbl determinants were characterized by hybridization, and confirmed by pcr and sequencing. results: the study involved 297 ltcf patients (99 with esbl+ gn uti, 99 with esbl- gn uti and  99 without gn infection). esbl+ gn utis were due to escherichia coli (64%), proteus mirabilis (25%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (11%). the ctx-m-type enzymes were the most prevalent (73% of isolates), whereas tem- and shv-type esbls and ampc-type enzymes were less prevalent (10%, 2% and 15% of isolates, respectively). patients with esbl+ gn uti were more likely to have a permanent urinary catheter (or 15, 95% ci 6.9-30.5) and to have received antimicrobial therapy in the previous 30 days (or 4, 95% ci 1.2-10.9). after adjusting for type, dosage and duration of antibiotic, exposure to >/=7 days of quinolones and  third-generation cephalosporins was associated with the highest risk of esbl+ gn  uti development (or 7, 95% ci 1.2-40). independent risk factors for acquiring esbl- gn utis were previous surgical procedures (or 2, 95% ci 1.1-4) and the presence of a urinary catheter (or 8, 95% ci 4-16). no specific antibiotics remained a significant risk for esbl- gn uti after adjusting for demographic and  clinical risk factors. conclusions: exposure to >/=7 days of quinolones and third-generation cephalosporins significantly increases the risk of esbl+ gn uti. interventions aimed at improving compliance with antimicrobial stewardship principles should be further developed and implemented in ltcfs.

TI  == prevalence of extended spectrum beta lactamase (esbl) production in gram negative isolates from pyogenic infection in tertiary care hospital of eastern nepal.
AB  == emergence of extended spectrum beta lactamase (esbl) producing isolates has important clinical and therapeutic implications. a high prevalence of esbl production among multidrug resistant gram negative isolates has been reported in  literature from various clinical samples. since esbl detection is not done on a routine basis, its prevalence is not known till date. thus the present study was  undertaken to determine the prevalence of esbl production in gram negative isolates from pyogenic infection. a total of 300 gram negative bacilli isolated from the pus samples were identified phenotypically and antimicrobial activity was determined. esbl detection among the isolated organisms was done by phenotypic confirmatory disc diffusion technique recommended by clsi. of the 300  isolates, majority were escherichia coli; (107) followed by acinetobacter species; (55), pseudomonas species; (44), klebsiella pneumoniae; (32), proteus mirabilis; (26), enterobacter species; (25), citrobacter species; (9) and others; (2). the prevalence of esbl producing organisms was found to be 54 (18%); amongst which escherichia coli was 29 (53.7%), klebsiella pneumonia (14.8%), proteus mirabilis 7 (12.9%) and others 4 (7.4%). multidrug resistance were found in 92.6% of esbl producers. forty two were resistant to all the three third generation cephalosporins. the continuous surveillance of the esbl producing isolates is necessary to make aware about the correct treatment regimens and good infection control practices.

TI  == changing antibiotic susceptibilities of community-acquired uropathogens in greece, 2005-2010.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was to determine the distribution and changes  in the antibiotic susceptibilities of uropathogens isolated from adults with community-acquired urinary tract infections (ca-utis) in crete, greece, over a 6-year period. methods: this study was performed with isolates from outpatients with utis, collected between 2005 and 2010. isolates were identified by standard  methods and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion method and the vitek2 is an automated system used for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of microorganisms (biomerieux). to identify changes in susceptibility patterns, we compared results of the period 2005-2007 to those of the period 2008-2010. we also compared the antibiotic susceptibilities of isolates between males and females. results: a total of 4011  community-acquired uropathogens were isolated during the period of 2005-2010. escherichia coli was the most common organism and responsible for 68.9% of ca-utis, followed by proteus mirabilis (6.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (6.4%) and enterococci (6%). a significant increase in resistance of e coli isolates was noted for beta-lactams, monobactams, aminoglycosides, quinolones, and cotrimoxazole. the reverse trend was evident for nitrofurantoin. higher resistance rates of community-acquired e coli and non-e coli enterobacteriaceae were noted in males for ampicillin, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and quinolones. no significant sex differences were noted in the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of enterococci. conclusion:  there is a concerning trend for increasing resistance among e coli and non-e coli enterobacteriaceae responsible for ca-utis in crete in recent years likely due to the inappropriate use of broad spectrum antibiotics, as a substitute for precise  diagnostics and/or to increase the chances of therapeutic success.

TI  == epidemiology and genetics of ctx-m extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == ctx-m enzymes, the plasmid-mediated cefotaximases, constitute a rapidly growing family of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) with significant clinical impact. ctx-ms are found in at least 26 bacterial species, particularly in escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. at least 109 members in ctx-m family are identified and can be divided into seven clusters based on their phylogeny. ctx-m-15 and ctx-m-14 are the most dominant variants. chromosome-encoded intrinsic cefotaximases in kluyvera spp. are proposed to be the progenitors of ctx-ms, while isecp1, iscr1 and plasmid are closely associated with their mobilization and dissemination.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility to isepamicin of 6,296 enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates collected at a tertiary care university hospital in greece.
AB  == the reevaluation of "forgotten" antibiotics can identify new therapeutic options  against extensively drug-resistant gram-negative pathogens. we sought to investigate isepamicin in this regard. we retrospectively evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility to isepamicin of enterobacteriaceae sp. isolates from unique patients, collected at the microbiological laboratory of the university hospital of heraklion, crete, greece, from 2004 to 2009. susceptibility testing was done with the automated vitek 2 system. the breakpoints for susceptibility to isepamicin, tigecycline, and other antibiotics  were those proposed by the comite de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie (ca-sfm), the fda, and the clsi, respectively. a total of 6,296 isolates were studied, including primarily 3,401 (54.0%) escherichia coli, 1,040  (16.5%) klebsiella pneumoniae, 590 (9.4%) proteus mirabilis, and 460 (7.3%) enterobacter sp. isolates. excluding the species with intrinsic resistance to each antibiotic, antimicrobial susceptibility was highest for colistin (5,275/5,441 isolates [96.9%]) and isepamicin (6,103/6,296 [96.9%]), followed by  meropenem (5,890/6,296 [93.6%]), imipenem (5,874/6,296 [93.3%]), and amikacin (5,492/6,296 [87.2%]). the antimicrobial susceptibility of the 1,040 k. pneumoniae isolates was highest for isepamicin (95.3%), followed by colistin (89.3%) and meropenem (63.0%). regarding resistant k. pneumoniae isolates, susceptibility to isepamicin was observed for 91.1% of the 392, 87.7% of the 375, and 85.6% of the 111 isolates that were nonsusceptible to the carbapenems, all other aminoglycosides, and colistin, respectively. isepamicin exhibited high in vitro activity against almost all of the enterobacteriaceae species. it could particularly serve as a last-resort therapeutic option for carbapenem-resistant k. pneumoniae in our region, where it is endemic, as it does not show considerable cross-resistance with other aminoglycosides.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) in danish clinical isolates of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae: prevalence, beta-lactamase distribution, phylogroups, and co-resistance.
AB  == background: most gram-negative community-acquired and nosocomial infections are caused by escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, among which increasing resistance due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) is a major problem. we  present data from the first danish nationwide prevalence study on esbl-producing  e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis in blood and urine cultures from hospitals and the community. methods: during september and october 2007, 13 of 15 danish departments of clinical microbiology collected data and strains. confirmatory esbl test-positive isolates were sent to a central laboratory for species and esbl-phenotype confirmation, extended susceptibility testing, phylogenetic grouping of e. coli strains, and esbl gene characterization. results: during the study, blood samples from 18,259 patients and urine samples from 47,504 patients were subjected to culture. among 14,674 cultured isolates, 352 were confirmed to be esbl-producers. thus, the crude esbl prevalence was 2.4% (range 1.5% of e. coli in community urine to 6.6% of k. pneumoniae in hospital urine). an average of 7.2 esbl-producers per 100,000 consumed bed-days was calculated. of the 352 reported esbl-producers, 205 e. coli, 73 k. pneumoniae, and 1 p. mirabilis, were available for testing. ctx-m enzymes dominated, both in  hospitals and in the community, occurring in 92% of e. coli and 88% of k. pneumoniae, and with ctx-m-15 constituting 60% and 77%, respectively. conclusions: compared to 2003 data the esbl prevalence in denmark has increased significantly. in the esbl-producers, reduced susceptibility towards both gentamicin and ciprofloxacin was seen among 43% e. coli and 55% k. pneumoniae, leaving clinicians in these cases with only a carbapenem for the treatment of serious infections. part of this study was presented at the 20(th) european congress of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases, abstract p-1617.

TI  == using nucleic acid microarrays to perform molecular epidemiology and detect novel beta-lactamases: a snapshot of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases throughout the world.
AB  == the worldwide dissemination of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (esbl)- and carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae is a major concern in both hospital and community settings. rapid identification of these resistant pathogens and the genetic determinants they possess is needed to assist in clinical practice and epidemiological studies. a collection of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, and proteus mirabilis isolates, including phenotypically esbl-positive (n = 1,093) and esbl-negative isolates (n = 59), obtained in 2008-2009 from a longitudinal surveillance study (smart) was examined using an in vitro nucleic acid-based microarray. this approach was used to detect and identify bla(esbl) (bla(shv), bla(tem), and bla(ctx-m) genes of groups 1, 2, 9, and 8/25) and bla(kpc) genes and was combined with selective pcr amplification and dna sequencing for complete characterization of the bla(esbl) and bla(kpc) genes. of the 1,093 phenotypically esbl-positive isolates, 1,041 were identified  as possessing at least one bla(esbl) gene (95.2% concordance), and 59 phenotypically esbl-negative isolates, used as negative controls, were negative.  several esbl variants of bla(tem) (n = 5), bla(shv) (n = 11), bla(ctx-m) (n = 19), and bla(kpc) (n = 3) were detected. a new bla(shv) variant, bla(shv-129), and a new bla(kpc) variant, bla(kpc-11), were also identified. the most common bla genes found in this study were bla(ctx-m-15), bla(ctx-m-14), and bla(shv-12). using nucleic acid microarrays, we obtained a "molecular snapshot" of bla(esbl) genes in a current global population; we report that ctx-m-15 is still the dominant esbl and provide the first report of the new beta-lactamase variants bla(shv-129) and bla(kpc-11).

TI  == vaginal bacterial flora and cytology in proestrous bitches: role on fertility.
AB  == the study of canine vaginal cytology underwent limited evolution over the years.  presence and significance of inflammatory cells in vaginal smears are little considered aspects in the bitch. moreover, occurrence of vaginal bacteria in breeding bitches during follicular phase of the reproductive cycle, in absence of clinical signs of infection, involves the difficult question of antibiotics administration. the aim of this study was to relate findings in vaginal cytology  (presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, erytrocytes and bacteria) and microbial environment during proestrus with fertility outcomes (development of pregnancy, uterine infection, resorption, abortion and neonatal mortality). bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics normally used in small animal practice was also evaluated. bacteria isolated from vagina, in order of frequency, were enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, pasteurella multocida, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, e. coli haemolyticus, arcanobacterium pyogenes, streptococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. no mycoplasmas were observed. the present study showed that proestrous cytological aspects do not affect fertility. eosinophils were never detected, while erythrocytes were always detected. during diestrus, e. coli was found in all pregnant bitches that developed clinical symptoms of uterine disorders (n = 3), resulting in uterine infection, resorption or abortion, but without statistical significance. vaginal presence of streptococcus spp. in proestrus was instead negatively associated with development of uterine infections (p = 0.005). therefore, streptococcus spp. could have a protective competitive role against more dangerous pathogens affecting fertility of the bitch. among the 12 antibiotics tested, gram-negative bacteria showed a significant sensitivity towards the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid association (p = 0.038). however, antibiotic treatment before mating, on the basis of positive culture, yet in the absence of clinical signs, seems to be unnecessary besides harmful leading to imbalance in vaginal commensal flora with adverse effects on fertility. in conclusion, vaginal bacteria, neutrophils, lymphocytes and erytrocytes should be considered as physiological aspect in the bitch during  proestrus that does not require antibiotic therapy when asymptomatic.

TI  == [epidemiology and clinical features in diabetic patients with invasive infections treated at the clinical hospital of infectious diseases of iasi, romania, between 2008-2010].
AB  == infections in the diabetic population can be severe and life threatning at least  for two reasons: clinical signs are often torpid, masqued by chronical complications of diabetes leading to late recognition and medical adresability and also because of the inability to control established infection due to complex cell-mediated and humoral immunity deffects. the aim of the study was to evaluate the etiology, clinical features and outcome in diabetic patients with invazive disease. material and methods: a retrospective study was conducted between january 2008 and december 2010 at the clinical hospital of infectious diseases iasi among 75 diabetic patients with sepsis of microbiologically confirmed etiology (positive cultures from normally sterile sites) and sepsis with clinically suspected etiology (positive cultures from pus). cases with positive urocultures and coprocultures only, were excluded. results: from 75 diabetics, 56% were males, 90,7% being over 50 years. severe cases of sepsis (33/75, 44%) were associated more often with insulin-treated diabetes than non-insulin treated group (40% vs. 4%, p<0,005) probably because of multiple comorbidities associated as suggested by a high charlson score (6,09 vs. 4,09, p<0,05). there were 64 cases with confirmed etiology and 11 cases with clinically suspected etiology. staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli were the most common agents isolated,  being involved in 16 (21,3%) cases each, followed by coagulase negative staphylococci (14/18,66%), enterococcus spp.(6/8%), group b streptococcus (3/4%), streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., salmonella spp. (2/2,66% each), aerococcus viridans, streptococcus equi, klebsiella pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, sphyngomonas paucimobilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis (1/1,33%). multiple septic disseminations occured in 17(22,6%) cases and meningeal involvment was doccumented in 10(15,6%) cases. meticillin resistance was noted in 53,3% for invasive isolates of s. aureus. among 16 invazive strains of e. coli, 25% were resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporins, 17% to ciprofloxacin and 6,6% to aminoglycosides and colimycin. there were no e.  coli strains resistant to imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and aztreonam. the mean mortality rate was 14,66%. conclusions: the high level of resistance of s. aureus and e. coli to commonly used antibiotics and meningeal involvement imposes a multidisciplinary approach of the diabetic patient. proper knowledge of the pathogers involved in the potential invazive diseases is an important tool for successful treatment with appropriate empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents.

TI  == multi-centre evaluation of a phenotypic extended spectrum beta-lactamase detection guideline in the routine setting.
AB  == this study aimed to evaluate the routine setting performance of a guideline for phenotypic detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in enterobacteriaceae, recommending esbl confirmation with etest or combination disc for isolates with a positive esbl screen test (i.e. cefotaxime and/or ceftazidime mic >1 mg/l or an automated system esbl warning). twenty laboratories submitted 443 enterobacteriaceae with a positive esbl screen test and their confirmation test result (74%escherichia coli, 12%enterobacter cloacae, 8%klebsiella pneumoniae, 3%proteus mirabilis, 2%klebsiella oxytoca). presence of esbl genes was used as reference test. accuracy of local phenotypic esbl detection was 88%.  the positive predictive value (ppv) of local screen tests was 70%, and differed per method (vitek-2: 69%, phoenix: 68%, disc diffusion: 92%), and species (95%k.  pneumoniae-27%k. oxytoca). a low ppv (3%) was observed for isolates with automated system alarm but third-generation cephalosporin mics <2 mg/l. local esbl confirmation had a ppv and negative predictive value (npv) of 93% and 90%, respectively. compared with centrally performed confirmation tests, 7% of local tests were misinterpreted. combination disc was more specific than etest (91% versus 61%). confirmation tests were not reliable for p. mirabilis and k. oxytoca (ppv 33% and 38%, respectively, although npvs were 100%). in conclusion, performance of etests could be enhanced by education of technicians to improve their interpretation, by genotypic esbl confirmation of p. mirabilis and k. oxytoca isolates with positive phenotypic esbl confirmation, and by interpreting  isolates with a positive esbl alarm but an mic <2 mg/l for cefotaxime and ceftazidime as esbl-negative.

AB  == objective: uncomplicated cystitis is one of the most frequent community infections. we report the french results of the international aresc study on the  clinical aspects, epidemiology, and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens. patient and methods: female patients between 18 and 65 years of age, with symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis, were investigated clinically with urinalysis  and urine culture. uropathogens were identified and their susceptibility was tested with nine antimicrobials. results: four thousand and four hundred patients were included, 871 in france, forming the largest national cohort. urine culture  was positive (cfu>/=10(4)/ml) in 550 (63.1%); 533 (96.9%) presented with a single bacterium infection. 488 uropathogens, collected from 479 patients, were analyzed. the most frequent were: escherichia coli (83.8%), staphylococcus saprophyticus (4.3%), proteus mirabilis (3.1%), enterococci (1.2%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (1.0%). e. coli was highly susceptible to fosfomycin (99.0%) (97.1%), nitrofurantoin (97.3%), and ciprofloxacin (98.3%). the lowest susceptibility rates were found for ampicillin (60.9%) and cotrimoxazole (87.8%). fosfomycin (97.8%), ciprofloxacin (98.3%), and nitrofurantoin (91.5%) had the highest susceptibility rate. the lowest susceptibility rates were observed with ampicillin (61.4%) and cotrimoxazole (86.5%). conclusions: fosfomycin, pivmecillinam (not available in france), and nitrofurantoin have preserved their  in vitro activity and are suitable for empiric therapy. cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim+sulfamethoxazole) and fluoroquinolones are not usually recommended  as first intention drugs for the empiric therapy of uncomplicated cystitis, because of increasing resistance rates.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections in south african hospitals (smart study 2004-2009): impact of the new carbapenem breakpoints.
AB  == background: the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) follows trends in resistance among aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (gnb) isolated from complicated intra-abdominal infections  (ciais) in patients around the world. methods: during 2004-2009, three centralized clinical microbiology laboratories serving 59 private hospitals in three large south african cities collected 1,218 gnb from complicated intra-abdominal infections (ciais) and tested them for susceptibility to 12 antibiotics according to the 2011 clinical laboratory standards institute (clsi)  guidelines. results: enterobacteriaceae comprised 83.7% of the isolates. escherichia coli was the species isolated most commonly (46.4%), and 7.6% of these were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-positive. the highest esbl rate was documented for klebsiella pneumoniae (41.2%). overall, ertapenem was the antibiotic most active against susceptible species for which it has breakpoints (94.6%) followed by amikacin (91.9%), piperacillin-tazobactam (89.3%), and imipenem-cilastatin (87.1%), whereas rates of resistance to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin were documented to be 29.7%, 28.7%, 22.5%, and 21.1%, respectively. multi-drug resistance (mdr), defined as resistance to three or more antibiotic classes, was significantly more common in  k. pneumoniae (27.9%) than in e. coli (4.9%; p<0.0001) or proteus mirabilis (4.1%; p<0.05). applying the new clsi breakpoints for carbapenems, susceptibility to ertapenem was reduced significantly in esbl-positive e. coli compared with esbl-negative isolates (91% vs. 98%; p<0.05), but this did not apply to imipenem-cilastatin (95% vs. 99%; p=0.0928). a large disparity between imipenem-cilastatin and ertapenem susceptibility in p. mirabilis and morganella morganii was documented (24% vs. 96% and 15% vs. 92%, respectively), as most isolates of these two species had imipenem-cilastatin minimum inhibitory concentrations in the 2-4 mcg/ml range, which is no longer regarded as susceptible. conclusions: this study documented substantial resistance to standard antimicrobial therapy among gnb commonly isolated from ciais in south africa. with the application of the new clsi carbapenem breakpoints, discrepancies were noted between ertapenem and imipenem-cilastatin with regard to the changes in their individual susceptibilities. longitudinal surveillance of susceptibility patterns is useful to guide recommendations for empiric antibiotic use in ciais.

TI  == [characteristic of fluoroquinolone resistant clinical isolates of k. pneumoniae,  p. mirabilis and e. coli producing esbl and ampc beta-lactamases].
AB  == introduction: extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) are the predominant mechanism for acquired antibiotic resistance in enterobacteriaceae. during the past few years, increasing occurrence of plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases (pampcs) particularly in k. pneumonia, p. mirabilis and e. coli was reported. therefore, the aim of our study was to analyse of the diversity of plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases such as pampcs and esbls among clinical k. pneumonia, p. mirabilis and e. coli strains in poland. methods: a total of 19 clinical enterobacteriaceae strains (e. coli, n = 9; k. pneumoniae, n = 7; p. mirabilis, n = 3) resistant to third-generation cephalosporin were selected from  collection of fluoroquinolone resistant isolates recovered during a 6-months period in regular hospital in warsaw, poland. esbls and ampcs were detected by using phenotypic methods: double-disc tests (ddsts), mast id d68c test, sensitivity to cefoxitin, disk potentiation test (dpt) and tris-edta test. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of the bla(ampc), bla(ctm-m), bla(tem), and bla(shv), genes. pcr-products for these genes were sequenced. to determine the possible clonality of the tested isolates pfge with the xbai was performed. results: nine of 19 fluoroquinolone-resistant strains tested produced  extended-spectrum beta-lactamases of tem, shv and ctx-m families. these esbls were most commonly detected in e. coli. ampc beta-lactamases were produced by 6 tested strains, including 3 isolates of p. mirabilis. the ampc found in our study belonged to cmy and dha families, furthermore, 4 isolates of k. pneumoniae were found to co-produce both esbl and ampc beta-lactamases. xbai-pfge profiles pointed significant differences of tested strains. conclusion: horizontal transfer of genes encoding for acquired beta-lactamases such esbl and ampc seem to play primary role in dissemination of these resistance traits among fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical strains of enterobacteriaceae in poland.

TI  == a self-loading microfluidic device for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration of antibiotics.
AB  == this article describes a portable microfluidic technology for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of antibiotics against bacteria. the microfluidic platform consists of a set of chambers molded in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (pdms) that are preloaded with antibiotic, dried, and reversibly sealed to a second layer of pdms containing channels that connect the  chambers. the assembled device is degassed via vacuum prior to its use, and the absorption of gas by pdms provides the mechanism for actuating and metering the flow of fluid in the microfluidic channels and chambers. during the operation of  the device, degas driven flow introduces a suspension of bacterial cells, dissolves the antibiotic, and isolates cells in individual chambers without cross contamination. the growth of bacteria in the chambers in the presence of a ph indicator produces a colorimetric change that can be detected visually using ambient light. using this device we measured the mic of vancomycin, tetracycline, and kanamycin against enterococcus faecalis 1131, proteus mirabilis hi4320, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli mg1655 and report values that are comparable to standard liquid broth dilution measurements. the device provides a  simple method for mic determination of individual antibiotics against human pathogens that will have applications for clinical and point-of-care medicine. importantly, this device is designed around simplicity: it requires a single pipetting step to introduce the sample, no additional components or external equipment for its operation, and provides a straightforward visual measurement of cell growth. as the device introduces a novel approach for filling and isolating  dead-end microfluidic chambers that does not require valves and actuators, this technology should find applications in other portable assays and devices.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
AB  == the antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different ph values. consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of ph on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (sa) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (scmc) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa, mdr vibrio sp, mdr stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl) producing salmonella sp, esbl producing klebsiella pneumoniae, esbl producing proteus mirabilis, esbl producing escherichia coli and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (czoi)]. the mean overall czoi for  the gram-positive isolates at a ph of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. a mean czoi of 5 mm was recorded for the scmc dressing, which was slightly higher,  at 5.4 mm for the sa dressing. at a ph of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed  a similar activity. however, at a ph of 8.5 the mean czoi of the scmc dressing was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the sa dressing for a select number of isolates. the mean overall czoi for the gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the gram-positive bacteria. susceptibility to  silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. interestingly, when ph was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (p < 0.05). overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all ph ranges. in addition, the study showed that the performance  of both dressings apparently increased when ph became more acidic. the findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role ph plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative organisms from intraabdominal infections and evolution of isolates with extended spectrum beta-lactamases in the smart study in spain (2002-2010).
AB  == introduction: the smart (study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends) surveillance study records the antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative bacilli obtain from intraabdominal infections with special focus in isolates with extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). material and methods: the antimicrobial susceptibility of 8,869 isolates was analyzed by microdilution during the smart study performed in spain from 2002 to 2010. isolates were recovered in 16 centres. results: escherichia coli was the most prevalent pathogen (60.9% from intraabdominal infections acquired in the community and 49.9% in those from nosocomial origin) followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (8.9% vs 9.2%). pseudomonas aeruginosa was more common in intraabdominal infections from nosocomial origin (5.6% community and 8.6% nosocomial). frequency of esbl-producing isolates was: e. coli, 8.7%; k. pneumoniae, 8.4%; klebsiella oxytoca, 1.4%; and proteus mirabilis, 1.6%. overall, esbl-producing isolates were more frequently isolated from elderly patients (6.8% >60 years). ertapenem and meropenem were the most active antimicrobials (susceptibility range with eucast criteria, 89.0-100%) when considering all enterobacteriaceae isolates and also against esbl producers (95.5-100%). susceptibility of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and piperacillin/tazobactam was lower, particularly among esbl-producing isolates. nevertheless, ertapenem maintained a good activity (susceptibility >95%) in esbl-producers that were resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam or fluoroquinolones. conclusions: antimicrobial susceptibility data from the smart-spain study reinforce current therapeutic guidelines of intraabdominal infections that include ertapenem as the empirical choice for treatment. this is also supported by the high frequency of esbl-producers in our geographic area.

AB  == the latest threat of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria corresponds to the emergence of carbapenemase ndm-1 (new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase) producers, mostly in enterobacteriacae. five bla(ndm) (-1) -positive plasmids of  different incompatibility groups (incl/m, fii, a/c and two untypeable plasmids) from clinical enterobacteriaceae were evaluated for conjugation properties and host specificity. successful conjugative transfers were obtained using all tested enterobacterial species as recipients (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhimurium and proteus mirabilis) and all plasmid types. conjugation  frequencies varied from 1 x 10(-4) to 6 x 10(-8) transconjugants per donor. higher conjugation rates were obtained for two plasmids at 30 degrees c compared  with that observed at 25 and 37 degrees c. carbapenems used as selector did not lead to higher conjugation frequencies. none of the five plasmids was transferable to acinetobacter baumannii or pseudomonas aeruginosa by conjugation. this work underlines how efficient the spread of the carbapenemase bla(ndm) (-1)  gene could be among enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == development of an antibiogram in a long-term care facility.
AB  == objective: to create an antibiogram-a profile of an organism's susceptibility/resistance to a panel of antibiotics- for a long-term care facility to assess the prevalence of resistance of bacteria present at the facility. design: retrospective analysis of culture and sensitivity data from july 1, 2009, through june 30, 2010. setting: a long-term care facility in huntsville, alabama. patients and participants: residents of the long-term care facility that had one or more culture and sensitivity test performed. main outcome measure: susceptibility of bacteria to each antimicrobial tested. results: results were compiled and reported according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute analysis and presentation of cumulative antimicrobial susceptibility test data. the most commonly seen bacteria in our long-term care facility were escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis. resistance rates for these bacteria were high and included the presence of methicillinresistant s. aureus and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. conclusion: resistance rates were high among all organisms reported. this poses a serious threat to the health care team's ability to effectively treat residents of this facility. development of an antibiogram to assist physicians in antimicrobial selection will be beneficial in helping evaluate trends in drug resistance to current available treatments. implementing clinical pathways for empiric treatment of infections could improve  the ability to provide consistent treatment for all residents in the facility.

TI  == the effect of inappropriate therapy on bacteremia by esbl-producing bacteria.
AB  == objective: to describe the impact of empiric appropriate treatment and the risk factors associated with mortality in patients with bacteremia by e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis producing esbl. methods: data were reviewed in an 8-year retrospective study, and 128 bacteremias were found: 80 caused by e. coli  (62.5%), 28 by k. pneumoniae (21.9%) and 20 by p. mirabilis (18.6%). results: the initial antibiotic treatment, administered within 72 h after the first positive blood culture, was appropriate with carbapenems or other antimicrobial agents with documented in vitro sensitivity in 53.8 and 16% of patients, respectively. the overall mortality 21 days after diagnosis was 17.2%, and it was 14.9 and 35.2% for patients adequately and inadequately treated, respectively. at univariate analysis the p value for mortality with and without appropriate treatment was 0.05, and significant differences were found only for previous positive blood cultures (p = 0.004) and presence of septic shock at diagnosis (p  = 0.006). conclusion: in this case series there was a high rate of initial appropriate empiric treatment, and only a marginal impact on mortality was found  with regard to appropriate and inappropriate treatment. this report shows that the knowledge of esbl-producing characteristics varies widely among the different case series for reasons that still have to be clarified.

TI  == clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteremias in the emergency department.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing bacteria have been spreading from hospitals to communities. despite this, there are limited emergency department (ed) patient-based studies about these bacteremias. a retrospective matched case-control study with a ratio of 1:3 was conducted at a university hospital. the case group consisted of patients aged >16 years with esbl-producing bacteremias in the ed. patients matched for age and sex with non-esbl-producing bacteremias were sampled as the control group. finally, 64 episodes of esbl-producing escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis bacteremias were included in our study. the median age of case patients was 71 years, and 29 (45.3%) were males. the most common type of infection was urinary tract infection (71.9%), followed by intra-abdominal infection (12.5%). inappropriate empirical antibiotics therapy was prescribed in 87.5% of case patients, which was significantly higher than the control group (13.0%; p < 0.001). patients with inappropriate empirical antibiotics had a significantly longer hospital stay than those with appropriate empirical antibiotics (p < 0.001). multivariate analysis showed that hospital-acquired infection, urinary catheterization, and previous antibiotics use were independent risk factors for the acquisition of esbl-producing bacteremia. the 28-day mortality rate of case patients was 18.8%. whether they received appropriate empirical antibiotics treatment or not, there was no statistical difference in the mortality of patients with esbl-producing bacteremias (p = 0.167). to face these emerging multidrug-resistant bacteria and to guide the empirical antibiotics therapy, it is crucial for emergency physicians to recognize the characteristics and risk factors for esbl-producing organisms.

TI  == effective cohorting and "superisolation" in a single intensive care unit in response to an outbreak of diverse multi-drug-resistant organisms.
AB  == background: cohorting patients in dedicated hospital wards or wings during infection outbreaks reduces transmission of organisms, yet frequently, this may not be feasible because of inadequate capacity, especially in the intensive care  unit (icu). we hypothesized that cohorting isolation patients in one geographic location in a single icu and using enhanced isolation procedures ("superisolation") can prevent the further spread of highly multi-drug-resistant  organisms (mdro). methods: six patients dispersed throughout our surgical trauma  burn icu had infections with carbapenem-resistant, non-clonal gram-negative mdro, namely klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, aeromonas hydrophilia, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and providencia rettgeri. five of the six patients also had simultaneous isolation of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). under threat of unit closure and after all standard isolation procedures had been enacted, these six patients were moved to the front six beds of the unit, the front entrance was closed, and all traffic was redirected through the back entrance. nursing staff were assigned to either two isolation or two non-isolation patients. in accordance with the practice of semmelweis, rounds were conducted so as to end at the rooms of the patients with  the most highly-resistant bacterial infections. results: a few months after these interventions, all six patients had been discharged from the icu (three alive and three dead), and no new cases of infection with any of their pathogens (based on  species and antibiogram) or vre occurred. the mean icu stay and overall hospital  length of stay for these six patients were 78.3 days and 117.2 days respectively, with a mortality rate of 50%. conclusion: cohorting patients to one area and altering work routines to minimize contact with patients with mdro (essentially designating a "high-risk" zone) may be beneficial in stopping patient-to-patient  spread of highly resistant bacteria without the need for a dedicated isolation unit.

TI  == impact of adopting minimum inhibitory concentration as the determinant of susceptibility to cephalosporins and carbapenems in multi-drug resistant enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == the clinical and laboratory standards institute has recommended that enterobacteriaceae susceptibility to most cephalosporins and carbapenems be reported according to minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) alone. we analyzed our record of multi-drug resistant enterobacteriaceae to assess the impact of these changes. we compared susceptibilities of ceftriaxone-resistant enterobacteriaceae when using the 2009 and new 2010 mic standards. vitek2(r) (biomerieux), was used to assess the changes in susceptibility. klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus sp., and escherichia coli were the major species from urine,  sputum, blood, and other sterile sites. the new breakpoint for cephalosporins increased resistance in e. coli and p. mirabilis. many proteus categorized as resistant by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) detection or inferred resistance have mics to ceftriaxone </= 1 mcg/ml. new carbapenem breakpoints increased resistant klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. the increased ceftriaxone resistance from lowering breakpoints was almost balanced by the loss  of resistance in esbl isolates with mics </= 1 mcg/ml. mic-based susceptibility for multi-drug resistant enterobacteriaceae increases the number of resistant isolates. inferring mechanisms of resistance has a disproportionate effect on the susceptibility of proteus mirabilis to cephalosporins, and the mic-based standard has an almost equivalent but opposite effect on proteus mirabilis susceptibility  to carbapenems.

AB  == objectives: to analyse the mechanisms responsible for decreased susceptibility or resistance to carbapenems in several enterobacterial isolates recovered in 2009-10 in geneva university hospitals, switzerland. methods: pcr and sequencing  were used to identify beta-lactamases, 16s rna methylases and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes. the transferable properties of the plasmids were analysed, as well as their plasmid type. the strains were typed by multilocus sequence typing. results: three patients were found to be positive for ndm-1-producing enterobacterial isolates (one with escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, one with k. pneumoniae only and one with proteus mirabilis), where ndm-1 stands for new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1. the bla(ndm-1) carbapenemase gene was detected in all isolates in addition to genes encoding narrow-spectrum beta-lactamases (tem-1, shv-11, oxa-1, oxa-9 and oxa-10), extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ctx-m-15, cmy-16 and cmy-30), arma and quinolone resistance determinants (qnr). the bla(ndm-1) gene was located on conjugative inca/c- or incf-type plasmids. upstream of the bla(ndm-1) gene, part  of isaba125, previously identified in ndm-1-negative acinetobacter baumannii, was found. downstream of the bla(ndm-1) gene, variable sequences were found. conclusions: this work constitutes the first identification of ndm-1 producers in switzerland. interestingly, patients from whom these ndm-1-producing isolates were recovered had a link with the indian subcontinent or the balkans.

TI  == new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1: local acquisition in ontario, canada, and challenges in detection.
AB  == new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (ndm-1) is a recently identified metallo-beta-lactamase that confers resistance to carbapenems and all other beta-lactam antibiotics, with the exception of aztreonam. ndm-1 is also associated with resistance to many other classes of antibiotics. the enzyme was first identified in organisms isolated from a patient in sweden who had previously received medical treatment in india, but it is now recognized as endemic throughout india and pakistan and has spread worldwide. the gene encoding ndm-1 has been found predominantly in escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. we describe the isolation ndm-1-producing organisms from two patients in toronto, ontario. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an organism producing ndm-1 that was locally acquired in canada. we also discuss the evidence that ndm-1 can affect bacterial species other than e. coli and k. pneumoniae, the limited options for treatment and the difficulty laboratories face in detecting organisms that produce ndm-1.

TI  == potentiation of antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin by pelargonium graveolens essential oil against selected uropathogens.
AB  == the recent approach of using herbs and antibiotics in combination constitutes a strategy to overcome the problems of resistance and side effects associated with  conventional antibiotics. in the present study, the antimicrobial effect of pelargonium graveolens l' her essential oil in combination with ciprofloxacin was evaluated on uropathogens, namely, klebsiella pneumoniae kt2, proteus mirabilis prt3 and staphylococcus aureus st2. minimum inhibitory concentrations of p. graveolens essential oil and ciprofloxacin were determined by the microbroth dilution method and further, the interaction between these two agents was studied by a checkerboard method. the fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici) was calculated to be 0.375 for both k. pneumoniae kt2 and p. mirabilis prt3, while for s. aureus st2 it was found to be 0.5. the values of fici for the tested microorganisms were found to be </=0.5, which indicates synergism between p. graveolens essential oil and ciprofloxacin. the concave shaped curve in the isobolograms also depicted a synergistic effect of p. graveolens essential oil and ciprofloxacin against the tested microorganisms. hence, the synergistic action of p. graveolens essential oil and ciprofloxacin may be applied for the treatment of utis, which have hitherto been treated by using only synthetic drugs.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in urinary tract pathogens in canada from 2007 to 2009:  canward surveillance study.
AB  == from january 2007 to december 2009, an annual canadian national surveillance study (canward) tested 2,943 urinary culture pathogens for antimicrobial susceptibilities according to clinical and laboratory standards institute guidelines. the most frequently isolated urinary pathogens were as follows (number of isolates, percentage of all isolates): escherichia coli (1,581, 54%),  enterococci (410, 14%), klebsiella pneumoniae (274, 9%), proteus mirabilis (122,  4%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (100, 3%), and staphylococcus aureus (80, 3%). the rates of susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (sxt) were 78, 86, 84, and 93%, respectively, for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, and s. aureus. the rates of susceptibility to nitrofurantoin were 96, 97, 33, and 100%, respectively, for e. coli, enterococci, k. pneumoniae, and s. aureus. the rates of susceptibility to ciprofloxacin were 81, 40, 86, 81, 66, and 41%, respectively, for e. coli, enterococci, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus. statistical analysis of resistance rates (resistant plus intermediate isolates) by year for e. coli over the 3-year study period demonstrated that increased resistance rates occurred only for amoxicillin-clavulanate (from 1.8 to 6.6%; p < 0.001) and for sxt (from 18.6 to 24.3%; p = 0.02). for isolates of e. coli, in a multivariate logistic regression  model, hospital location was independently associated with resistance to ciprofloxacin (p = 0.026) with higher rates of resistance observed in inpatient areas (medical, surgical, and intensive care unit wards). increased age was also  associated with resistance to ciprofloxacin (p < 0.001) and with resistance to two or more commonly prescribed oral agents (amoxicillin-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and sxt) (p = 0.005). we conclude that frequently  prescribed empirical agents for urinary tract infections, such as sxt and ciprofloxacin, demonstrate lowered in vitro susceptibilities when tested against  recent clinical isolates.

TI  == [cmy-2-type plasmid-mediated ampc ss-lactamases emerging in tucuman, argentina].
AB  == in the last years, enterobacteriaceae such as klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli, have acquired resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (c3g) because of the presence of plasmid-mediated ampc ss-lactamases. the aim of this work was to detect plasmid ampc enzymes and to investigate the predominant types in our region. between march and july 2009, 733 consecutive isolates of enterobacteriaceae derived from hospitals and outpatient  centers were studied. susceptibility testing was performed by disk diffusion; one p. mirabilis and three e. coli strains showed resistance to cephamycins (cefoxitin) and c3g. an e-test to determine mic and a synergy test by aminophenylboronic disks were performed. enzymatic activity against cefoxitin was confirmed by a microbiological assay. a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for the detection of plasmid-mediated ampc genes of different groups was performed and a  462-bp amplicon was obtained when using primers directed against the cit group; the obtained sequences were compared to blacmy-2 sequences, showing 100% identity. the emergence of cmy-2-type plasmid-mediated ampc ss-lactamases indicated the importance of implementing systematic monitoring of these resistances to avoid potential clinical and epidemiological consequences.

TI  == phytochemical screening and antibacterial activities of vernonia ambigua, vernonia blumeoides and vernonia oocephala (asteraceae).
AB  == some vernonia species (vernonia ambigua, vernonia blumeoides and vernonia oocephala) used in northern nigerian traditional medicine, were subjected to phytochemical screening using standard procedures. the antibacterial activity using the disc diffusion method as outlined by the nccls was carried out on klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, corynbacterium ulcerans, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella dysentriae, proteus mirabilis  and pseudomonas fluorescence. the results of the antibacterial activity as indicated by zone of growth inhibition ranged from 14 to 27 mm for the crude ethanol extracts and chloroform fractions of the vernonia species being studied.  the activity of chloroform fraction of v. blumeoides was higher on c. ulcerans and k. pneumoniae (27 mm), while the chloroform fractions of v. oocephala and v.  ambigua were more active on p. mirabilis (27 mm) and s. typhi (22 mm), respectively. it is worth of mention that the chloroform fractions of the three vernonia species demonstrated activity (20 mm) against mrsa. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values ranged from 1.25-2.5 mg/ml for all the organisms tested. the mic of 1.25 mg/ml exhibited by the chloroform fractions on  both gram positive and negative bacteria indicates broad spectrumactivity of the  vernonia species being studied. phytochemical screening of the extracts/fractions revealed the presence of steroids/terpenes, saponins, flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins and glycosides. the antibacterial activity exhibited in this study may be attributed to flavonoids, saponinss or sesquiterpene lactones. the overall results indicate that the extracts/fractions are potent antibacterial preparations at least in vitro. this lends credence to the use of these plants for the treatment of various infectious diseases.

TI  == escherichia, klebsiella, enterobacter, serratia, citrobacter, and proteus
AB  == the gram-negative bacilli of the genera escherichia, klebsiella, enterobacter, serratia, citrobacter,and proteus(table 26- 1) are members of the normal intestinal flora of humans and animals and may be isolated from a variety of environmental sources. with the exception of proteus, they are sometimes collectively referred to as the coliform bacilli because of shared properties, particularly the ability of most species to ferment the sugar lactose. many of these microorganisms used to be dismissed as harmless commensals. today, they are known to be responsible for major health problems worldwide. a limited number of  species, including e coli, k pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, s marcescens,and p mirabilis, are responsible for most infections produced by this group of organisms. the increasing incidence of the coliforms, proteus, and other gram-negative organisms in diseases reflects in part a better  understanding of their pathogenic potential but more importantly the changing ecology of bacterial disease. the widespread and often indiscriminate use of antibiotics has created drug-resistant gram-negative bacilli that readily acquire multiple resistance through transmission of drug resistance plasmids (r factors). also, development of new surgical procedures, health support technology, and therapeutic regimens has provided new portals of entry and compromised many host  defenses.

TI  == broad-spectrum antimicrobial efficacy of peptide a3-apo in mouse models of multidrug-resistant wound and lung infections cannot be explained by in vitro activity against the pathogens involved.
AB  == although the designer proline-rich antimicrobial peptide a3-apo has only modest activity against escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii in vitro, in mouse  models of systemic and wound infections it shows superior efficacy compared with  conventional antibiotics. in this study, the efficacy of a3-apo in several additional mouse models was investigated, including staphylococcus aureus wound infection, mixed klebsiella pneumoniae-a. baumannii-proteus mirabilis wound infection and k. pneumoniae lung infection, mimicking blast wound infections, foot ulcers and ventilator-induced nosocomial infections, respectively. whilst the peptide practically did not kill the strains in vitro, when administered intramuscularly or as an aerosol it significantly improved mouse survival and reduced bacterial counts at the infection site and in blood. in the lung infection study, the blood bacterial counts following a3-apo treatment were as low as after treatment with colistin and were lower than after treatment with imipenem or amikacin. the wounds of treated animals, unlike their untreated counterparts, lacked pus and signs of inflammation. in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, a3-apo upregulated the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-4 and interleukin-10 by four- to six-fold. one of the mechanisms mediating the in vivo protective effects might be the prevention of inflammation around bacterial infiltration.

AB  == background: carbapenems are used to treat severe infections caused by multi-drug-resistant organisms, however, the emergence of carbapenem-resistant bacterial isolates is becoming an increasing therapeutic challenge. since the first klebsiella (k.) pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc)-producing k. pneumoniae was  reported in 2001, kpc-producing isolates have been found increasingly, specially  in enterobacteriaceae. the aim of this study was to characterize the mechanisms of a carbapenem-resistant proteus (p.) mirabilis. methods: a carbapenem-resistant p. mirabilis isolate was recovered from pleural drainage fluid of a patient admitted to surgical intensive care unit. antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the isolate was performed by disk diffusion according to clinical and laboratory  standards institute guidelines, and subsequent minimal inhibitory concentrations  were determined with the e-test. amplification of the bla(kpc) gene generated a positive band and the pcr products were sequenced subsequently. the plasmid of the isolate was extracted and was successfully transformed into escherichia (e.)  coli dh5alpha. results: the p. mirabilis isolate was resistant to all detected antimicrobial agents except tigecycline. kpc-2 was confirmed by dna sequence analysis. the transformant e. coli was resistant to carbapenems. further study demonstrated that upstream and downstream regions of bla(kpc-2) were identical to that observed in k. pneumoniae submitted to genbank from china in 2007. conclusion: carbapenem resistance in the p. mirabilis isolate in this study is mainly due to production of kpc-2.

TI  == incidence of postoperative eye infections in a private eye hospital in lagos, nigeria.
AB  == background: there is a dearth of information on postoperative eye infections in nigeria and most hospitals do not have an infection control program in place. objective: this study was done to investigate the incidence of post-operative eye infections, their potential sources and the preparedness of the hospital to prevent such infections. methods: a microbiological survey of all eye surgical procedures between march 2004 and may 2005 was performed. relevant samples were taken and cultured pre, intra and post operatively as required. definitions of infections were based on the centers for disease control (cdc) criteria. in the eye clinic, and operation theatre, infection control procedures and practices were audited using a pre-designed questionnaire. results: there were 2 cases of post operative eye infections (with haemophilus influenzae and corynebacterium species) during the one year of survey of 339 performed surgeries. s. aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (cns), and enterobacter spp were cultured from  the aqueous humour, as well as pre and post operative conjunctivae swabs of three other patients. eighty four (24.8%) other patients were colonized post operatively with cns (32), s. aureus (28), klebsiella pneumoniae (8), e. coli (5), corynebacterium species (3), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1) proteus mirabilis (4), enterobacter species alone (1) and in association with cns on 2 occasions. seventy eight percent of patients had contact with staff who consistently haboured staphylococcus species in their nares. four patients (0.11%) were exposed to surgeons whose hands were contaminated and one eye (0.003%) to contaminated antiseptic solution. facilities for hand washing and protective clothing were adequate but staffs were observed to perform an inadequate hands scrubbing. most items were heat sterilized. cleaning facilities were adequate and the environment was clean. the choice of antiseptic was correct, but that of disinfectant was considered incorrect. the ophthalmic equipments except the eye occluder were appropriately disinfected. staffs were not protected when handling  linen. infected linens were separated from soiled linens only in the theatre. they were not bagged, and were hand sluiced. the only type of waste that was properly handled was sharps. all waste types were stored together prior to final  disposal away from the public. conclusion: the incidence of post-operative infection was 1.69% and their sources were the patients' normal flora. other potential sources of post-operative eye infections identified included nares of hospital staff, hands of surgeon and hospital disinfectants. areas of deficiencies in infection control practices, which require proper infection control policies, include hand scrubbing practices, disinfection, linen management and waste handling.

TI  == three enzymatic steps required for the galactosamine incorporation into core lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == the core lipopolysaccharides (lps) of proteus mirabilis as well as those of klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia marcescens are characterized by the presence of a hexosamine-galacturonic acid disaccharide (alphahexn-(1,4)-alphagala) attached by an alpha1,3 linkage to l-glycero-d-manno-heptopyranose ii (l-glycero-alpha-d-manno-heptosepyranose ii). in k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and some p. mirabilis strains, hexn is d-glucosamine, whereas in other p. mirabilis strains, it corresponds to d-galactosamine. previously, we have shown that two enzymes are required for the incorporation of d-glucosamine into the core lps of k. pneumoniae; the wabh enzyme catalyzes the incorporation of glcnac  from udp-glcnac to outer core lps, and wabn catalyzes the deacetylation of the incorporated glcnac. here we report the presence of two different hexnac transferases depending on the nature of the hexn in p. mirabilis core lps. in vivo and in vitro assays using lps truncated at the level of galacturonic acid as acceptor show that these two enzymes differ in their specificity for the transfer of glcnac or galnac. by contrast, only one wabn homologue was found in the studied p. mirabilis strains. similar assays suggest that the p. mirabilis wabn homologue is able to deacetylate both glcnac and galnac. we conclude that incorporation of d-galactosamine requires three enzymes: gne epimerase for the generation of udp-galnac from udp-glcnac, n-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (wabp), and lps:hexnac deacetylase.

TI  == [the bacteriological profile of bacteriuria in residents of a long-term geriatric facility].
AB  == background: little is known on the bacteriological profile of consecutive urine samples in elderly patients institutionalized in nursing homes. aim: this retrospective study aims to characterize urinary pathogens, rates of isolation of the same pathogen in subsequent urine samples and predicting factors associated with such repeated isolations. data were retrospectively retrieved from medical charts of nursing home patients during a four-year period. the authors looked for changes in rates of positive cultures, changes in urine flora, in rates of repeated isolation of the same pathogens and the possible interrelations with the use of antibiotics. methods: a total number of 3229 urine cultures were studied,  1311 of which (43%) were positive and 493 out of these positive cultures (37.6%)  were treated with antibiotics. the rates of positive cultures increased consistently during the study period (p=0.003). e. coli (68.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis accounted for more than 90% of positive cultures. results: there was no difference with regard to pathogen types isolated from symptomatic or asymptomatic cases. the rates of recurrent bacteriuria, by the same pathogen isolated at baseline urine culture, were similar in treated and untreated cases. a regression analysis aiming to predict factors associated with  subsequent positive cultures had negative results, except for cases of untreated  bacteriuria with pseudomonas (ci 1.36-7.09, o.r. 3.11, p=0.006). conclusion: our  data support earlier studies underscoring the need to carefully consider the role of antibiotics and for better clinical guidelines for the treatment of bacteriuria in this population.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in gram negative bacteria.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) are a group of plasmid-mediated, diverse, complex and rapidly evolving enzymes that are posing a major therapeutic challenge today in the treatment of hospitalized and community-based patients. infections due to esbl producers range from uncomplicated urinary tract infections to life-threatening sepsis. derived from the older tem is derived from temoniera, a patient from whom the strain was first isolated in greece. beta-lactamases, these enzymes share the ability to hydrolyze third-generation cephalosporins and aztreonam and yet are inhibited by clavulanic acid. in addition, esbl-producing organisms exhibit co-resistance to many other classes of antibiotics, resulting in limitation of therapeutic option. because of inoculum effect and substrate specificity, their detection is also a major challenge. at present, however, organizations such as the clinical and laboratory standards institute (formerly the national committee for clinical laboratory standards) provide guidelines for the detection of esbls in klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis. in common to all esbl-detection  methods is the general principle that the activity of extended-spectrum cephalosporins against esbl-producing organisms will be enhanced by the presence  of clavulanic acid. carbapenems are the treatment of choice for serious infections due to esbl-producing organisms, yet carbapenem-resistant isolates have recently been reported. esbls represent an impressive example of the ability of gram-negative bacteria to develop new antibiotic-resistance mechanisms in the  face of the introduction of new antimicrobial agents. thus there is need for efficient infection-control practices for containment of outbreaks; and intervention strategies, e.g., antibiotic rotation to reduce further selection and spread of these increasingly resistant pathogens.

TI  == [etiology and sensitivity of uropathogens identified in uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections in women (aresc study): implications on empiric therapy].
AB  == background and objective: to determine the etiology and susceptibility of uropathogens identified in women with uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (uti). patients and methods: in a multicenter study (aresc) in 9 spanish hospitals, 803 female patients with uncomplicated cystitis were consecutively enrolled and evaluated to identify the uropathogens and their susceptibility to 9 antimicrobials. results: of 803 patients with uncomplicated cystitis, 784 patients were included. a positive urine culture was found in 87.7% of the samples. of the 650 pathogens isolated, escherichia coli (e. coli) was the most frequent (79.2%) followed by staphylococcus saprophyticus (4.4%), proteus mirabilis (4.3%), enterococcus faecalis (3.2%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (2.3%).  e. coli showed a high rate of susceptibility to phosphomycin (97.2%), nitrofurantoin (94.1%) and somewhat lower to ciprofloxacin (88.1%). fluorquinolone resistance rates were higher among postmenopausal women (17 versus 10%). e. coli was highly resistant to ampicillin (65%) and cotrimoxazole (34%) and 25% of the strains were resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanalic acid and cefuroxime. conclusions: in spain, e. coli shows high resistance rates to widely  used antimicrobial antibiotics. phosphomycin and nitrofurantoin have a high in vitro activity. taking into account practical aspects such as convenience (only one dose), and the influence of the amount of fluorquinolone use on enterobacteriaceae and other microorganisms resistance levels, phosphomycin trometamol represents the option of first choice for the empirical treatment of uncomplicated cystitis in women.

TI  == clinical and molecular epidemiology of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae in a long-term study from japan.
AB  == the detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing bacteria in japan are very low ( approximately 5%) compared with those obtained worldwide. further, the current trend of these bacteria in japan is not known, and few studies with longitudinal observations have been reported. to obtain epidemiologic data on esbl-producing bacteria, their genotypic features, and their antibiotic resistance patterns in japan, we analyzed bacterial isolates from hospitalized patients at our institution over the 7-year period from 2003 to 2009. of 2,304 isolates, 202 (8.8%) were found to be esbl producers, including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, and proteus mirabilis. the detection rates of the esbl-producing isolates gradually increased and reached 17.1% and 10.5% for the e. coli and k. pneumoniae strains, respectively, in 2009. genotyping analysis showed that approximately 90% of the esbl-producing isolates  carried the ctx-m genotype, in which the ctx-m-9 group was predominant, although  the ctx-m-2 group is considered to be the main genotype in japan; further, many of the strains produced multiple beta-lactamases. the detection rates of esbl-producing bacteria may tend to be high within a limited region in japan. a countrywide survey is required to understand the trend for esbl-producing bacteria at the national level. in addition, our findings suggest that the genotypes of the detected esbl producers are similar to those exhibiting a successful nosocomial spread worldwide.

TI  == enterobacteriaceae act in concert with the gut microbiota to induce spontaneous and maternally transmitted colitis.
AB  == disruption of homeostasis between the host immune system and the intestinal microbiota leads to inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). whether ibd is instigated by individual species or disruptions of entire microbial communities remains controversial. we characterized the fecal microbial communities in the recently described t-bet(-/-) xrag2(-/-) ulcerative colitis (truc) model driven by t-bet deficiency in the innate immune system. 16s rrna-based analysis of truc and rag2(-/-) mice revealed distinctive communities that correlate with host genotype. the presence of klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis correlates  with colitis in truc animals, and these truc-derived strains can elicit colitis in rag2(-/-) and wt adults but require a maternally transmitted endogenous microbial community for maximal intestinal inflammation. cross-fostering experiments indicated a role for these organisms in maternal transmission of disease. our findings illustrate how gut microbial communities work in concert with specific culturable colitogenic agents to cause ibd.

TI  == [evaluation of the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of microorganisms isolated from urine in the region of vale do sousa and tamega].
AB  == the urinary tract is one of the more common sites of bacterial infections, especially in women. urinary infection can be defined as an infection of urinary  tract structures which occurs, generally, as a consequence of the presence or colonization by urine bacteria. the aim of this study was to determine the etiology of urinary tract infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents in the region of vale do sousa and tamega. from february 2008 to january 2009, 18653 urine cultures were analyzed. from these cultures 1037 were positive. from this total of positive cultures, 18,3% were from males and 81.7% were from females. in bacteriological positive tests, 23 different strains of microorganisms were found. it was verified that the most frequent microorganism was escherichia coli, followed by proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. for antimicrobial susceptibility it was verified that escherichia coli showed low susceptibility to amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole. proteus mirabilis showed good susceptibility to cefotaxime and low to cotrimoxazole, amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin. for klebsiella pneumoniae was found only a reasonable susceptibility to gentamicin and enterococcus faecalis showed amoxicillin susceptibility. pseudomonas aeruginosa showed low susceptibility to all antibiotics analyzed with the exception of the combination piperacillin/tazobactam. in conclusion, this study shows that escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae are the  three main microorganisms that causes urinary infections in the region of vale do sousa and tamega. therefore, the antimicrobial empirically used must have a spectrum against enterobacteria, because they are the most likely to be present in urinary tract infections acquired in the community. a periodic analysis of the susceptibility profile should be performed over time for each region in order to  help in the beginning of the empirical antimicrobial treatment.

TI  == functional identification of the proteus mirabilis core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis genes.
AB  == in this study, we report the identification of genes required for the biosynthesis of the core lipopolysaccharides (lpss) of two strains of proteus mirabilis. since p. mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae share a core lps carbohydrate backbone extending up to the second outer-core residue, the functions of the common p. mirabilis genes was elucidated by genetic complementation studies using well-defined mutants of k. pneumoniae. the functions of strain-specific outer-core genes were identified by using as surrogate acceptors lpss from two well-defined k. pneumoniae core lps mutants. this approach allowed the identification of two new heptosyltransferases (wama and wamc), a galactosyltransferase (wamb), and an n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (wamd). in both strains, most of these genes were found in the so-called waa gene cluster, although one common core biosynthetic gene (wabo) was found outside this cluster.

TI  == selective strategy for urethral catheterization in febrile young girls to confirm urinary tract infection diagnosis.
AB  == background: urinary tract infections (utis) are a common source of bacterial infections in childhood. making a proper diagnosis is important but requires invasive urine collection techniques. we aimed to derive a clinical decision rule to identify non-toilet-trained febrile girls at high risk for utis to restrict urethral catheterizations (ucs) to this high-risk group of patients. methods: we  included all non-toilet-trained girls with a positive microscopic urinalysis from urine collected by sterile bag in a prospective cohort study to derive a model to predict uti assessed by urine culture from uc. results: thirty-seven patients were included. absence of another source of fever on examination and the child's  unusual behaviour were found to be independent predictors of uti. the corresponding model offered an 85% sensitivity [95% confidence interval (ci): 56-96], with a 59% specificity (95% ci: 30-83) for uti. the internal cross-validation by bootstrap led to an 85% sensitivity (95% ci: 68-100), and a 59% specificity (95% ci: 35-83). conclusion: we derived a clinical decision model to selectively identify young febrile girls at high risk for uti with a positive  microscopic analysis and propose uc with an 85% sensitivity, which would avoid approximately 60% of unnecessary ucs; although further validation is necessary before daily clinical use.

AB  == human beta-defensin 2 (hbd-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. we determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hbd-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to  eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. the native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hbd-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hbd-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. characteristically, a. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (mdr) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hbd-2 (vld(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-mdr (wild-type) a. baumannii  strains (vld(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). bactericidal activity of hbd-2 was less pronounced against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis  strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. these observations give  indications that the natural hbd-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting mdr phenotypes.

AB  == integrating conjugative elements (ices) are mobile genetic elements that can transfer from the chromosome of a host to the chromosome of a new host through the process of excision, conjugation, and integration. although sxt/r391-related  ices, originally demonstrated in vibrio cholerae o139 isolates, have become prevalent among v. cholerae isolates in asia, the prevalence of the ices among gram-negative bacteria other than vibrio spp. remains unknown. in addition, sxt/r391-related ices carrying genes conferring resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins have never been described. here we carried out a genetic analysis  of a cefoxitin-resistant proteus mirabilis clinical isolate, tum4660, which revealed the presence of a novel sxt/r391-related ice, icepmijpn1. icepmijpn1 had a core genetic structure showing high similarity to that of r391 and carried xis  and int genes completely identical to those of r391, while an is10-mediated composite transposon carrying bla(cmy-2) was integrated into the ice. a nucleotide sequence identical to the 3' part of isecp1 was located upstream of the bla(cmy-2) gene, and other genes observed around bla(cmy-2) in earlier studies were also present. furthermore, the nucleotide sequences of hot spot 2 and hot spot 4 in icepmijpn1 showed high similarity to that of hot spot 2 in sxt(mo10) and with a part of the nucleotide sequence found in p. mirabilis atcc 29906, respectively. icepmijpn1 was successfully transferred to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and citrobacter koseri in conjugation experiments. these observations suggest that ices may contribute to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes among clinically relevant enterobacteriaceae, which warrants careful observation of the prevalence of ices, including sxt/r391-related ices.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase production of selected gram-negative bacilli from two croatian hospitals: mystic study results.
AB  == the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) programme is a global, longitudinal resistance surveillance network that monitors the activity of meropenem and compares its activity with other broadspectrum antimicrobial agents. we now report the antimicrobial efficacy of meropenem compared to other broad-spectrum agents within the selective gram-negative pathogen groups from two croatian hospitals investigated between 2002-2007. a total of 1510 gram-negative pathogens were tested and the minimum-inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by broth microdilution method according to  clsi.there was no resistance to either imipenem or meropenem observed for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis in both medical centers. high resistance rates of k. pneumoniae to ceftazidime (18%), cefepime (17%) and gentamicin (39%) are raising concern. acinetobacter baumannii turned out to be the most resistant gram-negative bacteria with 81% resistant to ceftazidime, 73% to cefepime, 69% to gentamicin and 71% to ciprofloxacin. almost  20% of pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant to imipenem, 13% to meropenem, 69% to gentamicin and 38% to ciprofloxacin.the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in e. coli was 10% and in k. pneumoniae 49%. pcr and sequencing of the amplicons revealed the presence of shv-5 in nine e. coli strains and additional tem-1 beta-lactamase five strains. five k. pneumoniae strains were positive for bla(shv-5 )gene. eight esbl positive enterobacter spp. strains were found to produce tem and ctx-m beta-lactamases. plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases were not found among k. pneumoniae, e. coli and enterobacter spp. three a. baumannii strains from zagreb university center were identified by multiplex pcr as oxa-58 like producers. six a. baumannii strains from split university center were found to possess an isaba1 insertion sequence upstream of bla(oxa-51 )gene. according to our results meropenem remains an appropriate antibiotic for the treatment of severe infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. these data indicate that despite continued use of meropenem, carbapenem resistance is not increasing among species tested, except for a. baumannii, in the two study hospitals and suggest that clinicians can still administer carbapenems as a reliable and effective choice in managing serious nosocomial infections.

TI  == [detection of bla(ctx-m) beta-lactamase genes in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == widespread production of ctx-m type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) in enterobacteriaceae strains which are resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is the most remarkable example for rapid and global spread of plasmid mediated antimicrobial resistance in bacteria. consecutive 200 esbl producing enterobacteriaceae strains out of 1640 isolates that were obtained from clinical samples (167 urine, 11 wound, 7 bronchoalveolar lavage, 3 peritoneal fluid, 2 cerebrospinal fluid, 2 biopsy, 2 tracheal aspirate, 2 conjunctiva, 1 abscess, 1 catheter) between february to july 2009 in our laboratory were included to this study. among the 200 esbl positive isolates 141 (70.5%) were escherichia coli, 51 (26%) were klebsiella pneumoniae, 5 (2.5%) were enterobacter spp. and one of each (0.5%) citrobacter freundii, klebsiella oxytoca and proteus  mirabilis. esbl positivity was 11% among the 123 community-acquired strains and 13% among the 77 hospital acquired strains, the statistical difference being insignificant (p > 0.05). the prevalence of bla(ctx-m) beta-lactamase genes were  detected by multiplex polymerase chain reaction with the use of two general primer sets: ctx-ma1 and ctx-ma2 primers for the amplification of ctx-m-1, ctx-m-2 and ctx-m-9 enzymes group, and ctx825-f and ctx825-r primers for the amplification of ctx-m-8 and ctx-m-25 enzymes group. bla(ctx-m) genes were detected in 167 out of 200 strains (83.5%). ctx-m production rates in community and hospital acquired strains were found as 86.2% and 79.2%, respectively and no  statistically significant difference was detected (p > 0.05). ctx-m producing strains were either e. coli (n = 132) or klebsiella spp. (n = 35) and were expressing one of the enzymes from ctx-m-1, ctx-m-2 or ctx-m-9 groups. no strains carrying ctx-m-8 or ctx-m-25 group enzymes were detected. ctx-m production rates  in esbl producing e. coli strains in community and hospital were found as 92.5% and 95.7%, respectively, whereas the same rates for esbl producing klebsiella spp. strains were 67.8% and 66.7%. the difference between the ctx-m production rates of community and hospital acquired strains was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). in conclusion, ctx-m prevalence was found high in esbl producing strains of both e. coli and klebsiella spp. since bla(ctx-m) gene acquisition usually results in the emergence of multiple drug-resistant enterobacteriaceae strains, screening for ctx-m type esbl production in the laboratory has an important impact on monitoring the resistant strains which have endemic potential.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative nonurinary bacteria to fosfomycin and other antimicrobials.
AB  == background: fosfomycin is an antimicrobial commonly used in uncomplicated urinary tract infections. the microbiological effectiveness of fosfomycin against nonurinary gram-negative isolates has not been widely investigated. the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of fosfomycin against gram-negative nonurinary isolates in a region of greece where considerable antimicrobial resistance has been detected. methods: data were retrieved from the microbiological library of the university hospital of heraklion, crete. we retrospectively examined the susceptibility of all gram-negative nonurinary isolates to fosfomycin, collected over 1 year (january-december 2008). results: a total of 594 nonurinary gram-negative isolates were examined. susceptibility testing was performed for 270 (45.4%) enterobacteriaceae, 209 (35.2%) gram-negative nonfermentative bacilli and 115 (19.4%) other gram-negative bacteria. in total, 385 (64.8%) were susceptible to fosfomycin. specifically, all escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and salmonella species isolates were susceptible. additionally, 73 out of 94 (77.7%) klebsiella pneumoniae (including  carbapenem-resistant strains), 22 out of 32 (68.8%) enterobacter species and 51 out of 79 (64.5%) pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to fosfomycin. susceptibility was highest amongst isolates (45 of 61; 73.8%) taken from outpatients and lowest for intensive care unit isolates (78 of 161; 48.4%). isolates originating from the pediatric wards exhibited higher susceptibility (45 of 63; 71.4%) than isolates originating from other departments (340 of 531; 64%). conclusion: in a region with relatively high levels of antimicrobial resistance,  fosfomycin seems to exhibit good levels of in vitro activity against gram-negative nonurinary isolates. these data justify further evaluation of its potential clinical effectiveness.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in community-acquired urinary tract infections: prevalence  and risk factors.
AB  == background: this study aimed to identify the agents causing community-acquired urinary tract infections (cautis) and their resistance patterns and to investigate risk factors for esbl production. material/methods: patients diagnosed at the department of infectious diseases in the cukurova university school of medicine hospital with cauti between january 2006 and april 2007 were included prospectively. patient data were recorded and the microorganisms and their sensitivity patterns were evaluated by the university's central microbiology laboratory. results: a total 146 patients with cautis, 109 women and 37 men (mean age: 50.9+/-18.44 years), were included in the study. the most common infectious agents were escherichia coli (76.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (9.2%), proteus mirabilis (4.1%), and enterococcus spp. (1.6%). the ciprofloxacin resistance rate for e. coli was 35% and resistance to tmp-smz 43%, whereas amikacin resistance was substantially low (3%). four of 12 k. pneumoniae strains  were resistant to ciprofloxacin and 2 to tmp-smz. resistance to amikacin was not  found in the k. pneumoniae strains. esbl production was identified in 25 of the 112 e. coli and k. pneumoniae strains. a history of a uti within the last 6 months (p=0.029) and a history of frequent uti (p=0.028) were found to be significant risk factors for esbl production by univariate analysis. the only independent risk factor was a history of urinary system infection in the past 6 months (p=0.025) according to multivariate regression analysis. conclusions: these high resistance rates to antimicrobials and particularly the extremely high rate of esbl production in cauti should be carefully considered.

TI  == assessing the emergence of resistance: the absence of biological cost in vivo may compromise fosfomycin treatments for p. aeruginosa infections.
AB  == background: fosfomycin is a cell wall inhibitor used efficiently to treat uncomplicated urinary tract and gastrointestinal infections. a very convenient feature of fosfomycin, among others, is that although the expected frequency of resistant mutants is high, the biological cost associated with mutation impedes an effective growth rate, and bacteria cannot offset the obstacles posed by host  defenses or compete with sensitive bacteria. due to the current scarcity of new antibiotics, fosfomycin has been proposed as an alternative treatment for other infections caused by a wide variety of bacteria, particularly pseudomonas aeruginosa. however, whether fosfomycin resistance in p. aeruginosa provides a fitness cost still remains unknown. principal findings: we herein present experimental evidence to show that fosfomycin resistance cannot only emerge easily during treatment, but that it is also cost-free for p. aeruginosa. we also tested if, as has been reported for other species such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis, fosfomycin resistant strains are somewhat compromised in their virulence. as concerns colonization, persistence, lung damage, and lethality, we found no differences between the fosfomycin resistant mutant and its sensitive parental strain. the probability of acquisition in vitro of resistance to the combination of fosfomycin with other antibiotics (tobramycin and imipenem) has also been studied. while the combination of fosfomycin with tobramycin makes improbable the emergence of resistance to both antibiotics when administered together, the combination of fosfomycin plus imipenem does not avoid the appearance of mutants resistant to both antibiotics. conclusions: we have reached the conclusion that the use of fosfomycin for p. aeruginosa infections, even in combined therapy, might not be as promising as expected. this study should encourage the scientific community to assess the in vivo cost of resistance for specific antibiotic-bacterial species combinations, and therefore avoid reaching universal conclusions from single model organisms.

TI  == [characteristics of urinary tract infections in different patient subpopulations  and depending on the bladder emptying system].
AB  == introduction: to analyze the prevalence and etiology of urinary tract infection in patients with neurogenic bladder depending on the bladder emptying system used as compared to a population with no neurological impairment. to assess perception of urinary tract infection by patients with neurogenic bladder. materials and methods: an epidemiological and prospective study was conducted on 283 patients,  in whom a total of 283 urethral cultures were performed. of these, 106 came from  patients with neurological damage, 28 from a control group with no neurological impairment, 74 from patients admitted to the intensive care unit (icu) of our hospital, and 75 from patients who attended the emergency room for symptoms of acute urinary tract infection. the sensitivity and specificity of patient perception as indicative of urinary tract infection was analyzed using roc curves. results: positive urethral cultures were found in 66% of patients with neurological damage and 25% of control patients. within the neurological group, patients with the highest rates of positive urethral cultures were those with myelomeningocele (mmc) (81.5%) and spinal cord injuries (71.7%), with a statistically significant difference (p=0.01). the microorganism most commonly found in all subgroups was escherichia coli, followed by enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the neurological subgroup, enterococcus faecalis and proteus mirabilis in the control subgroup, and klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus agalactiae in the emergency room subgroup. in the icu subgroup, the most commonly found microorganism was enterococcus faecalis, followed by escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. sensitivity for perception by neurological patients as an indication of the presence of urinary tract infection was 97.2%, as compared to 80% in the control group. specificity was low in both groups. conclusions: e. coli was the microorganism found in positive urethral cultures from all subgroups, except in the icu group. the groups with the highest urinary tract infection rates were patients with mmc and spinal cord injuries. sensitivity and specificity (as measured using roc curves) for perception by neurological patients as an indication of the presence of urinary tract infection was higher in neurological patients than in the non-neurological control group (p=0.0004, area: 0.643).

TI  == potential airborne microbial hazards for workers on dairy and beef cattle farms in egypt.
AB  == this study was conducted to determine the concentration and frequency distribution of certain airborne micro-organisms on cattle farms and their potential health hazards to farm workers. the samples (60 air samples and 240 hand and nasal swabs from cattle farm workers) were collected from ten cattle farms (five dairy barns and five beef sheds) located in the sharkia governorate of egypt. air samples were collected for microbiological examination in liquid media using an all-glass impinger whereas those for fungal examination were placed on agar plates using slit air samplers (aeroscopes). the results showed that the overall means of total culturable bacterial and fungal counts were lower in the air of dairy cattle barns than in beef cattle sheds. identification of the isolated bacteria revealed the recovery of the following species (from dairy cattle barns versus beef cattle sheds): staphylococcus epidermidis (26.7% vs 36.7%), s. saprophyticus (20% vs 33.3%), s. aureus (10% vs 16.7%), enterococcus faecalis (23.3% vs 26.7%), enterobacter agglomerans (23.3 vs 13.3%), escherichia  coli, (16.7% vs 26.7%), klebsiella oxytoca, (10% vs 16.7%), k. pneumoniae (3.3% vs 0%), proteus rettegri (6.7% vs 13.3%), p. mirabilis (10% vs 10%), p. vulgaris  (3.3% vs 6.7%), pseudomonas species (6.7% vs 16.7%), respectively). mycological examination of air samples revealed the presence of aspergillus fumigatus (46.7%  vs 63.3%), a. niger (20% vs 36.7%), a. flavus (13.3% vs 26.7%), penicillium citrinum (16.7% vs 23.3%), p. viridicatum (13.3% vs 6.7%), p. capsulatum (3.3% vs 0%), cladosporium spp. (30% vs 56.7%), alternaria spp. (13.3 vs 23.3%), mucor spp. (6.7% vs 16.7%), fusarium spp. (3.3% vs 10%), absidia spp. (6.7% vs 10%), curvilaria spp. (10% vs 3.3%), rhizopus spp. (6.7% vs 13.3%), scopulariopsis (3.3% vs 6.7%), epicoccum spp. (0% vs 3.4%) and yeast (13.3% vs 20%), respectively. in addition, microbiological examinations of farm workers revealed  heavy contamination of their hands and noses with most of the micro-organisms detected in the air of cattle farms. the results showed that potential airborne microbial risks in beef cattle sheds were greater than in dairies.

TI  == extended spectrum beta-lactamase detection in gram-negative bacilli of nosocomial origin.
AB  == background: resistance to third generation cephalosporins by acquisition and expression of extended spectrum beta lactamase (esbl) enzymes among gram-negative bacilli is on a rise. the presence of esbl producing organisms significantly affects the course and outcome of an infection and poses a challenge to infection management worldwide. materials and methods: in the period from june 2007 to 2008, we collected 1489 samples from patients suspected of nosocomial infection.  the isolates were identified based on colony morphology and biochemical reaction. gram negative bacilli resistant to third generation cephalosporins were tested for esbl by double disc synergy test (ddst- a screening test)and then phenotypic  confirmatory test. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done by modified kirby bauer disc diffusion method. results: from the sample of 238 gram-negative  bacilli, we isolated escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii and enterobacter cloacae. following both methods, 34% isolates were esbl-positive. the esbl producing isolates were significantly resistant (p < 0.01) to ampicillin, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin as compared to non-esbl producers. multidrug resistance was significantly (p < 0.01) higher (69.14%) in esbl positive isolates than non-esbl isolates (21.66%). conclusion: high prevalence of esbl in our hospital cannot be ignored. esbl producers can be detected by ddst and phenotypic confirmatory test with equal efficacy. the sensitivity of screening test improved with the use of more than one antibiotic and addition of  one or two antibiotics would not increase cost and labor. we recommend ddst using multiple antibiotics in all microbiology units as a routine screening test.

TI  == photoantimicrobials as a potential local approach to geriatric utis.
AB  == aims: to test the efficacy of acceptable photoantimicrobial agents against bacterial pathogens implicated in complicated urinary tract infection (uti) in comparison with conventionally employed antibacterials. methods and results: toluidine blue (tb), methylene blue (mb), 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ala), trimethoprim and levofloxacin were employed in the study against the typical uti-implicated pathogens staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and proteus mirabilis. standard bacterial cell culture was used to assay the activity both in the dark and under 660-nm led-illuminated conditions. tb and mb were highly photoactive across the range and exhibited rapid kill rates, their effects being  assayed after 20-min illumination, rather than the 18-h incubation employed with  the other compounds. trimethoprim was inactive against all bacteria except pr. mirabilis, while levofloxacin maintained highly bactericidal activity throughout. ala required high concentrations for effective action but, for porphyrin production in situ, also required an 18-h incubation. conclusions: tb and mb were highly and rapidly photobactericidal in comparison with the remaining agents tested. significance and impact of the study: ubiquitous catheterization of geriatric patients offers a portal for light delivery to the urinary tract. the photoantimicrobial approach thus offers considerable potential.

TI  == notes on the microbiology of cholesteatoma: clinical findings and treatment.
AB  == anomalous proliferation of the cholesteatoma epithelium is caused by extrinsic factors such as toxins or bacterial antigens combined with lytic enzymes, lymphokines and cytokines released from the inflammatory infiltrate. this could explain the close relationship between the aggressiveness of cholesteatoma and repeated bacterial superinfection, therefore it is very important to know the bacteria involved in order to control the regrowth of skin following surgery, reduce the aggressive potential of the cholesteatoma and limit the incidence of complications. this study focused on 70 females and 80 males aged between 15 and  65 years, affected by cholesteatomatous otitis media; all underwent bacteriological examination of the auricular secretion. the floral bacteria which proved to play the most important role (60.3%) were the aerobic type and the highest levels were those of pseudomonas aeruginosa (31.1%) followed by staphylococcus aureus (19.1%), proteus mirabilis (7.7%), escherichia coli (1.4%)  and klebsiella pneumoniae (1%). anaerobic floral bacteria were found in a fairly  high percentage of cases (38.2%); in particular, anaerobic gram-positive cocci (peptococcus 12.4% and peptostreptococcus in 4.8% of cases), bacteroides (12.4%), clostridium (3.8%), fusobacterium (2.9%) and propionobacterium (1.9%) were isolated. in 3 cases of mycetes (1.4%) only aspergillus, in association with pseudomonas and staphylococcus, was identified. the study showed, then, how effective second generation fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporins  are (the latter being used in pre-adolescent children), the reason being that these antibiotics work not only on pseudomonas and staphylococcus, but also on the anaerobic bacteria.

AB  == background: extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) may not always be detected  in routine susceptibility tests. this study reports the performance of the cefepime-clavulanate esbl etest for the detection of esbls in enterobacteriaceae, including those producing ampc enzyme. methodology: consecutive non-duplicate isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis isolated from bloodstream infections from january to june 2008 were tested for esbl by both the standard clsi double-disk diffusion method using ceftazidime and cefotaxime disks and etests using ceftazidime/ceftazidime-clavulanate, cefotaxime/cefotaxime-clavulanate and cefepime/cefepime-clavulanate gradients. isolates were also tested for the presence of transferable ampc beta-lactamase by ampc disk test and the efficacies of the different etests in detecting esbl production were compared. results: a total of 113 bacterial isolates (61 k. pneumoniae, 50 e. coli, and 2 p. mirabilis) were recovered. respectively, 42 (37.2%) and 55 (48.7%) isolates were positive for esbl by the ceftazidime-clavulanate and cefotaxime-clavulanate combined disk tests. the cefepime/cefepime-clavulanate etest strip detected the maximum number of isolates (70/113, 61.9 %) as esbl-positive compared to the ceftazidime/ceftazidime-clavulanate and cefotaxime/cefotaxime-clavulanate strips, which detected 57 (50.4%) isolates each as esbl-positive. all three esbl etest strips were equally effective in detecting esbl in the isolates that were ampc negative. in the 66 (58.4%) isolates that co-produced ampc in addition to the esbl enzymes, cefepime/cefepime-clavulanate etest strip detected esbl in an additional 13 (11.4%) isolates as compared to the other esbl etest strips. conclusions: cefepime-clavulanate esbl etest is a suitable substitute to test for esbl production, especially in organisms producing ampc beta-lactamases.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli in patients with travellers' diarrhoea.
AB  == the identification of patients carrying extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing bacteria is important, since these patients are at risk of receiving inappropriate empirical therapy if they become infected. the purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of esbl-producing bacteria in patients with travellers' diarrhoea. patients with travellers' diarrhoea (n = 242) having delivered stool samples for the diagnosis of salmonella, shigella, yersinia or campylobacter, were also examined for esbl-producing escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. the overall prevalence of faecal carriage of esbl-producing bacteria was 24% (58/242). of the patients who  had travelled in europe, 3% (2/63) were found to be esbl carriers in comparison to 36% (50/138) of those who had travelled outside europe. esbl-producing e. coli was especially common among patients returning from india (11/14), egypt (19/38;  50%) and thailand (8/38; 22%). in total, 90% of the genes of the esbl-positive samples were of ctx-m type. the ctx-m-1 group dominated, followed by the ctx-m-9  group. the repetitive sequence-based pcr fingerprint pattern showed that there was no similarity between the esbl strains found. patients who have travelled outside europe are at high risk of being colonized with esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae, and, if infected, are also at risk of receiving inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy.

TI  == [investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  == sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. the aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. a total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. the antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in mueller-hinton broth according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guideline. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for  10 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 enterobacter aerogenes strains. the mic values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 32 microg/ml for k. pneumoniae atcc 700603, 32 microg/ml for e. coli atcc 25922 and  > 128 microg/ml for p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. sertralin has showed antibacterial  activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that mic values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == autoimmune diseases: solution of the environmental, immunological and genetic components with principles for immunotherapy and transplantation.
AB  == autoimmune diseases have environmental and genetic components. these are the microbial trigger, the immunity system component and the genetic component. here  we describe these components and how they interact. known microbial triggers are  streptococcus pyogenes for rheumatic carditis, proteus mirabilis for rheumatoid arthritis and klebsiella pneumoniae for ankylosing spondylitis. the immunity system component has been clarified by realisation that no autoimmune disease is  caused by loss of suppressor t cells. this leaves burnet's forbidden clones, clearly seen in graves' disease, as the immunological defect. with wide scope for clonal diversification by somatic gene mutations, to prevent frequent autoimmunity the immunity system is policed by the histocompatibility system. this dictates the immune response repertoire by deleting complementary clones (h  gene theory). we show molecular evidence of how specific histocompatibility antigens can predispose to an autoimmune disease by influencing choice of the microbial antigen to which the immunity system reacts. because of the unlucky random element in the somatic mutations involved in their development, forbidden  clones are unlikely to reappear in new immune repertoires developing after immune ablation and autologous bone marrow cell reconstitution, as observed clinically.  isolation of autoantigens and their attachment to cytotoxic moieties could provide specific immunotherapy for autoimmune diseases. kaplans's discovery that  xenografts can be accepted without rejection after immune ablation followed by autologous and xenogeneic bone marrow inoculation, could enable widespread use of pig grafts for humans.

TI  == microbial aetiologic agents associated with pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts.
AB  == pulmonary infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunosuppressed patients. the aim of this study was to determine the etiologic agents and predisposing factors associated with pneumonia infections in immunocompromised patients. cross-sectional survey of 100 immunocompromised patients due to hiv and mycobacterium tuberculosis infections were enlisted for the study. the patients completed a structured questionnaire to abstract information on demographic features and risk factors. sputum samples were collected from the patients with clinical suspicion of having pneumonia and the sputa examined by cultural methods. the tuberculosis patients had the highest number of isolates, 119 (70%) while those with co-infections of hiv/aids and tuberculosis had 41(24.1%) and those with only hiv infection were 10 (5.9%). the  distribution of isolates were as follows, staphylococcus aureus 63 (37.9%), streptococcus pyogenes 44 (25.9%), streptococcus pneumoniae 27 (15.9%), candida albicans 24 (14.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae 7 (4.1%), proteus mirabilis 4 (2.4%) and escherichia coli 1 (0.5%). those with previous history of alcoholism and tobacco smoking had relatively high isolates. this study demonstrated that secondary infections are prevalent in the immunocompromised patients due to hiv/aids and tb or co-infection with tb/hiv-aids. this may lead to drug resistance, dots or haart programme, thereby leading to high mortality and morbidity.

TI  == international spread and persistence of tem-24 is caused by the confluence of highly penetrating enterobacteriaceae clones and an inca/c2 plasmid containing tn1696::tn1 and is5075-tn21.
AB  == tem-24 remains one of the most widespread tem-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) among enterobacteriaceae. to analyze the reasons influencing its spread and persistence, a multilevel population genetics study was carried out on 28 representative tem-24 producers from belgium, france, portugal, and spain (13 enterobacter aerogenes isolates, 6 escherichia coli isolates, 6 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 2 proteus mirabilis isolates, and 1 klebsiella oxytoca isolate, from 1998 to 2004). clonal relatedness (xbai pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [pfge] and e. coli phylogroups) and antibiotic susceptibility were determined by standard procedures. plasmid analysis included  determination of the incompatibility group (by pcr, hybridization, and/or sequencing) and comparison of restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) patterns. characterization of genetic elements conferring antibiotic resistance included integrons (classes 1, 2, and 3) and transposons (tn3, tn21, and tn402).  similar pfge patterns were identified among e. aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis isolates, while e. coli strains were diverse (phylogenetic groups a, b2, and d). highly related 180-kb inca/c2 plasmids conferring resistance to kanamycin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, and sulfonamides were identified. each plasmid contained defective in0-tn402 (dfra1-aada1, aaca4, or aaca4-aacc1-orfe-aada2-cmla1) and in4-tn402 (aaca4 or dfra1-aada1) variants. these integrons were located within tn21, tn1696, or hybrids of these transposons, with is5075 interrupting their irtnp and irmer. in all cases, blatem-24 was part of an is5075-deltatn1 transposon within tnp1696, mimicking other genetic elements containing blatem-2 and blatem-3 variants. the international dissemination of tem-24 is fuelled by an inca/c2 plasmid acquired by different enterobacterial clones which seem to evolve by gaining diverse genetic elements. this work highlights the risks of a confluence between highly penetrating clones and highly promiscuous plasmids in the spread of antibiotic resistance, and it contributes to the elucidation of the origin and evolution of  tem-2 esbl derivatives.

TI  == comparison of 3 phenotypic-detection methods for identifying plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis strains.
AB  == background: plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases (pabls) have been detected in the strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, and salmonella spp. pabls may be difficult to detect and might interfere in the therapeutic and infection-control processes. although several pabl-detection methods based on phenotypes have been reported, the clinical and laboratory standards institute currently does not recommend a routine detection method for pabls. the aim of this study is to compare the performances of 3 phenotypic pabl  detection methods. methods: total 276 non-duplicated clinical isolates of e. coli (n=97), k. pneumoniae (n=136), and p. mirabilis (n=43) were collected from 14 hospitals in korea between april and june 2007 in a non-consecutive and non-random manner. multiplex pcr was performed to detect the pabl genes. further, 3 phenotypic detection methods-cephamycin-hodge test, tris-edta (te) disk test, and combination-disk test with 3-aminophenylboronic acid (ba)-were performed using cefoxitin and cefotetan disks. results: pabl genes were detected by multiplex pcr in 122/276 isolates, including 14/97 e. coli, 105/136 k. pneumoniae, and 3/43 p. mirabilis isolates. the combination-disk test with ba showed higher sensitivity (98.4%), specificity (92.2%), and efficiency (96.3%) than the cephamycin-hodge (76.2%, 96.1%, and 88.6%, respectively) and the te-disk (80.3%, 91.6%, and 87.9%, respectively) tests. conclusions: the combination-disk  test with ba is a simple, efficient, and interpretable test that can be applicable in clinical laboratories involved in the detection of pabls in clinical isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis.

TI  == crystalline bacterial biofilm formation on urinary catheters by urease-producing  urinary tract pathogens: a simple method of control.
AB  == the problem of catheter encrustation stems from infection by urease-producing bacteria. these organisms generate ammonia from urea, elevate the ph of urine and cause crystals of calcium and magnesium phosphates to form in the urine and the biofilm that develops on the catheter. in this study, a laboratory model was used to compare the ability of 12 urease-positive species of urinary tract pathogens to encrust and block catheters. proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and providencia rettgeri were able to raise the urinary ph above 8.3 and produce catheter-blocking crystalline biofilms within 40 h. morganella morganii and staphylococcus aureus elevated the ph of urine to 7.4 and 6.9, respectively, and  caused some crystal deposition in the biofilms but did not block catheters in the 96 h experimental period. isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and providencia stuartii were only capable of raising the ph of urine to a maximum of 6.4 and failed to cause crystal deposition in the biofilm. the most effective way to prevent catheter encrustation was shown to be diluting urine and increasing its citrate concentration. this strategy raises the nucleation ph (ph(n)) at which calcium and magnesium phosphates crystallize from urine. increasing the fluid intake of a healthy volunteer with citrated drinks resulted in urine with a ph(n) of >8.0 in which catheter encrustation was inhibited. it is suggested that this dietary strategy will be an effective means of controlling catheter encrustation, whichever bacterial species is causing the problem.

TI  == growth inhibition of foodborne and pathogenic bacteria by conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  == the influence of conjugated linoleic acid (cla) on the growth of some foodborne and pathogenic bacteria was examined. a potassium salt of cla (cla-k) was tested  against three gram-positive strains ( bacillus cereus , staphylococcus aureus , and streptococcus mutans ) and five gram-negative strains ( pseudomonas aeruginosa , salmonella typhimurium , vibrio parahemolyticus , klebsiella pneumoniae , and proteus mirabilis ). cla-k-mediated growth inhibition was evident for all tested strains, particularly the gram-positive strains. the ic(50) value of cla-k was 0.3 mm for b. cereus, 1.2 mm for s. aureus, and 0.3 mm  for s. mutans, whereas the value was 1.2 mm for k. pneumoniae, 1.2 mm for p. aeruginosa, 1.8 mm for s. typhimurium, 1.8 mm for v. parahemolyticus, and 2.4 mm  for p. mirabilis. the cla-k delayed the growth of all the tested strains at lower cla-k concentrations, but completely inhibited the growth at higher concentrations. all cells grown in the medium containing cla-k contained cla in their membranes and exhibited irregular cell surface and cell disruption, which were greater in gram-positive than gram-negative strains. higher lactic dehydrogenase activity (ldh), protein content, and malondialdehyde (mda) content  were evident in gram-positive strains than in gram-negative strains. these results suggest that the broad spectrum of growth inhibition by cla mediated through the lipid peroxidation of cla in the membranes and in the medium.

TI  == catheter-related urinary tract infection in patients suffering from spinal cord injuries.
AB  == urinary tract infection is commoner in patients with spinal cord injuries because of incomplete bladder emptying and the use of catheters that can result in the introduction of bacteria into the bladder. 145 patients suffering from spinal cord injuries, admitted to the institute for physical medicine and rehabilitation, centre for paraplegia of the clinical centre of the university of sarajevo, were included. the patients were divided in three groups according to the method of bladder drainage: group a (n=61) consisted of patients on clean intermittent catheterization; group b (n=54) consisted of patients with indwelling catheters; group c (n=30) consisted of patients who had performed self-catheterization. from a total of 4539 urine samples, 3963 (87,3%) were positive and 576 (12,7%) were sterile. more than 90% of the infected patients were asymptomatic. the overall rate of urinary infection amounted to about 2,1 episodes, and bacteriuria to 8,1 episodes per patient. 77% of infections (113/145) were acquired within seven days from catheterization. infection was usually polymicrobial; the greatest number of urine samples 1770/3943 (44,9%) included more than one bacterium. the vast majority of cases of urinary tract infection and bacteriuria are caused by gram-negative bacilli and enterococci, commensal organisms of the bowel and perineum, representative of those from the hospital environment. providencia stuarti (18,9%) being the most common, followed by proteus mirabilis (16,3%), escherichia coli (11,8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10,2%), klebsiella pneumoniae (8,1%), morganella morgani (5,4%), acinetobacter baumannii (4,6%), providencia rettgeri (3,5%). 15,7% of isolates were gram-positive with enterococcus faecalis (8,6%) as the most common. 55,3% of isolates were multidrug-resistant, and the highest rates of resistance were found among acinetobacter baumannii (87,8%), providencia rettgeri (86,7%), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (85,4%), providencia stuarti (84,3%) and morganella morgani (81,0%). lower rates of resistance were found in group c, i.e. patients on intermittent self-catheterisation. eradication of organisms was achieved in only 53 (10,05%) of patients; hence, antibiotic therapy had no or very low effect. significant correlations were found between the method of catheterization and the frequency of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections. the analysis of group c showed a rate of lower urinary tract infection and bacteriuria than the other two groups of patients. the objective of this study is the update of etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility in urinary tract infections in this group of patients. in addition, possible correlations between uti and the type of bladder  management were examined.

TI  == doripenem activity tested against a global collection of enterobacteriaceae, including isolates resistant to other extended-spectrum agents.
AB  == the emergence and rapid dissemination of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing isolates among enterobacteriaceae coupled with increasing prevalence of stably derepressed and plasmid-borne ampc producers have rendered broad-spectrum cephalosporins and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations less effective. this scenario has required the use of carbapenems for treatment of infections caused by such organisms. in this study, the in vitro activities of doripenem and comparator agents against enterobacteriaceae, including esbl- and ampc-producing strains, were evaluated. a total of 36 614 isolates collected from more than 60 medical centers (2000-2007) were included and tested for susceptibility using reference methods and interpretive criteria,  except for doripenem (product package insert). overall, doripenem inhibited 98.7% of all enterobacteriaceae tested at <or=0.5 microg/ml. esbl rates were higher among klebsiella pneumoniae (from 7.7% to 44.0%, varied by geographic region), followed by escherichia coli (3.6-14.0%) and proteus mirabilis (0.8-34.8%). derepressed ampc production-mediated resistance rates were highest among enterobacter cloacae (26.6-38.7%) compared with other species and generally higher for strains isolated in the asia-pacific and latin american regions. doripenem inhibited 94.3% and 93.7% of the esbl phenotype and derepressed ampc isolates, respectively, and these resistances had little adverse influence on doripenem mic(50) values (nil to 2-fold increases). the observed increase in ampc- and esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae necessitates a greater confidence on  carbapenem empiric therapy. doripenem could represent a valuable choice for broad-spectrum coverage of contemporary enterobacteriaceae isolates with widespread resistance mechanisms.

AB  == aim of the study: the aerial parts of thymus kotschyanus boiss. and hohen. (lamiaceae) and flower buds of dianthus caryophyllus l. (caryophyllaceae) have been traditionally implemented in the treatment of wounds, throat and gum infections and gastro-intestinal disorder by the indigenous people of northern iraq, although the compounds responsible for the medicinal properties have not been identified. in this study, antibacterial compounds from both plants were isolated and characterized, and the biological activity of each compound was assessed individually and combined. materials and methods: compounds were isolated and characterized from the extracted essential oils of both plants using different spectral techniques: tlc, ftir spectra and hplc. the minimum inhibitory concentrations mic values for the compounds were assessed individually and combined based on a microdilution and the checkerboard method in 96 multi-well microtiter plates. results: two known compounds were isolated from the essential  oils of both plants and were identified as thymol and eugenol. the isolated compounds were investigated for their single and combined antibacterial activities against seven selected pathogenic bacteria; staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. thymol mic values ranged from 15.6 to 250.0 microg/ml and b. cereus was found to be the most sensitive pathogen with a mic value of 15.6 microg/ml. eugenol achieved stronger mic values against  most tested pathogens and the best mic value (15.6 microg/ml) was observed against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes and k. pneumoniae whereas, s. aureus, p. mirabilis and e. coli were inhibited with a mic value of 31.2 microg/ml. combination results had antibacterial enhancement against most pathogens and the  best synergistic result was seen against p. mirabilis and e. coli. conclusions: the isolation of two antibacterial compounds from thymus kotschyanus aerial parts and dianthus caryophyllus flower buds validates the use of these species in the treatment of throat and gum infections, wound-healing and gastro-intestinal disorder.

TI  == changes in bacterial isolates from burn wounds and their antibiograms: a 20-year  study (1986-2005).
AB  == background: our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study  period. methods: microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. results: staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by escherichia coli (13.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (10.9%), enterococcus sp. (9.7%), enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), proteus mirabilis (2%) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). susceptibility of s. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. increases in methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). results for methicillin-resistant cns (mrcns) show an even greater increase. p. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility  against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. s. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and p. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. conclusion: in-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts. study object and methods: antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts was determined with reference cultures of staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, escherichia coli atcc 25922, klebsiella pneumoniae atcc 33499, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, proteus mirabilis atcc 12459, bacillus subtilis atcc 6633, bacillus cereus atcc 8035, and fungus candida albicans atcc 60193. microbiological tests were performed under aseptic conditions. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)--the highest dilution  of preparation (the lowest concentration of preparation) that suppresses growth of reference microorganisms--was determined. results: concentration of phenolic compounds in soft propolis extract that possesses antimicrobial activity against  gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis) is 0.587+/-0.054 mg and 0.587+/-0.054-0.394+/-0.022 mg (p>0.05) and in purified propolis extract--0.427+/-0.044 mg and 0.256+/-0.02 mg (p>0.05). klebsiella pneumoniae is most resistant to soft propolis extract when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 1.119+/- 0.152 mg and to purified propolis extract when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 1.013+/-0.189 mg (p>0.05). spore-forming bacillus subtilis bacteria are more sensitive to soft and purified propolis extracts when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 0.134+/-0.002 mg and 0.075+/-0.025 mg, respectively, and bacillus cereus--when the concentration is 0.394+/-0.022 mg and 0.256+/-0.02 mg (p>0.05). sensitivity of fungus candida albicans to soft and purified propolis extracts is the same as bacillus subtilis. encapsulated bacterium klebsiella pneumoniae is most resistant to antimicrobial action of soft and purified propolis extracts as compared with gram-positive staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis bacteria (p<0.05), gram-negative  escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis (p<0.05), spore-forming bacillus subtilis and bacillus cereus bacteria (p<0.05), and fungus candida albicans (p<0.05). there is no statistically significant difference between antimicrobial effect of soft propolis extract and purified propolis extract on gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, spore-forming bacteria, encapsulated bacteria, and candida fungus. conclusions: soft and purified propolis extracts possess antimicrobial activity. they could be recommended as natural preservatives in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.

TI  == ampc beta-lactamases.
AB  == summary: ampc beta-lactamases are clinically important cephalosporinases encoded  on the chromosomes of many of the enterobacteriaceae and a few other organisms, where they mediate resistance to cephalothin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, most penicillins, and beta-lactamase inhibitor-beta-lactam combinations. in many bacteria, ampc enzymes are inducible and can be expressed at high levels by mutation. overexpression confers resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins including cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone and is a problem especially in infections due to enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae, where an isolate initially susceptible to these agents may become resistant upon therapy.  transmissible plasmids have acquired genes for ampc enzymes, which consequently can now appear in bacteria lacking or poorly expressing a chromosomal bla(ampc) gene, such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis. resistance due to plasmid-mediated ampc enzymes is less common than extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production in most parts of the world but may be both harder to detect and broader in spectrum. ampc enzymes encoded by both chromosomal and plasmid genes are also evolving to hydrolyze broad-spectrum cephalosporins more efficiently. techniques to identify ampc beta-lactamase-producing isolates are available but are still evolving and are not yet optimized for the clinical laboratory, which probably now underestimates  this resistance mechanism. carbapenems can usually be used to treat infections due to ampc-producing bacteria, but carbapenem resistance can arise in some organisms by mutations that reduce influx (outer membrane porin loss) or enhance  efflux (efflux pump activation).

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens responsible for community-acquired urinary tract infections in an italian community.
AB  == this study aimed to establish the pattern of the antimicrobial resistance among the leading uropathogens causing community-acquired utis in an area of the region of apulia, southern italy. twenty-one thousand and two hundred outpatients, 6,893 males and 14,307 females, were enrolled. urinary isolates were identified by conventional methods and the susceptibility to 18 antimicrobials determined. recognized uropathogens escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis were isolated from 3175 positive samples, e. coli accounting for 68.04% of positive cultures. most overall resistance was to ampicillin, while the resistance rate to cephalothin was higher than that of third generation cephalosporins. although to a different degree, all the bacteria had an overall good susceptibility rate to quinolones as well as to fosfomycin but increased resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. our results confirm that e. coli is  the leading uropathogen and provide information about the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the main pathogens causing community-acquired utis. these findings should be taken into account to help maintain the safety and efficacy of treatment for community-acquired utis.

TI  == large scale multiplex pcr improves pathogen detection by dna microarrays.
AB  == background: medium density dna microchips that carry a collection of probes for a broad spectrum of pathogens, have the potential to be powerful tools for simultaneous species identification, detection of virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance determinants. however, their widespread use in microbiological diagnostics is limited by the problem of low pathogen numbers in  clinical specimens revealing relatively low amounts of pathogen dna. results: to  increase the detection power of a fluorescence-based prototype-microarray designed to identify pathogenic microorganisms involved in sepsis, we propose a large scale multiplex pcr (lsplex pcr) for amplification of several dozens of gene-segments of 9 pathogenic species. this protocol employs a large set of primer pairs, potentially able to amplify 800 different gene segments that correspond to the capture probes spotted on the microarray. the lsplex protocol is shown to selectively amplify only the gene segments corresponding to the specific pathogen present in the analyte. application of lsplex increases the microarray detection of target templates by a factor of 100 to 1000. conclusion:  our data provide a proof of principle for the improvement of detection of pathogen dna by microarray hybridization by using lsplex pcr.

TI  == a fatty acid messenger is responsible for inducing dispersion in microbial biofilms.
AB  == it is well established that in nature, bacteria are found primarily as residents  of surface-associated communities called biofilms. these structures form in a sequential process initiated by attachment of cells to a surface, followed by the formation of matrix-enmeshed microcolonies, and culminating in dispersion of the  bacteria from the mature biofilm. in the present study, we have demonstrated that, during growth, pseudomonas aeruginosa produces an organic compound we have  identified as cis-2-decenoic acid, which is capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms and of inhibiting biofilm development. when added exogenously to p. aeruginosa pao1 biofilms at a native concentration of 2.5 nm, cis-2-decenoic acid was shown to induce the dispersion of biofilm microcolonies.  this molecule was also shown to induce dispersion of biofilms, formed by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and the yeast candida albicans. active at nanomolar concentrations, cis-2-decenoic acid appears to be functionally and structurally related to the class of short-chain fatty acid signaling molecules such as diffusible signal factor, which act as cell-to-cell communication molecules in bacteria and fungi.

TI  == nationwide surveillance in taiwan of the in-vitro activity of tigecycline against clinical isolates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == tigecycline in-vitro surveillance in taiwan (tist), initiated in 2006, is a nationwide surveillance programme designed to monitor longitudinally the in-vitro activity of tigecycline against commonly encountered resistant bacteria. this study compared the in-vitro activity of tigecycline against clinical isolates of  resistant gram-negative bacteria determined by the broth microdilution and etest  methods. a total of 622 isolates were collected from patients treated at 20 teaching hospitals. tigecycline had excellent in-vitro activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli (n = 275) with mic(90) 0.5 microg/ml and a 99.6% susceptibility rate, and also against esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 324) with mic(90) 2 microg/ml and a 98.5% susceptibility rate. for esbl-producing proteus mirabilis (n = 15) the mic(90) was 4 microg/ml with a 73.3% susceptibility rate. for esbl-producing klebsiella oxytoca (n = 8) the mic(50) and mic(90) were 0.5 and 1 microg/ml, respectively, with a 100% susceptibility rate. limited agreement (<80%) was found between the broth microdilution and the etest methods when determining the in-vitro activity of tigecycline against esbl- producing k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca.

TI  == changing trend in antimicrobial resistance of pediatric uropathogens in taiwan.
AB  == background: there is growing concern regarding antimicrobial resistance worldwide, particularly of escherichia coli, and the first choice of an antimicrobial agent for empiric treatment of pediatric urinary tract infection (uti) is not well established. methods: the medical records from january 1991 to  december 2005 for all children under 18 years of age admitted to tri-service general hospital, taipei for their first uti were reviewed. two study periods, early (1991-2000) and late (2001-2005), were chosen during the 15 year period for evaluating the trend of antimicrobial resistance. results: of the 368 isolates, e. coli was the most common pathogen (81.0%), followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (6.5%), enterococcus spp. (6.0%), and proteus mirabilis (3.5%). of the 368 isolates, 77.4% were resistant to ampicillin, 44.6% to co-trimoxazole, 27.2% to cephalothin, 15.0% to gentamicin, and 8.4% to nitrofurantoin. in the early (1991-2000) and late (2001-2005) study periods, 199 isolates (54.1%) and 169 isolates (45.9%), respectively, were compared. the resistance to antimicrobial agents for overall pathogens in the early and late study periods, respectively, was as follows: 68.8% and 88.0% to ampicillin, 48.9% and 46.6% to co-trimoxazole, 26.8% and 28.9% to cephalothin, 16.2% and 19.8% to gentamicin, and 8.7% and 9.0%  to nitrofurantoin. conclusion: among commonly used antimicrobial agents for the treatment of pediatric uti, there is a trend towards increasing resistance to ampicillin and a persistently low resistance rate to gentamicin, cephalosporin, and nitrofurantoin. parenteral first-generation cephalosporins, gentamicin, and oral nitrofurantoin should be considered for first-line agents, given the resistance patterns of this study.

TI  == [fluoroquinolones and gram-negative bacteria: antimicrobial activity and mechanisms of resistance].
AB  == fluoroquinolones acts by interacting with type ii topoisomerases (dna gyrase and  topoisomerases iv). related to this mechanism of action, bacteria have developed  resistance mechanisms consisting in some target mutations (gyra/gyrb for dna gyrase and parc/pare for topoisomerase iv) or in a reduced access to the target itself, by either decreased permeability or augmented expression of efflux pumps, such as acrab and mexab. along with these classical mechanisms of chromosomal resistance, the presence of fluoroquinolones resistant proteins (qnr) has been recently evidenced, codified by transmissible genes by means of plasmids, especially in enterobacter spp., escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas proteus mirabilis and non fermenter gram-negative, like acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa, are not involved in such a kind of resistance. qnr proteins determine a slight increase in mic values, which often remains below the susceptibility breakpoint. more relevant is their impact on mpc values. additionally, new specific resistance mechanisms have been described. aac(6')-ib-cr represents the first enzyme able to inactivate, by acetylation, antimicrobials of two different classes, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. however, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, but not levofloxacin, are susceptible to  this enzyme action. finally, the presence of another resistance mechanism has been reported, an efflux-pump plasmid-mediated, codified by the qepa gene, which  acts by a selective mechanism. only hydrophilic fluoroquinolones, i.e. norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, but not all the other ones, i.e. levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, etc, are affected by this mechanism. in the light of these new information, it is clear that, in terms of bacterial resistance, it is not any more possible to assimilate one fluoroquinolones to another, since different molecules can be diversely active, due to the specific resistance mechanism.

TI  == characterization and sequence analysis of extended-spectrum-{beta}-lactamase-encoding genes from escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis isolates collected during tigecycline phase 3 clinical trials.
AB  == in concert with the development of novel beta-lactams and broad-spectrum cephalosporins, bacterially encoded beta-lactamases have evolved to accommodate the new agents. this study was designed to identify, at the sequence level, the genes responsible for the extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (esbl) phenotypes of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis isolates collected during the global tigecycline phase 3 clinical trials. pcr assays were developed  to identify and clone the bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(oxa), and bla(ctx) genes from clinical strains. isolates were also screened for ampc genes of the bla(cmy), bla(act), bla(fox), and bla(dha) families as well as the bla(kpc) genes encoding  class a carbapenemases. e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis isolates with ceftazidime mics of > or =2 microg/ml were designated possible esbl-producing pathogens and were then subjected to a confirmatory test for esbls by use of etest. of 272 unique patient isolates, 239 were confirmed by pcr and sequencing to carry the genes for at least one esbl, with 44% of the positive isolates harboring the genes for multiple esbls. in agreement with current trends for esbl distribution, bla(ctx-m)-type beta-lactamase genes were found in 83% and 71% of the esbl-positive e. coli and k. pneumoniae isolates, respectively, whereas bla(shv) genes were found in 41% and 28% of the esbl-positive k. pneumoniae and e. coli isolates, respectively. ninety-seven percent of the e. coli and k. pneumoniae isolates were tigecycline susceptible (mic(90) = 2 microg/ml), warranting further studies to define the therapeutic utility of tigecycline against strains producing esbls in a clinical setting.

TI  == evaluation of screening methods to detect plasmid-mediated ampc in escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis.
AB  == there are currently no standardized phenotypic methods for the screening and detection of ampc enzymes. this study aimed to evaluate different methods to detect ampc enzymes in escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., and proteus spp., comparing the results from two disk-based methods and an agar dilution method. ampc activity was determined for 255 clinical isolates by use of a three-dimensional enzyme assay combined with a multiplex pcr assay for plasmid-borne ampc genes. these results were compared against a disk-based inhibitor assay using various combinations of cefpodoxime and cefoxitin as antibiotic substrates and boronic acid or cloxacillin as an ampc inhibitor. the presence of enzyme induction by disk approximation was evaluated using imipenem,  cefoxitin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate as inducing agents against ceftazidime. finally, an agar dilution assay was performed, using cefoxitin with and without added cloxacillin. ampc activity was present in 49.8% of test isolates, 93.7% of  which were positive for plasmid-borne ampc genes. cit-like enzymes were predominant in e. coli, and dha-like enzymes were predominant in klebsiella spp.  the disk-based inhibitor tests performed better than the agar dilution assay, while detection of ampc by disk induction had a poor sensitivity. the cefoxitin-cloxacillin disk combination provided the best overall performance, with a sensitivity and specificity of 95%. this study confirmed the accuracy of disk-based inhibitor screening for ampc enzymes, which proved reliable at detecting cit- and dha-like plasmid-borne ampc genes. the methods are simple enough for introduction into clinical microbiology laboratories.

AB  == introduction: the aim of this work was to analyse the bacterial and fungal flora  in maxillary sinuses in patients operated due to the fess method. material and methods: studies were conducted on 110 patients, including 47 women aged 17-78 and 63 men aged 17-66, who underwent endoscopic surgical procedures due to chronic polypoid maxillary sinusitis between 2006 and 2007. 214 cultures were prepared altogether. during the endoscopic operation on paranasal sinuses, a cannula was introduced along the natural entrance and material for the culture and antibiogram was removed by suction. results: in the studied material of 214 cultures, 72 (33.6%) cultures obtained positive results, including 2 cases with bacterial and fungal floras present simultaneously (aspergillus fumigatus and aspergillus niger) in 38 operated patients. in 25 (34.5%) cultures we noted the presence of staphylococcus epidermidis, which was sensitive to the following antibiotics: cotrimoxazole, rifampicin, vankomycin, teicoplanin and levofloxacin. staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 22 (31.0%) cultures, showing 100% sensitivity to similar antibiotics like the previous one. another bacteria (escherichia coli) was cultured in 10 cultures (13.8%), in 70% of the cases every second bacteria was staphylococcus epidermidis with 100% sensitivity mainly to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. in 3 cultures (4.17%) we found klebsiella pneumoniae, with 100% sensitivity to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and 100%  resistance to penicillins. in three cases pseudomonas fluorescens and proteus mirabilis (4.17% each) were cultured with their sensitivity and resistance similar to those of klebsiella pneumoniae. two cases (2.8% each) in the cultures  were noted: citrobacter freundii, streptococcus oralis and hafnia alvei, which were 100% sensitive to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides whereas their resistance to penicillins and cefuroxime was as high as 100%. conclusion: in the  operated patients suffering from chronic polypoid maxillary sinuses we found 33.6% of positive results in the bacterial flora. this indicates that the changes were accompanied by an acute inflammatory condition, thus surgical procedures had to be followed by a guided antibiotic. the cultured bacteria demonstrated sensitivity to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and resistance to penicillins, which proves the abuse of penicillins in the treatment of acute inflammatory states of upper airways.

TI  == effect of triclosan on the formation of crystalline biofilms by mixed communities of urinary tract pathogens on urinary catheters.
AB  == the crystalline bacterial biofilms that encrust foley catheters compromise the care of many elderly and disabled patients. the aim of this study was to examine  whether the biocide triclosan can prevent encrustation by the mixed flora of uropathogens that commonly infect patients undergoing long-term catheterization.  models of the catheterized bladder were inoculated with communities of organisms  isolated from patients who were experiencing catheter blockage. the catheter retention balloons were inflated with water or triclosan (3 g triclosan l(-1) in  0.1 m sodium carbonate) and urine was supplied to the models for up to 7 days. the effect of triclosan was recorded on the viable cell populations, the ph of the residual urine and the times that catheters took to block. the extent of encrustation of the catheters was visualized by scanning electron microscopy. in  models inoculated with communities containing proteus mirabilis, triclosan prevented the rise in urinary ph that drives crystalline biofilm formation and catheter blockage. the biocide had no effect on populations of enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli and  klebsiella pneumoniae were eliminated from the residual urine and the catheters drained freely for the 7-day experimental period. in models inoculated with a mixed community containing providencia rettgeri, catheters inflated with triclosan continued to block rapidly. although k. pneumoniae and proteus vulgaris were eliminated from the residual urine, there was no effect on the viability of  providencia rettgeri. the results indicate that the triclosan strategy should be  limited to the treatment of patients who are infected with proteus mirabilis.

AB  == asymptomatic bacteriuria (asb) was followed in repeated prevalence surveys in a cohort of non-institutionalized residents (n=330), aged>or=80 y. urine samples were collected at baseline, and at 6, and at 18 months. phenotyping (pheneplate)  was performed on isolates of escherichia coli to evaluate strain relatedness. asb occurred in 19.0, 19.4, and 19.9% in women, and in 9.4, 9.6 and 7.9% in men, at baseline and at the 6- and 18-months follow-up, respectively, and asb was found at least once in 37% of women and in 20% of men. of those with asb at baseline, 60% also had asb in the 2 subsequent surveys. among those with persisting e. coli bacteriuria, 76% and 40%, respectively, carried the same strain at the 6- and 18-months follow-ups. in women, we found that the risk of developing a symptomatic urinary tract infection within 24 months was higher among those with  asb at baseline than in those without bacteriuria (p=0.019). asb is common and often persistent, but we found a high turnover of strains, indicating a high rate of recolonization.

TI  == [evaluation of the phoenix automated microbiology system for detecting extended-spectrum beta-lactamase in escherichia coli, klebsiella species and proteus mirabilis].
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to compare the bd phoenix (beckton dickinson diagnostic systems, usa) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) test with the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) esbl phenotypic confirmatory test by disk diffusion (clsi esbl test) in escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca and proteus mirabilis. methods: we tested 224 clinical isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca and p. mirabilis during may 2006 to march 2007. these isolates were examined by the phoenix and the clsi esbl tests simultaneously. for the isolates showing discordant results between the two tests, boronic acid disk test was performed to differentiate ampc beta-lactamase and esbl. results: among the 224 clinical isolates, 75 and 79 isolates were positive for esbl by clsi esbl test and phoenix test, respectively. having detected 4 more isolates as esbl-producers, phoenix test showed a 98.2% agreement with a 100% sensitivity and 97.3% specificity compared with clsi esbl test. among the four false positive isolates, three were  ampc-positive but esbl-negative. conclusions: the bd phoenix esbl test was sensitive and specific, and can be used as a rapid and reliable method to detect  esbl production in e. coli, klebsiella species, and p. mirabilis.

TI  == urease-positive bacteria in the stomach induce a false-positive reaction in a urea breath test for diagnosis of helicobacter pylori infection.
AB  == this study investigated the influence of urease-positive non-helicobacter pylori  bacteria on the results of a urea breath test (ubt) to evaluate the diagnostic utility of a ubt using film-coated [(13)c]urea tablets. the ubt was performed in  102 patients treated with a proton pump inhibitor and antibiotics for the eradication of h. pylori. urease-producing bacteria other than h. pylori were isolated and identified from the oral cavity and stomach. in 4/102 patients, the  ubt gave false-positive results. these false-positive results were found to be caused by the presence of urease-positive bacteria in the oral cavity and stomach. five bacterial species with urease activity (proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and staphylococcus aureus) were subsequently isolated from the oral cavity and/or stomach. as there was no correlation between the in vitro urease activity of urease-positive non-h. pylori bacteria and the ubt value, and all of the patients with a false-positive ubt result were suffering from atrophic gastritis, it is possible that the false-positive results in the ubt were a result of colonization of urease-positive bacteria and gastric hypochlorhydric conditions. thus, for the diagnosis of h. pylori infection using a ubt, the influence of stomach bacteria must be considered when interpreting the results.

TI  == optimal probe length and target location for electrochemical detection of selected uropathogens at ambient temperature.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated the clinical validity of the rapid detection of uropathogens by use of a dna biosensor. this assay involves the hybridization of  capture and detector probe pairs with bacterial 16s rrna target molecules to form a dna-rna sandwich on the sensor surface. horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody binds to the detector probe to enzymatically amplify the hybridization signal. these previous studies involved the hybridization of bacterial 16s rrna target sequences with 35-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs at 65 degrees c. achievement of point-of-care technology will be greatly facilitated by ambient-temperature detection. the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of probe length and target location on signal intensity using hybridization temperatures of 20 to 25 degrees c. signal intensity was found to vary dramatically with hybridization location in the species-specific bulge region of 16s rrna helix 18. probe pairs of as short as 10 nucleotides in length  were able to produce a significant electrochemical signal, and signal intensity was correlated with probe length for probes of 10 to 20 nucleotides in length. the sensitivity of the escherichia coli-specific 15-mer probe pairs was approximately 330 cells. these shorter probes allowed differentiation of klebsiella pneumoniae from proteus mirabilis 16s rrna target sequences differing  by a single nucleotide. a panel of oligonucleotide probe pairs ranging from 11 to 23 nucleotides in length was able to distinguish among seven groups of urinary tract pathogens. in conclusion, we have developed short oligonucleotide probe pairs for the species-specific identification of uropathogens at ambient temperature by use of an electrochemical sensor.

TI  == [influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial  susceptibility test results by the automated microbial systems].
AB  == the influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results was evaluated for the three automated microbial systems, walkaway-40 (dade microscan, west sacramento, ca, usa), vitek  2 compact (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) and raisus (nissui pharmaceutical, tokyo). in the evaluation, two different species or two different strains were mixed in serial ratios and adjusted to the inoculum cell suspension for the respective systems, and then tested for the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. for the species-identification, all the three automated systems experienced incorrect identifications others from the species inoculated with higher likelihoods (> 90%), e.g. enterobacter cloacae plus klebsiella pneumoniae resulted in k. ornithinolytica or e. aerogenes with 93% to  97% likelihoods at the mixing ratio 9 to 1. whereas, the mixings extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing and non-producing escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant (mrsa) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant (vr) and vancomycin-susceptible (vs) enterococcus faecalis, always resulted in correct detection of a small portion of resistant cells. however, minimum ratios of resistant cells for the correct detection varied by the systems, that is, raisus required 70% of mrsa, vitek 2 compact was 8%, and the walkaway-40 was 1%. also, when the cell suspension of vs  e. faecalis spiked with proteus mirabilis was tested, the walkaway-40 reported as being very rare biotype, but both vitek 2 compact and raisus reported as the test inoculum being vr e. faecalis. with these results, it can be concluded that: first, incorrect species-identifications others from the inoculated species easily occur when the inoculum contains different species even at the ratio visibly indiscernible on the primary isolation agar plate. secondly, the automated microbial systems always intend to detect antimicrobial resistant cells in the inoculum rather than to detect major susceptible cells to prevent us from  reporting very major error interpretation.

TI  == surveillance study in europe and brazil on clinical aspects and antimicrobial resistance epidemiology in females with cystitis (aresc): implications for empiric therapy.
AB  == background: uncomplicated cystitis in females is among the most frequent infections in community. objective: to determine clinical aspects, epidemiology,  and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens. intervention: patients were investigated clinically and with urinalysis and urine culture. measurements: this survey started in 2003 and ended in 2006 including 68 centres in nine european countries and in brazil. female patients between 18 and 65 yr with symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis were consecutively enrolled and clinically evaluated. uropathogens were identified and their susceptibility tested for nine antimicrobials. results and limitations: clinical data of 4264 eligible patients  were analysed. a positive urine culture was found in 74.6%. within the 3018 pathogens, escherichia coli (e. coli) was most frequent (76.7%), followed by enterococcus faecalis (4.0%), staphylococcus saprophyticus (3.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.5%), and proteus mirabilis (3.5%). e. coli showed the highest rate  of susceptibility to fosfomycin (98.1%) followed by mecillinam (95.8%), nitrofurantoin (95.2%), and ciprofloxacin (91.8%). the lowest rate was found for  ampicillin (45.1%). for the total spectrum the order was fosfomycin (96.4%), mecillinam (95.9%), ciprofloxacin (90.3%), and nitrofurantoin (87.0%). in all countries a susceptibility rate to e. coli above 90% was found only for fosfomycin, mecillinam, and nitrofurantoin. the susceptibility rates varied significantly from country to country (p<0.0001), except for fosfomycin, mecillinam, and nitrofurantoin. conclusions: despite wide cross-country variability of bacterial susceptibility/resistance rates to the other antimicrobials tested, fosfomycin, mecillinam, and nitrofurantoin have preserved  their in vitro activity in all countries investigated. they may represent good options for the empiric therapy of female patients with uncomplicated cystitis.

TI  == dissemination of the ctx-m-25 family beta-lactamases among klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae and identification of the novel enzyme  ctx-m-41 in proteus mirabilis in israel.
AB  == objectives: the ctx-m-25 family of beta-lactamases is a closely related family of enzymes found rarely in the world. we aimed to describe the occurrence and to understand the dissemination of this extended-spectrum beta-lactamase family among enterobacteriaceae strains in our hospital. methods: fifty-four ctx-m-producing enterobacteriaceae strains collected from 2000 to 2005 were screened for bla(ctx-m-25) genes by pcr and sequencing. genetic relatedness was analysed by pfge. antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by vitek-2. plasmids encoding bla(ctx-m-25)-type genes were isolated, transformed and analysed by southern blot using a bla(ctx-m-25) probe. chromosomal location of bla(ctx-m-25)-type was studied by i-ceui restriction analysis. the bla(ctx-m-25)  genetic environment was characterized by pcr mapping and partial sequencing. results: ten out of 54 ctx-m-producing isolates (18.5%) carried bla(ctx-m-25) genes, including klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), escherichia coli (n = 3), enterobacter cloacae (n = 1) and proteus mirabilis (n = 2). isolates were genetically unrelated. four beta-lactamases were found: ctx-m-25, ctx-m-26, ctx-m-39 and ctx-m-41, a new member of the family (accession no. dq023162) that differed from ctx-m-25 in three amino acids, ala80val, val106ile and ile126ser. bla(ctx-m-25)-type genes were plasmid-mediated in all genera but p. mirabilis, organized in a class i integron and located downstream of an isecp1 element. the  genes were encoded on different plasmids with varying degree of similarities. several antibiotic-resistant determinants conferring resistance to trimethoprim and aminoglycosides existed on the same integron. conclusions: bla(ctx-m-25) exists in israel in different enteric species. spread of these enzymes within and between species is due to transfer of plasmids with common regions and by dissemination of determinants encoding these genes. ctx-m-41, a novel member of this family, was identified in the chromosome of p. mirabilis.

TI  == effects of rifaximin on bacterial virulence mechanisms at supra- and sub-inhibitory concentrations.
AB  == rifaximin, a poorly absorbed rifamycin derivative, exhibited time-dependent bactericidal activity and at concentrations as low as 1/32 of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) caused morphological alterations in both susceptible and resistant bacterial strains. spontaneous rifaximin-resistant clones appeared with an incidence of 2.6 x 10(-7). the percentage of escherichia  coli cells cured of various plasmids ranged from: 4.5-70% (flac), 0-18% (pbp507), 7.7-43.8% (plasmid carrying esbl genes) and 22.4-41.6% (plasmid encoding toxin from etec mex264). 8.4-18.2 and <0.1-18% of staphylococcus aureus cells were cured (plasmid-mediated penicillinase), 9.5-58.6% of morganella morganii (esbl),  10.6-47.1% citrobacter freundii (esbl), 2.3-38.7% of proteus mirabilis (esbl) and 14.3-66.6% of klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl). rifaximin reduced plasmid transfer from donor to recipient strains by >99%. the mic of ceftazidime was reduced (2-4  dilutions) in the presence of rifaximin (0.5 x mic) in esbl producing strains. rifaximin lowered the viability and virulence of the bacteria even though they developed resistance to the compound. in conclusion, the present findings add new features to the microbiological characteristics of rifaximin and suggest that if  in vivo pathogens are exposed to sub-mics of the drug, not only are their physiological functions compromised, but gene virulence and antibiotic resistance are not fully expressed.

TI  == molecular survey of beta-lactamases conferring resistance to newer beta-lactams in enterobacteriaceae isolates from polish hospitals.
AB  == the first national survey of resistance to newer beta-lactams in nosocomial populations of enterobacteriaceae in poland was performed. the study covered all  nonrepetitive enterobacterial isolates cultured from specimens from inpatients in 13 regional secondary-care hospitals from november 2003 to january 2004. among 2,388 isolates, the predominant species was escherichia coli (59.6%), followed by proteus mirabilis (14.5%) and klebsiella spp. (8.5%). the frequency of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) was very high, with esbls present in 11.1% of all isolates and 40.4% of klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, the latter value greatly exceeding that for e. coli (2.5%). the contribution of outbreak isolates was significant, resulting, for example, in a particularly high rate of  esbl producers among serratia marcescens isolates (70.8%). the pool of esbl types was overwhelmingly dominated (81.7%) by ctx-m-like beta-lactamases ctx-m-3 (80.6%) and ctx-m-15, with shv types (17.5%; shv-2, shv-5, and shv-12) and sporadic tem-like enzymes (0.7%; tem-19 and tem-48) being the next most frequent. acquired ampc-type cephalosporinases were observed exclusively in p. mirabilis, in 20.5% of the isolates of this species (compared with the frequency of esbl producers of 11.5% of p. mirabilis isolates). all these cephalosporinases (cmy-12, cmy-15, and a novel variant, cmy-38) originated from citrobacter freundii. four isolates of e. coli (two isolates), k. pneumoniae (one isolate), and p. mirabilis (one isolate) produced class a inhibitor-resistant beta-lactamases (tem-30, tem-32, tem-37, and shv-49), being the first of such producers identified in poland. the survey documented both specific and more global characteristics of the epidemiology of the beta-lactamase-mediated resistance in enterobacteria from polish hospitals and demonstrated that the esbl frequency has reached an alarming level.

TI  == identification of an inhibitor of the murc enzyme, which catalyzes an essential step in the peptidoglycan precursor synthesis pathway.
AB  == the pathway for synthesis of the peptidoglycan precursor udp-n-acetylmuramyl pentapeptide is essential in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. this pathway has been exploited in the recent past to identify potential new antibiotics as inhibitors of one or more of the mur enzymes. in the present study, a high-throughput screen was employed to identify potential inhibitors of  the escherichia coli murc (udp-n-acetylmuramic acid:l-alanine ligase), the first  of four paralogous amino acid-adding enzymes. inhibition of atp consumed during the murc reaction, using an adaptation of a kinase assay format, identified a number of potential inhibitory chemotypes. after nonspecific inhibition testing and chemical attractiveness were assessed, c-1 emerged as a compound for further  characterization. the inhibition of murc by this compound was confirmed in both a kinetic-coupled enzyme assay and a direct nuclear magnetic resonance product detection assay. c-1 was found to be a low micromolar inhibitor of the e. coli murc reaction, with preferential inhibition by one of two enantiomeric forms. experiments indicated that it was a competitive inhibitor of atp binding to the murc enzyme. further work with murc enzymes from several bacterial sources revealed that while the compound was equally effective at inhibiting murc from genera (proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae) closely related to e. coli,  murc enzymes from more distant gram-negative species such as haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter baylyi, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not inhibited.

TI  == efficacy of ertapenem for consolidation therapy of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative infections: a case series report.
AB  == background: infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing gram-negative organisms are becoming increasingly common and present significant challenges in terms of treatment. carbapenems is the antibiotic class of choice for treatment of these types of infections. ertapenem  is the newest carbapenem, capable of being dosed once daily, and has some in vitro but little in vivo evidence supporting its use for the treatment of these resistant infections. objective: to examine the clinical and microbiologic outcomes associated with ertapenem therapy of esbl-producing escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis infections. methods: this was a retrospective case series that examined the clinical and microbiologic outcomes of 22 patients who received ertapenem for treatment of an esbl infection at rush  university medical center in chicago, il, during 2003-2005. results: the majority (16/22) of patients received ertapenem for consolidation rather than initial therapy. different antibiotics most commonly used were other carbapenems, piperacillin/tazobactam, and aminoglycosides. the most common infections treated  were lower urinary tract infections and osteomyelitis. clinical efficacy was determined in all 22 patients, with 20 (91%) patients having a positive outcome,  defined as either clinical improvement or clinical cure. the best clinical cure rate was seen with wound infections, where all 3 patients examined were found to  be clinically cured. microbiologic efficacy was determined in 7 patients, with 6  (85.7%) defined as microbiologic cure. one patient was found to be both a clinical and microbiologic failure and was also found to have developed an ertapenem-resistant strain of e. coli. conclusions: these results demonstrate potential microbiologic and clinical efficacy of ertapenem for treatment of esbl-producing infections and the need for a prospective, randomized study examining its efficacy versus that of other carbapenems.

TI  == evaluation of different laboratory tests for the detection of metallo-beta-lactamase production in enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == objectives: clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (91), escherichia coli (49), enterobacter spp. (27), proteus mirabilis (17), citrobacter freundii (2), providencia stuartii (3) and serratia spp. (5), with various mics of imipenem, were examined for production of metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls) with different phenotypic laboratory tests that have been previously published to detect mbls in pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. methods: a total of 194 (95 mbl-positive and 99 mbl-negative) clinical isolates with imipenem mics < or = 0.25 to > 256 mg/l were examined. all isolates were evaluated by the double-disc  synergy test (ddst), the combination disc test (cdt), the mbl etest and the modified hodge test. the presence of bla(vim) and bla(imp) genes was evaluated by in situ hybridization with specific probes and was certified by pcr. results: in  30 bla(vim)-positive isolates that exhibited mics of imipenem < or = 4 mg/l, mbl  etest could not be evaluated. cdt with ceftazidime and 1900 or 750 microg of edta, and ddst after applying an imipenem disc 10 mm apart from a disc containing approximately 1900 microg of edta, showed the highest sensitivity (97.9% to 100%) and specificity (87.9% to 96%) rates among the analysed procedures. cdt with imipenem and 1900 microg of edta exhibited a sensitivity of 94.7% and showed very good specificity (98%). conclusions: the cdt with imipenem/imipenem+0.5 m edta or ceftazidime/ceftazidime+0.2 m edta and the ddst with imipenem 10 mm apart from edta are the most effective methods for the detection of mbls in enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == fournier's gangrene: ten-year experience in a medical center in northern taiwan.
AB  == background and purpose: fournier's gangrene is a life-threatening infection. the  mortality is still high despite the rapid advancement of modern intensive care and surgical technique. in this study, we present our institution's recent experience with a large series of patients with fournier's gangrene. methods: a retrospective chart review was performed including 44 consecutive patients with fournier's gangrene over a 10-year period. results: the 44 cases comprised 39 males and 5 females, with a mean age of 55.5 years. the mean duration of hospitalization was 27.9 days. overall mortality was 22.7%. diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic liver disease, liver cirrhosis and chronic renal insufficiency were the 5 leading predisposing factors. liver cirrhosis was highly related to mortality (p=0.009). the etiologic origin of the gangrene was colorectal, urological and dermatological in 52.3%, 25.0%, and 11.4% of patients, respectively. the most common isolated pathogens were escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus spp., and proteus mirabilis. there were a total of 74 debridements. other related surgical procedures were reconstruction surgery (n = 18), colostomy (2), cystostomy (1), vasectomy (1), orchiectomy (1) and penectomy (1). major complications of fournier's gangrene, including respiratory failure, renal failure, septic shock,  hepatic failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, were significantly to mortality (p<0.05). conclusions: early diagnosis, intensive medical care (aggressive resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics), and prompt and repeated surgical intervention are the mainstays of treatment. liver cirrhosis in particular is a poor prognostic factor. reconstructive surgery should also be a consideration once the acute condition has improved. patients with comorbid condition, serious infection, and major complications should be treated carefully and aggressively.

TI  == isolation and purification of enterocin e-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as  antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis,  s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20  other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment  with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability  by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized  with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.

TI  == activities of the frog skin peptide, ascaphin-8 and its lysine-substituted analogs against clinical isolates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing bacteria.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing gram-negative bacteria are becoming increasingly prevalent and their antibiotic resistance necessitates novel therapeutic intervention. ascaphin-8 is a cationic alpha-helical peptide that shows broad-spectrum antibacterial activity but is also toxic to human erythrocytes (lc(50)= 55 microm). this study assesses the activity of ascaphin-8, and a series of l-lysine-substituted analogs, against a range of clinical isolates of esbl-producing bacteria. all esbl-producing escherichia coli (mic=1.5-6 microm) and klebsiella pneumoniae (mic=12.5-25 microm) strains tested  were susceptible to ascaphin-8, as well as a group of miscellaneous esbl-producing strains (citrobacter, salmonella, serratia, shigella spp.) (mic< or = 25 microm). the lys4- and lys8-substituted analogs were generally the most potent against bacteria but showed the highest hemolytic activity. however, the lys10, lys14, and lys18 analogs also displayed potent antibacterial activity while showing very low hemolytic activity (lc50> 500 microm). an unexpected finding was the susceptibility of esbl-producing proteus mirabilis strains to ascaphin-8 (mic=12.5-25 microm) and its lys4-substituted analog (mic= 6 microm),  although non-esbl isolates of this organism were resistant to these peptides (mic> 100 microm).

TI  == detection of plasmid-mediated ampc in escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis.
AB  == aims: this study investigated the prevalence of plasmid-mediated ampc production  in selected clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella species and proteus mirabilis, and compared the results of boronic acid disc screening with conventional susceptibility testing for the detection of ampc-positive isolates.  methods: e coli, klebsiella species and p mirabilis with reduced susceptibility to amoxycillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime and cephalexin, but without phenotypic evidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were screened for ampc activity using enzyme-extraction methods. the presence of plasmid-mediated ampc was determined by multiplex pcr. antibiotic susceptibilities were determined using both disc and dilution-based methods. a disc-based screening method for detection of ampc-producing strains was evaluated using boronic acid as an inhibitor of ampc, and cefoxitin as the antibiotic substrate. results: plasmid-mediated ampc was present in 26% of study isolates, with cmy-like enzymes detected predominantly in e coli and dha-like enzymes predominantly in klebsiella pneumoniae. current susceptibility methods failed to detect a significant proportion of plasmid-mediated ampc-producing isolates, with 33% of such strains  interpreted as susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins using current clinical laboratory standards institute breakpoints. the boronic acid disc method showed sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 98% respectively in detecting ampc-positive isolates. conclusion: the prevalence of plasmid-mediated ampc was high in the study population, and may be missed by conventional susceptibility testing methods. inhibitor-based screening methods would improve detection of this emerging resistance phenotype.

TI  == drug sensitivity patterns of bacterial isolates from septic post-operative wounds in a regional referral hospital in uganda.
AB  == background: wound infections have been a problem in the field of surgery for a long time. advances in control of infections have not completely eradicated this  problem because of development of drug resistance. antimicrobial resistance can increase complications and costs associated with procedures and treatment. objective: a study was carried out on drug sensitivity patterns of bacterial isolates from septic postoperative wounds in jinja hospital, uganda. this study was designed to determine the distribution of bacterial pathogens isolated from septic post-operative wounds and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. method: specimens of pus swabs were collected aseptically and analysed in the laboratory. colony characteristics and grams technique were used to differentiate the organisms. biochemical tests were done to confirm the species of the organisms. sensitivity testing was done on the isolates using the disk diffusion  method. results: pathogenic bacteria were recovered from 58.5% of the specimens.  the isolates were: s.aureus (45.1%), coliforms (16.9%), proteus mirabilis (11.3%), p.aeruginosa (9.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (7.0%) and enterobacter spp (2.82%). most of the organisms were sensitive to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. there was resistance to ampicillin, amoxycillin and chloramphenicol. staphylococcus aureus was generally sensitive to gentamicin (87.5%), ciprofloxacin (68.7%) and methicillin (75%), but resistant to erythromycin (56.2%) and ampicillin (97%). most of the gram-negative bacteria isolated (coliforms, p.aeruginosa, e.coli, proteus mirabilis, and klebsiella pneumoniae) were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and ceftazidime but resistant to ampicillin, amoxycillin and chloramphenicol. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains formed 25% of this species. pseudomonas aeruginosa was sensitive to gentamicin (87.5%) and ceftazidime (85.7%) but showed resistance to  ciprofloxacin (57.2%). some organisms e.g. s.aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis exhibited multi-drug resistance to the antibiotics tested. conclusion: since a high proportion of samples had positive cultures, infection control is recommended as a strategy to minimise spread of resistant organisms. it is recommended that gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime be used in preference to ampicillin and amoxycillin for treatment of septic wounds. there is need to develop national surveillance of antibiotic- resistant organisms.

TI  == [epidemiology and treatment of acute prostatitis after prostatic biopsy].
AB  == objective: acute prostatitis is the main complication of prostatic biopsies (pb)  and sometimes requires hospitalisation and appropriate antibiotic therapy. this study evaluated the pathogens responsible and proposes a statistically adapted empirical antibiotic therapy. patients and methods: this retrospective (from 2000 to 2006) two-centre study included 17 patients hospitalised for acute prostatitis after pb in a series of 1,216 biopsies. bacteriological documentation was based on urine cultures, blood cultures, identification of bacteria and antibiotic susceptibility testing. results: all patients received prophylactic antibiotics with a single dose of systemic fluoroquinolone at least 1 h before pb. bacterial  identification was possible in fourteen cases: e. coli (nine cases), proteus mirabilis (one case), klebsiella pneumoniae (one case), enterococcus faecalis (one case), staphylococcus spp (one case), clostridium perfringens (one case). only urine culture was positive in 6 cases (35%), only blood culture was positive in 3 cases (17%), and urine cultures and blood cultures were positive and concordant in 5 cases (29%). a high rate of resistance of e. coli to fluoroquinolones was observed in 88% of cases and to cotrimoxazole in 77% of cases. however, the strain was susceptible to second and third generation cephalosporins (2gc and 3gc) and amikacin in 100% of cases. prostatitis was associated with epididymo-orchitis (3 cases), acute urinary retention (4 cases) and infective endocarditis (1 case). conclusions: identification of the micro-organism responsible for acute prostatitis after biopsy requires a combination of blood cultures and urine cultures. empirical antibiotic therapy is based on the use of 2gc or 3gc, alone or in combination with amikacin depending on the severity of the clinical features.

TI  == species interactions in mixed-community crystalline biofilms on urinary catheters.
AB  == previous experimental investigations of the crystalline biofilms that colonize and block urinary catheters have focussed on their formation by pure cultures of  proteus mirabilis. in the urine of patients undergoing long-term catheterization, p. mirabilis is commonly found in mixed communities with other urinary tract pathogens. little is known about the effect that the other species have on the rate at which p. mirabilis encrusts catheters. in the present study, a set of data on the nature of the bacterial communities on 106 catheter biofilms has been analysed and it was found that while species such as providencia stuartii and klebsiella pneumoniae were commonly associated with p. mirabilis, when escherichia coli, morganella morganii or enterobacter cloacae were present, p. mirabilis was rarely or never found. the hypothesis that the absence of p. mirabilis from some biofilm communities could be due to its active exclusion by other species has also been examined. experiments in laboratory models showed that co-infection of p. mirabilis with m. morganii, k. pneumoniae or e. coli had  no effect on the ability of p. mirabilis to encrust and block catheters. co-infection with ent. cloacae or pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, significantly  increased the time that catheters took to block (p <0.05). the growth of ent. cloacae, m. morganii, k. pneumoniae or e. coli in the model for 72 h prior to superinfection with p. mirabilis significantly delayed catheter blockage. in the  case of ent. cloacae, for example, the mean time to blockage was extended from 28.7 h to 60.7 h (p < or =0.01). in all cases, however, p. mirabilis was able to  generate alkaline urine, colonize the biofilms, induce crystal formation and block the catheters. the results suggest that although there is a degree of antagonism between p. mirabilis and some of the other urinary tract organisms, the effects are temporary and whatever the pre-existing urinary microbiota, infection with p. mirabilis is thus likely to lead to catheter encrustation and blockage.

AB  == ctx-m-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) have become increasingly common worldwide, with the notable exception of the united states, where tem- and shv-type esbls have appeared to predominate. we have noted the emergence of esbls in our health care system (the university health system in san antonio, tx), especially in escherichia coli isolates, that preferentially hydrolyze cefotaxime rather than ceftazidime, suggesting the possibility of ctx-m-type enzymes. microbiology laboratory records were reviewed to identify esbl-producing isolates and to compare the diameters of ceftazidime disk diffusion zones of inhibition to cefotaxime zone diameters. all isolates had been initially detected and confirmed using the procedures recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute. a total of 94 stored esbl-producing isolates recovered between january 2000 and june 2006 (predominately from blood and normally sterile fluids) were retrieved for further study and screened using pcr primers specific for the presence of ctx-m, tem, and shv esbls. only small numbers of retained esbl-producing isolates were available for study in 2000 and 2002. the percentages of available esbl-producing organisms in the following years were found to produce ctx-m enzymes: 2000, 25%; 2001, 10%; 2002, 0%; 2003, 60%; 2004,  69%; 2005, 89%; and 2006, 70%. the most common ctx-m-type esbl was ctx-m-15, followed by ctx-m-16, ctx-m-8, and ctx-m-14. comparing the disk diffusion zone diameters of cefotaxime and ceftazidime was helpful with the initial recognition  of ctx-m-producing e. coli, which had an average cefotaxime zone diameter 7 mm smaller than the ceftazidime zone. however, comparing ceftazidime and cefotaxime  zones for ctx-m-producing klebsiella spp. was not helpful with initial recognition. ctx-m enzymes were also identified in proteus mirabilis, enterobacter spp., and morganella morganii. based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing of the e. coli isolates, the ctx-m-producing isolates did  not represent the spread of a single clone in the institution or in the community. in conclusion, ctx-m-type esbls are now the most common esbl type isolated from patients in our health care system and may also be present but unrecognized in other u.s. locales.

TI  == diversity of microflora in the gut and casts of tropical composting earthworms reared on different substrates.
AB  == the diversity of fungi, bacteria, yeast, actinomycetes and protozoa were analysed in the gut and casts of eudrilus eugeniae, lampito mauritii, eisenia fetida and perionyx excavatus, both qualitatively and quantitatively as influenced by different feed substrates like clay loam soil, cowdung and pressmud. while actinomycetes (streptomyces albus, s. somaliensis, nocardia asteroides, n. caviae and saccharomonosporia) were not digested by any of these species of worms, protozoa (amoeba proteus, a. terricola, paramecium trichium, euglena viridis, e.  orientalis, vorticella picta and trichomonas hominis) and yeast (candida tropicalis, c. krusei c. albicans and cryptococcus neoformans) were totally digested. certain species of fungi (saksenae vasiformis, mucor plumbeus, cladosporium carrionii, c. herbacium, alternaria sp., cunninghamella echinulata,  mycetia sterila, syncephalostrum racemosum, curvalaria lunata, c. geniculata and  geotrichum candidum) and bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacterium antitratum,  mima polymorpha, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, proteus vulgaris, p. mirabilis, p. rettgeri, escherichia coli, staphylococus citreus, bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, enterococci and micrococci) were completely digested. certain other species were not digested fungi like aspergillus fumigatus, a. flavus, a. ochraceous, trichoderma koningii (except by eeugeniae), fusarium moniliforme (except by e. eugeniae) and rhizopus sp., and bacteria like klebsiella pneumoniae and morganella morganii) and these were multiplied during the transit of the organic residues through the gut of worms. the microbial proliferation was more in the casts, due to the environment prevailing--rich in nutrient supply and large surface area available for growth and reproduction of the microbes that lead to enhanced microbial activity and humic acid contents in  the casts.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative bacilli causing infections in intensive care unit patients in the united states between 1993 and 2004.
AB  == during the 12-year period from 1993 to 2004, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of 74,394 gram-negative bacillus isolates recovered from intensive care  unit (icu) patients in united states hospitals were determined by participating hospitals and collected in a central location. mics for 12 different agents were  determined using a standardized broth microdilution method. the 11 organisms most frequently isolated were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.2%), escherichia coli (18.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (14.2%), enterobacter cloacae (9.1%), acinetobacter spp. (6.2%), serratia marcescens (5.5%), enterobacter aerogenes (4.4%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.3%), proteus mirabilis (4.0%), klebsiella oxytoca (2.7%), and citrobacter freundii (2.0%). specimen sources included the lower respiratory tract (52.1%), urine (17.3%), and blood (14.2%). rates of resistance to many of the antibiotics tested remained stable during the 12-year study period. carbapenems were the most active drugs tested against most of the bacterial species. e. coli and p. mirabilis remained susceptible to most of the drugs tested. mean rates of resistance to 9 of the 12 drugs tested increased with acinetobacter spp. rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin increased over the study  period for most species. ceftazidime was the only agent to which a number of species (acinetobacter spp., c. freundii, e. aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and s. marcescens) became more susceptible. the prevalence of multidrug resistance, defined as resistance to at least one extended-spectrum cephalosporin, one aminoglycoside, and ciprofloxacin, increased substantially among icu isolates of acinetobacter spp., p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae.

TI  == [selective action of broad-spectrum antibiotics on intestinal flora in sepsis in  rats].
AB  == objective: to investigate the selective effect of broad-spectrum antibiotics on the intestinal flora in sepsis in rats. methods: fifty-six sd rats were randomly  divided into normal control group, scald group [before ceftriaxone sodium (rocephin) treatment group], scald group with 3 days of rocephin treatment, scald group with 9 days of rocephin treatment, and sepsis group (before rocephin treatment group), sepsis group with 3 days of rocephin treatment, and sepsis group with 9 days of rocephin treatment. all the animals were incurred with 30% iii degree burns on their back followed by endotoxin challenge with a dose of 20  mg/kg 24 hours after the burn injury. the animals were treated with intraperitoneal injection of ceftriaxone 24 hours (60 mg/kg, quaque 12 hours) after the second hit with endotoxin. at the end of the treatment, the bacteria in stomach, intestine and colon were cultured. the number and kind of the bacteria were also determined. results: antibiotics significantly increased the number of  cocci (p<0.05 or p<0.01). the ratio between cocci and bacilli was markedly inverted. in selective culture of gut bacilli, e.coli was almost the only bacteria in the contents of stomach, intestine and colon in normal control group, but after burns and endotoxin challenge, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis appeared. after the rats received antibiotics treatment, e. coli decreased in number or disappeared, and was replaced mainly by pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae and proteus  and other bacilli. conclusion: broad-spectrum antibiotics can induce imbalance of bacteria flora in the gut, resulting in a reversion of the ratio between cocci and bacilli, and also reduction in intestinal colonization resistance. then, opportunistic pathogens become dominant flora in gut, which may cause antibiotic-related gut-origin diseases.

TI  == antibiotic resistance pattern in uropathogens.
AB  == uropathogenic strains from inpatient and outpatient departments were studied from april 1997 to march 1999 for their susceptibility profiles. the various isolates  were escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter baumanii and enterococcus faecalis. antibiotic susceptibility pattern of these isolates revealed that for outpatients, first generation cephalosporins, nitrofurantoin, norfloxacin/ciprofloxacin were effective for treatment of urinary tract infection but for inpatients, parenteral therapy with newer aminoglycosides and third generation cephalosporins need to be advocated as the organisms for nosocomial uti exhibit a high degree of drug resistance. trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole combination was not found to be effective for the treatment of urinary tract infections as all the uropathogens from inpatients and outpatients showed high degree of resistance to co-trimoxazole. culture and sensitivity of the isolates from urine samples should be done as a routine before advocating the therapy.

TI  == convenient test using a combination of chelating agents for detection of metallo-beta-lactamases in the clinical laboratory.
AB  == although transmissible metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls) are a serious threat to beta-lactam antibiotic therapy, the clsi currently does not recommend testing methods for the detection of mbls. the aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of double-disk tests (ddts) by using disks containing a combination of the chelators 2-mercaptopropionic acid (mpa) and tris-edta (te) to detect mbls. sixteen isolates (4 acinetobacter baumannii isolates, 6 pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 1 serratia marcescens isolate, 1 aeromonas hydrophila isolate, 1 aeromonas veronii isolate, 2 chryseobacterium meningosepticum isolates, and 1 stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolate) producing imp-1, imp-1-like, imp-18, gim-1, spm-1, vim-2, vim-2-like, and chromosomal mbls and 20 isolates (7 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 3 escherichia coli isolates, 5 enterobacter cloacae isolates, 2 s. marcescens isolates, 1 proteus mirabilis isolate, and 2 a. baumannii isolates) producing non-mbl carbapenemases, ampc beta-lactamases, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were tested. the ddt method was evaluated by using four types of chelator disks (te, high-strength te, mpa, and te plus 20 microl of mpa [at various concentrations]) and the beta-lactams imipenem (ipm), meropenem (mem), ertapenem (ert), and ceftazidime (caz). ddts with ipm and a te disk supplemented with 1:320 mpa detected all mbls and yielded no false-positive  results. some, but not all, mbl producers were detected in ipm-based tests involving the single chelator te or mpa alone or by ert- or caz-based tests. ipm-based tests with mpa concentrations other than 1:320 and all mem-based tests  had suboptimal sensitivities or specificities. ddt with ipm and a te disk supplemented with 20 microl of 1:320 mpa appears to be convenient for the detection of mbls in the clinical laboratory.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility of community-acquired urinary tract pathogens to commonly used antimicrobial agents in spain: a comparative multicenter study (2002-2004).
AB  == the susceptibility patterns of 2724 uropathogens isolated in 9 spanish regions during 2002, and 3013 obtained in 2004 were determined. the antibiotics tested were fosfomycin trometamol, amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, cefixime, cefuroxime-axetil, pipemidic, ceprofloxacin, trimethoprim plus sulphamethoxazole  and nitrofurantoin. escherichia coli was the main pathogen in both studies (73% vs. 68.3%) followed by proteus mirabilis 7.2% vs. 6.4%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (5.4% vs. 5.2%). enteroccocus spp. (4.7% vs. 6.8%), streptoccocus agalactiae (1.7% vs. 3.1%) and staphyloccocus saprophyticus (0.7% vs. 1.3%)were the most frequent gram-positive pathogens. 31.3% of e. coli in 2002 and 32% in 2004 were susceptible to all antibiotics tested. around 40% of e. coli were resistant to a  single agent. 21.6-24.1% were resistant to two antibiotics. 35.4% of first period isolates, and 37.6% of second period ones were resistant to two or more classes of antibiotics. fosfomycin (2.1- 2.8%) and nitrofurantoin (3.5-5.7%) had the lowest resistance rates for e. coli. amoxicillin (58.2-58.7%), co-trimoxazole (30.8-33.8%) and ciprofloxacin (22.6-22.7%) showed the highest resistance rates,  and their suitability as empiric treatments for uti should probably be re-evaluated.

TI  == in vitro availability studies of enoxacin in presence of h2 receptor antagonists.
AB  == enoxacin is a second-generation quinolone with increased antibacterial activity both in potency as well as in terms of broad spectrum against a wide range of clinically important pathogens over the first generation quinolones and produces  its effect by inhibiting bacterial enzyme dna gyrase. there are a number of drug  interactions reported for enoxacin. on the other hand h2-receptor antagonists block gastric acid secretion and some cardiovascular effects of histamine. as the later drugs are used for a long-term therapy, they may be coadministered with other drugs. in present study in vitro release of enoxacin in presence of cimetidine, ranitidine and famotidine has been studied on a b.p. 2003 dissolution test apparatus and compared with the availability of enoxacin and h2-receptor antagonists alone. the interacting drugs were analyzed spectrophotometrically. these studies were carried out in simulated gastric juice, simulating empty stomach, simulated intestinal juice (ph 9) and buffers of ph 7.4 simulating blood ph at 37 degrees c. in order to support these interaction studies, the effect of  h2-receptor antagonists on the antibacterial efficacy (mic) of enoxacin was also  studied by turbidity method and compared with parent drug against staphylococcus  aureus, streptococcus pyogens, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and bacillus subtilis. on the basis of these results, it is suggested that enoxacin should be coadministered with care along with h2-receptor antagonists especially in case of ranitidine, although chances of adverse reactions are rare but decrease in mic of enoxacin may result in delayed effect or require prolonged use of the drug.

TI  == efficacy of ertapenem in the treatment of early ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms in an intensive care unit.
AB  == objectives: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is a frequent complication of patients admitted to intensive care units (icus). ertapenem is a newer carbapenem with good in vitro activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing organisms. however, there are no clinical data to support the use of ertapenem in vap. our purpose is to evaluate the usefulness and safety of  ertapenem in the treatment of vap caused by susceptible esbl strains. methods: ertapenem 1 g daily intravenously was given to adult patients with signs and symptoms of vap beginning within 7 days of mechanical ventilation and caused by esbl-producing gram-negative organisms. results: from june 2005 to june 2006, we  enrolled 20 adult patients hospitalized in an icu and diagnosed with vap due to gram-negative esbl strains. causative organisms identified as esbl producers susceptible to ertapenem were klebsiella pneumoniae (alone in 10 cases and with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in 4 cases), enterobacter cloacae (2), proteus mirabilis (2) and citrobacter freundii (2). clinical success was achieved in 16/20 (80%) of the clinically evaluable patients and in 15/20 (75%) of the microbiologically evaluable patients. the drug was well-tolerated; one patient presented a transient increase in liver enzymes. conclusions: we believe  this is one of the first reports to demonstrate that ertapenem has clinical utility in treating serious infections caused by esbl-producing organisms. ertapenem appears to be suitable for esbl vap therapy. this pilot study suggests  subsequent controlled randomized trials in this indication.

AB  == cathelicidins, a group of cationic peptides found in leukocytes and epithelial cells, play a central role in the early innate immune defense against infection.  although these host defense peptides have been reported in several mammalian species, including primates, no cathelicidins have been identified in carnivores. here we report the cloning, tissue expression and biological activity of a novel  canine cathelicidin (k9cath). the full-length cdna sequence of k9cath encodes a predicted 172 amino acid pre-propeptide that is 60-70% similar to other mammalian cathelicidins. mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the 38 aa mature k9cath  peptide was present in neutrophil granule contents. synthetic k9cath displayed broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus; mics (minimal inhibitory concentrations) 0.5 and 50 microm, respectively), gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella serotype typhimurium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis; mics 1.25 microm, salmonella serotype  enteritidis; mic 0.5 microm, and neisseria gonorrhoeae; mic 0.06 microm), and yeast (candida albicans; mic 12.5-50 microm). k9cath demonstrated high antimicrobial activity against ureaplasma canigenitalium, and lower activity against ureaplasma urealyticum (mic 0.06 and 50 microm, respectively). similar to its ovine congener smap-29, k9cath possesses salt-independent antimicrobial activity and lps binding capacity. k9cath displayed minimal hemolytic activity against human, dog and chicken erythrocytes. the potency and broad antimicrobial  activity of k9cath suggest that this peptide may act as a fundamental contributor to the innate immune responses in this carnivore species.

TI  == predictors of mortality in patients with bloodstream infections caused by extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae: importance of inadequate initial antimicrobial treatment.
AB  == bloodstream infections (bsi) caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing organisms markedly increase the rates of treatment failure and death. we conducted a retrospective cohort analysis to identify risk factors for  mortality in adult in-patients with bsi caused by esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae (esbl-bsi). particular attention was focused on defining the impact on the mortality of inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy (defined as the initiation of treatment with active antimicrobial agents >72 h after collection of the first positive blood culture). a total of 186 patients with esbl-bsi caused by escherichia coli (n = 104), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 58), or proteus mirabilis (n = 24) were identified by our microbiology laboratory from 1  january 1999 through 31 december 2004. the overall 21-day mortality rate was 38.2% (71 of 186). in multivariate analysis, significant predictors of mortality  were inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy (odds ratio [or] = 6.28; 95% confidence interval [ci] = 3.18 to 12.42; p < 0.001) and unidentified primary infection site (or = 2.69; 95% ci = 1.38 to 5.27; p = 0.004). the inadequately treated patients (89 of 186 [47.8%]) had a threefold increase in mortality compared to the adequately treated group (59.5% versus 18.5%; or = 2.38; 95% ci = 1.76 to 3.22; p < 0.001). the regimens most commonly classified as inadequate were based on oxyimino cephalosporin or fluoroquinolone therapy. prompt initiation of effective antimicrobial treatment is essential in patients with esbl-bsi, and empirical decisions must be based on a sound knowledge of the local distribution of pathogens and their susceptibility patterns.

AB  == the usefulness and applicability of isolation precautions were questioned for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains of enterobacteriaceae in the endemic setting. we performed a surveillance programme for esbl-positive organisms and the infection control management of patients colonized or infected  with these organisms. between 1 january 2002 and 31 december 2004, a total of 147 cases of esbl-producing strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis from 123 patients were noted. the overall incidence of esbl-producing-strain-positive cases was 0.12/1000 patient-days. the proportion of referred cases was 35% (n=51); 65% of cases (n=96) were acquired in our institution. infections developed in 57 cases (38.8%), of which 36 (63.3%) were nosocomial. contact isolation precautions were carried out for 79.6% of the cases, with a median duration of contact isolation precautions for 14 days (range: 0-144). the contact isolation precautions resulted in 2985 isolation days in total, i.e. 995 isolation days per year. typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed clonal diversity in 94.2% of the isolates from patients. seven patient-to-patient transmissions were noted. only in 10 cases (6.8%) was colonization with esbl-producing strains cleared. considering the large number of immunocompromised patients treated in our institution (>1500 bone marrow or solid organ transplantations performed during 2002-2004), we will continue to isolate patients who are colonized or infected with esbl-producing organisms.

TI  == antibacterial activities of emblica officinalis and coriandrum sativum against gram negative urinary pathogens.
AB  == present investigation is focused on antibacterial potential of aqueous infusions  and aqueous decoctions of emblica officinalis (amla) and coriandrum sativum (coriander) against 345 bacterial isolates belonging to 6 different genera of gram negative bacterial population isolated from urine specimens by employing well diffusion technique. aqueous infusion and decoction of emblica officinalis exhibited potent antibacterial activity against escherichia coli (270), klebsiella pneumoniae (51), k. ozaenae (3), proteus mirabilis (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10), salmonella typhi (1), s. paratyphi a (2), s. paratyphi b (1) and serratia marcescens (2) but did not show any antibacterial activity against gram  negative urinary pathogens.

TI  == effect of ovotransferrin, protamine sulfate and edta combination on biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria.
AB  == aims: to determine the effect of a composition comprising ovotransferrin (ot), protamine sulfate (ps) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) on biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria. methods and results: the in vitro activity of ot, ps and edta alone and in combinations against biofilm formation by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis was investigated. all the three compounds either alone or in combinations failed to inhibit the growth completely at the concentrations tested. however, the subinhibitory concentrations of three compounds in a composition showed synergistic inhibitory  effect on biofilm formation by k. pneumoniae, ps. aeruginosa and s. epidermidis.  furthermore, 79-95% reduction in ps. aeruginosa and s. epidermidis biofilm formation was observed in a clear vinyl urinary catheter treated with the composition. conclusion: the subinhibitory concentrations of ot, ps and edta in a composition were effective in reducing biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria. significance and impact of the study: this study shows that a synergistic composition-comprising non-antibiotic generally regarded as safe (gras) compounds such as ot, ps and edta may be used in the prevention of catheter-related infections.

TI  == detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae by use of semiautomated microbiology systems and manual detection procedures.
AB  == three commercially available microbiology identification and susceptibility testing systems were compared with regard to their ability to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production in enterobacteriaceae, i.e., the phoenix automated microbiology system (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md), the vitek 2 system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france), and the microscan walkaway-96 system (dade behring, inc., west sacramento, ca), using routine testing panels. one hundred fifty putative esbl producers were distributed blindly to three participating laboratories. conventional phenotypic confirmatory tests such as the disk approximation method, the clsi double-disk synergy test, and the etest esbl were also evaluated. biochemical and molecular characterization of beta-lactamases performed at an independent laboratory was used as the reference method. one hundred forty-seven isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii were investigated. of these  isolates, 85 were identified as esbl producers by the reference method. the remaining isolates were identified as non-esbl producers; they were either hyperproducers of their chromosomal ampc, koxy, or shv enzymes or lacked any detectable beta-lactamase activity. the system with the highest sensitivity for the detection of esbls was the phoenix (99%), followed by the vitek 2 (86%) and the microscan (84%); however, specificity was more variable, ranging from 52% (phoenix) to 78% (vitek 2). the performance of the semiautomated systems differed widely with the species investigated. the sensitivities of the conventional test  methods ranged from 93 to 94%. the double-disk synergy test showed the highest specificity and positive predictive value among all test methods, i.e., 97% and 98%, respectively.

TI  == comparison of three techniques for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections in dogs with urolithiasis.
AB  == objectives: to identify an appropriate sampling technique(s) to accurately detect the bacteria causing urinary tract infections in dogs with urolithiasis. methods: twenty-one dogs with urolithiasis were included in the study. three types of samples were taken from each dog. urine was collected by cystocentesis, and a urinary bladder mucosal biopsy and urolith were retrieved during cystotomy. the samples were then cultured on blood agar and macconkey's agar to identify the bacteria associated with urinary tract infections. results: bacterial urinary tract infection was found in 16 cases (76.19 per cent). the most prevalent bacteria found to cause urinary tract infection were escherichia coli (n=7), followed by coagulase-positive staphylococcus species (n=4), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=2) and proteus mirabilis (n=1). in the case of a positive urine culture, the same bacteria were also cultured from the urinary bladder mucosal biopsy alone or from both the urinary bladder mucosal biopsy and urolith. however, in the case of a negative urine culture, bacteria were found to be present in the urinary bladder mucosal biopsy or urolith cultures in 23.81 per cent of dogs. the uroliths that gave positive culture results were either infection-induced uroliths composed of struvite and calcium carbonate phosphate, ammonium acid urate only or metabolic uroliths composed of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate, or calcium phosphate only. all the uroliths that gave negative culture results were metabolic uroliths composed of calcium oxalate and/or calcium phosphate, and uric acid and calcium phosphate. clinical significance: when the culture from the urine obtained by cystocentesis  is negative, cultures of urinary bladder mucosal biopsy and urolith are recommended in dogs with urolithiasis in order to accurately assess the microbiological status of the urinary tract.

TI  == in-vitro activity of triclosan-eluting ureteral stents against common bacterial uropathogens.
AB  == background and purpose: ureteral stents are commonly used in urology today, but the biofilms that form on them within hours of placement may harbor bacteria that can result in infection or encrustation. triclosan is an antimicrobial commonly used in consumer and medical products that inhibits bacterial fatty-acid synthesis. the bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect of a triclosan-eluting ureteral stent was tested against clinical isolates of common bacterial uropathogens in an in-vitro setting. materials and methods: triclosan eluted from a drug-loaded ureteral stent was suspended in artificial urine with bacterial pathogens (escherichia coli c1214, proteus mirabilis 296, enterococcus faecalis 1131, klebsiella pneumoniae 280, staphylococcus aureus newman, pseudomonas aeruginosa ak1) to assess growth, virulence-promoter activity, and bacterial adherence to the stent. generic stents were utilized as controls. results: triclosan inhibited the growth of e. faecalis, k. pneumoniae, s. aureus, and p. mirabilis in a dose-dependent manner. pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance. lower concentrations of triclosan downregulated e. coli virulence-factor promoters of outer membrane protein x and p-fimbriae. triclosan  stents had significantly fewer adherent viable bacteria than control stents. conclusions: triclosan-eluting ureteral stents inhibit the growth of common bacterial uropathogens and thus may reduce the incidence of urinary-tract infections and, potentially, encrustation. this drug-eluting stent provides both  mechanical drainage of the upper urinary tract and local antibiosis.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens that cause community-acquired urinary tract infections in antananarivo, madagascar.
AB  == background: urinary tract pathogens obtained from patients in madagascar are becoming increasingly resistant to commonly used antibiotics that are readily available at a low price. this poses a real problem for the treatment of community-acquired urinary tract infections (utis) in madagascar. objectives: to  obtain data on the pathogens responsible for community-acquired utis in antananarivo and on their susceptibility patterns to the antimicrobial agents that are currently used to treat utis. methods: we conducted a retrospective study on bacteria isolated from the urine of patients at the institut pasteur of  madagascar between january 2004 and april 2006. results: we isolated 903 pathogens from 673 women and 213 men. the most commonly isolated bacteria were escherichia coli (607 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (87 strains), staphylococcus aureus (35 strains) and proteus mirabilis (32 strains). seventy-seven per cent of gram-negative bacilli were resistant to amoxicillin, 65.7% were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and more than 15% were resistant to ciprofloxacin. strains were rarely resistant to more expensive antibiotics (ceftriaxone 5.9%, fosfomycin 4.6%). most bacteria showed intermediate susceptibility to nitroxolin. resistance rates of e. coli to ceftriaxone and gentamicin increased significantly between 2005 and 2006, due to  the increase in strains harbouring an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. gram-positive bacteria, streptococcaceae and staphylococcus spp. were rarely resistant, but 9.5% of streptococci were resistant to penicillin a and 8% of staphylococci were resistant to oxacillin. conclusions: the rate of amoxicillin-  and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant enterobacteriaceae implies that another antibiotic should be used for empirical treatment and that there is a need for new generic drugs in developing countries, especially in madagascar.

TI  == [characteristics of war wound infection].
AB  == war wounds are the most complex type of non-targeted injuries due to uncontrolled tissue damage of varied and multifold localizations, exposing sterile body areas  to contamination with a huge amount of bacteria. wound contamination is caused by both the host microflora and exogenous agents from the environment (bullets, cloth fragments, dust, dirt, water) due to destruction of the host protective barriers. war wounds are the consequence of destructive effects of various types  of projectiles, which result in massive tissue devitalization, hematomas, and compromised circulation with tissue ischemia or anoxia. this environment is highly favorable for proliferation of bacteria and their invasion in the surrounding tissue over a relatively short period of time. war wounds are associated with a high risk of local and systemic infection. the infection will develop unless a timely combined treatment is undertaken, including surgical intervention within 6 hours of wounding and antibiotic therapy administered immediately or at latest in 3 hours of wound infliction. time is a crucial factor in this type of targeted combined treatment consisting of surgical debridement, appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy, and specific antitetanic prophylaxis. apart from exposure factors, there are a number of predisposing factors that favor the development of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infection.  these are shock, pain, blood loss, hypoxia, hematomas, type and amount of traumatized tissue, age, and comorbidity factors in the wounded. the determinants that define the spectrum of etiologic agents in contaminated war wounds are: wound type, body region involved, time interval between wounding and primary surgical treatment, climate factors, season, geographical area, hygienic conditions, and patient habits. the etiologic agents of infection include gram-positive aerobic cocci, i. e. staphylococcus spp, streptococcus spp and enterococcus spp, which belong to the physiological flora of the human skin and mucosa; gram-negative facultative aerobic rods; members of the family enterobacteriacea (escherichia coil, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae), which predominate in the physiological flora of the intestines, transitory flora of the skin and environment; gram-negative bacteria, i. e. pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus -  a. baumanii complex; environmental bacteria associated with humid environment and dust; anaerobic gram-positive sporogeneous rods clostridium spp, gram-negative asporogeneous rods bacteroides spp and gram-positive anaerobic cocci; peptostreptococcus spp and peptococcus spp. the latter usually colonize the intestine, primarily the colon, and the skin, while clostridium spores are also found in the environment. early empirical antibiotic therapy is used instead of standard antibiotic prophylaxis. empirical antimicrobial therapy is administered  to prevent the development of systemic infection, gas gangrene, necrotizing infection of soft tissue, intoxication and death. the choice of antibiotics is determined by the presumed infective agents and localization of the wound. it is  used in all types of war wounds over 5-7-10 days. the characteristics of antibiotics used in war wounds are the following: broad spectrum of activity, ability to penetrate deep into the tissue, low toxicity, long half-life, easy storage and application, and cost effectiveness. the use of antibiotics is not a  substitution for surgical treatment. the expected incidence of infection, according to literature data, is 35%-40%. if the time elapsed until surgical debridement exceeds 12 hours, or the administration of antibiotics exceeds 6 hours of wound infliction, primary infection of the war wound occurs (early infection) in more than 50% of cases. the keys for the prevention of infection are prompt and thorough surgical exploration of the wound, administration of antibiotics and antitetanic prophylaxis, awareness of the probable pathogens with respect to localization of the wound, and optimal choice of antibiotics and length of their administration.

TI  == bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. it is active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. the aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers  and non-producers). gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic bacteroides fragilis. ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs). killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the  first few hours of the kinetic curves against e. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) reduction in the first 2h), b. fragilis (4 log(10) cfu reduction in 4h), mssa (3 log(10) cfu reduction in 4-6h), k. ozaenae (esbl+), k. pneumoniae (esbl+ and -), e. cloacae (esbl-) in 1h and p. mirabilis (esbl+) in the first 2h. the potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of e. coli-b. fragilis and e. coli-b. fragilis-e. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of s. aureus-p. mirabilis. these results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == there is a low incidence of recurrent bacteriuria in painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis patients followed longitudinally.
AB  == the objective of this paper was to establish whether patients with confirmed painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (pbs/ic) presenting with symptoms  of uti have actual bacteriuria vs a flare of their pbs/ic symptoms. one hundred and six (n = 106) consecutive female patients (mean age 39.8 +/- 14 years) with newly diagnosed ic were identified and followed longitudinally for 24 months. at  the initial visit and at all subsequent visits, urinary specimens were obtained by sterile catheterization (bard 14fr female) and cultured for bacteria. eight patients had an initially positive urine culture, and repeat cultures 8 weeks after treatment were all negative. once sterile urine was established, the diagnosis of pbs/ic was confirmed. a pelvic pain/urgency/frequency (puf) questionnaire score was obtained from 89 patients. after the diagnosis of pbs/ic, all patients received multimodal treatment. patients were instructed to present to the office whenever they developed symptoms of uti, at which time a sterile catheter specimen was obtained and sent for culture. greater than 10(3) colonies  were considered positive. patients who did not report flares were contacted to establish whether unreported treatments were given. seventy-two patients (68%) had no uti episodes or flares. the remaining 34 patients (32%) presented with 54  flares, of which 44 were culture-negative and 10 were culture-positive. a single  flare was reported by 21 patients during the 24 months, with three positive cultures (14.3%). recurrent uti symptoms (two to four flares) were seen in a small group (n = 13) for a total of 33 flares. of these, seven had two flares each (12 negative, 2 positive), five had three flares each (12 negative, 3 positive), and one patient had four flares (two negative, two positive). therefore, within the group with recurrent symptoms, seven positive cultures were obtained for a rate of recurrent bacteriuria of 6.6% (7/106). nine of the 10 positive bacterial cultures were due to gram-negative bacteria: escherichia coli  (n = 6), proteus mirabilis (n = 1), klebsiella pneumonia (n = 1), and citrobacter sp. (n = 1). one grew streptococcus sp. there was no difference between the flare group and nonflares in regards to age or puf scores between groups. this study is the first to report on the low incidence of confirmed utis in a large group of pbs/ic patients followed longitudinally. these data suggest that only a small number of pbs/ic patients with uti symptoms have positive urine cultures (9.4%; 10/106). although the symptoms of recurrent uti are prevalent in ic patients, the incidence of confirmed recurrent utis is only 6.6%. because the flares of ic are  usually self-limiting, treatment response to antibiotics may be misleading in light of the low incidence of positive urine cultures. these data suggest that the symptom flares of ic are not usually associated with recurrent uti and, therefore, are likely due to a triggering of the other painful mechanisms involved in ic patients who are culture-negative.

TI  == increased serum iga and igm against lps of enterobacteria in chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs): indication for the involvement of gram-negative enterobacteria in the etiology of cfs and for the presence of an increased gut-intestinal permeability.
AB  == there is now evidence that chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs) is accompanied by immune disorders and by increased oxidative stress. the present study has been designed in order to examine the serum concentrations of iga and igm to lps of gram-negative enterobacteria, i.e. hafnia alvei; pseudomonas aeruginosa, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas putida, citrobacter koseri, and klebsiella pneumoniae in cfs patients, patients with partial cfs and normal controls. we found that the prevalences and median values for serum iga against the lps of enterobacteria are significantly greater in patients with cfs than in  normal volunteers and patients with partial cfs. serum iga levels were significantly correlated to the severity of illness, as measured by the fibrofatigue scale and to symptoms, such as irritable bowel, muscular tension, fatigue, concentration difficulties, and failing memory. the results show that enterobacteria are involved in the etiology of cfs and that an increased gut-intestinal permeability has caused an immune response to the lps of gram-negative enterobacteria. it is suggested that all patients with cfs should be checked by means of the iga panel used in the present study and accordingly should be treated for increased gut permeability.

AB  == bacteria harbouring the novel qnra plasmid-mediated mechanism of quinolone resistance have been described in different countries, but the frequency of their occurrence has not been investigated. in total, 1,468 clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae with quinolone resistance or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase  (esbl) phenotypes were collected from eight teaching hospitals in france during 2002-2005 and screened for qnra. overall, 28 isolates (22 enterobacter cloacae, three klebsiella pneumoniae, one citrobacter freundii, one klebsiella oxytoca and one proteus mirabilis) were positive for qnra, representing 1.9% of all isolates, 3.3% of esbl-producing isolates (22% of the e. cloacae isolates) and 0% of non-esbl-producing isolates. the prevalence of qnra among consecutive esbl-producing isolates in 2004 from the eight hospitals was 2.8% (18/639). of the qnra-positive isolates, 100% were intermediately-resistant or resistant to nalidixic acid, and 75% to ciprofloxacin. twenty-one of the 22 qnra-positive e. cloacae isolates were obtained from two hospitals in the paris area, and molecular typing and plasmid content analysis showed clonal relationships for five, three and two isolates, respectively. the qnra genetic environment was similar to that of the in36 integron. the remaining two isolates had qnra variants (30 and 29 nucleotide differences, respectively, compared with the original sequence) and an unknown genetic environment. the esbl gene associated with qnra was bla(shv-12) in most of the isolates, but bla(per-1) and bla(shv-2a) were found in two isolates. in france, it appears that qnra-positive isolates are predominantly e. cloacae isolates producing shv-12, and may be associated with the dissemination of an in36-like integron.

TI  == assessment of pathogen frequency and resistance patterns among pediatric patient  isolates: report from the 2004 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program on 3 continents.
AB  == selecting empiric or directed therapy for pathogens isolated from pediatric patients can be problematic. many antimicrobial agents are not indicated for use  in pediatric patients, and regional variations of resistance mechanisms have been reported. the purpose of this study was to analyze antimicrobial resistance patterns and pathogen occurrence rates in pediatric-aged patient infections on 3  continents using data from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. a total of 3537 clinical isolates were collected from 47 medical centers in 2004. with a  protocol that dictated a sampling of 80 consecutive isolates from children (< or  =18 years of age), all samples were forwarded to a central laboratory for reference susceptibility testing. broth microdilution methods and current clinical and laboratory standards institute breakpoint criteria were used. the 15 most frequently observed pathogens accounted for 93.6% of all isolates. staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen isolated in north america (27.4%) and europe (19.0%), but escherichia coli was most common in latin america (19.3%). all streptococcus pneumoniae strains from north america and latin america were susceptible to the newer fluoroquinolones, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin. however, 2 s. pneumoniae strains from italy were resistant to gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin (> or =4 microg/ml). ribotype and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns found that these resistant pneumococci  were clonal. numerous strains of klebsiella spp. (22.5%), e. coli (4.5%), and proteus mirabilis (4.9%) exhibited phenotypic extended-spectrum beta-lactamase resistance patterns. four pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (3 from latin america and 1 from europe) were multidrug resistant, 2 p. aeruginosa isolates from turkey were resistant to polymyxin b (> or =4 microg/ml), and 8.7% of stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates from latin america were resistant to the "drug of choice", trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. physicians should be aware of pathogen occurrences that vary by children's age, geographic location, and prior antimicrobial exposure. therefore, continued surveillance will be necessary to monitor emerging antimicrobial resistance in the pediatric patient population, especially because  new agents such as the fluoroquinolones are used to a greater extent in this age  group.

TI  == 1h nmr spectroscopy in the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  == the (1)h nmr spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (uti). k. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-pd), acetate, ethanol and succinate. the quantity of 1,3-pd produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. other common bacteria causing uti (except for citrobacter frundii), such as escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), enterobacter  aerogenes, acinetobacter baumanii, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus gp b and staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. citrobacter frundii (c. frundii) also gives the same nmr results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary  tract infection. the method provides a single-step documentation of k. pneumoniae (and c. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of uti was obtained in 516 cases (84%). the nmr-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. in the present authors' experience, the results of nmr spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.

AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) efficiently hydrolyze extended-spectrum beta-lactams such as cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and aztreonam. esbls are most often plasmid-mediated. in taiwan, the prevalence of esbls in bacteria has risen, ranging from 8.5 to 29.8% in klebsiella pneumoniae and 1.5 to 16.7% in escherichia coli isolates. the most prevalent types of esbls are shv-5, shv-12, ctx-m-3, and ctx-m-14 in isolates of k. pneumoniae and e. coli, with differences  between institutions. shv-12 and ctx-m-3 have been reported as the most common esbls in isolates of enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens, respectively.  molecular epidemiology studies suggest that the esbl-encoding genes have been disseminated either by proliferation of epidemic strains or by transfer of plasmids carrying the resistance traits. the current esbl screen guidelines of the clinical and laboratory standards institute (formerly national committee for  clinical laboratory standards) are issued for e. coli, klebsiella spp., and proteus mirabilis. owing to the lack of standard methods, it remains difficult to assure the presence of esbl in an isolate co-harboring an ampc beta-lactamase, particularly in cases where the latter is produced in larger amounts than the former. empirical therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam to replace third-generation cephalosporins may help to reduce the occurrence of esbls in an  institution with a high prevalence of esbl producers. carbapenems remain the drugs of choice for serious infections caused by esbl-producing organisms. to retard the selection for carbapenem-resistant bacteria, 7-alpha-methoxy beta-lactams or fourth-generation cephalosporins can be therapeutic alternatives  for mild-to-moderate infections provided that the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic target can be easily achieved.

TI  == fishmeal extract bile salt lactose agar--a differential medium for enteric bacteria.
AB  == fishmeal extract bile salt lactose agar (febla), a new differential medium for enteric bacteria was developed and evaluated for its ability to grow and differentiate lactose fermenters (lf) from non-lactose fermenters (nlf) in comparison with macconkeys agar. performance of febla was at par with the latter. on febla medium, the contrast between lf and nlf colonies was pronounced and klebsiella pneumoniae produced more mucoid colonies than on macconkeys agar (hi media). unlike macconkeys agar, a 24 h culture of k. pneumoniae cells on febla were longer and thicker with abundant capsular material around the bacilli. escherichia coli produced long and thick cells but only after 48h. no change in cell morphology was evident with regard to salmonella typhi, s. paratyphi a, shigella flexneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, citrobacter koseri and acinetobacter baumannii. performance of the medium was controlled using e. coli and s. flexneri. febla is simple, cost effective and may be a suitable alternative in the preliminary identification of enteric bacteria.

TI  == urinary tract infection caused by fluoroquinolone- and cephem-resistant enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == in 2001, fluoroquinolone-resistant escherichia coli isolates emerged in japan in  patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infection (uti), and accounted for ca.  8% of isolates. this is a worldwide occurrence as reported by the eco.sens study. the number of fluoroquinolone- and cephem-resistant enterobacteriaceae isolates from patients with complicated uti is increasing. most cephem-resistant isolates  of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). the rates of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae differ between countries but there are esbl producers in urinary enterobacteriaceae isolates in most countries. more seriously, most nosocomial esbl producers are also resistant to non-beta-lactams, such as the fluoroquinolones, fosfomycin and  co-trimoxazole. this causes serious problems in the chemotherapy of cystitis.

TI  == in vitro activities of various piperacillin and sulbactam combinations against bacterial pathogens isolated from intensive care units in taiwan: smart 2004 programme data.
AB  == we investigated the in vitro activity of various piperacillin and sulbactam combinations against gram-negative bacterial isolates from intensive care units (icus) in taiwan. antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 1030 bacterial isolates recovered from icus of nine major teaching hospitals was performed using the agar dilution method. sulbactam was added to piperacillin either at a fixed sulbactam  concentration of 4 mg/l and 8 mg/l or at a piperacillin:sulbactam ratio of 2:1 and 4:1. piperacillin/sulbactam at a ratio of 2:1 or a fixed 8 mg/l concentration of sulbactam had better activities against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens than other piperacillin/sulbactam formulations. for pseudomonas aeruginosa, piperacillin/sulbactam (2:1 or 4:1 ratios) had mic(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) of 64 mg/l (>90% susceptibility) compared with 64 mg/l for cefoperazone/sulbactam (68% susceptibility) and 128 mg/l for piperacillin/tazobactam (82% susceptibility). for acinetobacter baumannii, both piperacillin/sulbactam (either 2:1 ratio or a fixed 8 mg/l sulbactam) and cefoperazone/sulbactam were the most potent agents. adding sulbactam to piperacillin resulted in increased susceptibility rates among piperacillin-resistant p. aeruginosa (53-57% in either 2:1 or 4:1 ratios) and a.  baumannii (38-46% in either 2:1 ratio or a fixed 8 mg/l concentration of sulbactam) isolates. results of susceptibility tests with piperacillin/sulbactam  are dependent on the method used. piperacillin/sulbactam combinations possessed better in vitro activities than piperacillin alone or piperacillin/tazobactam against p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii.

TI  == a simple phenotypic method for differentiation between acquired and chromosomal ampc beta-lactamases in escherichia coli.
AB  == background: screening methods for the detection of plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases are technically demanding. the purpose of this study was to assess screening methods for the detection of these enzymes in clinical isolates  of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. methods: isolates were selected according to a resistance phenotype consistent with production of an ampc-type beta-lactamase. detection of acquired ampc genes was done with a multiplex ampc-pcr and sequencing. the phenotypic detection methods evaluated included visual examination of antibiogram plates to identify the presence of scattered colonies located near the edge of the inhibition halo of cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam, and a double-disc synergy test  using cloxacillin (500 mg) to inhibit ampc enzymes. results: seventy-seven isolates were selected from among 6,209 isolates recovered. acquired ampc genes (blacmy-2, bladha-1, blacmy-4 and blaacc-1) were found in 19 (24.7%) of these isolates, including 14 e. coli, two k. pneumoniae and three p. mirabilis isolates. the differential trait for the presence of colonies in the inhibition halo was 100% sensitive and specific. similar results were obtained for the cloxacillin test, except for the e. coli isolates in which specificity was 10.3%. conclusion: the phenotypic trait described here can be considered useful for suspecting the presence of these enzymes. the cloxacillin test was only useful in isolates lacking a natural ampc beta-lactamase.

TI  == using interrupted time series analysis to assess associations of fluoroquinolone  formulary changes with susceptibility of gram-negative pathogens and isolation rates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the use of fluoroquinolones has been linked to increasing bacterial resistance and infection and/or colonization with already resistant pathogens both as a risk factor and based on volume of use. changes in individual fluoroquinolones used in an institution may also be related to these clinical problems. interrupted time series analysis, which allows for assessment of the associations of an outcome attributable to a specific event in time, was used to study the effect of changes in our hospital's fluoroquinolone formulary on fluoroquinolone susceptibility rates in select gram-negative pathogens and the methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) isolation rate. susceptibility rates to ciprofloxacin were considered for the period of 1993 through 2004, while the mrsa isolation rate was assessed from 1995 through 2004. levofloxacin was added to the formulary in 1999, and gatifloxacin was substituted for levofloxacin in 2001. statistically significant changes in the already declining rates of susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa (p, 0.042) and escherichia coli (p, 0.004) to ciprofloxacin and in the already rising mrsa isolation rate (p, 0.001)  were associated with the addition of levofloxacin to the formulary. substitution  of gatifloxacin for levofloxacin on the formulary was associated with reversals in the downward trend in e. coli susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and the upward trend in mrsa isolation rate. no associations were detected on susceptibility of  klebsiella pneumoniae or proteus mirabilis to ciprofloxacin. these findings suggest that potential changes in susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and isolation of mrsa may vary by both drug and organism.

AB  == results of a 2003 survey carried out in italy to evaluate the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteria are presented. eleven italian microbiology laboratories investigated 9,076 consecutive nonreplicate isolates (inpatients, 6,850; outpatients, 2,226). esbl screening was performed by mic data analysis. confirmation was obtained using the double-disk synergy test and the combination disk test based on clsi methodology. esbl determinants were investigated by colony blot hybridization and confirmed by sequencing. results were compared to those of the 1999 italian survey (8,015 isolates). the prevalence of esbl producers was 7.4% among isolates from inpatients (in 1999, 6.3%) and 3.5% among outpatients (no data were available for 1999). among hospitalized patients, the most prevalent esbl-positive species was  escherichia coli (klebsiella pneumoniae in 1999). proteus mirabilis was the most  prevalent esbl-positive species among outpatients. in both groups, most esbl-positive pathogens were obtained from urinary tract infections. tem-type esbls were the most prevalent enzymes (45.4%). non-tem, non-shv determinants emerged: ctx-m-type in e. coli and k. pneumoniae, and per-type in p. mirabilis, providencia spp., and e. coli. with the exception of 3/163 p. mirabilis isolates  and 1/44 providencia stuartii isolate (all of which were intermediate for imipenem), carbapenems were active against all esbl-positive enterobacteria. susceptibility to other drugs was as follows: 84.7% for amikacin, 84.4% for piperacillin-tazobactam, 48.0% for gentamicin, and 32.8% for ciprofloxacin. carbapenems appear to be the drug of choice. amikacin and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations represent an alternative in non-life-threatening infections. the appearance of esbl-positive enterobacteria in the community makes it mandatory that family physicians learn how to treat these pathogens.

TI  == antibiotic treatment and resistance of unselected uropathogens in the elderly.
AB  == a population-based study was conducted among women over the age of 70 years with  complaints of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (utis). the positive predictive value of the nitrite test alone or in combination with the leukocyte esterase test ranged between 83% and 99%. the nitrofurantoin prescription rate decreased whereas fluoroquinolone and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid prescriptions increased with increasing age. the aetiology of infection was age-dependent. escherichia coli was the most commonly isolated uropathogen, followed by proteus  mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae. for these uropathogens, the lowest susceptibility percentages were found for amoxicillin, trimethoprim and co-trimoxazole. as trimethoprim susceptibility reached approximately 75%, it may  be advisable not to use this as a first-choice agent in the treatment of uncomplicated utis in the elderly.

TI  == effect of triclosan on the development of bacterial biofilms by urinary tract pathogens on urinary catheters.
AB  == objectives: to examine (i) the effect of triclosan on the formation of catheter biofilms by urinary tract pathogens and (ii) the diffusion of triclosan through the retention balloons of urinary catheters. methods: models of the catheterized  bladder were infected with eight different urinary tract pathogens and the effect of triclosan on biofilm formation was assessed by determining the numbers of viable cells colonizing the catheters and by scanning electron microscopy. hplc was used to determine the triclosan concentration in urine draining from models that had been fitted with triclosan-inflated silicone catheters. results: when catheters were inflated with triclosan (10 g/l) the formation of catheter biofilm by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis was prevented. the numbers of enterococcus faecalis and providencia stuartii cells colonizing catheters were also significantly reduced (p<0.05). serratia marcescens, morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, were able to produce extensive catheter biofilms in the presence of triclosan. only p. mirabilis produced alkaline urine and encrusted the catheters. concentrations of 0.02-0.16 mg/l of the biocide were detected in urine draining from the model over the 48 h experimental period. conclusions: triclosan diffused through silicone catheter balloons and produced urinary concentrations that prevented catheter encrustation by p. mirabilis and biofilm formation by several  other common pathogens of the catheterized urinary tract. it had little effect on urease-producing p. aeruginosa, s. marcescens or m. morganii but these species did not produce alkaline urine or crystalline biofilms.

TI  == regional variation in the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing clinical isolates in the asia-pacific region (sentry 1998-2002).
AB  == we examined the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter koseri, and salmonella spp. that were isolated as part of  the sentry asia-pacific surveillance program between 1998 and 2002. during the study period, a total of 6,388 strains were gathered from 17 medical centers in 7 countries and examined for esbl production and hyperproduction of k. oxytoca chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase enzyme. high rates of confirmed esbl-producing isolates were found in k. pneumoniae strains from singapore (35.6%), followed by  those from mainland china (30.7%), south africa (28.1%), and the philippines (21.9%), whereas the rates were less than 10% in japan and australia. esbl-producing e. coli strains were also prominent in mainland china (24.5%), hong kong (14.3%), and singapore (11.3%). esbl-producing k. oxytoca were common in the philippines (38.5%), singapore (33.3%), and china (30.0%). hyperproduction of k. oxytoca chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase enzyme was common in australia and japan. p. mirabilis strains from singapore produced esbl (17.9%) despite the low  prevalence (0-8.1%) in other countries. few esbl-producing c. koseri and salmonella spp. strains were found in japan, singapore, taiwan, and south africa. although there was variation among countries in substrate preference, ceftazidime was more likely to detect presumptive esbl phenotype in k. pneumoniae and aztreonam more likely in e. coli, whereas ceftriaxone was the best substrate for  the confirmation of esbl production. esbl-producing strains showed high levels of co-resistance to aminoglycosides, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin. imipenem retained activity against all esbl-producing strains. organisms expressing esbls are widely distributed in the asia-pacific region, although prevalence rates vary significantly.

AB  == for the post-marketing surveillance of cefmetazole (cmz, cefmetazon), mics of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including cmz against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. in the first surveillance from june 2000 to march 2001, 574 isolates of 13 species were tested, 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from april 2001 to march 2002, and 654 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the third surveillance from april 2002 to march 2003. no remarkable changes in the activity of cmz were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. the activity of cmz in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before cefmetazon was launched. this result suggests that cmz still maintains potent activity. changes in percent resistance of each species to cmz (mic of cmz > or = 32 microg/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa, 0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, 72.9% --> 87.2% --> 88.7%), staphylococcus epidermidis (18.5% --> 31.6% --> 14.3%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. (cns, 13.3% --> 18.2% --> 21.4%), escherichia coli (3.6% -->  0.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 3.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella oxytoca (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), proteus mirabilis (2.3% --> 2.1% --> 0.0%), proteus vulgaris (13.6% --> 6.7% --> 0.0%), morganella morganii (7.3% --> 0.0% --> 14.0%), providencia spp. (12.5% --> 0.0% --> 18.2%), peptostreptococcus spp.  (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), bacteroides fragilis (10.3% --> 10.8% --> 17.1%), bacteroides spp. (78.6% --> 87.5% --> 62.5%). the change in percent resistance of mrsa, other cns, and b. flagiris tended to increase. it is necessary to pay much  attention to trends observed in these species. compared to other drugs tested, against mssa, the activity of cmz was inferior to that of cez, ctm, and fmox and  superior to that sbt/cpz. against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and cns, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and inferior to that of fmox. against b. flagiris and other bacteroides spp., the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and comparable to or inferior to that of sbt/cpz and fmox.

AB  == the present study was conducted to investigate antibacterial activity of zuccagnia punctata ethanolic extract against 47 strains of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria and to identify bioactive compounds. inhibition of bacterial growth was investigated using agar diffusion, agar macrodilution, broth microdilution and bioautographic methods. zuccagnia punctata extract was active against all assayed bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia) with minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values ranging from 25 to 200 microg/ml. minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) values were identical or two-fold higher than the corresponding mic values. contact bioautography, indicated that zuccagnia punctata extracts possess one major antibacterial component against pseudomonas aeruginosa and at least three components against. klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. activity-guided fractionation of 1he  ethanol extract on a silica gel column yielded a compound (2',4'-dihydroxychalcone), which exhibited strong antibacterial activity with mic values between 0.10 and 1.00 microg/ml for proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia. these values are lower than imipenem (0.25-16 microg/ml). zuccagnia punctata might provide promising therapeutic agents against infections with multi-resistant gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == [comparison of frequency and susceptibility to antimicrobials of bacterial strains of the family enterobacteriaceae isolated from patients hospitalised in intensive care units].
AB  == the aim of the study was estimation of frequency and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents of gram-negative rods isolated from clinical specimens obtained from patients requiring intensive care, with emphasis on profile of the  unit. the analysis comprised strains of gram-negative rods isolated from patients of two intensive care units (icus) of a tertiary care hospital (1200 beds). identification of cultured isolates was done using automated vitek and api systems (biomerieux, france). susceptibility to antimicrobial agents was tested by a disk-diffusion method according to the nccls recommendations. in total the analysis comprised 722 strains of gram-negative rods. in blood cultures predominated strains of enterobacter spp. (42.5%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (37.5%). in cultures of clinical specimens other than blood 41.6% comprised strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, 14.8% escherichia coli and 14.4% proteus mirabilis. frequency of multi-drug resistant strains of bacteria of the family enterobacteriaceae was much higher among blood isolates in comparison to strains  cultured from other clinical specimens. there was a relatively high percentage of strains of enterobacteriaceae susceptible to piperacillin and tazobactam (69.0%)  and ceftazidime (54.6%). conclusions: 1. all strains were susceptible to carbapenems. 2. there was a relatively high percentage of strains of gram-negative rods susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. 3. bacteria isolated from blood cultures were characterised by a much higher percentage of resistant strains in comparison to other specimens. 4. longer stay  in icu promoted selection of strains resistant to antimicrobials.

TI  == synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some novel derivatives of benzofuran: part 1. synthesis and antimicrobial activity of (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methylcyclobutyl) ketoxime derivatives.
AB  == the reaction of salicylaldehyde with 1-phenyl-1-methyl-3-(2-chloro-1-oxoethyl) cyclobutane (1) and potassium carbonate was used to prepare (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-methyl-3-phenylcyclobutyl) methanone (2) for the starting reagent purposes. (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl) ketoxime (3) was synthesized from the reaction of the compound (2) with hidroxylamine. new derivatives of (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl) ketoxime (3) such  as, o-glycidylketoxime (4) and o-phenylacylketoxime (5a-c) were obtained very high yields. alkyl, allyl and aryl substituted n-oxime ethers (6a-e) were obtained from the reaction compound 3 and various halogen contained compounds. the syntheses of the compounds (7a-f) were carried out from the reaction of the compound (4) and different amines such as, isopropyl amine, natrium azide, morpholine and piperazine. all of the synthesized compounds were tested for antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, escherichia coli atcc 8739, klebsiella pneumoniae atcc 4352, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 1539, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, proteus mirabilis atcc 14153 and candida albicans atcc 10231. among the synthesized compounds (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl)-o-[2-hydroxy-3-(n-methylpiperazino)] propylketoxime (7d) was found the most active derivative against s. aureus atcc 6538. the compounds 2, 5b, 6b,  6c, 7b and 7f showed very strong and the same antimicrobial effect against c. albicans atcc 10231. similarly (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methylcyclobutyl)-o-benzylketoxime 6a showed good antimicrobial effect against c. albicans atcc 10231. none of the other compounds  exhibited activity against the other test microorganisms.

TI  == bacteria isolated from blood, stool and urine of typhoid patients in a developing country.
AB  == blood, stool and urine samples were collected from 100 patients diagnosed as having typhoid in 5 hospitals in akwa ibom state and analyzed for the presence of salmonella species and other bacteria. of the 100 blood samples screened, 55 (55%) were positive with the widal test and 39 (39%) were positive on blood culture. thirteen (14.1%) out of 92 urine samples were positive for bacterial growth, while 22 (26.8%) of the stool cultures were positive out of the 82 samples screened. those within the age range 11-20 years old were infected most frequently (33%), followed by the age range 21-30 (19%) and 41-50 (18%) years old. those in the age range of 0-2 years old (4%) were least infected. female subjects were more infected than males. the commonest organisms isolated from the blood samples were staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, streptococcus faecalis, salmonella paratyphi and salmonella typhi. s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. coli, k. aerogenes, s. faecalis, proteus mirabilis and p. aeruginosa were isolated from urine, while those isolated from stool were s. aureus, e. coli, s. typhi, s. paratyphi, shigella sp, k. pneumoniae, p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa and vibrio cholerae 01. the isolates were sensitive to peflacine, ceftazidine, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and chloramphenicol. these antibiotics are recommended as the drugs of choice in therapy. the results suggest the existence  of symptomless carriers of enteric fever bacilli in the state. this is worrisome, since some of the s. typhi isolates exhibited multiple resistance to commonly used antibiotics.

TI  == effects of lipopolysaccharides from gram-negative bacteria on the level of thiols in blood platelets.
AB  == lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin, lps) activates blood platelets and stimulates generation of free radicals in these cells. the mechanism of platelet activation  induced by lps is not known. the aim of the present study was to examine how glutathione (gsh) and other thiol-containing compounds are involved in the oxidative stress in blood platelets caused by lps. the hplc technique has been used on the analysis of non-protein thiols from human blood platelets treated with lipopolysaccharides of different gram-negative bacteria (proteus mirabilis,  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). our results show that lpss caused an increase (about 10%) of the level of reduced glutathione (gsh) and other nonprotein thiols such as cysteine (csh) and cysteinylglycine (cgsh), whereas the total pool of these compounds was almost unchanged. lps may react directly with thiols, since after incubation of lpss with glutathione alone (in reduced form) we observed a distinct decrease of the level of platelet gsh.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of contemporary pathogens from uncomplicated urinary tract infections isolated in a multicenter italian survey:  possible impact on guidelines.
AB  == during 2004 four italian laboratories assessed the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens causing acute uncomplicated cystitis in female out-patients. a total of 600 urine samples from individuals aged 18-65 were studied. the overall prevalence of escherichia coli was 85.3%. klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus saprophyticus, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis and other rarer species were far less represented. determination of the  antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the entire collection of e. coli (512 organisms) revealed that among the drugs analyzed ampicillin was the least active molecule with only 62.5% of the strains being inhibited. amoxicillin-clavulanate  and cefuroxime displayed a higher potency (87.7% and 89.2% respectively). cotrimoxazole inhibited only 70.1% of the uropathogens. the three fluoquinolones  tested had comparable activity ranging from 83.0% for ciprofloxacin, to 83.6% for levofloxacin and 84.9% for prulifloxacin, indicating an identical spectrum of cross resistance. nitrofurantoin (96.7%) and fosfomycin (98.6%) were the most potent drugs. against the whole collection of uropathogens, only cefuroxime, nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin overcame the threshold of 90% activity, with the fluoroquinolones and amoxicillin-clavulanate suffering from about 15% resistance. the results of this survey strongly support the conclusions of recent italian guidelines concerning the best empiric treatment of uti in this country today.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  == the first beta-lactamase was identified in an isolate of escherichia coli in 1940. to date, there are >130 tem-type and >50 sulfhydryl variable (shv)-type beta-lactamases, mainly in e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis  but also in other members of the enterobacteriaceae family and in some nonenteric organisms, such as acinetobacter species. the incidence of expanded-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) varies, depending on which area of the globe the isolates originate from. esbls render the oxyimino-cephalosporins ineffective, and esbl-producing organisms frequently also possess resistance factors to other classes of antibiotics, such as aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones, and possibly also piperacillin-tazobactam and cefepime. these results suggest that microbiology laboratories should routinely test for the presence of these strains among their isolates and that the antibiotics of choice for infections believed to be caused by these types of organisms are the carbapenems.

TI  == [antibiotic resistance transformation in community-acquired urinary infections].
AB  == objective: to detect the prevalence of uropathogens in community-acquired urinary tract infection in our environment, and the degree of sensitivity to antibiotics  used as empirical treatment. patients and method: retrospective longitudinal study on 16,392 consecutive urine cultures collected in the emergency department  of hospital del mar, between january 1997 and december 2001. resistance rates were compared through variance analysis. results: 8,743 urine cultures with significant count were obtained. 6,062 escherichia coli (69.3%), 517 proteus mirabilis (5.9%) and 390 klebsiella pneumoniae (4.5%) were identified. escherichia coli showed progressive growth rate and significant resistances to most of antibiotics evaluated, especially to quinolones which came close to 30%.  fosfomycin showed the least resistance rate (0.9%) and remained stable along the  years studied. conclusions: these results suggest that higher rate of resistance  to quinolones does not advise its use as empirical in community-acquired urinary  tract infection treatment in our environment. according to our experience, fosfomycin can be an excellent option for cystitis treatment in patients without  risk factors, while for the treatment of parenchymatous urinary tract infection,  complicated urinary tract infections, and urinary tract infections associated to  risk factors, preference could be second or third generation oral cephalosporins, or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.

AB  == the aim of the study was to investigate the phenotypic and genetic characteristics of recently emerging cefoxitin-resistant and induction-positive isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella species, and proteus mirabilis. strains  of enterobacteriaceae were isolated at a korean tertiary care hospital between june and december 2002. induction was tested using cefoxitin and aztreonam disks, the bladha allele was detected by pcr, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) patterns were also analyzed. among the cefoxitin-resistant isolates, 2.7%  of e. coli, 21.1% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 32.0% of klebsiella oxytoca, and 8.3% of p. mirabilis isolates showed induction, and were bladha-1 allele positive. to  the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of bladha-1 in p. mirabilis.  the mics of ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and aztreonam increased significantly by higher inoculum, suggesting that their clinical usefulness is limited. presence of multiple pfge patterns and identical patterns in some isolates suggest that the widely disseminated bladha-1 in klebsiella species was because of both horizontal and clonal spread.

AB  == from 5 march 2001 to 19 october 2001, outbreaks of broncho-alveolar lavage (bal)  contamination with enterobacteraceae were detected in our 700-bed institution. we report the investigation of these outbreaks. a case was defined as the occurrence of pairs of specific enterobacteraceae in bal specimens among any patients who underwent bronchoscopy in the respiratory unit during the period of the outbreak. contamination was identified in 117 bal samples during three outbreaks among 418  patients, and was associated with bronchoscopes 11 and 12 (p<0.001). the other five devices in use were not linked with the outbreaks. during the first outbreak, particular pairs of micro-organisms were associated with a specific bronchoscope (klebsiella pneumoniae/proteus vulgaris with bronchoscope 11, and morganella morganii/proteus mirabilis with bronchoscope 12). cultures of sputa from two patients also yielded m. morganii some days after bronchoscopic examination. isolates from contaminated bal samples and bronchoscope 11 had similar patterns by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. no further cases occurred after removal of the implicated bronchoscopes. no deficiencies in disinfection procedures were detected and the source of contamination was found to be a loose  port of the biopsy channel of the bronchoscope. our findings underscore the urgent need to test bronchoscopic samples regularly and to improve the design and structure of bronchoscopes.

AB  == background: antibiotic resistance in the longterm-care facility (ltcf) setting is of increasing concern due to both the increased morbidity and mortality related to infections in this debilitated population and the potential for transfer of resistant organisms to other healthcare settings. longitudinal trends in antibiotic resistance in ltcfs have not been well described. design: correlational longitudinal survey study. setting: four ltcfs in pennsylvania. subjects: all clinical cultures of residents of the participating ltcfs (700 total beds) from 1998 through 2003. we assessed the annual prevalence of resistance to various antimicrobials of interest for the following organisms: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus species. results: a total of  4,954 clinical isolates were obtained during the study. a high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance was noted for many organism-drug combinations. this was  especially true for fluoroquinolone susceptibility among the enterobacteriaceae (susceptibility range, 51.3% to 92.2%). in addition, the prevalence of resistance to various agents differed significantly across study sites. finally, significant increasing trends in resistance were noted over time and were most pronounced for fluoroquinolone susceptibility among the enterobacteriaceae. conclusions: the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance has increased significantly in ltcfs, although trends have varied substantially across different institutions. these trends have been particularly pronounced for fluoroquinolone resistance among the enterobacteriaceae. these findings demonstrate that antimicrobial resistance is widespread and increasing in ltcfs, highlighting the need for future studies to more clearly elucidate the risk factors for, and potential interventions against, emerging resistance in these settings.

TI  == microbial resistance to antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections in mexican children.
AB  == urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections in female children. this infection has a prevalence of 4.1 to 7.1% during infancy. the bacterial agents causing the urinary tract infection are escherichia coil (80-90%), followed by other gram negative germs such as klebsiella pneumoniae and enterococcus species and gram positive such as staphylococcus species. typical treatment for this infection is ampicillin or the mixture of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (tmt/smx) among others. however, a high incidence of microbial resistance to these antibiotics has been observed recently. the purpose of this study was to assess the microbial resistance of the most frequent infectious agents in urinary tract of mexican children from january to december 2000. a total of 725 urinary cultures were collected during all year. of these, 293 patients were positive of the most frequently reported bacteria including escherichia coil (205 patients, 69.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (67 patients, 22.8%) and proteus mirabilis (21 patients, 7.1%). infections produced by escherichia coil were highly resistant to ampicillin (83.5%) and tmt/smx (76.7%). results indicate a high incidence of microbial resistance to ampicillin and tmt/smx in urinary tract infections in mexican children and suggest caution before giving a treatment with antibiotic in this condition.

TI  == evaluation of the microscan esbl plus confirmation panel for detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == objective: we aimed to assess the performance of the microscan esbl plus confirmation panel using a series of 87 oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacilli of various species. methods: organisms tested included 57 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains comprising enterobacter aerogenes (3), enterobacter cloacae (10), escherichia coli (11), klebsiella pneumoniae (26), klebsiella oxytoca (3) and proteus mirabilis (4). also included were 30 strains resistant to oxyimino cephalosporins but lacking esbls, which were characterized with other resistance mechanisms, such as inherent clavulanate susceptibility in acinetobacter spp. (4), hyperproduction of ampc enzyme in citrobacter freundii (2), e. aerogenes (3), e. cloacae (3), e. coli (4), hafnia alvei (1) and morganella morganii (1), production of plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase in k. pneumoniae (3) and e. coli (3) or hyperproduction of k1 enzyme in k. oxytoca (6). results: the microscan mic-based clavulanate synergy correctly classified 50 of 57 esbl strains as esbl-positive and 23 of 30 non-esbl strains as esbl-negative (yielding a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 76.7%, respectively). false negatives among esbl producers were highest with enterobacter spp. due to masking interactions between esbl and ampc beta-lactamases. false-positive classifications occurred in two acinetobacter spp., one e. coli producing plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase and two k. oxytoca hyperproducing their chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase. conclusion: the microscan clavulanate synergy test proved to be a valuable tool for esbl confirmation. however, this test has limitations in detecting esbls in enterobacter spp. and in discriminating esbl-related resistance from the k1 enzyme and from inherent clavulanate susceptibility in acinetobacter spp.

TI  == in vitro activity of ave1330a, an innovative broad-spectrum non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor.
AB  == objectives: production of beta-lactamases is the main mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in gram-negative bacteria. despite the current use of clavulanic acid, sulbactam and tazobactam, the prevalence of class a and class c enzymes is increasing worldwide, demanding new beta-lactamase inhibitors. here we report the antimicrobial properties of ave1330a, a representative of a novel class of bridged bicyclico[3.2.1]diazabicyclo-octanones in combination with ceftazidime. materials and methods: ic(50) and kinetic parameters of the hydrolysis reaction were used to characterize beta-lactamase inhibition by ave1330a. mics for >600 strains were determined with the combination ceftazidime/ave1330a at a fixed ratio of 4:1. results: ic(50)s of ave1330a for tem-1 and p99 enzymes were 0.0023  mg/l (8 nm) and 0.023 mg/l (80 nm), compared with 0.027 mg/l (130 nm) and 205.1 mg/l (1 x 10(6) nm) of clavulanic acid and 0.013 mg/l (40 nm) and 1.6 mg/l (5000  nm) of tazobactam. a highly stable covalent complex led to a low turnover of ave1330a. mics of ceftazidime/ave1330a for enterobacteriaceae were at least eight-fold lower than those of ceftazidime alone. all of the escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter and proteus mirabilis strains, including ceftazidime-resistant isolates, were inhibited at 4-8 mg/l. only 2 mg/l were required to inhibit other proteeae, enterobacter, salmonella and serratia. conclusion: the combination of ceftazidime with ave1330a exhibited broad-spectrum activity against ambler class a- and class c-producing enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == resistance rates to commonly used antimicrobials among pathogens of both bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection.
AB  == this study examined the distribution of organisms and their antimicrobial resistance in patients admitted due to acute bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection (uti). during a period of 1 year and 1 month, a total of 201 patients and 253 bacterial isolates were studied. fever higher than 38.5 degrees c was significantly more common in the bacteremic group  than the non-bacteremic group (68% vs 48%; p<0.05). escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis were the most common organisms isolated. e. coli was the leading pathogen and it was significantly more predominant in bacteremic uti than non-bacteremic uti (73% vs 49%; p<0.01).  bacteria other than e. coli (i.e., k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, proteus spp., morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter spp., acinetobacter baumannii, serratia marcescens, and providencia spp.) were more common in non-bacteremic uti than bacteremic uti (44% vs 22%; p<0.01). e. coli isolated from both bacteremic and non-bacteremic patients had a high rate of resistance to ampicillin (80%), cephalothin (59%), gentamicin (29%), piperacillin (61%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (56%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (34%), and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (36%). isolates of p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and  proteus spp. from the non-bacteremic group showed a higher proportion of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, aminoglycosides (netilmicin and amikacin) and ciprofloxacin. the emergence of a high rate of resistance to commonly used antimicrobials (ampicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, piperacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid) may have an impact on the antibiotic treatment of patients admitted due to acute community-acquired bacteremic or non-bacteremic uti in taiwan. further studies are needed to clarify the impact of antimicrobial  resistance on the outcome in these conditions.

AB  == in this study we evaluated the prevalence of enterobacteriaceae and the epidemiology of esbl+ microorganisms in an icu of our institution over a 5-year period and analyzed the clinical features and outcomes of the infections caused by these microorganisms. the most frequent esbl+ isolate was proteus mirabilis (69 isolates, 58%); a high rate of positive results in the double-disk synergy test (dds) was also recognized for klebsiella pneumoniae (52 isolates, 51%), whereas this phenomenon was observed less frequently in other species. in 312 cases the isolated microorganism was considered to be the cause of infection; we  documented 103 wound infections, 89 utis, 62 lrtis, 30 primary bacteremias, 27 infections of indwelling catheters and 1 cns infection. the overall mortality rate due to esbl+ strains was 1%, compared with 10.6% rate caused by esbl-negative enterobacteriaceae. this could be explained because esbl+ strains caused mostly localized infections (wound infections and utis), whereas systemic  or severe infections were sustained by esbl-negative strains, and therapy with carbapenems was started promptly after esbl+ isolation (always within 24h after strain isolation).

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

AB  == objectives: in this study, we evaluated the performance of a new esbl etest configuration based on clavulanate synergy with cefepime compared with cefotaxime-clavulanate and ceftazidime-clavulanate esbl etest strips for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) in an enterobacteriaceae strain collection, with special focus on enterobacter spp. methods: overall, a total of 54 clinical isolates of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae species were evaluated: enterobacter aerogenes (n=3), enterobacter cloacae (n=10), escherichia coli (n=10), klebsiella oxytoca (n=3), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=25) and proteus mirabilis (n=3). to check etest behaviour with resistance phenotypes similar to esbl, our panel was expanded by six clinical isolates of k. oxytoca that were identified as putative producers of their chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase. results: with this panel, esbl etest was 98% sensitive with cefepime-clavulanate, 83% with cefotaxime-clavulanate, and 74% with ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. concentrating on enterobacter spp., reliable esbl detection could only be achieved by the new cefepime-clavulanate strip since it confirmed esbl production in all strains (100% sensitivity) whereas only 4/13 (31%) of enterobacter strains were positive using cefotaxime-clavulanate or ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. a limitation of using the new cefepime strip was less than optimal specificity with k1 phenotypes of k. oxytoca: among six strains, four isolates were scored false-positive by etest strips containing cefepime-clavulanate. conclusion: the new etest esbl strip containing cefepime-clavulanate is a valuable supplement to  current methods for detection of esbls. in our study collection, the cefepime-clavulanate strip was the best configuration for detection of esbls, particularly in enterobacter spp.

TI  == cefotaximases (ctx-m-ases), an expanding family of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  == among the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, the cefotaximases (ctx-m-ases) constitute a rapidly growing cluster of enzymes that have disseminated geographically. the ctx-m-ases, which hydrolyze cefotaxime efficiently, are mostly encoded by transferable plasmids, and the enzymes have been found predominantly in enterobacteriaceae, most prevalently in escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis. isolates of vibrio cholerae, acinetobacter baumannii, and aeromonas hydrophila encoding ctx-m-ases have also been reported. the ctx-m-ases belong to the molecular class  a beta-lactamases, and the enzymes are functionally characterized as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. this group of beta-lactamases confers resistance to penicillins, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and monobactams, and the enzymes are inhibited by clavulanate, sulbactam, and tazobactam. typically, the ctx-m-ases hydrolyze cefotaxime more efficiently than ceftazidime, which is reflected in substantially higher mics to cefotaxime than to ceftazidime. phylogenetically, the ctx-m-ases are divided into four subfamilies that seem to have descended from chromosomal beta-lactamases of kluyvera spp. insertion sequences, especially isecp1, have been found adjacent to genes encoding enzymes  of all four subfamilies. the class i integron-associated orf513 also seems to be  involved in the mobilization of blactx-m genes. this review discusses the phylogeny and the hydrolytic properties of the ctx-m-ases, as well as their geographic occurrence and mode of spread.

TI  == urinary bactericidal activity, urinary excretion and plasma concentrations of gatifloxacin (400 mg) versus ciprofloxacin (500 mg) in healthy volunteers after a single oral dose.
AB  == in an open randomised double-crossover study 12 volunteers (six men, six women) received a single oral dose of gatifloxacin (400 mg) or ciprofloxacin (500 mg) to assess urinary bactericidal activity (in eight intervals up to 120 h) and pharmacokinetic (pk) parameters (up to 36 h). plasma concentrations and urinary excretion were determined by hplc with fluorescence detection, and urinary bactericidal titers (ubt) by microdilution-method, using antibiotic-free urine of each volunteer. the mean maximum plasma concentration of gatifloxacin was 3.35 mg/l and that of ciprofloxacin 2.12 mg/l. the mean (median) cumulative renal excretion of the parent drug was for gatifloxacin 81 (83)% of the administered dose within 120 h and for ciprofloxacin 43 (45)%. the ubts, i.e. the highest two-fold dilution (antibiotic-free urine as diluent) of urine still being bactericidal, were determined for an escherichia coli atcc reference strain and nine clinical uropathogens with the following mics (mg/l) for gatifloxacin/ciprofloxacin (microdilution, mhb): e. coli atcc 25922 (0.008/0.008); e. coli 523 (0.06/0.06); klebsiella pneumoniae 1058 (0.03/0.016);  proteus mirabilis 524 (0.125/0.016); pseudomonas aeruginosa 561 (1/0.125); enterococcus faecalis strains 60 an 55 (0.5/1 and 8/32); staphylococcus aureus strains 248 and 596 (both 0.03/0.125) and s. saprophyticus ho94 (0.125/0.25). the median ubts measured within the first 6h for gatifloxacin were between 1:16 and 1:>or=1024 for the gram-negative strains including p. aeruginosa and between 1:8  and 1:>or=1024 for the five gram-positive strains. the median ubts for ciprofloxacin were between 1:64 and 1:>or=1024 for the gram-negative strains (incl p. aeruginosa) and between 1:1.5 and 1:768 for the five gram-positive strains. the ubts up to 12 < 0.05 h showed no difference (p<0.05 ) for both e. coli strains, but ciprofloxacin was superior to gatifloxacin against klebsiella,  proteus and pseudomonas strains and gatifloxacin was superior to ciprofloxacin against all gram-positive strains. for the ubts at 12-24 h, gatifloxacin was generally superior to ciprofloxacin, but showed no difference in the proteus and  pseudomonas strains. the areas under the ubt-time-curve (aubt) up to 120 h showed statistically significant (p ) differences between both quinolones in favour of gatifloxacin against 8 of 10 strains tested, no difference for p. mirabilis and significantly higher activity of ciprofloxacin against p. aeruginosa. in conclusion, gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin had overall comparable initial urinary bactericidal activity with some differences for specific pathogens, some times in favour of gatifloxacin (gram-positives) and some times of ciprofloxacin (usually  gram-negatives), suggesting that for empiric therapy a single oral dose of gatifloxacin (400mg) would be clinically equivalent to ciprofloxacin (500 mg) twice daily-in agreement with the results of a clinical study in complicated uti  performed previously [int. j. antimicrob. agents (2004)].

TI  == the status of antimicrobial resistance in taiwan among gram-negative pathogens: the taiwan surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (tsar) program, 2000.
AB  == in a nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (taiwan surveillance of  antimicrobial resistance, tsar), isolates were collected from 21 medical centers  and regional hospitals throughout taiwan over a three-month period in 2000 (tsar  ii). this report summarizes susceptibility data of 7 common gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii) in the tsar ii collection and compared selected key forms of resistance by epidemiologic factors and with isolates collected in 1998 (tsar i) as well as with data from international surveillance studies. resistance of the 5 enterobacteriaceae species to most of the commonly prescribed "first-line" antimicrobials in taiwan, such as ampicillin (78% in e. coli, 68% in p. mirabilis), gentamicin (19% in k. pneumonia to 66% in s. marcescens), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (29% in k.  pneumoniae to 70% in p. mirabilis), was high, several of which are higher than other countries. resistance to certain broad-spectrum antimicrobials is also more acute in taiwan than most western countries, such as ceftazidime resistant a. baumannii (73%) and ciprofloxacin resistant e. coli (12%). differences in geographic regions and specimen types were associated with certain forms of resistance in tsar ii; however, the resistance problem is prevalent among both inpatients and outpatients of not only medical centers but also regional hospitals throughout taiwan.

TI  == [surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2002].
AB  == the antibacterial activity of cefmetazole (cmz) against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over japan was evaluated yearly for two years from june  2000 to march 2002 and compared with that of other parenteral beta-lactams, cefazolin (cez), cefotiam (ctm), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and flomoxef (fmox). in the first surveillance from june 2000 to march 2001, 575 isolates of 13 species were tested, and 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from april 2001 to march 2002. in these surveillances spanning two years, the mic90s of cmz against the bacterial species tested hardly differed. changes in percent resistance of each species to cmz (mic of cmz > or = 32 micrograms/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (mssa, 0%-->0%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, 73%-->87%), staphylococcus epidermidis (19%-->32%), other coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. (other cns, 13%-->18%), escherichia coli (4%-->1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3%-->4%), klebsiella oxytoca (0%-->0%), proteus mirabilis (2%-->2%), proteus vulgaris (14%-->7%), morganella morganii (7%-->0%), providencia spp. (17%-->0%),  peptostreptococcus spp. (0%-->0%), bacteroides fragilis (10%-->11%), and other bacteroides spp. (79%-->88%). the change in percent resistance of mrsa, s. epidermidis, other cns, and other bacteroides spp. tended to increase. in addition, the percent resistance of b. fragilis was 10%. it is necessary to pay much attention to the trends observed in these species. compared to other drugs tested, against mssa, the activity of cmz was inferior to that of cez, ctm, and fmox and superior to that of sbt/cpz. against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and cns, the  tested drugs exhibited little activity. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and inferior to that  of fmox. against b. fragilis and other bacteroides spp., the activity of cmz was  almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and comparable to or inferior to that of  sbt/cpz and fmox. no remarkable changes in the activity of cmz were observed in this study compared with studies conducted before cmz was launched. this result suggests that cmz still maintains potent activity.

TI  == different susceptibilities of staphylococcus and gram-negative rods to epigallocatechin gallate.
AB  == we examined the antibacterial effects of epigallocatechin gallate (egcg, the main constituent of tea catechins) against various strains of staphylococcus and gram-negative rods. compared to the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of egcg against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hominis, and s. haemolyticus (50-100 micro g/ml), higher mics (>or=800 micro g/ml) were observed against gram-negative rods, including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens. and difference was observed between the binding abilities of egcg with viable s. aureus and with e. coli. the bactericidal activity of egcg for s. aureus was blocked dose-dependently by purified peptidoglycan but not by lipopolysaccharide  or dextran. it was also found that peptone and protein, but not amino acids, in the culture medium greatly affected the antibacterial activity of egcg. these results indicate that the structure of the bacterial cell wall and the different  affinities of egcg with the various cell wall components are responsible for the  different susceptibilities of staphylococcus and gram-negative rods to egcg.

TI  == replacement of broad-spectrum cephalosporins by piperacillin-tazobactam: impact on sustained high rates of bacterial resistance.
AB  == we have previously observed a significant reduction of ceftriaxone resistance in  proteus mirabilis associated with an increase in the use of cefepime, along with  a decrease in the consumption of broad-spectrum cephalosporins (cep). however, we did not observe such a reduction with klebsiella pneumoniae. therefore, we sought to determine whether replacement of cep by piperacillin-tazobactam might be useful in reducing sustained high rates of cep resistance by this organism. we used a 6-month "before and after model"; during the second (intervention) period, most prescriptions of cep were changed to piperacillin-tazobactam at the pharmacy. no additional barrier precautions were undertaken. during intervention, consumption of ceftazidime decreased from 17.73 to 1.14 defined daily doses (ddd) per 1,000 patient-days (p < 0.0001), whereas that of piperacillin-tazobactam increased from 0 to 30.57 ddd per 1,000 patient-days (p < 0.0001). the levels of  resistance to cep by k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis decreased from 68.4 and 57.9% to 37.5 and 29.4%, respectively (p < 0.05). we conclude that replacement of ceftazidime by piperacillin-tazobactam might be a suitable strategy to decrease endemic cep resistance by k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, even where there are high bacterial resistance rates and irrespective of any additional precautions for controlling nosocomial infection.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

AB  == in 1999, 39 of 2,599 isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae (1.5%) collected by eight private laboratories in the aquitaine region in france produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl). among these were 19 enterobacter aerogenes isolates; 8 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates; 6 escherichia coli isolates; 3 proteus mirabilis isolates; and 1 isolate each of serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and providencia stuartii. esbl producers were isolated from 38 patients, including 33 residents of 11 clinics or nursing homes  and 5 ambulatory patients. seven different esbls were characterized. these mainly consisted of tem-24 (25 isolates) and tem-21 (9 isolates), but tem-15 (2 isolates) and tem-3, tem-19, shv-4, and ctx-m-1 (1 isolate each) were also characterized. seven strains showed the coexistence of different tem- and/or shv-encoding genes, including a new shv-1 variant, shv-44, defined by the substitution r205l previously reported for shv-3 in association with s238g. the epidemiology of the esbl producers was investigated by random amplification of polymorphic dna, typing by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus pcr, analysis of resistance cotransferred with the esbl, and analysis of the restriction profiles of the esbl-encoding plasmids. of the tem-24-expressing strains, 18 were e. aerogenes isolates, including 9 from the same clinic, that were representatives of the epidemic clone disseminating in france. of the tem-21-producing strains that belonged to different species of the family enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis), 8 were isolated in the same nursing home. outbreaks due to strain and/or plasmid dissemination in these clinic and nursing home were demonstrated. the presence of esbl producers in five ambulatory patients probably resulted from nosocomial acquisition. our data highlight the serious need to monitor patients for esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae in general practice.

TI  == susceptibility trends in bacteraemias: analyses of 7544 patient-unique bacteraemic episodes spanning 11 years (1990-2000).
AB  == the aim of the present study was to design more accurate tools for the selection  of appropriate antimicrobial therapy for hospitalized patients with suspected sepsis. we created a large database comprising data on all patient-unique blood cultures obtained over an 11 year period (1 january, 1990 through 31 december, 2000). improved statistical tools were applied to assess the trends in in vitro activity of individual antibiotic agents against various bacteria over time, and  to calculate susceptibility rates of subsets of organisms. during the 11 year study period, 173571 blood cultures were obtained, of which 17703 (10.2%) were positive, with 7544 patient-unique blood cultures (4.3%). the mean annual number  of positive, patient-unique cultures was 686 (standard deviation=79). the 10 most frequently isolated organisms were: escherichia coli (1494), staphylococcus aureus (1240), klebsiella pneumoniae (779), enterococcus spp. (631), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (488), streptococcus pneumoniae (447), enterobacter spp. (338), acinetobacter spp. (298), proteus mirabilis (260) and candida spp. (254). no significant change was detected in the annual rates (means, standard deviations)  per 1000 admissions of these organisms: the highest was e. coli (5.5, 1), the lowest was candida (1, 0.3). forty percent of organisms (n=2943) were obtained from patients in the emergency department (ed), 23% (1744) in medical departments, 15% (1134) in paediatric units, 13% (998) on surgical wards and 9% (709) in intensive care units (icus). trend statistical analysis revealed a significant decrease in susceptibility in ed enterobacteriaceae to eight of 15 (53%) tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 1.6%+/-0.6%, in the icu isolates, a significant decrease was detected in only five (33%) of the tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 2.5%+/-1.3%. the difference in susceptibility between ed and icu isolates was significant for all antimicrobials (p<0.001). a significant decrease in the susceptibility of e coli  to nine of 15 drugs (60%) was detected, ranging from 0.7% to 2.7% annually. in k. pneumoniae a significant decrease in susceptibility of k. pneumoniae was detected with only two agents. pseudomonas spp. isolates remained highly sensitive to all  traditional anti-pseudomonal agents, without significant decay in sensitivity rates over time. susceptibility of s. aureus to methicillin decreased significantly for several subsets of patients (p<0.001). marked differences in susceptibility rates between the departments were detected. trend statistical analyses, when appropriately applied to multi-year databases of microbial susceptibilities, may yield susceptibility tables that are significantly more accurate than traditional semi-annual or annual tables.

TI  == in vitro susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria isolated from hospitalized patients in four european countries, canada, and the united states in 2000-2001 to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and comparator antimicrobials: implications for therapy.
AB  == access to current antimicrobial agent surveillance data is an important prerequisite for the optimal management of patients with hospital-acquired infections. the present study used data collected in 2000 to 2001 from 670 laboratories in europe (france, germany, italy, and spain), canada, and the united states to report on the in vitro activities of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and comparative agents against >125,000 isolates of gram-negative bacteria from hospitalized patients. all but two isolates of enterobacteriaceae (one isolate of proteus mirabilis from france and one isolate of morganella morganii from canada) were susceptible to imipenem. the susceptibility of escherichia coli to ceftriaxone or cefotaxime was > or = 97% in each country, and for p. mirabilis, susceptibility was 99% in each country except italy. in contrast, susceptibility  of e. coli to ciprofloxacin varied from 80.5% (spain) to 94.0% (france); levofloxacin susceptibility ranged from 75.2% (spain) to 91.6% (united states). among klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca isolates, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime susceptibilities ranged from 86.6 to 98.7% and 83.5 to 99.7%, respectively, depending upon the country. considerable geographic variation in the susceptibilities (generally 85 to 95% susceptible) of serratia marcescens and m. morganii to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were observed. for s. marcescens, susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam varied from 81.5% (france) to 94.1% (italy) and susceptibility to ciprofloxacin ranged from 66.2% (germany) to 90.7%  (spain). enterobacter cloacae and enterobacter aerogenes were less susceptible to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime than were the other species of enterobacteriaceae studied. the present study demonstrated that established parenteral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin antimicrobial agents retain significant in vitro  activity against many clinically important gram-negative pathogens.

AB  == twelve isolates of enterobacteriaceae (1 of klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 of escherichia coli, 1 of proteus mirabilis, and 2 of proteus vulgaris) classified as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers according to the esbl screen flow application of the bd-phoenix automatic system and for which the cefotaxime  mics were higher than those of ceftazidime were collected between january 2001 and july 2002 at the laboratory of clinical microbiology of the san matteo university hospital of pavia (northern italy). by pcr and sequencing, a ctx-m-type determinant was detected in six isolates, including three of e. coli (carrying bla(ctx-m-1)), two of p. vulgaris (carrying bla(ctx-m-2)), and one of k. pneumoniae (carrying bla(ctx-m-15)). the three ctx-m-1-producing e. coli isolates were from different wards, and genotyping by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) revealed that they were clonally unrelated to each other.  the two ctx-m-2-producing p. vulgaris isolates were from the same ward (although  isolated several months apart), and pfge analysis revealed probable clonal relatedness. the bla(ctx-m-1) and bla(ctx-m-2) determinants were transferable to  e. coli by conjugation, while conjugative transfer of the bla(ctx-m-15) determinant from k. pneumoniae was not detectable. present findings indicate that ctx-m enzymes of various types are present also in italy and underscore that different ctx-m determinants can be found in a single hospital and can show different dissemination patterns. this is also the first report of ctx-m-2 in p.  vulgaris.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae in buenos aires, argentina, public hospitals.
AB  == resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is often associated with plasmid encoded extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl). in order to evaluate the prevalence and diversity of esbls in enterobacteria in our city, a 1-month-period survey was carried out from april to may 2000. extended-spectrum-cephalosporin-resistant strains, isolated from inpatient clinical specimens other than stools, were collected among 17 participating hospitals. from a total of 427 enterobacterial strains that were collected during this period, 39 were extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistant. the national committee for clinical laboratory standards' screening and confirmatory tests for esbl production were performed using cefotaxime and ceftazidime; cefepime and cefepime-clavulanic acid-containing disks were included. beta-lactamases were characterized by isoelectric focusing and pcr amplification using specific primers. three different esbls were detected: shv-related (4 isolates), per-2-type (9 isolates), and ctx-m-2-related (26 isolates). sequencing of the corresponding genes confirmed ctx-m-2 in 19 of 21 and ctx-m-31 (an allelic variant) in the remaining 2 of 21. ctx-m-2 (or its variant) was detected in all escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, and providencia stuartii strains, while per-2 was detected in enterobacter cloacae, e. aerogenes, and klebsiella pneumoniae; shv-related esbl were found only in k. pneumoniae. these results clearly show that ctx-m-2 is the most prevalent esbl produced by enterobacterial species isolated from public hospitals in buenos aires.

TI  == ampc beta-lactamase producing multidrug resistant strains of klebsiella spp. & escherichia coli isolated from children under five in chennai.
AB  == background & objectives: ampc beta-lactamases are group i cephalosporinases that  confer resistance to a wide variety of beta-lactam drugs. plasmid mediated ampc beta-lactamases has been discovered most frequently in isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, salmonella, proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. the present study was undertaken to study the occurrence of multidrug resistant and ampc beta-lactamase producing klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli in children less than five years of age as this age group is very susceptible to intestinal and extraintestinal infections. methods: a total of 116 isolates of klebsiella species and 32 isolates of esch. coli were tested for resistance to cephamycin such as cefoxitin, third generation cephalosporin (3gc) antibiotics (ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone), ampicillin, amikacin, cephaloridine, cefuroxime, co-trimoxazole, gentamycin, imipenem and tetracycline by disc diffusion method. isolates found resistant to cefoxitin were tested for the production of ampc beta-lactamases by three dimensional extract method. transconjugation experiments were done to study the transfer of drug resistance and ampc beta lactamase production from ampc producing klebsiella and esch. coli isolates to a recipient  esch. coli strain (k12 j62-2). results: twenty eight isolates (24.1%) of klebsiella spp. and 12 (37.5%) of esch. coli were found to be ampc beta-lactamase producers; 66.6 per cent and 81 per cent of klebsiella and esch. coli isolates respectively showed resistance to all the 3gcs. all the strains were found to be  sensitive to imipenem. eighty four (72%) of klebsiella isolates and 20 (62.5%) of esch. coli were found to be resistant to cefoxitin. transfer of cefoxitin resistance to the recipient strain was observed in all the ampc producing strains of klebsiella spp. of the 12 ampc producing strains of esch. coli, only 4 (33.3%) showed the transfer of cefoxitin resistance to the recipient strain. interpretation & conclusion: this study has shown the occurrence of ampc beta-lactamase producing klebsiella and esch. coli strains in children in chennai. since ampc beta-lactamase production is frequently accompanied by multiresistance to antibiotics, therapeutic options become limited resulting a need for new measures for the management of klebsiella and esch. coli infections. also failure to identify ampc beta-lactamase producers may lead to inappropriate  antimicrobial treatment and may result in increased mortality. detecting plasmid  mediated ampc beta-lactamase producing strains is technically difficult and the phenotypic tests for ampc detection are not well defined. if an investigational ampc beta-lactamase inhibitor was made available for diagnostic testing, it could be useful in combination with a suitable cephamycin to confirm ampc production.

TI  == pharmacological profile of extracts of pelargonium sidoides and their constituents.
AB  == in areas of southern africa, aqueous extracts from the roots of pelargonium sidoides are employed to cure various disorders. nowadays, a modern formulation (eps 7630), elaborated from the traditional herbal medicine, is successfully used for the treatment of respiratory tract diseases. we previously observed that root extracts of p. sidoides and their representative constituents exhibit moderate antibacterial and significant immunomodulatory capabilities. the present study was performed to further assess the efficacy and mode of action for these pharmacological activities. the results indicate that p. sidoides extracts may well possess antimycobacterial activity as claimed in traditional uses. furthermore, significant antibacterial properties against multi-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains as well as tnf-inducing potencies and prominent interferon-like activities in supernatants of sample-activated bone marrow-derived macrophages were observed using several functional assays. in addition, eps 7630 stimulated the synthesis of ifn-beta in mg 63 cells as demonstrated by a specific enzyme immunoassay. for gallic acid, a characteristic  constituent, evidence for the expression of inos and tnf-alpha transcripts in stimulated raw 264.7 cells and, hence, activation at the transcriptional level was revealed by rt-pcr. the present results, when taken together with the recently reported pharmacological activities, provide for a rationale basis of the utilization of eps 7630 in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.

TI  == is combination antimicrobial therapy required for urinary tract infection in children?
AB  == this retrospective study examined the characteristics of 338 pediatric patients presenting with a first episode of symptomatic urinary tract infection at taichung veterans general hospital from november 1996 to december 2001. escherichia coli was the most common pathogen (72.5%), followed by proteus mirabilis (8.3%), enterococcus (5.6%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (4.7%). they were more susceptible to first-generation cephalosporin in comparison with other  first-line antimicrobial agents such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, and gentamicin. two hundred and eighty-seven (84.9%) of the 338 patients were divided into 3 groups according to the type of antibiotic treatment received, and the susceptibility rate and the averaged day of defervescence after effective antibiotic therapy were compared among the groups. group 1 consisted of those patients treated with cefazolin or cephalexin alone (95%, 2.1 days); group  2, cefazolin plus gentamicin (88.9%, 2.8 days); and group 3, ampicillin plus gentamicin (76.1%, 2.3 days). a total of 38 (13.2%) cases from the 3 antibiotic groups did not respond to empiric antibiotics. for non-susceptible infections, when the antibiotic regimen was switched from cefazolin plus gentamicin to ampicillin alone, only 4 (20%) strains became susceptible, compared with 10 strains (62.5%) becoming susceptible after switching from ampicillin plus gentamicin to cefazolin alone (p < 0.01). the results indicated that first-generation cephalosporin alone is an appropriate treatment for pediatric cases of community-acquired urinary tract infection and suggest that antimicrobial combinations should be reserved for serious or critical cases.

AB  == as a result of the appearance of bacterial strains resistant to 3rd generation cephlosporin, since 1993 cephalosporins of 4th generation have been developed and introduced in therapy; among them are: cefepime and cefpirome. cefepime is the most active 4th generation cephalosporin possessing the following advantages over the 3rd generation cephalosporins: high intrinsic potency due to rapid penetration into the periplasmic space; an extended spectrum of activity that includes many gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; activity against multi-resistant gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacter and klebsiella species; low potential for beta-lactamase induction, especially bush group 1 beta-lactamases, even ar low periplasmic concentrations; minimal selection of resistant mutant strains. its spectrum is very large being very active against gram-negative bacilii: enterobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia, citrobacter, proteus mirabilis and less active against bacillus fragillis. cefepime is also very active against gram-positive cocci: staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only), streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes. some of the methicillin-resistant strains of  staphylococcus are susceptible to cefepime; enterococcus is resistant. due to its high resistance against beta-lactamases cefepime (maxipime) is the best choice in life threatening nosocomial infections occuring in patients in the intensive care units. cefepime can be synergically associated with aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones.

AB  == production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in enterobacteriaceae: identification of esbls based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. the phoenix esbl test (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of esbl-producing gram-negative bacteria. an algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid,  cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical  isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus  mirabilis, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, and citrobacter  koseri. of these isolates, 319 were identified as esbl producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-esbl producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. combined use of isoelectric focusing, pcr, and/or dna sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(tem-1)- and/or bla(shv-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(ctx-m) gene. among the 191 non-esbl-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an ampc-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed tem-1, tem-2, or shv-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all k. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced k1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. the phoenix esbl test system gave positive results for all the 319 esbl-producing isolates and also for two of the four k1-hyperproducing isolates of k. oxytoca. compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. these findings suggest that the phoenix esbl test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of  esbl resistance in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == a uk multicentre study of the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens causing urinary tract infection.
AB  == objectives: to determine the prevalence of resistance amongst urinary tract pathogens against antimicrobials used to treat urinary tract infections (utis) in the uk to provide data to help direct empirical therapy. method: during 1999-2000, a total of 1291 bacterial isolates causing uti were collected from 8 centres in the uk. isolates were cultured from patients with (1). community-acquired uti in those less than 65 years old (397), (2). hospital-acquired uti other than those admitted with pyelonephritis (394), (3). pyelonephritis (108) and (4). community-acquired uti in those greater than 65 years old (392). after re-identification, mics for a range of antimicrobials were determined and interpreted using nccls procedures and interpretive guidelines. results: escherichia coli was the predominant pathogen in all categories but the  total percentage for each category varied (56.3-77.3%). the next three pathogens  of importance were enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis which varied in prevalence slightly from category to category. the activity of amoxycillin against e. coli (51.3% susceptible) was greatly reduced as a result of beta-lactamase production and only partially restored by the addition of clavulanic acid (78.8% susceptible). cefuroxime was very active against e. coli using parenteral form breakpoints (97.1% susceptible) but less so using oral form breakpoints (68.6% susceptible). cefuroxime was inactive against  enterococcus spp. and pseudomonas spp. nitrofurantoin was very active against isolates of e. coli (96.3% susceptible) and e. faecalis but not against k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis or pseudomonas aeruginosa. overall susceptibility to trimethoprim ranged from 58.1% to 84.5% for the most prevalent pathogens. ciprofloxacin was highly active against the uti pathogens examined in this study  with susceptibilities of between 88.6% and 97.7% for the most prevalent pathogens (e. coli, n=864, 97.7% susceptible) and was the only oral agent tested with activity against pseudomonas spp. conclusion: these data provide much needed information on the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance amongst pathogens currently causing uti in the uk.

TI  == prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria among pregnant women in benin city, nigeria.
AB  == a semi-quantitative screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria was carried out in the first trimester of 500 consecutive pregnant women in benin city. the purpose was  to provide baseline data and rational therapy for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women. of the 500 women screened, 433 clinical specimens showed significant bacteriuria, representing an incidence of 86.6%. of this number, 38 (7.4%) were of mixed bacterial colonies while 395 (91%) were of single bacterial  colonies. staphylococcus aureus (29.8%), escherichia coli (29.1%) and klebsiella  pneumoniae (21.5%) were the most frequently isolated pathogens. the high incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy correlated significantly (p <  0.05) with the observed high proportion of pyuria. on average, sensitivity of the pathogens was ciprofloxacin 99.7%; ceftazidime 81.6%; co-trimoxazole 79.4%; augmentin 71.4%; nalidixic acid 61.7%; nitrofurantoin 61.%; gentamycin 56.9% and  ampicillin 25.4%. s. aureus was most sensitive, while proteus mirabilis was least sensitive among the pathogens. rational therapy of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women may prevent associated risks such as pyelonephritis and pre-eclampsia.

TI  == evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == the newly developed rapid lumi eiken/is60 (rl/is60) system automatically determines mics by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. the present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility  testing. chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with mics determined by the reference microdilution method. when the mics of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (qc) strains (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the rl/is60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the qc limits  proposed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the system  was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including e. coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, p. aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae. overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the rl/is60 system and the reference microdilution method. our  results suggest that the rl/is60 system provides rapid and reliable mics of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as qc strains.

TI  == urinary tract infection trends in latin american hospitals: report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1997-2000).
AB  == urinary tract infections (uti) are one of the most common infectious diseases diagnosed in outpatients as well as in hospitalized patients. the objective of this study was to report the frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens collected in latin america between 1997 to 2000 through the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed and results interpreted using reference broth microdilution methods. in the 4 year period, a total of 1961 urine isolates from hospitalized patients were included. the patients' mean age was 51.3 years and most of the infections occurred among women (65.6%). esherichia coli was the  most frequent pathogen isolated followed by klebsiella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis. among the e. coli isolates, piperacillin/tazobactam, aztreonam, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems and amikacin constitute reasonable therapeutic options for treatment of serious uti in latin america (91.0-100.0% susceptible). high resistance rates to fluoroquinolones (17.5-18.9%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (>45.0%) were observed among the e. coli. in contrast, nitrofurantoin displayed susceptibility  rate of > 87.0%. against klebsiella spp. infections, the only effective therapeutic option would be the carbapenems due to the high number of isolates (>30.0%) producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl). even the new fluoroquinolones showed limited activity against klebsiella spp. (72.1-88.6% susceptible) and the p. aeruginosa isolates showed high resistance rates to most  antimicrobial agents tested. the results of this survey endorse the importance of enterobacteriaceae as cause of uti in latin america. our results also demonstrate that the uropathogens isolated in the latin american medical centers exhibit high resistance to various classes of antimicrobial agents. carbapenem-resistant p. aeruginosa, ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli, esbl-producing k. pneumoniae constitute serious problem in this geographic region.

TI  == first occurrence of transferable extended-spectrum beta-lactamase hydrolyzing cefoperazone in multiresistant nosocomial strains of klebsiella pneumoniae from two hospitals in czech and slovak republics.
AB  == the occurrence of positive synergy between antibiotic discs of amoxicillin/clavulanate and cefoperazone was registered in two klebsiella pneumoniae strains, isolated from hospitals in czech and slovak republic, indicating the presence of genes coding for an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase active also against cefoperazone, a broad-spectrum cephalosporin. sulbactam inhibited the hydrolysis of cefoperazone by cell-free lysates of these strains which substantiates its use in combination with cefoperazone. resistance to cephalothin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefoperazone, cefepime and aztreonam was transferred from k. pneumoniae isolates to escherichia coli k-12 3110 and to proteus mirabilis p-38 recipient strains.

TI  == distribution of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae in vietnam.
AB  == among 730 escherichia coli, 438 klebsiella pneumoniae, and 141 proteus mirabilis  isolates obtained between september 2000 and september 2001 in seven hospitals in ho chi minh city, vietnam, 26.6% were resistant to ceftazidime, 30% were resistant to cefotaxime, 31.5% were resistant to ceftriaxone, 15.9% were resistant to cefoperazone, and 6% were resistant to cefepime. resistance to imipenem was found in 5.6% of the isolates. in 55 strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (32 e. coli isolates, 13 k. pneumoniae isolates, and 10 p. mirabilis isolates), structural genes for veb-1 (25.5%), ctx-m (25.5%), shv (38.1%), and tem (76.3%) enzymes were detected alone or in combination. sequencing of the pcr products obtained from the k. pneumoniae isolates revealed the presence of bla(veb-1), bla(ctx-m-14), bla(ctx-m-17), bla(shv-2), and bla(tem-1). molecular typing of the strains with a similar resistance phenotype to broad-spectrum cephalosporins indicated polyclonal spread. isecp1 was presumably responsible for dissemination of the bla(ctx-m-like) gene.

TI  == the inner-core lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic waae gene: function and genetic distribution among some enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == to determine the function of the waae gene in the biosynthesis of the inner-core  lps of klebsiella pneumoniae, a waae non-polar mutant has been constructed. data  obtained from the comparative chemical analysis of lps samples obtained from the  wild-type, the mutant strain and the complemented mutant demonstrated that the waae gene is involved in substitution of alpha-l-glycero-d-manno-heptopyranose i  (l,d-heppi) at the o-4 position by a beta-d-glucopyranose (beta-d-glcp) residue.  in addition, dna amplification and nucleotide sequence determination studies revealed that waae homologues located between the waaa and coad genes are present in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae containing the structure beta-d-glcp-(1-->4)-alpha-l,d-heppi (k. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and yersinia enterocolitica), as well as in strains of serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes of unknown lps-core structures. complementation studies using non-polar waae mutants prove that all the waae homologues perform the same  function. furthermore, k. pneumoniae, ser. marcescens and p. mirabilis non-polar  waae mutants showed reduced adhesion and pathogenicity. in addition, the ser. marcescens and p. murabilis waae mutants showed reduced swarming motility and ability to form biofilms in vitro. all these characteristics were rescued by reintroduction of the waae gene independently of its origin. an easy dna amplification method to detect this gene was established, which also helps in finding the potential presence of this structural feature [beta-d-glcp-(1-->4)-alpha-l,d-heppi] in the inner-core lps of enterobacteriaceae members with unknown lps-core structures.

TI  == characterization of cmy-type beta-lactamases in clinical strains of proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae isolated in four hospitals in the paris area.
AB  == we isolated five clinical strains (three proteus mirabilis and two klebsiella pneumoniae) with beta-lactam resistance phenotypes consistent with production of  an ampc-type beta-lactamase. the predicted amino acid sequences of the enzymes were typical of class c beta-lactamases. the enzymes were identified as cmy-2, cmy-4 and a new cmy-variant beta-lactamase, cmy-12. the ampc beta-lactamases from the two k. pneumoniae isolates were found to be encoded on self-transferable plasmids. the genes encoding the ampc-type beta-lactamase produced by the three p. mirabilis isolates were chromosomal. four of the five clinical isolates were from patients transferred from greece, algeria and egypt; one of the k. pneumoniae strains was recovered from a french patient. pfge analysis and rep-pcr fingerprinting showed that the two p. mirabilis isolates from greek patients were closely related.

TI  == infectious background of patients with a history of acute anterior uveitis.
AB  == objective: to study the infectious background of patients with a history of acute anterior uveitis (aau) and healthy control subjects. methods: sixty four patients with previous aau and 64 sex and age matched controls were studied. serum antibodies to salmonellae, yersiniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, campylobacter jejuni, and borrelia burgdorferi were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), and antibodies to chlamydia trachomatis and chlamydia pneumoniae by microimmunofluorescence test. peripheral  blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs), separated by density gradient centrifugation, were studied for salmonella and yersinia antigens by means of an immunofluorescence test, and for c pneumoniae dna with a polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: neither prevalence nor levels of single microbial antibodies studied differed between the patients and control subjects, or between subgroups of patients created on the basis of clinical characteristics. in logistic regression analysis, the high number of recurrences (>10) of aau was independently related to the presence of single or multiple bacterial antibodies  (p=0.04). none of the pbmc samples of the patients were positive for yersinia or  salmonella antigens. c pneumoniae pcr was positive in a patient who was negative  for c pneumoniae antibodies. conclusion: although neither the prevalence nor the  levels of single microbial antibodies studied differed between the patients and the controls, current data suggest that the presence of single or multiple antibodies in patients with many recurrences of aau compared with patients with none or few recurrences may be a sign of repeated infections, antigen persistence, or raised innate immune responsiveness.

TI  == development of an elisa using a recombinant 41 kda partial protein (p45n') for the detection of riemerella anatipestifer infections in ducks.
AB  == riemerella anatipestifer, a gram-negative bacillus, is the causative agent of duck septicemia, a disease which could incur much economic loss in the duck industry. an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) has been developed to facilitate early detection of r. anatipestifer infection in ducks. the antigen used was a recombinant 41 kda n-terminal fragment (rp45n') of a newly characterized r. anatipestifer potential surface protein, p45, which was expressed in escherichia coli as an n-terminal gst fusion protein. the rp45n'-based elisa successfully detected p45 antibodies in the sera of 20 ducks immunized with bacterin preparations of r. anatipestifer serotypes 1, 10 15, 19 and the atcc11845 strain. antibodies to p45 were also detected in the sera of 25% (75/296) of white pekin ducks which were imported into singapore from three different farms. successful discrimination was obtained between sera from infected ducks and that of specific-pathogen free ducks (p<0.01). the rp45n'-gst  antigen did not cross-react with antibodies in sera from guinea pigs which were infected with other gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including aeromonas hydrophila, citrobacter freundii, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pastuerella multocida, proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., serratia maccescens, shigella sonnei and yersinia enterocolitica. in addition, the dna sequence encoding p45 was detected in r. anatipestifer serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and the atcc11845 strain, suggesting that  p45 is probably also universally expressed in these r. anatipestifer serotypes. thus, the elisa described is applicable to the detection of r. anatipestifer infection in ducks.

AB  == a colony of knockout mice (gene designation cybb tm1) has been maintained at this institution for 5 years. these mice are lacking the b subunit of nadph oxidase and are susceptible to experimental infection with aspergillus fumigatus. the purpose of this study was to document the spontaneous diseases present in these mice which are a murine model of x-linked chronic granulomatous disease and to compare these lesions to those of chronic granulomatous disease in humans. lesions were documented in 72 mice submitted to the necropsy service. all 72 mice had an acidophilic macrophage pneumonia, and 16 also had lobar suppurative and necrotizing pneumonias caused by paecilomyces sp. (11 of the 16 mice), a. fumigatus (3 mice), rhizopus sp. (1 mouse), or candida guilliermondii (1 mouse).  of the 72 animals, 36 had severe bacterial suppurative and necrotizing to pyogranulomatous pneumonias; lung abscesses yielded cultures of pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3), enterococcus (n = 6), staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), s. xylosus (n = 1), coagulase-negative staphylococcus sp. (n = 4), gram-negative enteric bacilli (n = 6), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1), and proteus mirabilis (n  = 2). thirteen mice had a necrotizing and suppurative adenitis of the cervical lymph nodes caused by coagulase-negative staphylococcus sp.; s. aureus, s. xylosus, and s. equorum were recovered from abscesses in the cervical lymph nodes, extremities, and head. splenomegaly was found in 30 animals and lymphadenopathy in 11 mice. the array of spontaneously occurring infectious diseases and lesions in these mice is similar to that of human patients with chronic granulomatous disease.

TI  == evaluation of a new etest for detecting metallo-beta-lactamases in routine clinical testing.
AB  == several etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) gradient formats were developed for detection of metallo-beta-lactamases based on the reduction of imipenem (ip) or ceftazidime (tz) mics in the presence of edta or 2-mercaptopropionic acid (mpa).  the etest metallo-beta-lactamase (etest mbl) strips consisted of a double-sided seven-dilution range of ip or tz (4 to 256 microg/ml) and ip or tz (1 to 64 microg/ml) overlaid with a constant concentration of edta or mpa. the prototype strips were evaluated on several agar media (brain heart infusion agar, isosensitest agar, nutrient agar, and mueller-hinton agar for aerobes and brucella blood agar for anaerobes) with 138 challenge strains: acinetobacter spp. (n = 9), aeromonas spp. (n = 8), chryseobacterium spp. (n = 28), escherichia coli (n = 1), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 14), proteus  mirabilis (n = 3), serratia spp. (n = 10), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 43), sphingobacterium spp. (n = 3), and bacteroides fragilis group (n = 15). pcr analysis using specific primers for imp-1, l1, ccra, and bla(b/c) confirmed the presence of the metallo-beta-lactamase genes. enzyme assays were also performed with ip as an indicator substrate followed by edta inhibition profiles. edta was  found to be a better inhibitor of metallo-beta-lactamases, especially for anaerobes. ip was a better than tz. mueller-hinton agar was the preferred medium, particularly when compared to isosensitest agar, which frequently produced falsely low mics for ip. etest ip plus ip-edta with mueller-hinton agar had a sensitivity of 94% (79 of 84) and specificity of 95% (124 of 130). the etest mbl  strip appears to be an acceptable diagnostic reagent to detect metallo-beta-lactamase phenotypes in the clinical microbiology laboratory.

AB  == between january 1986 and december 1999, 109 adult patients with culture-proven community-acquired bacterial meningitis were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital. to compare changes over time, the appearance of disease among  our patients was divided into two equal time periods: an earlier time period (1986-1992) and a later time period (1993-1999). in this study, there was a decreasing proportion of community-acquired bacterial meningitis compared with nosocomial bacterial meningitis in adult patients in recent years. its proportion declined dramatically from 81% in the earlier 7 years to 37% in the later 7 years. of the pathogens, klebsiella (k.) pneumoniae was the most frequently implicated pathogen, followed by viridans (v.) streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. other rare organisms including acinetobacter baumannii, salmonella group b and d, proteus mirabilis, group b, d, and non-a, non-b and non-d streptococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci emerged during the second period. there was a decrease in the mortality rate from 44% in the first to 34% in the second time period, but the overall mortality rate remained high. of the implicated pathogens, patients infected with v. streptococci had a consistently favorable prognosis, while a dramatic decrease in the mortality rate of those infected with k. pneumoniae was seen in recent years. in the multiple logistic regression analysis, only the presence of septic shock and seizures was independently associated with mortality. the timing of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, as defined by consciousness level, was a major determinant of survival and neurological outcomes for patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis, and the first dose of an appropriate antibiotic should be administrated before a patient's consciousness deteriorates  to a glasgow coma scale score lower than 10.

TI  == emerging fluoroquinolone-resistance for common clinically important gram-negative bacteria in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the three most commonly used fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) was measured for 2235 isolates of seven common pathogenic gram-negative bacteria. collected from a major teaching hospital in taiwan during the years 1985-86, 1989-90, and 1996-97, the samples were evaluated using the agar dilution method. the overall susceptibility to fluoroquinolones has decreased rapidly after the wide use of these antimicrobial agents. isolates of escherichia coli and morganella morganii  proved quite susceptible to the fluoroquinolones until 1996. by 1996-97, 20% of the bacteria had become resistant to the fluoroquinolones. activity against klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis remained excellent, however, with more than 90% of the isolates susceptible during the survey period. interestingly, some strains of serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa were demonstrating in vitro resistance even before the fluoroquinolones were launched in taiwan. this resistance increased rapidly, with around 20-30% of s. marcescens isolates fluoroquinolone-resistant by 1996-1997. after the introduction of the fluoroquinolones, resistance was demonstrated for about 15% of the p. aeruginosa isolates, and 20% of enterobacter cloacae isolates, with the susceptibility rate remaining steady state through the 1990s. different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns have been demonstrated for most fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates, suggesting that the increased resistance was  not due to the spread of a single clone. we conclude a trend of increasing fluoroquinolone resistance for many common gram-negative bacteria in taiwan, especially in recent years. appropriate use of the new fluoroquinolones should be encouraged in order to prevent the rapid emergence and increase of fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems.  thirty-two species 2,697 strains of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of  moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), escherichia coli (n = 250), citrobacter freundii (n = 153), citrobacter koseri (n = 97), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), serratia marcescens (n = 153), proteus mirabillis (n = 103), proteus vulgaris (n = 77), morganella morganii (n = 141), providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii; n = 154), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), pseudomonas putida (n = 49), burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), acinetobactor iwoffii (n = 30), bacteroides fragilis group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola; n = 124). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lowffii throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae  yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained  the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however,  the decrease in the antibacterial activity of czop against h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == detection of plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase genes in clinical isolates by using multiplex pcr.
AB  == therapeutic options for infections caused by gram-negative organisms expressing plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases are limited because these organisms are usually resistant to all the beta-lactam antibiotics, except for cefepime, cefpirome, and the carbapenems. these organisms are a major concern in nosocomial infections and should therefore be monitored in surveillance studies. six families of plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases have been identified, but no phenotypic test can differentiate among them, a fact which creates problems for surveillance and epidemiology studies. this report describes the development of a multiplex pcr for the purpose of identifying family-specific ampc beta-lactamase  genes within gram-negative pathogens. the pcr uses six sets of ampc-specific primers resulting in amplicons that range from 190 bp to 520 bp and that are easily distinguished by gel electrophoresis. ampc multiplex pcr differentiated the six plasmid-mediated ampc-specific families in organisms such as klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella enterica serovar  typhimurium. family-specific primers did not amplify genes from the other families of ampc genes. furthermore, this pcr-based assay differentiated multiple genes within one reaction. in addition, wave technology, a high-pressure liquid chromatography-based separation system, was used as a way of decreasing analysis  time and increasing the sensitivity of multiple-gene assays. in conclusion, a multiplex pcr technique was developed for identifying family-specific ampc genes  responsible for ampc beta-lactamase expression in organisms with or without a chromosomal ampc beta-lactamase gene.

TI  == ceftriaxone activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated in us clinical microbiology laboratories from 1996 to 2000: results from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa.
AB  == ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the usa in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily  treatment of patients with gram-positive or gram-negative infections. review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. we reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five gram-positive and 11 gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using  data from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa. all mic results were interpreted using nccls breakpoint criteria. ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than  in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. beta-lactam-resistant streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group b beta-haemolytic  streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. among methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. ceftriaxone resistance among escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%),  klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. resistance to ceftriaxone among enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. all haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. in summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered gram-positive and gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.

TI  == antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  == in this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (hsp) and fresh frozen plasma (ffp) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. due to the clinical use of hsp and ffp for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that hsp contains marked igg antibody reactivity against antigens of escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter sakazakii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, chlamydia pneumoniae, and candida albicans. although no igm antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in hsp, moderate iga reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. immunoblot analysis  demonstrated specific iga and igg responses against the endoproteinase glu-c and  the superantigens enterotoxin a and b of s. aureus, the iga-protease of neisseria gonorrhoeae, and shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic e. coli. by using 3 different hsp batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. this antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of ffp.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI  == the migration of proteus mirabilis and other urinary tract pathogens over foley catheters.
AB  == objective: to examine the ability of organisms that infect the catheterized urinary tract to migrate over the surfaces of foley catheters. materials and methods: in a simple laboratory model, organisms were challenged to migrate across sections of hydrogel-coated latex, hydrogel/silver-coated latex, silicone-coated latex and all-silicone catheters. the sections (1 cm long) were placed as bridges in channels between blocks of agar and the test organisms inoculated onto the agar adjacent to one side of each bridge. the plates were incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h and examined for growth of the test organisms  on the agar on the other side of the bridges. a collection of swarming, swimming  and nonmotile species were tested in the model. the relative mobilities of the test organisms were expressed as migration indices, calculated as the percentage  of tests in which bacterial migration was observed over each type of catheter bridge. results: the swarmer cells of proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris migrated  successfully (migration indices of 73-100) over all four types of catheter. the migration index of serratia marcescens swarmers was reduced to 33 over the silver-coated catheters, but these cells crossed over the other catheter surfaces with ease (indices of 100). pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most mobile of the swimming, non-swarming organisms with indices of 70-22, but this group was less capable of migration than the swarmers. indices were 0-33 for nonmotile organisms. the mean migration indices for the nine species for each type of catheter were 57 (hydrogel-coated latex), 49 (silver/hydrogel-coated latex), 41 (silicone-coated latex) and 35 (all-silicone). the swarmer cells of p. mirabilis  moved through populations of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis, and then migrated over sections  of hydrogel-coated latex catheters with little or no reduction in migration index. they were also capable of transporting the nonmotile cells of k. pneumoniae and s. aureus over the catheters. the migration index of p. mirabilis  swarmers was substantially reduced in the presence of ps. aeruginosa and s. marcescens. conclusions: hydrogel coatings facilitate the migration of urinary tract pathogens over catheter surfaces. with the exception of s. marcescens, the  incorporation of silver into the hydrogel did not inhibit migration. swarmer cells were particularly effective at moving over catheters and p. mirabilis swarmers were also capable of transporting other species. this suggests that inhibitors of swarming could be useful in controlling catheter-associated infection and the complications resulting from the spread of bacterial biofilm over catheters.

TI  == molecular characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases produced by nosocomial isolates of enterobacteriaceae from an italian nationwide survey.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) are widespread in hospital settings worldwide. the present investigation was undertaken to assess the distribution and prevalence of esbls belonging to the tem and shv families in 448 esbl-producing clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae collected from 10 different italian hospitals. the natures of tem and shv determinants were identified by direct sequencing of pcr-amplified genes. tem-52 and shv-12 were the most common variants, and they were found in most hospitals and in several different species. other less frequent variants included tem-5, tem-12, tem-15, tem-19, tem-20, tem-24, tem-26, tem-43, tem-60, tem-72, tem-87, shv-2a, shv-5, and shv-11. proteus mirabilis was the most common producer of tem-type esbls, while klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common producer of shv-type esbls. the distribution of tem- and shv-type esbl variants in enterobacteriaceae from italian hospitals exhibited notable differences from those from other geographical settings.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against local bacterial isolates.
AB  == introduction: the emergence of resistance to common antimicrobials in bacteria has been increasingly reported in various countries. empirical antimicrobial therapy of various infections would therefore need to be reviewed. the introduction of new fluoroquinolones has created an interest in the use of these  as possible agents in the empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections. materials and methods: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the new fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, against 400 clinical bacterial isolates was determined by the e-test method. results: all streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (penicillin sensitive or resistant) were susceptible to moxifloxacin. similarly,  both beta-lactamase and non beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin. as for enterobacteriaceae, 88.6% of the isolates tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin with mic < 8 mg/l, but resistance was noted for some of proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli. enterococci and acinetobacter baumannii were resistant to moxifloxacin, whilst the anaerobes tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin. conclusion: moxifloxacin has good in vitro activity against common  organisms associated with community and nosocomial infections, with the exception of enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria. there was good anti-anaerobic activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridum spp. results of this study are consistent with other similar published in vitro studies.

TI  == mystic program: summary of european data from 1997 to 2000.
AB  == the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) program  is a global study providing in-vitro surveillance data on microbial susceptibility in centers that prescribe meropenem. this paper summarizes data on the activity of meropenem and five comparator agents against 13,793 clinical isolates from 31 centers in 10 european countries, 1997-2000. meropenem and imipenem demonstrated broad-spectrum activity against the tested organisms, including beta-lactamase-producing strains that were co-resistant to quinolones and aminoglycosides. the carbapenems were active against the most frequently isolated pathogens including staphylococci (98-100% susceptible), pseudomonas aeruginosa (65-82% susceptible) and klebsiella pneumoniae (98-100% susceptible).  resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins was observed, particularly among enterobacter species in southern and eastern europe. eastern europe showed a high prevalence of ampc beta-lactamase and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing  strains in russia (2000); 47% and 28% of enterobacteriaceae isolates were ampc or esbl-producers, respectively. there was no significant decrease in susceptibility to the carbapenems throughout the four-year period. meropenem and imipenem appear to remain reliable options for the treatment of serious nosocomial infections.

TI  == occurrence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in members of the family enterobacteriaceae in italy: implications for resistance to beta-lactams and other antimicrobial drugs.
AB  == an italian nationwide survey was carried out to assess the prevalences and the antimicrobial susceptibilities of members of the family enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). over a 6-month period, 8,015 isolates were obtained from hospitalized patients and screened for resistance to  extended-spectrum cephalosporins and monobactams. on the basis of a synergistic effect between clavulanate and selected beta-lactams (ceftazidime, aztreonam, cefotaxime, cefepime, and ceftriaxone), 509 isolates were found to be esbl positive (6.3%). colony blot hybridization with bla(tem) and bla(shv) dna probes  allowed one to distinguish four different genotypes: tem-positive, shv-positive,  tem- and shv-positive, and non-tem, non-shv esbl types. mics for each isolate (e-test) were obtained for widely used beta-lactams, combinations of beta-lactams with beta-lactamase inhibitors, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. among esbl-positive strains, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and escherichia  coli accounted for 73.6% of isolates. overall, tem-type esbls were more prevalent than shv-type enzymes (234 versus 173), whereas the prevalence of strains producing both tem- and shv-type esbls was similar to that of isolates producing  non-tem, non-shv enzymes (55 and 38, respectively). in vitro, all but one of the  esbl-producing isolates remained susceptible to imipenem. susceptibility to other drugs varied: piperacillin-tazobactam, 91%; amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 85%; cefoxitin, 78%; amikacin, 76%; ampicillin-sulbactam, 61%; ciprofloxacin, 58%; and gentamicin, 56%. associated resistance to aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin was observed most frequently among tem-positive strains. since therapeutic options for multiresistant enterobacteriaceae are limited, combinations of beta-lactams and beta-lactamase inhibitors appear to represent an important alternative for treating infections caused by esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae:

TI  == urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of gemifloxacin and ofloxacin after a single oral dose in healthy volunteers.
AB  == in a randomized crossover study, 16 volunteers (8 men, 8 women) received single oral doses of 320 mg of gemifloxacin and 400 mg of ofloxacin on two separate occasions in the fasting state to assess the urinary excretion and urinary bactericidal titers (ubts) at intervals for up to 144 h. ofloxacin showed higher  concentrations in urine compared with those of gemifloxacin. the median (range) cumulative excretion of gemifloxacin was 29.7% (8.4 to 48.7%) of the parent drug  administered, and median (range) cumulative excretion of ofloxacin was 84.3% (46.5 to 95.2%) of the parent drug administered. the ubts, i.e., the highest twofold dilutions (with antibiotic-free urine as the diluent) of urine that were  still bactericidal, were determined for a reference strain and nine uropathogens  for which the mics of gemifloxacin and ofloxacin were as follows: escherichia coli atcc 25922, 0.016 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively; klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.03 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively; proteus mirabilis, 0.125 and 0.125 microg/ml, respectively; escherichia coli, 0.06 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively;  pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; staphylococcus aureus, 0.008 and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively; enterococcus faecalis, 0.06 and 2 microg/ml, respectively; staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; enterococcus faecalis, 0.5 and 32 microg/ml, respectively; and staphylococcus aureus, 2 and 32 microg/ml, respectively. generally, the ubts for  gram-positive uropathogens were higher for gemifloxacin than for ofloxacin and the ubts for gram-negative uropathogens were higher for ofloxacin than for gemifloxacin. according to the ubts, ofloxacin-resistant uropathogens (mics, >or=4 mg/liter) should also be considered gemifloxacin resistant. although clinical trials have shown that gemifloxacin is effective for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, whether an oral dosage of 320 mg of gemifloxacin once daily is also adequate for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections has yet to be confirmed.

TI  == prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among urinary tract pathogens isolated from female outpatients across the us in 1999.
AB  == in the united states, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (tmp-smx) is the recommended first-line treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (utis) in females, in regions with resistance rates of <10-20%. unfortunately, current data on regional resistance is often not readily available to physicians and regional  variability in resistance remains largely unknown. this report presents antimicrobial susceptibility data for tmp-smx and three other commonly tested antimicrobials organized by state and region to demonstrate current regional variability in resistance in the us. in the last quarter of 1999, 5739 fresh clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus saprophyticus were collected from 202 laboratories throughout  the us. susceptibility testing was performed against tmp-smx, cephalothin, nitrofurantoin and ciprofloxacin using broth microdilution. data were analyzed by patient age and specimen source, and by state and region. in the us as a whole, resistance to tmp-smx was 16.8% for e. coli, 7.8% for k. pneumoniae, 12.1% for p. mirabilis and 3.0% for s. saprophyticus, but these rates showed considerable regional variation. by state, e. coli resistance ranged from 7.4% in pennsylvania to 33.3% in iowa (among states with > or =50 isolates tested). regionally, resistance for all uropathogens taken together ranged from 8.5% in east south-central to 22.8% in west south-central. ciprofloxacin demonstrated the broadest activity of the antimicrobials tested and was more active than tmp-smx against all pathogens. resistance to tmp-smx among e. coli now approaches or exceeds 20% in some areas. as resistance among uropathogens reaches clinically significant levels in many areas, continued regional surveillance is essential to ensure the provision of effective empiric therapy for urinary tract infections.

TI  == dental unit waterlines: review and product evaluation.
AB  == dental practitioners must be knowledgeable regarding microbial contamination and  biofilm formation in dental unit waterlines. education should stress the need for improvement in the quality of water delivered to patients during treatment. manufacturers must also play an important role by providing training and education regarding the proper use and maintenance of their systems. dental facilities, both public and private, need reliable methods to prevent the development of biofilms within duws. these methods must be economical and require minimal effort to use on the part of the dental staff. in order for the system to work efficiently, the effluent water that is produced must be compatible with dental materials and be potentially free from toxic or carcinogenic materials. there are numerous models of water filtration units and chemical flushes available to the dental practitioner. however, the food and drug administration have not approved all products currently on the market. our evaluation of zerosil, a new waterline-cleaning product, indicates that it is very easy to use  and is extremely effective in killing the commonly found microorganisms in dental unit waterlines, as well as eliminating existing biofilms. it is also economical  and requires minimum staff time to keep the waterlines clean. following the initial treatments during week one, the water emanating from the duws was free from any viable microorganisms. this effect was present the entire three weeks in which the waterlines were treated. the elimination of viable microorganisms continued into a fourth study week, even though no further treatment of the duws  was performed. although the manufacturer recommends weekly treatment of duws following the initial treatment regimen, this result indicates that the product has a longer lasting effect than previously thought. finally, the product can be  delivered through any of the commercially available reservoir/bottle water delivery systems. from our study, zerosil appears to meet the demanding requirements of keeping dental unit waterlines clean. based on the research that  has been done thus far, no universal treatment protocol can be recommended. a combination of approaches may offer the best available assurance of high-quality  dental treatment water. independent water reservoir systems, when used with a periodic chemical treatment protocol, have demonstrated safety and efficacy. until we reach a point when a recommendation based on thorough evaluations can be made, dental offices should follow current ada, osap, and cdc guidelines: flush waterlines for two to three minutes at the beginning of each day and for 20 to 30 seconds between each patient, and anti-retraction valves should be installed to prevent oral fluids from being drawn into dental waterlines. it is expected that  in the near future, the dental practitioner will have a choice of proven systems  and products to deal with this issue. until that time, one should carefully evaluate any product or system being considered to prevent the formation of biofilms in duws.

TI  == urinary tract infections in general practice in a rural community in south trinidad.
AB  == objective: a prospective study was carried out at a general practice in south trinidad, to assess the sensitivity profiles of urinary isolates in this remote rural community. methods: quantitative bacteriologic cultures were performed according to standard procedures. identification of isolates was based on gram reaction, morphology and biochemical reactions. susceptibility testing was carried out using commonly prescribed antimicrobials for the treatment of urinary tract infections. results: from 779 urine specimens, 49% were culture positive for counts >105 organisms per ml. three hundred and eighteen were aged 21 years and above and 85.5% of these were females. the lowest incidence of urinary tract  infections, 8%, was seen among the 13-20 year old age group. most males above 50  years had indwelling urethral catheters due to prostatic disease. escherichia coli was the predominant isolate, 71%, followed by proteus mirabilis, 9%, and klebsiella pneumoniae, 7%. all urinary tract infections isolates were fully sensitive to ofloxacin and >96% (except for citrobacter species, 63%) were sensitive to cefuroxime. apart from enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus saprophyticus, the overall sensitivity to ampicillin by all isolates was <33%. the prevalence of multi-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa in community-acquired urinary tract infections is increasing. all pseudomonas aeruginosa were fully sensitive to gentamicin and ofloxacin. conclusion: the high frequency of single and multiple antibiotic resistances in this rural community should cause alarm. the ease of procuring antibiotics in these areas without a prescription can result in uncontrolled self-medication. also, the absence of antibiotic prescribing policies and inadequate information on patterns of bacterial resistance, may all contribute to the emergence of resistant strains.

AB  == this study compares the antibacterial activities of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against recently isolated urinary tract pathogens, by evaluating their mics and mbcs in accordance with nccls susceptibility tests, time-kill curves and interference with bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells. a total of 200 clinical isolates was tested, including the species escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. all e. coli isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin and only one was resistant to ciprofloxacin, and there were no differences between beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains. k. pneumoniae strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were also resistant to levofloxacin. methicillin-resistant s. aureus seemed to be less susceptible than methicillin-susceptible strains to these quinolones. s. epidermidis strains were  susceptible to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with the exception of two isolates. incubation of s. aureus and e. coli with subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations reduced their capacity to adhere to uroepithelial cells; this was  statistically significant at 0.25 x mic with respect to controls (p < 0.05). inhibition of adhesion ranged from 36 to 43% when bacteria were incubated in the  presence of 0.25 x mic of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and from 10 to 27% at 0.125 x mic. these findings suggest that levofloxacin is an effective alternative to ciprofloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract infections and that sub-inhibitory concentrations may contribute to efficacy.

TI  == bacterial flora of the conjunctiva and nasal cavity in normal and diseased captive bustards.
AB  == a survey was carried out to describe the normal aerobic bacterial flora of the conjunctiva and nasal cavity of captive houbara bustards (chlamydotis undulata),  kori bustards (ardeotis kori), and white-bellied bustards (eupodotis senegalensis) maintained at the national avian research center, abu dhabi, united arab emirates. a total of 58 samples were examined from the nasal cavity and 55 samples from the conjunctiva of healthy bustards. there was no bacterial growth in 45% of conjunctival samples. bacteria isolated from the conjunctiva of healthy birds included micrococcus spp., staphylococcus auricularis, staphylococcus xylosus, staphylococcus capitis, staphylococcus warneri, bacillus spp., and enterobacter amigenus. bacteria isolated from the nasal cavity of healthy birds included bacillus spp., micrococcus spp., s. auricularis, s. xylosus, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus saprophyticus, staphylococcus hyicus, staphylococcus cohnii, staphylococcus sciuri, aerococcus spp., and providencia rettgeri. these findings were compared with bacterial isolates from bustards with clinical signs of ocular or upper respiratory tract diseases. mycoplasma spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas stutzeri, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., aeromonas hydrophila, and staphylococcus aureus were the pathogenic bacteria isolated from the conjunctiva of 34.3% bustards with ocular discharges. mycoplasma spp., p. aeruginosa, pseudomonas spp., p. mirabilis, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and s. aureus were the pathogenic bacteria isolated  from the nasal cavity of 74% bustards with upper respiratory tract diseases.

TI  == [pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility in uropathogen isolates from children].
AB  == the bacteriological profile in children with culture-positive bacteriuria was analyzed during a 5-year period. escherichia coli was the most common cause of urinary tract infections (57%), followed by streptococcus faecalis (11%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), and proteus mirabilis (6%). results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated that cephalosporins (first, second and third generation) and nitrofurantoin are the best empirical oral treatment for urinary  infections in children. fosfomycin is a valid option in some cases. in hospitalized children treatment must be initiated with a third-generation cephalosporin, and gentamicin can be added in severely ill inpatients. these treatments can be modified when microbiological results become available.

TI  == genetic characterization of the klebsiella pneumoniae waa gene cluster, involved  in core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
AB  == a recombinant cosmid containing genes involved in klebsiella pneumoniae c3 core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis was identified by its ability to confer bacteriocin 28b resistance to escherichia coli k-12. the recombinant cosmid contains 12 genes, the whole waa gene cluster, flanked by kbl and coad genes, as  was found in e. coli k-12. pcr amplification analysis showed that this cluster is conserved in representative k. pneumoniae strains. partial nucleotide sequence determination showed that the same genes and gene order are found in k. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae, for which the core chemical structure is known. complementation analysis of known waa mutants from e. coli k-12 and/or salmonella enterica led to the identification of genes involved in biosynthesis of the inner core backbone that are shared by these three members of the enterobacteriaceae. k. pneumoniae orf10 mutants showed a two-log-fold reduction in a mice virulence assay and a strong decrease in capsule amount. analysis of a constructed k. pneumoniae waae deletion mutant suggests that the waae protein is involved in the transfer of the branch beta-d-glc to the o-4 position of l-glycero-d-manno-heptose i, a feature shared by k. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and yersinia enterocolitica.

TI  == variations in the prevalence of strains expressing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype and characterization of isolates from europe, the americas, and the western pacific region.
AB  == to evaluate the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains among species of enterobacteriaceae, a microdilution susceptibility test  was performed with strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella species that were isolated as part of the sentry project. the highest percentage of esbl phenotype (defined as a minimum inhibitory concentration [mic] > or =2 microg/ml for ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, or aztreonam) was detected among k. pneumoniae strains from latin america (45%), followed by those from the western pacific region (25%), europe (23%), the united states (8%), and canada (5%). p. mirabilis and e. coli strains for which mics of  extended-spectrum cephalosporins or monobactams were elevated also were more prominent in latin america. testing with ceftazidime revealed more isolates with  elevated mics than did testing with ceftriaxone or aztreonam. esbl strains showed high levels of co-resistance to aminoglycosides, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin. imipenem remains highly effective against esbl strains. organisms expressing an esbl are widely distributed worldwide, although prevalence rates are significantly higher in certain geographic regions.

TI  == a survey of gram-negative bacteria survival on hospital fabrics and plastics.
AB  == one critical factor for the transmission of microorganisms from person to person  or from the environment to a person (patient or health care worker) is the ability of the microbe to survive on an environmental surface. the purpose of this study was to determine the length of survival of various gram-negative bacteria on fabrics and plastics commonly used in hospitals. seven materials were tested: smooth cotton (clothing), cotton terry (towels), 60% cotton-40% polyester blend (scrub suits and lab coats), polyester (drapes), 75% nylon-25% spandex (pressure garments), polyvinyl (splash aprons), and polyurethane (keyboard covers). the following bacteria were tested: pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter species, and enterobacter species. swatches of the materials were inoculated with defined amounts of bacteria and assayed at regular intervals. survival was dependent on the bacterium, its inoculum size, and the material tested. at 102 microorganisms per swatch, bacteria survived from less than 1 hour to 8 days. at 10(4) to 10(5) bacteria per swatch, survival ranged from 2 hours to more than 60 days. these findings emphasize the need for careful disinfection and conscientious contact control procedures in areas that serve immunosuppressed individuals, such as patients with burn injuries.

TI  == resistance patterns among nosocomial pathogens: trends over the past few years.
AB  == multiple surveillance studies have demonstrated that resistance among prevalent pathogens is increasing at an alarming rate, leading to greater patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial infections. among gram-positive organisms, the most important resistant pathogens are methicillin- (oxacillin-)resistant staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactam-resistant and multidrug-resistant pneumococci, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. important causes of gram-negative resistance include extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis, high-level third-generation  cephalosporin (amp c) beta-lactamase resistance among enterobacter species and citrobacter freundii, and multidrug-resistance genes observed in pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. in selecting an empiric treatment for a nosocomial infection, one should consider the prevalent resistance patterns. antimicrobials used for the treatment of nosocomial infections should be effective against any likely resistant pathogens and should  not further promote the development of resistance. recent data suggest that because of esbls and high-level amp c beta-lactamase resistances, use of third-generation cephalosporins may be ineffective in many patients with nosocomial infections. in addition, use of these agents may allow overgrowth of inherently resistant enterococci. the role of fluoroquinolones in the empiric treatment of nosocomial infections is also being limited by new resistance patterns and increasing resistance levels. available antimicrobials with good activity against many resistant pathogens include the carbapenems, piperacillin/tazobactam, and cefepime. in addition, several new agents with good  activity against gram-positive organisms are in development or have been recently released. appropriate antimicrobial selection, surveillance systems, and effective infection-control procedures are key partners in limiting antimicrobial-resistant pathogen occurrence and spread.

TI  == acute mastoiditis--the antibiotic era: a multicenter study.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the clinical course and identify the causative organisms  of acute mastoiditis in a community where most of the patients who develop acute  otitis media are treated with antibiotics. methods: a multicenter retrospective review of a series of 223 consecutive cases of acute mastoiditis. setting: nine secondary or tertiary academic or non-academic referral centers. results: prior to the diagnosis of acute mastoiditis, 121 of the patients (54.3%) had been receiving oral antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media for periods ranging from 1 to 21 days (mean 5.3 days). samples for bacterial culture were obtained from 152 patients. cultures were negative in 60 patients. the organisms isolated  in the 92 positive cultures were: streptococcus pneumoniae (15 patients), streptococcus pyogenes (14 patients), staphylococcus aureus (13 patients), staphylococcus coagulase negative (three patients), pseudomonas aeruginosa (eight patients), haemophilus influenzae (four patients), proteus mirabilis (two patients), escherichia coli (two patients), klebsiella pneumoniae (one patient),  enterobacter (one patient), acinetobacter (one patient), anaerobic gram-negative  bacilli (one patient), and fungi (two patients). ten patients had mixed flora. sixteen patients presented with complications (cerebellar abscess, perisinus empyema, subdural abscess or empyema, extradural abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, lateral sinus thrombosis, bacterial meningitis, labyrinthitis, petrositis, or facial nerve palsy). conclusions: antibiotic treatment cannot be considered an absolute safeguard against the development of acute mastoiditis. early myringotomy for acute otitis media seems to decrease the incidence of complications. the distribution of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis differs from that in acute otitis media. intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis are not rare. because of the diversity of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis and the growing resistance of bacteria to the various antibiotics, all means to obtain a sample for culture prior to antibiotic treatment, including general anesthesia.

TI  == hla molecules, bacteria and autoimmunity.
AB  == it has been well established that many diseases are linked to hla antigens. two of the most interesting hla associations may provide some insight into the pathogenesis of rheumatic inflammatory conditions. in ankylosing spondylitis (as), 96% of patients possess hla-b27, whilst the frequency of this marker in the general population is c. 8%. in rheumatoid arthritis (ra), >90% of patients possess either hla-dr1 or some subtypes of hla-dr4, whilst the frequency of this  marker in the general population is c. 35%. the association between hla-b27 and reactive arthritis (rea) has also been well established. furthermore, it has been shown that rea is triggered by infection via the gastrointestinal tract due to yersinia, salmonella or campylobacter spp. and in the genitourinary tract due to  chlamydia. in a similar way, microbiological and immunological studies have revealed an association between klebsiella pneumoniae in as and proteus mirabilis in ra. this article reviews the possible pathological implications of the associations between hla-b27, k. pneumoniae and as, as well as hla-dr1/dr4, p. mirabilis and ra.

TI  == conserved regulatory elements of the promoter sequence of the gene rpoh of enteric bacteria.
AB  == the rpoh regulatory region of different members of the enteric bacteria family was sequenced or downloaded from genbank and compared. in addition, the transcriptional start sites of rpoh of yersinia frederiksenii and proteus mirabilis, two distant members of this family, were determined. sequences similar to the sigma(70) promoters p1, p4 and p5, to the sigma(e) promoter p3 and to boxes dnaa1, dnaa2, camp receptor protein (crp) boxes crp1, crp2 and box cytr present in escherichia coli k12, were identified in sequences of closely related  bacteria such as: e.coli, shigella flexneri, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae. in more distant bacteria, y.frederiksenii and p.mirabilis, the rpoh regulatory region has a distal p1-like sigma(70) promoter and two proximal promoters: a heat-induced sigma(e)-like promoter and a sigma(70) promoter. sequences similar to the regulatory boxes were not identified in these bacteria.  this study suggests that the general pattern of transcription of the rpoh gene in enteric bacteria includes a distal sigma(70) promoter, >200 nt upstream of the initiation codon, and two proximal promoters: a heat-induced sigma(e)-like promoter and a sigma(70) promoter. a second proximal sigma(70) promoter under catabolite-regulation is probably present only in bacteria closely related to e.coli.

TI  == assessment of the capacity of lactobacillus to inhibit the growth of uropathogens and block their adhesion to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  == to gain insight into the mechanisms by which lactobacillus blocks the adherence of uropathogens to vaginal epithelial cells and inhibits their growth, 15 lactobacillus strains and 22 uropathogens were studied. lactobacilli from hemagglutination group iii, identified as lactobacillus crispatus, showed greater capacity to block uropathogen adherence than those from hemagglutination groups ii and i (61.9%, 49.5%, and 52.6% of blockage, respectively). pseudomonas aeruginosa pa5 and klebsiella pneumoniae kp7 were the uropathogens most susceptible to blockage, and staphylococcus aureus sa11 and proteus mirabilis pm1 were the most resistant. lactobacillus inhibited uropathogen growth better in liquid assays; the 3 lactobacillus groups showed similar inhibitory power (72.3%, 71.9%, and 74.2% of light transmittance). p. aeruginosa pa5 was the most inhibited, and enterococcus species e15 was the least inhibited. there is considerable variation among lactobacillus strains regarding their adherence to uroepithelium, blockage of uropathogen attachment, and inhibition of uropathogen  growth. although these properties are independent, they may coincide and therefore allow for these strains to balance the vaginal ecosystem and to make them useful as probiotics.

AB  == during the period from 1984 to 1997, 85 bacterial meningitis neonates with positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures were treated. the ages of these patients ranged from 1 to 28 days. the male to female ratio was 1.7 to 1. the most common  causative agent was group b beta-hemolytic streptococci (gbs, 31.8%), followed by escherichia coli (20%), proteus mirabilis (7.1%), enterobacter cloacae (5.9%), other streptococci excluding streptococcus pneumoniae (5.9%), chryseobacterium meningosepticum (5.9%), enterococci (4.7%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (3.5%). among the 85 patients treated, 51 (60%) were younger than 7 days old. among them, dyspnea was the most common clinical manifestation. in contrast, fever and diarrhea were seen more frequently in neonates with late onset of disease (after  seven days of age). ampicillin and cefotaxime were the most commonly used antibiotics. the most frequently encountered complications were hydrocephalus and seizures. since 1991, gbs has overtaken e. coli as the leading cause of neonatal  bacterial meningitis. this was accompanied by a fall in the mortality rate, but a sustained high incidence of complications and sequelae. the results of this study highlight the importance of developing strategies to prevent group b streptococcal infection.

TI  == waste water bacterial isolates resistant to heavy metals and antibiotics.
AB  == sewage water of casablanca, an industrial city in morocco, was studied for microorganisms resistant to heavy metals. isolates were purified and collected on agar slants to be screened for resistance to heavy metals, including mercury in vitro. the strains that showed high resistance to heavy metals were also studied  for their resistance to antibiotics and aromatic hydrocarbons. results indicated  that the strains most resistant to all tested products belonged to ps. fluorescens, ps. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus sp. these strains exhibit high minimal inhibitory concentrations for heavy metals such as cadmium (2 mm) or mercury (1.2 mm). growth of ps. fluorescens and klebsiella pneumoniae in the presence of heavy metals was also determined, and the growth curves indicated that mercury, copper, and zinc present a slight inhibitory action, while cadmium and silver could have a potent  inhibitory action on growth compared with the controls. these studies also investigated growth in media containing aromatic compounds as the sole source of  carbon. the results demonstrate that these strains could be good candidates for remediation of some heavy metals and aromatic compounds in heavily polluted sites.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1998). i. susceptibility distribution].
AB  == the frequencies of bacterial isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 538 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 9 hospitals during the period of june 1998 to  may 1999. of the above bacterial isolates, gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.3% and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.7%. susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; against enterococcus faecalis isolated from patients with utis, vancomycin (vcm), ampicillin (abpc) and imipenem (ipm) had strong activities. among e. faecalis strains, those with low susceptibilities to all drugs have increased in 1998, compared with those in  1997. vcm showed the highest activity against mrsa isolated from patients with utis. the mics of vcm for all 34 strains were equal to or lower than 2 micrograms/ml. arbekacin (abk) was also active against mrsa with the mic90s of 2  micrograms/ml. against escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, all drugs except penicillins were active. particularly, meropenem (mepm) showed the highest activity with the mics of 0.125 micrograms/ml or below. almost all the drugs except minocycline (mino) showed high activities against proteus mirabilis. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, all drugs were not so active, with the mic90s of  16 micrograms/ml or above. mepm, ipm and gentamicin (gm) showed high activities against serratia marcescens. generally, it seemed that resistant strains of s. marcescens had decreased since 1996.

TI  == respiratory pathogen colonization of the dental plaque of institutionalized elders.
AB  == although it has been established that aspiration of pharyngeal bacteria is the major route of infection in the development of nosocomial pneumonia, colonization of the pharyngeal mucosa by respiratory pathogens has been shown to be a transient phenomenon. it has been suggested that the dental plaque may constitute an additional, possibly more stable, reservoir of respiratory pathogens. the purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of oral colonization by potential respiratory pathogens in a group of elderly (mean age = 75.9 yrs) chronic-care-facility residents (n = 28) and a group of age-, gender-, and race-matched outpatient control subjects (n = 30), with specific attention to plaque present on tooth, denture, and oral mucosal surfaces. plaque scores on teeth and dentures were significantly higher in the chronic-care-facility (ccf) subjects than in the dental outpatient control (doc) subjects (pii 2.3 vs. 1.2 and denture plaque 1.4 vs. 0.3). while no subjects in the doc group were found to be colonized with respiratory pathogens (> 1.0% of the cultivable aerobic flora), 14.3% (4/28) of the ccf subjects were found to be colonized. oral colonization with respiratory pathogens in ccf subjects was associated with the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) and higher plaque scores. these results suggest that deficient dental plaque control and the presence of copd may be related to respiratory pathogen colonization of dental plaque in chronic-care-facility residents.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in enterobacteriaceae in brooklyn, ny: epidemiology and  relation to antibiotic usage patterns.
AB  == in november 1997, all enterobacteriaceae isolated at 15 hospitals in brooklyn were collected. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) were present in 44% of  409 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. six isolates had reduced susceptibility to carbapenems, including two that were not susceptible to any of the antibiotics tested. pulsed field gel electrophoresis revealed a commonality of resistant isolates within and between hospitals. the occurrence of esblcontaining isolates  was associated with cephalosporin usage (p = 0.055). esbls were present in 4.7% of escherichia coli and 9.5% of proteus mirabilis isolates. it is concluded that  esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae are endemic in brooklyn, are spread between hospitals, and may be associated with cephalosporin usage.

TI  == use of pcr with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

TI  == in vitro activity of difloxacin against canine bacterial isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of difloxacin against canine bacterial isolates from clinical cases was studied in the united states and the netherlands. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic), the postantibiotic effect, the effect of ph on antimicrobial activity, and the bacterial killing rate tests were determined according to standard techniques. the mics of american and dutch isolates agreed  in general. the mics of the american gram-negative isolates ranged from 0.06 to 2.0 microg/ml, and the mics of the dutch gram-negative isolates ranged from 0.016 to 8.0 microg/ml. a few european strains of proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae had relatively high mics. bordetella bronchiseptica also was less susceptible to difloxacin. the mics of the american gram-positive cocci ranged from 0.125 to 4.0 microg/ml, and the mics of dutch isolates ranged from 0.125 to  2.0 microg/ ml. difloxacin induced a concentration-dependent postantibiotic effect that lasted 0.2-3 hours in cultures with escherichia coli, staphylococcus  intermedius, streptococcus canis, proteus spp., and klebsiella pneumoniae. there  was no postantibiotic effect observed against canine pseudomonas aeruginosa. decreasing the ph of the medium increased the mic of proteus mirabilis for difloxacin. the mics of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were lowest at neutral ph and were slightly increased in acid or alkaline media. at a neutral ph, most tested bacterial species were killed at a difloxacin concentration of 4  times the mic. similar results were obtained when these same bacteria were tested against enrofloxacin. a klebsiella pneumoniae strain in an acidic environment was readily killed at difloxacin or enrofloxacin mic, but at neutral ph the drug concentration had to be raised to 4 times the mic for a bactericidal effect. after 24 hours of incubation at ph 7.1, difloxacin and enrofloxacin had similar bactericidal activity for all bacteria tested except staphylococcus intermedius.  against s. intermedius, difloxacin was more bactericidal than enrofloxacin.

TI  == [frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of urinary pathogens isolated in the microbiology and virology laboratory of the careggi general hospital in the period july-december 1996].
AB  == background: the aim of the study was to evaluate the isolation frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of pathogens isolated form urinocoltures. methods: 2192 bacterial strains obtained from urine cultures with bacterial count > 100,000 ufc/ml were examined in our laboratory from july through december 1996. inpatients as well as outpatients were considered. five different ward typologies were taken into account (surgery, medicine, obstetrics, spinal unit and high risk wards). isolation frequencies were evaluated for each ward, but in order to get an adequate statistical sample they were divided into in two categories, e.g. strains isolated from inpatients and from outpatients. antibiotic susceptibility  was also evaluated dividing the data into the same two categories. for strains isolated with lower frequencies that was not possible, and data from inpatients were grouped with data from outpatients. results: the results obtained show that  bacterial species most frequently isolated among inpatients are escherichia coli  (45.7%), enterococcus faecalis (16.8%), proteus mirabilis (9.1%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.9%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (6.4%). those most frequently isolated among outpatients are escherichia coli (58.1%), enterococcus faecalis (12.3%), proteus mirabilis (9.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (4.4%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (4.0%). as far as antibiotic susceptibility is concerned,  whenever a statistically significant difference in sensitivity could be observed  between strains isolated from inpatients and strains isolated from outpatients, sensitivity was always higher for outpatients strains. conclusions: isolation frequency and antibiotic susceptibility are different depending on the place of origin of the patients (inpatients/outpatients). this implies a different approach to the empiric therapy in urinary tract infections.

TI  == occurrence and detection of ampc beta-lactamases among escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis isolates at a veterans medical center.
AB  == ampc beta-lactamases are cephalosporinases that confer resistance to a wide variety of beta-lactam drugs and that may thereby create serious therapeutic problems. although reported with increasing frequency, the true rate of occurrence of ampc beta-lactamases in escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis remains unknown. we tested a total of 1,286 consecutive, nonrepeat isolates of these three species and found that, overall, 45 (3.5%) yielded a cefoxitin zone diameter less than 18 mm (screen positive) and that 16 (1.2%) demonstrated ampc bands by isoelectric focusing. based on the species, of  683 e. coli, 371 k. pneumoniae, and 232 p. mirabilis isolates tested, 13 (1.9%),  28 (7.6%), and 4 (1.7%), respectively, demonstrated decreased zone diameters and  11 (1.6%), 4 (1.1%), and 1 (0.4%), respectively, demonstrated ampc bands. cefoxitin resistance was transferred for all but 8 (e. coli) of the 16 ampc producers. we also describe a three-dimensional extract test, which was used to detect phenotypically isolates that harbor ampc beta-lactamase. of the 45 cefoxitin-resistant isolates, the three-dimensional extract test accurately identified all 16 ampc producers and 28 of 29 (97%) isolates as non-ampc producers. interestingly, most (86%) isolates in the latter group were k. pneumoniae isolates. these data confirm that, at our institution, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis harbor plasmid-mediated ampc enzymes.

TI  == three-year surveillance study of nosocomial bacterial resistance in argentina. the antimicrobial committee; and the national surveillance program (sir) participants group.
AB  == introduction: a national surveillance program (sir) was introduced in 1996 in argentina by the antimicrobial committee of the argentinean society for microbiology to assess bacterial resistance. the present study reports the rates  of nosocomial bacterial resistance found by this program. methods: a 2-month point-prevalence study was conducted twice yearly (i.e., april-may and october-november) from 1996 to 1998, by 27 argentinean centers. susceptibility testing was carried out by the disk diffusion method following the national committee for clinical laboratory standards guidelines. results: in all, 6343 isolates recovered from 5603 inpatients (> or =48-hr hospitalization) were included. methicillin resistance was 58% and 56% in staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), respectively. although no vancomycin resistance was found in staphylococci, 2% and 8% of the s. aureus and cns strains, respectively, proved resistant to teicoplanin. no ampicillin resistance  was displayed by enterococcus faecalis. high-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance in enterococci were 33% and 37%, respectively. acquired glycopeptide resistance in enterococci emerged in 1997 (2%). imipenem resistance in acinetobacter spp and pseudomonas aeruginosa was 9% and 21%, respectively. among  enterobacteriaceae, 1% and 5% of the klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae isolates, respectively, proved resistant to imipenem. ceftazidime and cefepime resistance was found in 63% and 33% of the e. cloacae strains. resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins was shown by 48%, 26%, and 8% of the k. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and escherichia coli isolates, respectively. conclusions: the alarming rates of resistance found in this study provide compelling evidence of the need for more rational use of antimicrobial agents in argentina.

(p. mirabilis 25 strains and p. vulgaris 25 strains) to the aminoglycosides isepamicin (isp), amikacin (amk), gentamicin, tobramycin and dibekacin, and to the beta-lactams imipenem, ceftazidime and piperacillin (all three known to be effective against p. aeruginosa) were investigated using a micro liquid dilution method with the following results: 1. isp was effective against all strains except for 14% of mrsa, 2% of proteus sp., and 4% of p. aeruginosa. 2. six strains of mrsa were resistant to all eight drugs; however, in these cases isp exhibited a relatively  low minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) compared to the other compounds. 3. four strains of mrsa were resistant to all drugs except isp. mrsa was the only isolate to demonstrate a resistance to seven or more drugs. 4. twenty-one strains of mrsa and 1 strain of p. aeruginosa were resistant to six drugs; however, all of these were susceptible to both isp and amk. 5. against all strains tested, isp generally exhibited a lower mic compared to amk. these results suggest that, even ten years after its entering the market, isp is still an aminoglycoside having a  high anti-bacterial activity against a wide range of clinical isolates.

TI  == biochemical sequence analyses of ges-1, a novel class a extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, and the class 1 integron in52 from klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == klebsiella pneumoniae ori-1 was isolated in 1998 in france from a rectal swab of  a 1-month-old girl who was previously hospitalized in cayenne hospital, cayenne,  french guiana. this strain harbored a ca. 140-kb nontransferable plasmid, ptk1, that conferred an extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance profile antagonized  by the addition of clavulanic acid, tazobactam, or imipenem. the gene for ges-1 (guiana extended-spectrum beta-lactamase) was cloned, and its protein was expressed in escherichia coli dh10b, where this pi-5. 8 beta-lactamase of a ca. 31-kda molecular mass conferred resistance to oxyimino cephalosporins (mostly to  ceftazidime). ges-1 is weakly related to the other plasmid-located ambler class a extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). the highest percentage of amino acid identity was obtained with the carbenicillinase gn79 from proteus mirabilis; with yent, a chromosome-borne penicillinase from yersinia enterocolitica; and with l-2, a chromosome-borne class a cephalosporinase from stenotrophomonas maltophilia (36% amino acid identity each). however, a dendrogram analysis showed that ges-1 clustered within a class a esbl subgroup together with esbls veb-1 and per-1. sequencing of a 7,098-bp dna fragment from plasmid ptk1 revealed that the  ges-1 gene was located on a novel class 1 integron named in52 that was characterized by (i) a 5' conserved segment containing an inti1 gene possessing two putative promoters, p(1) and p(2), for coordinated expression of the downstream antibiotic resistance genes and an atti1 recombination site; (ii) five antibiotic gene cassettes, bla(ges-1), aac(6')ib' (gentamicin resistance and amikacin susceptibility), dfrxvb (trimethoprim resistance), a novel chloramphenicol resistance gene (cmla4), and aada2 (streptomycin-spectinomycin resistance); and (iii) a 3' conserved segment consisting of qacedelta1 and suli.  the bla(ges-1) and aada2 gene cassettes were peculiar, since they lacked a typical 59-base element. this work identified the second class a esbl gene of a non-tem, non-shv series which was located in the plasmid and integron, thus providing it additional means for its spread and its expression.

TI  == characteristics of pathogens causing urinary tract infections in hospitals in north america: results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, 1997.
AB  == urinary tract infection (uti) is common and involves pathogens with changing susceptibility patterns. the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program evaluates  international pathogen incidence patterns to detect and manage the emergence of resistant strains. we describe the antimicrobial resistance patterns among 1617 pathogens recovered from utis during the third-quarter of 1997 in north america (united states and canada), as part of this worldwide program. the isolates were  tested against more than 50 antimicrobial agents (20 reported) by reference broth microdilution methods, and selected isolates were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and automated ribotyping. the five most frequently isolated species were escherichia coli (48.6%), enterococcus spp. (13.7%), klebsiella spp. (12.0%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.2%), and enterobacter spp. or  proteus mirabilis (3.8% each). for each nation, imipenem and cefepime produced the widest spectrum of coverage among the beta-lactams and amikacin was best among the aminoglycosides. for gram-negative species, high resistance among beta-lactam antimicrobial agents was noted especially for various penicillins against e. coli (37.9% to 42.8%) and for the cephalosporins tested against enterococci (99.4% and 100%). approximately 7.0% of enterococci in the usa were vancomycin-resistant (88% with van a). p. aeruginosa provided the most consistent levels of resistance, but the following agents were most active against these organisms: amikacin (96.6 to 97.4% susceptible), tobramycin (89.5 to 100.0%), piperacillin/tazobactam (89.5 to 100.0%), piperacillin (89.5 to 96.6%), imipenem  (89.7 to 92.1%), cefepime (77.6 to 89.7%), and ceftazidime (82.9 to 86.2%). e. coli (2.2 to 2.7%), k. pneumoniae (6.2 to 6.4%), and a single enterobacter cloacae strain produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases; and five other enterobacter spp. were likely to have expressed chromosomally mediated (amp c) stably derepressed cephalosporinases with associated resistance to ceftazidime (16.7 to 21.2% resistance). these data demonstrated that several uti isolates in  sentry hospitals have high levels of resistance to various classes of antimicrobial agents with little evidence of clonal dissemination.

TI  == impact of use of multiple antimicrobials on changes in susceptibility of gram-negative aerobes.
AB  == evaluation of antimicrobial usage vs. susceptibility relationships typically involves single agents. however, susceptibility profiles may be affected by multiple drugs. from 1992 through 1996, we studied relationships between drug usage and the susceptibility (only susceptibility rates of > or = 70%) of acinetobacter anitratus (baumannii), enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens to 22 agents. linear regression was used to assess usage of each agent vs. susceptibility to it and to all agents. only relationships with a coefficient of determination of > or = 0.5 and a negative slope were evaluated and classified as increasing drug use and decreasing susceptibility (increasing d, decreasing %s) or decreasing drug use and increasing susceptibility (decreasing d, increasing %s). the mean numbers (range) of drugs associated with a change in susceptibility were 1.7 (0-14) and 0.6 (0-7), respectively, for increasing d, decreasing %s and decreasing d, increasing %s relationships. multiple antimicrobials are associated with susceptibility to other drugs; thus, surveillance of these relationships should not be limited to single drugs.

TI  == demographic, clinical, and treatment parameters influencing the outcome of acute  cystitis.
AB  == a meta-analysis of six double-blinded clinical trials was undertaken to identify  risk factors associated with bacteriologic outcome in 3,108 women with acute cystitis. eleven antibiotic regimens were used, including ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and nitrofurantoin. entry  criteria for all studies were identical. among 2,409 patients who were defined to be valid for efficacy analysis, pathogens included escherichia coli (78.6%), staphylococcus saprophyticus (4.4%), klebsiella pneumoniae (4.3%), proteus mirabilis (3.7%), and "other" (9%). causative bacteria were eradicated at the end of treatment in 93% of patients. the following parameters were associated with successful bacteriologic outcome: not using a diaphragm (p = .0041), treatment for > or = 3 days (p = .0043), pathogen not "other" (p = .0043), symptom duration of < 2 days (p = .0096), and african american race (p = .0147). k. pneumoniae (p  = .0496) and "other" pathogens (p = .0018) were associated with increased probability of bacteriologic treatment failure. the presence of pyuria (> or = 10 wbcs per high-power field) did not correlate with outcome and was inversely correlated with the finding of > or = 10(5) bacterial colony-forming units per ml of urine (p < .001). this large database identifies new parameters associated with treatment outcomes of acute cystitis and calls into question current clinical trial guidelines.

TI  == susceptibility to levofloxacin of clinical isolates of bacteria from intensive care and haematology/oncology patients in switzerland: a multicentre study.
AB  == the objective of this study was to examine the susceptibility of clinical isolates to levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone with extended activity against gram-positive bacteria, and other antibiotics in 12 swiss clinical microbiology laboratories using the nccls disc diffusion technique. isolates were prospectively collected from intensive care units (icus (59%), oncology wards (7%) and other units with haematology/oncology patients (34%) from june 1995 to march 1996. the levofloxacin breakpoints used were as recommended by the manufacturer. a total of 310 gram-positive and 580 gram-negative isolates from the respiratory tract (36%), skin/wounds (12%), blood (16%), urine (17%) and other sources (19%) were tested. the percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin was 100% for enterococcus spp. (38 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (13), streptococcus pneumoniae (65), acinetobacter spp. (11), citrobacter diversus (6), citrobacter freundii (17), klebsiella oxytoca (39), morganella morganii (16), proteus mirabilis (20), proteus vulgaris (23), serratia spp. (19), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (10) and haemophilus influenzae (41). the percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin for staphylococcus aureus (95  strains, including 2% mrsa) was 94%, coagulase-negative staphylococci (85) 65%, enterobacter spp. (75) 99%, escherichia coli (111) 97%, klebsiella pneumoniae (45) 98% and pseudomonas aeruginosa (124) 87%. in conclusion, levofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone to which the most common clinical isolates in switzerland are susceptible. the susceptibility of enterococcus spp. and s. pneumoniae to levofloxacin was particularly remarkable. this compound appears to be a promising therapeutic alternative for the treatment of gram-positive infections.

TI  == [a consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-negative bacilli].
AB  == the results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the japanese ministry of health and welfare during the period of january 1993 to july 1995, were analyzed for typical gram-negative  bacilli in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. during these 3 years, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes and proteus mirabilis showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to fosfomycin (fom) and citrobacter freundii. klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes showed slightly increasing tendency to minocycline (mino). while haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefmetazole (cmz). however, these annual changes were almost negligible. generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against gram-negative bacilli. however, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. on the other hand, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st), cmz, latamoxef (lmox), gentamicin (gm) and amikacin (amk) showed good activities against some of the gram-negative bacilli to which no indications are approved. in conclusion, bedside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of antimicrobial agents is necessary.

TI  == ankylosing spondylitis in monozygotic twins: studies on immunological parameters.
AB  == objective: to examine immunological parameters that might explain disease discordance in monozygotic twin pairs with ankylosing spondylitis (as). methods:  11 monozygotic twin pairs (nine with as, two with undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy) were investigated. the peripheral t cell receptor vbeta repertoire was investigated using facs analysis and 14 different vbeta antibodies. in addition serum samples were tested for antibodies to klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, candida albicans, proteus mirabilis, and escherichia coli. peripheral blood lymphocyte reactivity against a number of bacteria was investigated by interferon gamma elispot assays. results: twins suffering from as showed cellular hyporeactivity against k pneumoniae, s pyogenes, c albicans in the elispot assays compared with healthy twins. in contrast with the antibody data, where no significant differences were observed between the two groups, as concordant twins showed the most pronounced differences in their vbeta repertoire on cd4+ and cd8+ lymphocytes. conclusions:  cellular hyporeactivity of peripheral blood cells to bacterial antigens might reflect defective t cell responses allowing bacterial antigens to persist in diseased patients. there are probably other environmental factors that influence  disease concordance.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of a series of simple coumarins was evaluated against  8 microorganisms, including three gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococcus and streptococcus pneumoniae) and five gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and haemophilus influenzae), using the microdilution broth method. the coumarins tested showed broad diversity regarding growth inhibitory activity with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.9 to > 12.4 microm. this study, presenting the first systematic analysis of structure-activity relationships among this group of coumarins, revealed some interesting structural requirements. while coumarins with a methoxy function at c-7 and, if present, an oh group at either the c-6 or c-8 position are invariably effective against the spectrum of tested standard bacteria (gram-negative microorganisms including the gram-positive bacterium staphylococcus aureus), the  presence of an aromatic dimethoxy arrangement is apparently favourable against those microorganisms which require special growth factors (beta-hemolytic streptococcus, streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae). a combination of these structural features, two methoxy functions and at least one  additional phenolic group as reflected by the highly oxygenated coumarins, identify promising candidates with antibacterial broad-spectrum activity.

AB  == background: escherichia coli, listeria, and streptococcal antigens have been found in crohn's disease tissues. antibodies to klebsiella pneumoniae have been found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and ankylosing spondylitis. the presence of these bacterial antigens in crohn's granulomas would be of aetiological interest, while their presence in ulcers alone would be more likely  to indicate secondary infection. aim: to investigate inflammatory bowel disease tissues for the presence of these bacteria. methods: formalin fixed, paraffin processed sections from 53 patients (19 ulcerative colitis, 23 crohn's disease; 11 normal tissues from cancer resections) were studied by immunohistochemistry. control tissue consisted of normal human small bowel injected submucosally with either e coli, listeria monocytogenes, proteus mirabilis, or klebsiella pneumoniae serotypes k2, 3, 17, 21, 26, 36, and 50, and colonic biopsies from a child with e coli 0114 infection. tissues were stained by gram-twort, and with specific antibodies for e coli (dako b357), l monocytogenes (difco 2302-50), and  k pneumoniae (biogenesis 5580-5208) using an immunoperoxidase technique. results: positive staining for e coli was observed on the luminal surface epithelium and in ulcers in 35% of crohn's disease patients, 26% of ulcerative colitis patients, and no normal controls. superficial staining for l monocytogenes was observed in  one case of ulcerative colitis only. staining for k pneumoniae was observed in one case of ulcerative colitis and one of crohn's disease. no granulomas, giant cells, or germinal centres stained positively for any of the three bacterial antigens. conclusions: these data do not support a primary role for e coli, l monocytogenes, and k pneumoniae in inflammatory bowel disease. the presence of e  coli antigens in ulcers suggests secondary infection in these lesions.

TI  == febrile morbidity in severe and critical ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome: a multicentre study.
AB  == the objective of this study was to define the incidence of febrile morbidity and  its causes in severe and critical ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (ohss). for this purpose, we reviewed the medical records of all ohss patients hospitalized in 16 out of 19 tertiary medical centres in israel between january 1987 and december 1996. febrile morbidity was defined as at least one episode of temperature rise above 38 degrees c lasting > or =24 h. a total of 2902 patients  (3305 hospitalizations) with ohss was identified, of whom 196 had severe, and 13  critical, ohss. among the 209 patients investigated the incidence of febrile morbidity was 82.3%, of which 20.5% was attributed to urinary tract infection, 3.8% to pneumonia, 3.3% to upper respiratory tract infection, 2.0% to intravenous line phlebitis, 1.0% to cellulitis at an abdominal puncture site, 1.0% to postoperative wound infections and 0.5 % to gluteal abscess at the site of progesterone injection. non-typical organisms were frequently isolated, such as pseudomonas, proteus, klebsiella and enterobacter species. no infectious aetiology was found in 105 patients (50.2%). hypoglobulinaemia was recorded in most patients, while ascitic and pleural fluids aspirated from these patients contained high globulin concentrations. we conclude that infection-related febrile morbidity in severe and critical ohss is high, and may be attributed to some degree of immunodeficiency associated with loss of plasma globulins to the third space. however, non-infection-related febrile morbidity is even higher and  may be attributed to endogenous pyrogenic mechanisms.

TI  == comparison of five days versus seven days of incubation for detection of positive blood cultures by the bactec 9240 system.
AB  == the specimen capacity of blood culture systems is determined by the length of time that blood cultures are incubated. since the patient populations served by hospitals vary, individual laboratories should evaluate the relative cost and benefits of different testing regimens for their particular setting. to be cost-effective, the use of a 5-day rather than a 7-day protocol for the bactec 9240 system (becton dickinson diagnostic instrument systems, usa) has been recommended. to evaluate whether the shorter schedule would be appropriate at the microbiology laboratory at the national cheng kung university medical center in tainan, taiwan, the yield from 5 days versus 7 days of incubation was compared using a total of 9653 blood specimens collected from 1 april to 30 september 1997. of the 1848 positive vials, 1822 (98.6%) were positive in the first 5 testing days; only 26 (1.4%) were positive on day 6 or 7. only five of the latter vials were judged to contain clinically significant organisms: one cryptococcus neoformans, one candida albicans, one enterobacter cloacae, one klebsiella pneumoniae, and one proteus mirabilis. two vials contained organisms whose clinical significance was categorized as unknown, while 19 contained organisms that were considered contaminants. these data suggest that, for the laboratory studied, the 5-day protocol for the bactec 9240 system is more cost-effective than the 7-day protocol and is adequate for detection of positive blood cultures.

AB  == this study was performed to define the relation between colonization of genital skin flora and bacteriuria in spinal cord injured patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction. twenty-seven female and 23 male spinal cord injured patients were included in the study. patients were evaluated regarding their type of bladder management, educational status, level and degree of the spinal cord lesion. quantitative cultures were obtained from the perineum labium/dorsum of penis, external meatus of urethra, and urine. we investigated whether the organisms isolated from urine were also present in one or more skin sites in every patient. in total 54 identical bacterial isolates were observed both from urine and one or more skin sites in 43 of the patients. escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus stuartii were the most common bacterial isolates. the distribution of identical colonization of genital skin flora with urine were as follows: 30 in urethra, one in perineum, four in urethra and perineum, nine in urethra and labium/dorsum of penis, and 10 in both three skin sites. identical colonization of both perineum and labium/dorsum of penis with urine were significantly higher in female patients than those of males (p =  0.037, p = 0.003, respectively). no significant difference was found in the presence/distribution of colonization with respect to type of bladder management, educational status, and neurologic status. these results demonstrate the importance of the urethra, perineum, and labium/dorsum of penis as a source of bacteria causing urinary infection in spinal cord injured patients.

TI  == comparative activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against clinical isolates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == beta-lactam resistance on the part of the enterobacteriaceae causes serious therapeutic problems in our institutions due to their production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbetals). we studied the in vitro activity of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations and third-generation cephalosporins and monobactams against 71 clinically relevant enterobacteriaceae  which produced tem- and shv-derivative esbetals. of the single drugs and combinations tested, piperacillin/tazobactam proved to be the most effective. piperacillin/tazobactam was highly active against proteus mirabilis, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) ranging from 0.125 to 16 microg/ml; escherichia  coli (mics from 2 to 16 microg/ml) and serratia marcescens (mics from 4 to 8 microg/ml), while its activity against klebsiella pneumoniae esbetal producers turned out to be closely related to the type and the amount of enzyme produced, the mic ranging from 1 to 128 microg/ml. the antibacterial activity of piperacillin/tazobactam was stronger than that of ticarcillin/clavulanate, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam, and the combination shared favorable in vitro activity properties against the esbetal producers with imipenem which, however, should be kept as reserve product.

TI  == carbapenem-induced endotoxin release in gram-negative bacterial sepsis rat models.
AB  == the carbapenem-induced endotoxin release was evaluated using experimental models  of gram-negative bacterial sepsis in wistar rats. infections with escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris and proteus mirabilis resulted in an increase of the plasma endotoxin concentration after treatment with ceftazidime and carbapenems including imipenem, panipenem, meropenem and biapenem. except for p. aeruginosa, the plasma endotoxin concentrations after carbapenem treatment were significantly lower than those after ceftazidime treatment. it is noteworthy that treatment of p. aeruginosa sepsis with meropenem or biapenem induced significantly more endotoxin release than other carbapenems and the endotoxin concentrations induced by these  carbapenems reached those of ceftazidime treatment. the plasma endotoxin concentrations appeared to correlate with the reduction of platelet counts and the elevation of both glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and glutamic pyruvic transaminase values.

TI  == transfer of resistance to oxy-imino-cephalosporins and of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase productions in klebsiella pneumoniae strains from infected neonates.
AB  == in this communication, we describe the occurrence of strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to cephalosporins of all generations and to aztreonam due to their production of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), in two hospitals in slovakia. they were found to transfer the genetic determinants of resistance of cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam and of esbl production to suitable recipient strains of escherichia coli k-12 no. 3110 and proteus mirabilis p-38. six donor k. pneumoniae strains were collected from six prematurely born babies gradually infected with strains of k. pneumoniae resistant to cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam. all six strains of k. pneumoniae gave an identical pattern in esbl testing (double-disk diffusion test). the second cycle of transfers to nalidixin-resistant e. coli k-12 no. 185 nal+ also confirmed that all transconjugants were resistant to all beta-lactams tested. we conclude that a single gene was transferred from donor strains which confers 'en bloc' the resistance to the beta-lactams tested. four strains of k. pneumoniae produced a uniform type of esbi. although with different quantitative expression. all transconjugants tested produced identical types of esbl as did the donor strains  of k. pneumoniae. this transfer of an identical pattern of esbl production was confirmed also in the second cycle of transfers. cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam were actively hydrolysed (as shown by the relative rate of hydrolysis [vmax]) by strains of k. pneumoniae as well as by transconjugant colonies and clavulanate inhibited the hydrolysis of these beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of a single oral dose of 400 milligrams of fleroxacin versus a single oral dose of 800 milligrams of pefloxacin in healthy volunteers.
AB  == twelve healthy volunteers participated in this randomized crossover study to compare the concentrations and recovery levels of fleroxacin and pefloxacin in urine and to assess their bactericidal activities against 12 strains of urinary pathogens with different susceptibilities over a wide range of mics. the volunteers received a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin or 800 mg of pefloxacin. the mean cumulative renal excretion of unchanged fleroxacin, n-demethyl-fleroxacin, and n-oxide-fleroxacin accounted for 67, 7, and 6% of the  total dose, respectively. the total urinary recovery of pefloxacin and the active metabolite norfloxacin was 34%. in the time-kill and the urinary bactericidal titer (ubt) studies, only the subjects' urine not supplemented with broth was used. with most tested organisms and both quinolones it took more than 8 h to achieve a reduction in cfu of 99.9% (3 log units). overall, there was a good correlation between ubts and mics for the strains. against escherichia coli atcc  25922 the median ubts were similar for both antibiotics and at least 1:8 for 96 h; against the e. coli strain for which the mic was 0.5 microgram/ml the ubt was  at least 1:4 for 48 h. the ubts of both drugs against klebsiella pneumoniae were  at least 1:16 for 72 h. the ubts for staphylococcus aureus (the mic for which was 16 micrograms/ml) of both antibiotics were low, and in some of the samples, no bactericidal titers were observed. ubts for proteus mirabilis of pefloxacin are significantly higher than those of fleroxacin. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the median ubts were present for the 24-to-48-h interval. the same is true for enterococcus faecalis. against staphylococcus saprophyticus, ubts were present for at least 48 h with both quinolones. overall, a single oral dose of 400 mg of  fleroxacin exhibits ubts comparable to those of 800 mg of pefloxacin. therefore,  it may be expected that half of the dose of fleroxacin gives comparable results in the treatment of urinary tract infections; this should be substantiated in comparative clinical trials.

TI  == urinary bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of enoxacin versus norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in healthy volunteers after a single oral dose.
AB  == in an open, randomised monocentric crossover study in six male and six female healthy volunteers, the urinary antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetics of enoxacin, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were assessed. urine was collected up to  6 days, and venous blood samples up to 12 h, after a single oral dose of 400 mg enoxacin, 400 mg norfloxacin and 500 mg ciprofloxacin. enoxacin (250 mg/l) demonstrated the highest peak concentration (median) in the urine (0-6 h), followed by ciprofloxacin (237 mg/l) and norfloxacin (157 mg/l) as determined by  the hplc assay. the total amount (mean) excreted by the kidneys as parent drugs were as follows: enoxacin 54% of dose, ciprofloxacin 33% of dose, and norfloxacin 22% of dose. the mean plasma concentrations decreased from 1 to 4 h after administration for enoxacin from 1.9 to 1.4 mg/l, for ciprofloxacin from 2.0 to 0.8 mg/l and for norfloxacin from 1.3 to 0.5 mg/l. the antibacterial activity in  urine was determined as urinary bactericidal titers (ubt), i.e. the highest 2-fold dilution of urine still bactericidal for the reference organism (e. coli atcc 25,922) and for five uropathogens with minimal inhibitory (mic) and bactericidal (mbc) concentrations ranging from highly susceptible to resistant cultured from the urine of patients with complicated urinary tract infections (uti). for the e. coli atcc 25,922, the organism with the lowest mic, median ubts of ciprofloxacin were present for 4 days, decreasing from 1:512 to 1:2, that of enoxacin for 2 days, decreasing from 1:256 to 1:4, and that of norfloxacin for 2  days, decreasing from 1:128 to 1:2. for the five uropathogens (with increasing mics: k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, e. coli (resistant to nalidixic acid), p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis), the ubts decreased in general, according to mics, demonstrating the same relations of ubts for ciprofloxacin (highest) versus enoxacin (medium) versus norfloxacin (lowest) with one exception (p. mirabilis) for which norfloxacin showed higher ubts than enoxacin. the minimal urinary bactericidal concentrations (mubc), as derived from urinary concentrations, and ubts showed a fairly wide inter- and intraindividual range and were generally higher than the corresponding mbcs as determined in mueller hinton broth. in conclusion, according to antibacterial activity in urine determined as ubts, a single oral dose of ciprofloxacin (500 mg) generally resulted in the highest and  longest-lasting ubts followed by that of enoxacin (400 mg) and norfloxacin (400 mg). a dose of 400 mg enoxacin can be expected to be at least equivalent if not superior to that of 400 mg norfloxacin. only enoxacin and ciprofloxacin exhibited urinary bactericidal activity against all test organisms up to 12 h in all individuals. therefore, clinical comparison of enoxacin versus ciprofloxacin in the treatment of complicated uti could be worth testing.

TI  == beta-lactamases responsible for resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins in klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis isolates recovered in south africa.
AB  == although resistance to the expanded-spectrum cephalosporins among members of the  family enterobacteriaceae lacking inducible beta-lactamases occurs virtually worldwide, little is known about this problem among isolates recovered in south africa. isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis resistant to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins recovered from patients in various parts of south africa over a 3-month period were investigated for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard disk diffusion and agar dilution procedures. production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases was evaluated by using the double-disk test, and the beta-lactamases were characterized by spectrophotometric hydrolysis assays and an isoelectric focusing overlay technique which simultaneously determined isoelectric points and general substrate or inhibitor characteristics. dna amplification and sequencing were performed to confirm the identities of these enzymes. the p. mirabilis and e. coli isolates were found to produce tem-26-type, shv-2, and shv-5 extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. an ampc-related  enzyme which had a pi of 8.0 and which conferred resistance to cefoxitin as well  as the expanded-spectrum cephalosporins was found in a strain of k. pneumoniae. this is the first study which has identified organisms producing different extended-spectrum beta-lactamases from south africa and the first report describing strains of p. mirabilis producing a tem-26-type enzyme. the variety of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases found among members of the family enterobacteriaceae isolated from major medical centers in south africa is troubling and adds to the growing list of countries where these enzymes pose a serious problem for antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == an in-vitro study of carbapenem-induced morphological changes and endotoxin release in clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == one hundred clinical isolates, including escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris and proteus mirabilis, were exposed to carbapenems (imipenem, panipenem, meropenem and biapenem) at 0.5 x mic for 3 h, then their morphology was examined and endotoxin  release determined. ceftazidime, which induces filament formation, was used as a  control. scanning electron microscopy showed that these carbapenems induced formation of spherical or ovoid cells, except for p. aeruginosa treated with meropenem and biapenem; these latter cells had a 'bulge' midway along them and we have termed them 'oval-centred'. there was a relationship between morphology and  the amount of endotoxin released following exposure to carbapenems or ceftazidime. of all the species investigated, p. aeruginosa showed the most variable morphological changes. p. aeruginosa exposed to biapenem were longer oval-centred in shape, and released significantly more endotoxin than those exposed to imipenem, panipenem (spherical) or meropenem (shorter oval-centred cells) (p=0.030, 0.017 and 0.002, respectively). in all strains except p. aeruginosa, carbapenems induced significantly less endotoxin release than ceftazidime (p < 0.05).

TI  == [risk factors and pathogenic microorganisms in patients with insufficient esophagojejunostomy after gastrectomy].
AB  == it was the aim of the study to find by retrospective analysis of data from totally gastrectomized patients risk factors for the development of esophago-jejunal anastomotic leakage, that may be avoidable or influenced therapeutically. patients and methods: the study design was retrospective involving 838 patients with total gastrectomy for gastric cancer from the years 1973-1993. in 134 cases leakage of the esophago-jejunostomy occurred. the relative risk for the development of leakage associated with individual parameters was determined by comparing the data from 704 patients without leakage to the data from 134 patients presenting with this complication. for a subgroup of 86 patients with anastomotic leakage microbiological data of swabs taken from  the anastomoses were available, which were evaluated with respect to potentially  pathogenic bacilli. results: the overall leakage rate of esophago-jejunal anastomoses was 15.9% (n = 134). the mortality rate during this time period amounted to 14.3%. leakage was a most highly significant factor for mortality (p  = 0.0001). significant risk factors for leakage of the esophago-jejunostomy were  tumors of the cardia, splenectomy, a duration of operating time of more than 5 hours and manual suture technique compared to stapler anastomoses. tumor unrelated associated disease, tumor stage and a history of other preexisting gastric diseases were not associated with an increased relative risk. at the time of the initial clinical manifestation of leakage the following pathogenic bacilli could be isolated from leaking anastomoses with decreasing incidence: e. coli, s. aureus, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae a.o. the bacterial spectrum has not changed during the observation period of 20 years. summary: with the exception of the choice of suture techniques the identified clinical risk factors cannot be avoided or influenced therapeutically due to a lack of potentially curative treatment alternatives. in contrast potentially pathogenic bacilli associated with leakage can be prevented from coming in contact with anastomoses thereby preventing infection and leakage.

TI  == chromosomally encoded ampc-type beta-lactamase in a clinical isolate of proteus mirabilis.
AB  == a clinical strain of proteus mirabilis (cf09) isolated from urine specimens of a  patient displayed resistance to amoxicillin (mic >4,096 microg/ml), ticarcillin (4,096 microg/ml), cefoxitin (64 microg/ml), cefotaxime (256 microg/ml), and ceftazidime (128 microg/ml) and required an elevated mic of aztreonam (4 microg/ml). clavulanic acid did not act synergistically with cephalosporins. two  beta-lactamases with apparent pis of 5.6 and 9.0 were identified by isoelectric focusing on a gel. substrate and inhibition profiles were characteristic of an ampc-type beta-lactamase with a pi of 9.0. amplification by pcr with primers for  ampc genes (escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, and citrobacter freundii) of  a 756-bp dna fragment from strain cf09 was obtained only with c. freundii-specific primers. hybridization results showed that the ampc gene is only chromosomally located while the tem gene is plasmid located. after cloning of the gene, analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence (1,146 bp) showed that  this ampc gene is close to blacmy-2, from which it differs by three point mutations leading to amino acid substitutions glu --> gly at position 22, trp --> arg at position 201, and ser --> asn at position 343. ampc beta-lactamases derived from that of c. freundii (lat-1, lat-2, bil-1, and cmy-2) have been found in klebsiella pneumoniae, e. coli, and enterobacter aerogenes and have been reported to be plasmid borne. this is the first example of a chromosomally encoded ampc-type beta-lactamase observed in p. mirabilis. we suggest that it be  designated cmy-3.

AB  == objective: to determine whether the association between increased humoral reactivity against klebsiella and hla-b27 associated diseases could be confirmed  in dutch patients with ankylosing spondylitis (as) and acute anterior uveitis (aau). methods: under coded conditions sera from dutch patients with as, aau, and rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and from hla-b27 positive and negative healthy controls were studied for iga anti-klebsiella (k54) and igg anti-proteus antibodies with the indirect immunofluorescence assay on whole bacteria fixed in suspension with  paraformaldehyde. each group consisted of at least 17 sera. results: iga anti-klebsiella antibody titers were elevated in as and hla-b27 negative aau compared to the hla-b27 positive and negative controls or patients with active ra (p < 0.001). furthermore, patients with active ra had elevated levels of igg antibodies against p. mirabilis compared to every other test or control group (p  < 0.001). there was no significant difference between the as and ra patients in terms of serum c-reactive protein levels, although these were significantly elevated in both compared to healthy controls (p < 0.001), suggesting that the antibody elevations were not due to a nonspecific inflammatory effect. the same sera were blindly tested with negative results by 2 other centers. the discrepancies are probably the result of differences in the methods used. conclusion: our data support the hypothesis that klebsiella are involved in the pathogenesis of as and aau and that the same might be true for proteus in ra.

AB  == objective: to measure gut immunity directly in jejunal fluid in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (as) and rheumatoid arthritis (ra). methods: antibodies against three different enterobacterias were measured in jejunal perfusion fluids (collected by a double balloon perfusion device) of 19 patients with as, 14 patients with ra, and 22 healthy controls using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. results: the as patients had significantly increased jejunal fluid concentrations of igm, igg, and iga class antibodies against klebsiella pneumoniae, and igm and iga class antibodies against escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis compared with healthy controls. when compared with the patients with ra, the as patients had higher concentrations of iga and igg class antibodies only against k pneumoniae. the ra patients had higher igm class antibody concentrations against all three studied enterobacterias, when compared with the  healthy controls, suggesting an enhanced mucosal immune response in these patients. a three month treatment with sulphasalazine did not decrease enterobacterial antibody concentrations in the 10 patients with as. conclusion: there is strong direct evidence for an abnormal mucosal humoral immune response particularly to k pneumoniae in patients with as.

TI  == [characterization of plasmids which mediate resistance to multiple antibiotics in gram-negative bacteria of nosocomial origin].
AB  == background: the genetic and molecular mechanisms involved in antimicrobial resistance of 10 strains of gramnegative bacilli (1 serratia marcescens; 2 escherichia coli; 1 proteus mirabilis; 4 klebsiella pneumoniae; 1 enterobacter cloacae y 1 alcaligenes faecalis), isolated from adult patients with nosocomial pulmonary infection at the in-patient facilities of the university hospital of los andes, merida, venezuela, have been studied. methods: the antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by minimum inhibitory concentrations using the dilution method in agar. the study of extrachromosomal genes was carried out by conjugation, bacterial infection with the bacteriophage m13 and curing of plasmid by acridine orange. the plasmids were isolated by alkaline lysis and analysis of  restriction endonuclease digestion was carried out separately using the enzymes ecori and hindiii. a dna probe, derived from the region which encodes the tem-1 beta-lactamase of the plasmid pbr322 was used for dot-blot hybridization tests. results: all of the gramnegative bacilli showed resistance to ampicillin, carbenicillin and cephalothin (> 128 micrograms/ml) and 3 strains also showed resistance to gentamicin (> 64 micrograms/ml). genetic and molecular procedures showed the presence of conjugative plasmids of approximately 54 kb in all the 10  strains. the restriction patterns obtained by using ecori and hindiii indicated common dna fragments in most of the plasmids studied. the dot-blot hybridization  tests confirmed homology between the plasmids and the dna probe used (tem-1 beta-lactamase). conclusions: in this study, the gramnegative bacteria of nosocomial origin harbored self-transferable plasmids of approximately 54 kb, which mediate resistance to gentamicin and encode a beta-lactamase of the tem group.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheter.
AB  == the main objective of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel indwelling bladder catheter impregnated with minocycline and rifampin. thirty antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheters were inserted transurethrally in spinal cord-injured patients and removed, in six groups of five catheters each, at 3, 7, 10, 14, 17 or 21 days. removed catheters had detectable zones of inhibition against two different clinical isolates of each of the 10 tested uropathogens (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus saprophyticus and candida albicans) for greater than 14 days after catheter insertion. the residual zones of inhibition and levels of antimicrobial agents in removed catheters were  both inversely related to the duration of catheter placement. minocycline and rifampin were undetectable in serum and urine. these results support the ongoing  efforts for examining the clinical efficacy of these experimental bladder catheters.

AB  == objective: evaluation of the in vitro activity of new fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins and carbapenems against gram-negative bacteria. material and method: a total of 569 clinical isolates were obtained from inpatients at sao paulo hospital--unifesp/epm in june and july of 1992. the species distribution was as follows: enterobacter sp. (62), escherichia coli (308), klebsiella pneumoniae (27), klebsiella sp. (9), proteus mirabilis (23), pseudomonas aeruginosa (88), pseudomonas sp. (4), serratia sp. (30) and other gram-negatives  (7). susceptibility tests were performed by broth microdilution. the antimicrobials agents tested were: ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, du 6859-alpha, ceftazidime, cefepime, fk 037, imipenem, meropenem  and biapenem. results: du 6859-alpha showed the highest anti-microbial activity among the fluoroquinolones. it was two- to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against some species. the potency and antimicrobial spectrum were similar between the fourth-generation cephalosporins against enterobacteriaceae,  except for enterobacter sp. strains which were more susceptible to cefepime than  they were to cefetazidime or fk 037. when testing pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftazidime was slightly more active than the other cephalosporins. against enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, meropenem was more active  than imipenem or biapenem. in addition, the percentage of strains, susceptible to meropenem was higher than the percentage susceptible to the other cerbapenems against these species. conclusion: the new antimicrobial agents demonstrated in vitro activity higher than that of agents commercially available. however, more studies are necessary to further evaluate the in vivo activity and the clinical benefit of these compounds.

TI  == association of gut inflammation with increased serum iga class klebsiella antibody concentrations in patients with axial ankylosing spondylitis (as): implication for different aetiopathogenetic mechanisms for axial and peripheral as?
AB  == objectives: a role for klebsiella pneumoniae in ankylosing spondylitis (as) has been suggested because faecal carriage of klebsiella and serum klebsiella specific antibodies may be increased in this disease. this study has extended the earlier findings by comparing klebsiella specific serum iga class antibodies with inflammatory changes in the gut. methods: iga antibodies to k pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis in serum samples of 25 patients with as,  of eight control patients, and of 100 healthy blood donors were measured by enzyme immunoassay. gut inflammation of the patients was studied by ileocolonoscopy. results: increased iga antibody concentrations to k pneumoniae associated with gut inflammation in patients with axial form of as. such association was not seen in patients with peripheral form of as. conclusions: these findings may provide further evidence for the role of k pneumoniae in the pathogenesis of as. however, at least some of the patients with axial as without  gut inflammation, as well as patients with peripheral as did not have increased k pneumoniae antibody concentrations, which may be regarded as evidence against the direct role of k pneumoniae in the pathogenesis. the aetiopathogenetic mechanisms in the axial and peripheral form of as may be different.

AB  == specific immunoreactive anti-klebsiella antibodies are found in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (as), a significant proportion of whom have occult inflammatory bowel disease. molecular mimicry between klebsiella or other bacterial antigens and hla-b27 has been suggested in the pathogenesis of as. the  specificity of increased immunoreactivity against klebsiella remains to be assessed against the abundant anaerobic bacterial flora, present either in healthy controls or in patients with ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn's disease  (cd). total immunoglobulin (ig; igg, iga, igm) immunoreactivity was measured by elisa against klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli and ten  anaerobic isolates of the predominant normal bowel flora in 35 patients with active as, 60 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (30 cd, 30 uc), 60 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and 60 healthy controls. ig immunoreactivity to k. pneumoniae was significantly elevated in as (p < 0.001), cd (p < 0.001) and uc (p < 0.001) patients compared with ra patients and healthy  controls. furthermore, ig immunoreactivity to p. mirabilis was significantly elevated only in ra patients, compared with the other inflammatory groups (p < 0.001) and controls (p < 0.001). there was no significant antibody response against e. coli or the ten obligate anaerobes in any of the test groups. the data suggested an increased immune response to klebsiella in patients with as, uc, cd  and to proteus in patients with ra. the specificity of these responses in some patients supported a possible role for enteric klebsiella in the pathogenesis of  as and proteus in ra. the role of klebsiella in inflammatory bowel disease requires further study.

TI  == antibodies to klebsiella, proteus, and hla-b27 peptides in japanese patients with ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  == objective: to determine whether patients with ankylosing spondylitis (as) and patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) from japan have antibodies to klebsiella  pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis and to assess whether such antibodies are activated against peptides sharing sequences with hla-b27. methods: serum samples from 152 japanese patients, 52 with as, 50 with ra, and 50 healthy controls, were tested against 3 bacteria (k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, and escherichia coli) and 3 synthetic peptides (hla-b27, pullulanase-d, and scrambled pullulanase-d control peptide) by elisa under coded conditions. samples were tested for elevations in igg, iga, and igm antibody classes in patients with active as or ra, in patients  with ra with probable disease, and in patients with inactive as. disease activity was determined by an elevated serum c-reactive protein (> 10 mg/l) level and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (> 20 mm/h). results: patients with active as showed specific elevations in serum iga antibody levels against k. pneumoniae compared to patients with ra and controls (p < 0.001). no such elevation was seen in the igg and igm antibody classes. patients with inactive as showed no elevation in any class of antibody against k. pneumoniae compared to controls or patients with ra. patients with active or probably active ra showed significant elevations in igg antibody levels against p. mirabilis compared to as and controls (p < 0.001). patients with as (active or inactive), ra (active or probably active), and controls showed no elevations in any antibody class to e. coli. both active and inactive as patients had specific autoantibodies against hla-b27 peptide compared to patients with ra and controls (active as: igg, iga, igm, p < 0.001; inactive as: igg and iga, p < 0.001). patients with active as had igg and iga antibodies against pullulanase-d peptide, which contains a sequence that cross reacts with hla-b27 compared to controls (p < 0.001). conclusion: these results provide the first evidence of as and ra patients in japan having specific elevations of antibody to k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, respectively.  this suggests that k. pneumoniae in as and p. mirabilis in ra may play a role in  triggering and/or exacerbating these diseases.

TI  == a bifunctional urease enhances survival of pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica and morganella morganii at low ph.
AB  == to infect a susceptible host, the gastrointestinal pathogen yersinia enterocolitica must survive passage through the acid environment of the stomach.  in this study, we showed that y. enterocolitica serotype o8 survives buffered acidic conditions as low as ph 1.5 for long periods of time provided urea is available. acid tolerance required an unusual cytoplasmically located urease that was activated 780-fold by low-ph conditions. acid tolerance of helicobacter species has also been attributed to urease activity, but in that case urease was  not specifically activated by low-ph conditions. a ure mutant strain of y. enterocolitica was constructed which was hypersensitive to acidic conditions when urea was available and, unlike the parental strain, was unable to grow when urea  was the sole nitrogen source. examination of other urease-producing gram-negative bacteria indicated that morganella morganii survives in acidic conditions but escherichia coli 1021, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa do not. consistent with these results, biochemical evidence demonstrated that y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases  were activated in vitro by low ph with an unusually low activity optimum of ph 5.5. in whole cells activation occurred as medium values decreased below ph 3.0 for y. enterocolitica and ph 5.5 for m. morganii, suggesting that in vivo activation occurs as a result of cytoplasmic acidification. dna sequence analysis of portions of the m. morganii ure locus showed that the predicted primary structure of the enzyme structural subunits is most similar to those of y. enterocolitica urease. one region of similarity between these two ureases located near the active site is distinct from most other ureases but is present in the urease of lactobacillus fermentum. this region of similarity may be responsible for the unique properties of the y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases since  the l. fermentum urease also has been shown to have a low ph optimum for activity.

(b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis, n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently  found in daily treatment of infections. it appears that the effectiveness of cdzm was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. among h. influenzae isolates included imipenem (ipm)-resistant and norfloxacin (nflx)-resistant strains. the mic-range of cdzm against strains collected in 1995 including ipm-resistant and nflx-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and mic90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. cdzm showed strong antimicrobial activities against h. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.

TI  == is the ability of urinary tract pathogens to accumulate glycine betaine a factor  in the virulence of pathogenic strains?
AB  == the regulation of intracellular concentrations of organic solutes, including glycine betaine, is an important adaptive response to osmotic stress for escherichia coli. the clinical significance of glycine betaine to uropathogens is not clear. clinical isolates of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. saprophyticus, and enterococcus faecalis accumulated glycine betaine from hyperosmotic media. the addition of glycine betaine to hyperosmotic minimal medium accelerated the growth rates of all species tested except p. mirabilis. however, when clinical strains of e. coli were transferred from urine with low osmolality to hyperosmotic urine, there was no slowing of the growth rate. there  was no difference in growth rates of e. coli isolates from acute pyelonephritis,  cystitis, and asymptomatic bacteriuria nor from fecal isolates. the ability to accumulate osmolytes, although it may be a factor in the adaptation to hypertonic environments, was not related to virulence.

AB  == although the vitek and microscan walkaway are two of the most commonly used automated antimicrobial susceptibility test systems, few studies have been performed comparing discrepancies between these systems. in this study, 500 gram  negative clinical isolates were tested against ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam,  ticarcillin, ticarcillin/clavulanate, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin to determine the number of major interpretation discrepancies between the two systems. the 500 isolates consisted of 100 isolates each of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus  mirabilis and enterobacter species. each isolate was tested simultaneously in both systems using the same standardized inoculum. eighty-four major discrepancies occurred, of which 48 were reproducible. the reproducible discrepancy rate, for the 4,500 isolate/antimicrobic combinations tested, was 48  of 4500 (1.06%). the rate for individual antimicrobics varied from 17 of 500 (3.4%) for ampicillin to no discrepancies for ticarcillin or ciprofloxacin. of the 48 reproducible discrepancies, 44 (92%) were vitek resistant, microscan susceptible. fifteen (31%) of the vitek and 21 (44%) of the microscan results were confirmed by broth microdilution. disk diffusion results were in agreement with 15 (31%) of the vitek and 21 (44%) of the microscan results. twelve (25%) of the broth microdilution and 12 (25%) of the disk diffusion results were intermediate. the broth microdilution and disk diffusion results for the 48 isolates with reproducible discrepancies were in agreement more often with microscan. however, there was less very major error comparing the vitek results for these isolates to the broth microdilution and disk diffusion. overall, the result of this evaluation indicate that the number of major interpretation discrepancies between the two systems is minimal for the isolate/antimicrobic combinations tested.

AB  == seventy patients (44(62.9%) females) requiring short-term urinary bladder catheterisation at the kenyatta national hospital, nairobi formed the study population. their mean ages +/- sd was 41+/- 26 years (range 13-100 years). the common indications and objectives for catheterisation included keeping the environment dry (41.1%), relieving urinary retention (27.0%) and urinary incontinence (24.3%). urinary tract infection (uti) was documented in 48 (68.6%)  of the patients. the commonest infection organisms were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis, the three accounting for 78.6% of the infections. female gender and increasing age increased the risk of catheter-associated uti. the risk of having catheter-associated uti was higher in patients with medical and surgical conditions than in those with obstetric and gynaecology conditions. patients who were on systemic antibiotics for other conditions acquired uti less often (27%) than those who were not undergoing antibiotic therapy. the organisms isolated showed marked resistance to commonly available antibiotics. we conclude that uti, due to resistant organisms, is common in patients undergoing acute urinary bladder catheterisation in our setting and recommend that urinary bladder catheterisation should be avoided whenever possible. in a situation where this is inevitable, closed drainage systems should be used for the shortest duration possible.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of lb10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
AB  == in vitro activity of lb10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. against gram-positive bacteria, lb10522 was most active among the compounds tested. it was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  and enterococcus faecalis. lb10522 was highly effective against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested. ninety percent of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. these activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, lb10522 with a mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml  was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by staphylococcus aureus giorgio, streptococcus pneumoniae iii, pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e, escherichia coli 851e, proteus mirabilis 1315e, serratia marcescens 1826e, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus ac-54. lb10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as tem-3, tem-7, shv-1, fec-1, and p-99. lb10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in enterobacter cloacae 1194e, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. time-kill study showed that lb10522, at concentrations of two or four times the mic, had a rapid bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus 6538p, escherichia coli 851e, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich peptide derived from a  putative porcine precursor protein of a novel family of antibacterial peptides.
AB  == it has long been speculated that porcine cathelin is an n-terminal fragment of a  longer precursor protein which possesses antimicrobial activity. in an attempt to find such a precursor, a cdna clone was recently isolated and sequenced by screening a cdna library from porcine bone marrow. in order to identify the functional activity of the putative protein encoded by an open reading frame, we  have synthesized various lengths of peptides that correspond to the c-terminal region of the protein and examined them for their antimicrobial activities. we found that a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich region with the sequence of vrrfpwwwpflrr had strong antimicrobial activity with a wide spectrum. it showed potency against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus group d as well  as aspergillus fumigatus. the action of this peptide is bactericidal rather than  bacteriostatic and this activity is completely inhibited by 2 mm mgcl2. our results indicate that the previously identified putative precursor encoded by the isolated cdna indeed possesses a potent antimicrobial activity and that this 13 amino acid synthetic peptide is considered to be a potentially effective drug against various infectious agents.

AB  == during the first six months of 1990 and 1994 respectively, 3179 and 2721 non-repetitive strains of enterobacteriaceae were isolated at the teaching hospital of clermont-ferrand. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were found in 147 isolates, mainly in klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 73), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 37) and proteus mirabilis (n = 15). tem-3/ctx-1, shv-4/caz-5 and tem-24/caz-6 were the prevalent enzymes. however, the most frequently involved enzyme in 1990  was tem-3 (48.6%) whereas in 1994 it was shv-4 (56.0%). two salient features emerged from this study: the high frequency of tem-3 production in p. mirabilis and the production of shv-4 enzyme, heretofore observed solely in k. pneumoniae,  in two other species, e. aerogenes and escherichia coli.

TI  == douglas-fir root-associated microorganisms with inhibitory activity towards fungal plant pathogens and human bacterial pathogens.
AB  == a microbial culture collection composed of 1820 bacterial strains, including 298  actinomycete strains, was established from the roots of douglas-fir (pseudotsuga  menziesii (mirb.) franco) seedlings harvested from conifer nurseries and forest sites. two hundred and thirty-four strains inhibited the growth of fusarium, cylindrocarpon, and (or) pythium spp. in in vitro assays. a significantly greater proportion of bacterial strains from actinomycete genera exhibited antifungal properties compared with bacterial strains from nonactinomycete genera. eighty-nine percent of identified inhibitory strains were streptomyces, streptoverticillium, bacillus, pseudomonas, or burkholderia species. the actinomycete species were isolated almost exclusively from forest seedlings. recovery of inhibitory strains representing 29 microbial species was enhanced using a variety of methods to isolate microorganisms from the roots of seedlings  from nursery and forest sites. bacterial strains (including actinomycete strains) with antifungal activity were tested for in vitro growth inhibition of six clinical human bacterial pathogens (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). forty-eight percent of the tested strains inhibited one or more human pathogens, inhibitory activity towards fungal and bacterial pathogens was strain specific, not species specific, and many inhibitory strains exhibited broad-spectrum activity. strains with antifungal activity against several conifer root pathogens were also more likely to inhibit multiple species of clinical bacterial pathogens.

TI  == an evaluation of the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  == tazobactam is a new, irreversible inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases of staphylococci, plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of the tem and shv types found in escherichia coli and klebsiella species and beta-lactamases of anerobes such as bacteroides species. its combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum ureido-penicillin, would be expected to improve the activity of piperacillin against staphylococci, tem and shv beta-lactamase producing gram negative bacteria and anerobes. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of piperacillin/tazobactam were determined for 1952 individual patient isolates of gram positive and negative bacteria causing significant infections and compared with mic values for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid. mics were determined by agar dilution (nccls 1990 and 1992). piperacillin/tazobactam had excellent activity against methicillin susceptible staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, enterococci and organisms of the bacteroides fragilis group. it was also active against the majority of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates tested. it was not active against extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing klebsiella species and some high level tem and shv beta-lactamase producing e. coli and klebsiella species. activity against gram negative organisms capable of producing chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases was good, since in most organisms tested, the enzymes were not induced in sufficient quantities to cause antibiotic resistance. however some enterobacter species were derepressed hyperproducing mutants; these isolates showed resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam since tazobactam does not inhibit these class i beta lactamases. activity was superior to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid for gram negative rods. imipenem was the most active agent against esbl producing klebsiella species. piperacillin/tazobactam has a suitable spectrum of activity in vitro to suggest its use in monotherapy of mixed anerobic infections, mixed respiratory infections such as aspiration pneumonia and, in combination with an aminoglycoside, it would provide gram positive as well as gram negative cover of  febrile episodes in immunosuppressed patients.

AB  == in this multicenter study conducted in eight european countries, 13,173 pathogens--all isolated from community-acquired infections in 1992 and 1993--were evaluated for their susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin g, ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. ten centers in italy, five in germany, in the netherlands and switzerland, four in greece and spain, three in hungary and one in finland contributed to this study; ready-to-use standardized microtiter panels (sceptor system, bbl, heidelberg, germany) were used throughout all assays. the most frequently encountered species were: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and non-typhoid salmonella spp., enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus agalactiae, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter freundii, staphylococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, proteus  vulgaris, moraxella catarrhalis and shigella spp. the percentage of susceptible isolates was assessed for each of the above-mentioned countries and european-wide with all the data available. for many species, the percentage of resistant isolates did not differ markedly between the countries considered. however, one of the most striking exceptions was the high prevalence of high-level penicillin-g-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates in hungary and spain; some of the low-level penicillin-g-resistant strains remained susceptible to cefuroxime, whereas complete cross-resistance occurred for all other beta-lactams studied. the high frequency of ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae isolates in spain deserves mentioning; this could be attributed mainly to the prevalence of a beta-lactamase, as the addition of clavulanic acid rendered these strains susceptible to ampicillin. the penicillin compounds exhibited the greatest activity against gram-positive pathogens, whereas cefetamet was the most active agent against gram-negative pathogens with a well-balanced spectrum of activity.

TI  == changing patterns of susceptibilities of blood, urinary and respiratory pathogens in hong kong.
AB  == the incidence and antimicrobial susceptibility of organisms isolated from blood,  urine and respiratory specimens at a teaching hospital in hong kong were studied  retrospectively from 1986-1993. the incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, particularly coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), increased significantly from 33.6 to 47.3% (p < 0.001) while that of gram-negative bacteraemia fell from 60.0  to 47.0% (p < 0.001). among blood isolates, methicillin resistance of cns increased from 17.0 to 58.0% (p < 0.001) and cefuroxime resistance of enterobacter spp. increased from 21.0 to over 50% (p < 0.01). among urinary isolates, cefuroxime resistance of klebsiella spp. (11.0 to 24.0%, p < 0.001) and enterobacter spp. (32.0 to 75.0%, p < 0.001) increased. nalidixic acid resistance among gram-negative urinary isolates, except proteus mirabilis, rose by three- to sixfold. for streptococcus pneumoniae, isolated from the respiratory tract, penicillin resistance increased dramatically (2 to 18%, p < 0.001). for respiratory isolates of haemophilus influenzae, ampicillin resistance increased from 17.0 to 29.0% (p < 0.001). these data are useful in guiding empirical treatment of nosocomial infections.

TI  == in-vitro production of ethanol in urine by fermentation.
AB  == driving while under the influence of alcohol (dui) can lead to serious injuries to the intoxicated driver and surrounding individuals, in addition to revocation  or suspension of driving privileges. the accuracy and interpretation of the testing procedures may be compromised if an individual's urine contains sugar, and either bacteria or yeast. under these conditions, ethanol can be produced in  vitro, producing a result that may be erroneously indicative of dui. in this study three yeast species and six bacterial species were added to a blank urine sample devoid of any alcohol or sugar. samples were incubated at 0, 25, and 35 degrees c for 24, 48, and 144 hours in the presence of one of four different sugars. ethanol concentrations were assayed using an enzymatic alcohol dehydrogenase assay. results showed that when glucose was used as a substrate, all yeast species (candida albicans, candida parapsilosis, and candida sp. not albicans) and three bacterial species (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis) were capable of producing ethanol while the other three (enterococcus sp., staphylococcus sp. not aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were not. the rate of ethanol production is temperature dependent and can be inhibited by storage of samples at 0 degrees c or the use of approximately 1% sodium fluoroide as an antimicrobial agent. many of these species were also able  to use other substrates (sucrose, fructose, and galactose) to produce ethanol by  fermentation.

TI  == the effect of iontophoresis on bacterial growth in urine.
AB  == purpose: to determine the effect of iontophoresis (electrical current for therapeutic purposes) on the growth of pathogenic bacteria in human urine. materials and methods: pathogenic bacteria were isolated and inoculated into a dynamic in vitro artificial bladder model. pooled sterile human urine was regulated through the artificial bladder by intravenous tubing and pumps to simulate filling and emptying of the human bladder. the effect of electrical current on bacterial growth in the system was then studied. results: when iontophoresis is applied at low bacterial concentrations ( < 10(8) colony forming units [cfu]/l.), inhibition of bacterial growth occurs. however, when iontophoresis is applied after fulminant growth of bacteria ( > 10(8) cfu/l.), no inhibition of bacterial growth occurs. iontophoresis was not found to enhance the antibacterial action of gentamicin to resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa. conclusions: iontophoresis inhibits bacterial growth at low bacterial concentrations. it does not inhibit bacterial growth after infectious levels have been attained, and it does not potentiate the action of gentamicin on resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa.

AB  == this study reports the isolation and identification of aerobic organisms from biopsies/slit-skin smears/scrapings from 129 leprosy patients and 50 healthy controls. these include 56 paucibacillary (pb) and 73 multibacillary (mb) cases.  thirty-six isolates from the specimens from 21 patients and 15 healthy controls were grown. the non-mycobacterial isolates from clinically pb leprosy (tt/bt/i) patients were: (1) gram-positive cocci: staphylococcus aureus(1), staphylococcus  albus(1); (b) gram-positive bacilli: bacillus subtilis(1), corynebacterium xerosis(1); (c) gram-negative bacilli: escherichia coli(1), proteus mirabilis(2), klebsiella pneumoniae(1) and pseudomonas aeruginosa(1). the isolates from clinically mb leprosy (bb/bl/ll) patients were: (a) gram-positive cocci: micrococci(1), staphylococcus aureus(1) and staphylococcus albus(1); (b) gram-positive bacilli: corynebacterium xerosis(1); corynebacterium hofmanni(1) and bacillus cereus(1). (c) gram-negative bacilli: escherichia coli(2), klebsiella pneumoniae(1) and proteus mirabilis(2). the specimens from healthy controls yielded similar organisms. these were (a) gram-positive cocci: staphylococcus albus(2), staphylococcus aureus(2) and micrococci(2); (b) gram-positive bacilli: corynebacterium xerosis(1), bacillus subtilis(2), corynebacterium hofmanni(1) and bacillus cereus(1); (c) gram-negative bacilli: escherichia coli(3), proteus vulgaris(1) and proteus mirabilis(1). while these results show no significant differences in the species types of non-mycobacterial aerobic organisms isolated from healthy skin and pb/mb types of leprosy, these isolates need to be characterized by immunological/molecular methods to find out  subtypes if any.

TI  == experimental investigations on the immunomodulating activity of polybacterial preparation for peroral immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis of uroinfections.
AB  == the immunomodulating effect of a polybacterial immunostimulator urostim in experimental animal models was investigated. the preparation was created for immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis of uroinfections. it consists of killed bacterial cells and their lysates of four microbial species: escherichia coli expressing type 1 pili, rc mutant of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and enterococcus faecalis, balb/c mice and guinea-pigs were treated orally with urostim for 5 or 10 days, respectively. a stimulatory effect of urostim on phagocytosis (increased phagocytic index and phagocytic number) of mice peritoneal exudate cells was observed. an increased number of plaque-forming cells and elevated titres of haemagglutinating antibodies in mice demonstrated activation of humoral immunity. lymphoproliferative studies showed a significant  response to phytohaemagglutinin (pha) and urostim, especially after the second application of the preparation. at the same time no changes in the absolute number of peripheral blood lymphocytes were found. an active protection of mice against a systemic infection and of guinea-pigs against uroinfection caused by gram-negative bacteria was obtained. in conclusion, the results obtained characterize urostim as an effective immunostimulator. its peroral application leads to the activation of innate resistance, cell-mediated, humoral and local immunity.

TI  == bacterial agents causing chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  == ear swabs from 350 patients with chronic otitis media attending different orthorhinolaryngological clinics at different hospitals and health centres in benin city and ekpoma in edo state were screened for the presence of bacterial agents of chronic otitis media. results revealed the presence of 19 different species indicating polymicrobial infections. species isolated comprised staphylococcus aureus (33.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.3%), proteus mirabilis  (17%), alcaligenes faecalis (6.2%) and klebsiella aerogenes (4.3%). others included escherichia coli (3.3%), proteus rettgeri (2.8%), and staphylococcus epidermidis (2.2%), klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, acinetobacter spp, proteus morgani, haemophilus influenzae, providencia spp, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, non-haemolytic streptococci and diphotheroids, each accounted for less than 2% of isolates. the study also showed a higher prevalence of chronic otitis media among males (55.7%) than females (44.3%). cases of chronic otitis media were highest among the age groups (0-5 years) with a prevalence rate of 50% and least among the 6-10 year age group with a prevalence rate of 14.9%. antibiogram of isolates revealed marked sensitivities (over 90% of the isolates) to ciproxin, tarivid, rocephin and fortum whereas over 70% were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. results have indicated that staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis are leading bacterial agents of otitis media and highlights the high risk involved in the use of penicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, cloxacillin and septrin in the management of chronic otitis media in our locality.

TI  == antibodies to klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis in the sera of ankylosing spondylitis patients with/without iritis and enthesitis.
AB  == igm, igg and iga class serum antibodies against the whole klebsiella pneumoniae,  escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis bacteria, as well as against k. pneumoniae and e. coli lipopolysaccharides (lpss) were studied earlier in the sera of 98 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (as) and in 102 healthy blood donors by enzyme immunoassay. in this study the patients were divided into groups according to the clinical picture, i.e. presence or absence of iritis and enthesitis. the previous major finding of increased iga class antibody levels against the whole k. pneumoniae bacteria in as patients when compared to the healthy controls was not specifically associated with any single patient group in the present study. however, the patients with iritis had higher levels of iga class antibodies to lps of k. pneumoniae and e. coli when compared to the patients without iritis. in addition, the patients without enthesitis had higher level of igg class antibodies against whole k. pneumoniae bacteria compared to the patients with enthesitis. the increased iga class antibody levels against k. pneumoniae and e.  coli lps in as patients with iritis may reflect an inflammatory process in the gut area. furthermore, there were certain other differences in the immunological  parameters between the as patients with and without iritis or enthesitis and the  possibility that they reflect different mechanisms involved in the disease processes cannot be excluded.

AB  == igm, igg and iga class serum antibodies against the whole klebsiella pneumoniae,  escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis bacteria, as well as against k. pneumoniae and e. coli lipopolysaccharides (lpss) were studied earlier in two separate patient populations of 99 and 85 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (as) and in 102 healthy blood donors by enzyme immunoassay. in this study the patients were divided into groups according to the presence or absence of peripheral arthritis. the patients with peripheral type as had increased levels of igm and iga class antibodies against k. pneumoniae, whereas the patients with axial type as had increased levels of igg and iga class antibodies to k. pneumoniae, as well as iga class antibodies against e. coli and p. mirabilis bacteria. sulphasalazine treatment decreased the igm and iga class antibodies in peripheral as and iga class antibodies in axial as against k. pneumoniae lps. the antibody levels were  also decreased against e. coli and p. mirabilis bacteria in the sera of patients  with axial as. the immunological findings in patients with peripheral and axial form of as were different from each other and thus may reflect different aetiopathogenetic mechanisms for these two types of as.

TI  == nosocomial infections caused by selected gram-negative bacteria at the anaesthesiology and intensive care unit of the teaching hospital in brno.
AB  == in the course of 13 months we monitored the occurrence of strains of p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, kl. pneumoniae, including its indole-positive variant and s. marcescens in patients of the anaesthesiology and intensive care unit (aicu) of the teaching hospital (th) in brno. out of 436 patients hospitalized at that time, 95 (21.8%) were colonized or infected by one or all of the bacterial species studied. out of those 95 patients, 48 (50.5%) came to the aicu already colonized or infected by one of the studied agents mostly from other wards of the th or from other hospitals. at the aicu, 32 of them were reinfected or superinfected by one, two or all of the bacterial species studied. of the 436 hospitalized patients, 79 (18.1%) were newly infected, reinfected or superinfected. by serotyping, proticine production and proticine sensitivity (p-s) typing and phage typing we demonstrated the endemization of some p-s types  and phage types of the bacterial species studied and their spreading among the contemporaneously hospitalized patients. the endemic strains of p. mirabilis included p-s types p5/s6, s7, s9 and p5/s6, s7; p0/s9; p1/s2, s11 and p1/s11. the two biotypes of klebsiella, i.e. k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca, were identically sensitive to some of the phages 1, 2, 3, 8 and 106, particularly to phages 2 and  3, or 2, 3 and 106. the isolated strains of serratia were absolutely resistant to the 26 bacteriophages used.

TI  == toc-39, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin with excellent activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == toc-39, a new parenteral cephalosporin, is a hydroxyimino-type cephem antibiotic  with vinylthio-pyridyl moiety at the 3 position. toc-39 was evaluated for antibacterial activity against various clinically isolated strains. toc-39 had excellent activity, stronger than that of methicillin, oxacillin, the cephalosporins tested, imipenem, gentamicin, minocycline, tobramycin, ofloxacin,  and ciprofloxacin against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and  had an mic comparable to that of vancomycin (the mics of toc-39 and vancomycin for 90% of the strains tested were 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively). against enterococcus faecalis strains, which are resistant to cephalosporins, toc-39 was twice as active as ampicillin. against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp., and streptococcus pneumoniae, toc-39 was twice as active as or more active than cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome. against streptococcus pyogenes, toc-39 was superior to cefotiam, ceftazidime, and flomoxef and was similar to cefpirome. in addition, the activity of toc-39 was equal to or greater than that of cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome against haemophilus influenzae, escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and morganella morganii. in terms of bactericidal effect against mrsa, toc-39 was superior to vancomycin. no mutant resistant to toc-39 or vancomycin was obtained from susceptible mrsa strains. in  murine systemic infection models, toc-39 showed potent activity against s. aureus and e. coli. against highly mrsa, the activity of toc-39 was comparable to that of vancomycin.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of sulbactam/ampicillin against clinically isolated microbial strains].
AB  == antimicrobial activities were examined for sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc) against clinically isolated microbial strains in 1987, 1990, 1994. besides, the beta-lactamase productivity and mics of these strains were measured, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. the ratio of beta-lactamase producing strains were 90% of methicillin (dmppc)-susceptible staphylococcus aureus subsp.  aureus (mssa), about 80% of dmppc-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), 100% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis, 95% of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis and 15-20% of haemophilus influenzae.  several kinds of beta-lactamase productivity were observed. 2. antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc against beta-lactamase producing strains of mssa, m. (b.)  catarrhalis, h. influenzae, and almost all of enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of ampicillin (abpc) and piperacillin (pipc), but antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were weak against mrsa and cephems (ceps)-resistant strains detected in some of enterobacteriaceae. 3. it appeared that benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive streptococcus pneumoniae (pisp) or pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) and ceps-resistant escherichia coli increased  year by year. 4. antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were strong against streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, m. (b.) catarrhalis and h. influenzae including beta-lactamase producing strains. additionally, beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of sbt was observed against beta-lactamase produced by s. aureus and k. pneumoniae which demonstrate indirect pathogenicity. thus, sbt/abpc is an injectable antibiotic that is expected to demonstrate clinical usefulness,  especially as the first line drug for the respiratory tract infections that are community-acquired.

TI  == [susceptibility of bacterial isolates from the equine respiratory tract to trimethoprim, sulfadoxine, sulfadimethoxine and combinations of these compounds].
AB  == using a broth microdilution technique, the in vitro susceptibility of bacterial isolates from the equine respiratory tract to trimethoprim, sulfadoxine, sulfadimethoxine, and combinations of these compounds was determined. the bacterial strains (n = 88) isolated recently from horses with respiratory symptoms belonged to the following species: streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (n = 34), streptococcus equi subsp. equi (n = 22), staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 7), rhodococcus equi (n = 4), pseudomonas spp. (n = 3) and escherichia coli (n = 3). in addition, two isolates  of enterobacter spp. and one isolate of streptococcus equisimilis, staphylococcus intermedius, proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens were examined. for determination of susceptibility of an organism the following minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) were fixed as limiting values: trimethoprim < or = 0.5 microgram/ml, sulfadoxine < or = 32 micrograms/ml, sulfadimethoxine < or = 32 micrograms/ml, trimethoprim/sulfadoxine < or = 0.5/32 micrograms/ml, trimethoprim/sulfadimethoxine < or = 0.5/32 micrograms/ml. as expected, rhodococcus-equi-isolates were resistant to the antimicrobials tested. however, most of the clinically more common isolates showed a high degree of susceptibility to the combinations. the fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) indices indicated synergism of the combination-partners in a wide range. according to these in vitro results, application of trimethoprim/sulfonamide combinations for the initial therapy of equine respiratory tract infections can be recommended.

TI  == [nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1991. in this study, identifications and susceptibility  testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and cns showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (dmppc). streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to  many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. though enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (abpc), piperacillin (pipc), imipenem (ipm), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st) compounds, enterococcus faecium was resistant  to almost all antibacterial agents but to st compounds. high susceptibility rates were observed for strains of enterobacter cloacae to ipm, gentamicin (gm) and ofloxacin (oflx) and for strains of proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (lmox), ipm, aztreonam (azt), gm and oflx. serratia marcescens and bacteroides fragilis group  were highly susceptible only to ipm. pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (caz), ipm, amikacin (amk) and tobramycin (tob). pseudomonas cepacia  was relatively susceptible only to caz. ipm showed strong antibacterial activity  to many species except for s. aureus and cns.

TI  == monoclonal antibodies to pseudomonas pseudomallei and their potential for diagnosis of melioidosis.
AB  == monoclonal antibodies (mabs) specific for pseudomonas pseudomallei antigens were  produced by immunizing balb/c mice with a crude whole cell extract. hybrids secreting mabs specific for p. pseudomallei antigens were identified by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) against a panel of crude whole cell extracts from p. pseudomallei, p. cepacia, p. aeruginosa, p. putida, p. alcaligenes, xanthomonas maltophilia, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella typhi, s. krefeld, s. enteritidis, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus. of the six specific clones, clone 5f8, which was igm-producing and which reacted with all 56 p. pseudomallei isolates, was selected for further characterization and evaluation of its possible diagnostic potential. results obtained from the indirect elisa against various p. pseudomallei antigens, from direct bacterial agglutination, and from immunofluorescence tests suggested that 5f8 reacted with the surface envelope, and probably specifically with an epitope of the lipopolysaccharide. the antibody could be readily used to identify p. pseudomallei in primary culture or in a simulated hemoculture. the antibody was also used to prepare an affinity-purified antigen for use in an indirect elisa that was highly sensitive and specific for the detection of circulating antibody in patients with acute septicemic melioidosis.

TI  == comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: a multi-center study in five mediterranean countries.
AB  == in 5 mediterranean countries 7902 pathogens, all isolated in 1992 and 1993 from community-acquired infections, were studied for susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin g, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid (both 2:1 ratio), cefalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime,  cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. ten centers in italy, 4 centers in greece, 3 centers in spain, and 1 center in lebanon and saudi arabia contributed  to this study; all centers used performed standardized microtiter panels (sceptor, bbl, heidelberg, frg). the most frequently isolated pathogens were escherichia coli (n = 1267), proteus mirabilis (n = 843), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 771), enteric salmonella spp. (n = 629), enterobacter cloacae (n = 486), citrobacter freundii (n = 383), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 346), haemophilus influenzae (n = 298), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 294), streptococcus pneumoniae  (n = 246), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 243), and shigella spp. (n = 185). statistical analysis was performed for each of the above countries and for all pooled data available. the penicillin antibiotics were the most active compounds against the  gram-positive cocci, exceeding the mic90 values 2- to 8-fold over all cephalosporins. regarding the gram-negatives (above all klebsiella spp.) cefetamet was by far the most active compound (mic90 = 1 mg/l). regarding the percentage of resistant isolates, there were no striking discrepancies between the centers and countries involved in this study. there was, however, complete cross-resistance in penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates (mic90 = 2 mg/l). by far the majority of the penicillin-resistant pneumococci showed additional resistance to doxycycline and erythromycin.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the activity of ceftriaxone plus metronidazole against pathogens usually involved in intra-abdominal infections was studied. metronidazole 1 g and ceftriaxone 1 g  (as the sodium salt) were simultaneously administered i.v. over 30 minutes every  24 hours to 12 healthy volunteers for three doses. serum samples were collected at baseline, just before the last dose, and 12, 16, 20, 22, and 24 hours after the start of infusion of the last dose. serum bactericidal titers (sbts) were performed in duplicate for each serum sample from 12 hours on. serum ceftriaxone  and metronidazole concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, and the elimination rate and half-life were calculated for each antimicrobial in each volunteer. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of  each antibiotic for two strains each of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacteroides fragilis were determined by microdilution. eleven volunteers completed the study. ceftriaxone and metronidazole maintained sbts of at least 1:4. serum ceftriaxone concentrations remained above the mics for e. coli, p. mirabilis, and k. pneumoniae, and serum metronidazole concentrations remained above the mic for b. fragilis throughout the study. ceftriaxone combined with metronidazole resulted in intense and prolonged activity against e. coli, p. mirabilis, k. pneumoniae, and b. fragilis.

TI  == proteolytic activity and fatal gram-negative sepsis in burned mice: effect of exogenous proteinase inhibition.
AB  == circulating proteolytic activity (pa) increases following burn or surgical trauma. challenging traumatized mice with the yeast candida albicans further increases pa. once a pa threshold has been passed, mortality increases as pa increases. the purposes of this study were to determine (i) if gram-negative bacterial challenge affects circulating pa and mortality as candida challenge does and (ii) if proteinase inhibitor treatment with aprotinin, antithrombin iii, and alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor decreases circulating pa and increases the survival of burned mice infected with a bacterium. for all bacteria tested (proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae), burn plus challenge significantly elevated pa and mortality above levels in mice that were  only burned or only challenged. quantitative culture counts indicated that the mice died of sepsis. proteinase inhibitor treatment of mice burned and challenged with k. pneumoniae significantly decreased circulating pa, decreased the hepatic  microbial load, and increased survival. hence, in traumatized mice challenged with either c. albicans or gram-negative bacteria, a relationship exists between  proteolytic load and subsequent septic death. parallels between these animal studies and human studies are discussed.

TI  == pre-formed urease activity of helicobacter pylori as determined by a viable cell  count technique--clinical implications.
AB  == the pre-formed urease activity of three nctc reference strains and five clinical  isolates of helicobacter pylori was determined at room temperature (21 degrees c) and 37 degrees c by a viable cell count technique with a conventional urea slope  test (christensen's agar) as well as the commercial clo-test. the urease activity of two gastroduodenal commensals, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae, was also tested. h. pylori strains produced positive reactions with viable cell counts of 10(6)-10(8) cfu within 30 min and with counts of 10(3)-10(6) cfu within 2 h. for some strains, smaller numbers of organisms were needed with the clo-test than with the conventional test, and incubation of the clo-test strips at 37 degrees c slightly decreased the number of organisms required for positive results. p. mirabilis produced a positive result on urea slopes with an initial inoculum of 10(7)-10(8) cfu at 2 h, but no positive reaction occurred for k. pneumoniae at 12 h, even with an initial inoculum of 10(11) cfu. however, both p. mirabilis and k. pneumoniae gave a positive result after incubation for 24 h with initial inocula of < 10(1) cfu and 10(3)-10(4) cfu respectively. incubation at 37 degrees c significantly reduced the inoculum size of these organisms required for a positive result after incubation for 4 h when tested with the slopes, but not with the clo-test. these findings indicate that h. pylori possesses much greater  pre-formed urease activity than p. mirabilis and k. pneumoniae. false negative results for clinical detection of h. pylori in gastroduodenal biopsies may be due to small numbers of organisms, especially after treatment with antimicrobial agents, and false positive results may arise from gastroduodenal commensals or contaminants.

AB  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. the advantages of in vitro activity of fk037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (mic90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa), (3) a strong activity against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (mic90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for escherichia coli,  0.1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis and moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for c. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant s. aureus (l-mrsa), enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for h-mrsa and serratia marcescens.  fk037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except mrsa, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except p. vulgaris and/or m. catarrhalis. the increase in mics of fk037 against 2 l-mrsa strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa at the mic or higher. fk037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against h-mrsa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. against the other strains, fk037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa. transmission electron microscopic  studies revealed that fk037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in mrsa after 4 h incubation.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (cxm-ax) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from january to september of 1990 and 1993. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were  obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic80 of cxm were equal to or lower against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, peptostreptococcus spp., and propionibacterium acnes, except for streptococcus pneumoniae, mic80 which was slightly higher. 2. mic90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephem-resistant e. coli and klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant h. influenzae and n. gonorrhoeae. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. from the nature of mrsa detected in those situations mrsa appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. mic90 against strains obtained from  patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. therefore, the determination of mic90  is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. antimicrobial activities of cxm against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. however, mic of cxm as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of cxm against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., h. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.

TI  == cefuroxime axetil.
AB  == cefuroxime is the first commercially-available second-generation cephalosporine to be widely used in therapy; it is a semi-synthetic cephalosporin obtained from  the 7-cephalosporanic acid nucleus of cephalosporin c. cefuroxime axetil is the acetoxyethyl ester of cefuroxime. the majority of micro-organisms associated with respiratory infections are highly sensitive to cefuroxime. these include haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and the  other streptococci (excluding group d streptococci), and moraxella catarrhalis. bacteria sensitive to cefuroxime include the enterobacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella and shigella and straphylococcus aureus (methicillin-sensitive strains). the pharmacokinetic studies show that the maximum plasma concentration of cefuroxime after oral administration of 250 mg and 500 mg of cefuroxime axetil after a meal are respectively 4.6 and 7.9 mg/l. the absolute bioavailability of tablets is 68% (extremes 63-73%) after oral administration of 500 mg cefuroxime axetil. the protein binding is 33+/-5.7%. tissue diffusion was studied in the interstitial fluid, the bronchial mucosa, the tonsils, and the bronchial secretions. cefuroxime axetil is available as capsule-shaped tablets containing 125, 250 or 500 mg. an oral suspension dosage form for paediatric purposes is also available  as granules in multidose bottles and sachets. constitution gives a suspension containing 125 mg or 250 mg cefuroxime (as cefuroxime axetil). cefuroxime axetil  is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible bacteria. indications include: lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., acute and chronic  bronchitis and pneumonia); upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., ear, nose and throat infections such as otitis media, sinusitis tonsillitis and pharyngitis); genito-urinary tract infections (e.g., pyelonephritis, cystitis and urethritis, gonorrhoea, acute uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis); and skin and soft tissue infections (e.g., furunculosis, pyoderma and impetigo). for most infections, a dose of 250 mg twice daily is appropriate.  in some urinary tract infections, 125 mg twice daily has been shown to be effective. if pneumonia is suspected or in more severe lower respiratory tract infection, doses of 500 mg bd should be used. uncomplicated gonorrhoea has been shown to respond to a single 1-g dose of cefuroxime axetil. adverse reactions to  cefuroxime have generally been mild and transient in nature (gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting).

TI  == in vitro activity of cefdinir (fk482) and ten other antibiotics against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from adult and pediatric patients.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefdinir, an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin was compared with that of cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, ampicillin, vancomycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 279 gram-positive and gram-negative recent  clinical isolates from adult and pediatric patients. cefdinir was the most active drug among the cephalosporins against oxacillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, escherichia coli and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90 0.015-2 mg/l). cefixime was the most active agent against hemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris (mic90 < 0.015-0.125 mg/l). the activity of cefpodoxime was better than that of cefixime against s. pneumoniae and oxacillin-sensitive staphylococci (mic90 0.25-8 vs. 0.5-32 mg/l), similar to  cefixime against s. pyogenes (mic90 0.06 mg/l) and not as good as cefixime against h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, klebsiella spp. and proteus spp. (mic90 <  0.015-0.25 vs. 0.125-0.5 mg/l). the activity of cefdinir was greater than that of the other cephalosporins against enterococcus faecalis (mic90 16-32 vs. > 64 mg/l). none of the cephalosporins were active against methicillin-resistant, coagulase-positive or -negative staphylococci or pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 >  64 mg/l). overall, the susceptibilities of adult and pediatric isolates were similar. kinetic kill curves demonstrated rapid and similar killing at 6 h by cefdinir, cefixime, cefpodoxime and ofloxacin. at 24 h at 1 x mic, the least regrowth was observed with cefdinir and cefpodoxime; at 2 x mic, suppression of growth was similar with all four drugs.

TI  == effect of different combinations of antibiotics on experimental septic peritonitis in rabbits.
AB  == this study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of different combinations of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of experimental septic peritonitis. two hundred rabbits, divided into ten groups of 20 rabbits each, were used. septic peritonitis was provoked in two stages: treatment of animals by mechanical lavage or antibiotics was performed during the first stage; blood cultures, isolation and identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the peritoneal cavity were performed during the second stage. the parameters assessed were survival and, in the second phase, the formation of peritoneal abscesses. the most significant finding was noted in the first phase, where diffuse peritonitis took  place, with a very high mortality rate due to bacteremia and sepsis. in both blood and pus from the peritoneal cavity cultures in all groups, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis (among the aerobes) and bacteroides fragilis, clostridium sp. and peptostreptococcus sp. (among anaerobes) were the predominant pathogens identified. high mortality rates appeared to be due to the aerobic microbes, particularly escherichia coli, whereas abscess formation was related to the anaerobes, particularly bacteroides  fragilis. all antibiotics tested were effective, whether alone or in combination. metronidazole, however, was the most effective in the reduction of intraabdominal abscesses. the lowest mortality rate was observed in animals injected with piperacillin and a combination of cefoxitin and an aminoglycoside with metronidazole. finally, good peritoneal lavage seemed to be as effective as any combination of antibiotic treatment.

TI  == [staghorn renal lithiasis treated with shock waves. bacteriologic aspects].
AB  == struvite renal stones are caused by infection of the urine with bacteria that synthesize the enzyme urease. ammonium is released by the breakdown of urea by urease, the urine becomes highly alkaline, and magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and carbonate apatite crystallize. incorporation of the infecting bacteria within the developing stone, results in a focus of infection that is resistant to conventional antimicrobial therapy, and which is manifested clinically by repeated urinary tract infection caused by persistent bacteriuria.  extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (eswl) currently is accepted as the election treatment for most renal calculi. this trial examines the bacteriologic  aspects pre and post-eswl. eighty adult patients, 47 females and 33 males, without clinical signs of urinary tract infections (uti) were submitted to urine  cultures pre and post-eswl. the first 50 patients underwent during and post-eswl, 150 blood cultures, which all proved to be negative, confirming very low risk of  generalized sepsis. no patient presented fever, chills or rigors pre or postprocedures. with respect to urine cultures 43 patients (52.5%) had a pre-eswl uti, in comparison to 49 (60%) who had a uti post-eswl. the distribution of organisms pre and post-eswl was as follows: proteus mirabilis (22/22), escherichia coli (11/11), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4/5), klebsiella pneumoniae (2/2), enterobacter cloacae (0/1), alcaligenes odorans (1/2) enterococcus faecalis (1/3), staphylococcus saprophyticus (1/2) and candida albicans (1/1). in this study 6 patients presented bacteriuria post-eswl probably due to bacteria from inside the calculi. according to these results, the risk of bacteremia seems to be very low. in 60% of staghorn renal stones we could demonstrate a bacterial  infection.

AB  == the effect of a direct electric current (10 microa) on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis was investigated. when the ends of negatively-charged intravascular catheters were placed in nutrient agar seeded with bacteria, circular zones of inhibition of bacterial growth were observed around the catheters. the zones ranged from 6 to 16 mm in diameter according to the organism under test. zones of inhibition were not produced around positively-charged catheters. bacteria colonising the surfaces of catheters were  similarly affected by the application of a 10 microa electric current. a negative electric current applied to colonised catheters for 4 to 24 h significantly reduced the number of adherent viable organisms as compared to controls. the results demonstrated that a constant electric current of low amperage might be used to reduce bacterial colonisation of intravascular catheters. this may offer  a novel means of protecting catheters and other prosthetic devices from associated sepsis in vivo.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefepime: a multicentre study.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cefepime, a new broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin, was evaluated in vitro against 1757 recent clinical gram-positive  and gram-negative isolates. cefepime was active at low concentrations (mic50 values < or = 0.06 mg/l and mic90 values < or = 0.12 mg/l) against non-cephalosporinase-producing enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp. and shigella spp.). for klebsiella pneumoniae, mics were between 0.016 and 16 mg/l; the highest mic values were observed for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. against enterobacteriaceae, such as cephalosporinase producing enterobacter cloacae, mics were < or = 0.5 mg/l, but mics against cephalosporinase hyperproducing strains were generally higher. ticarcillin-sensitive strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by cefepime concentrations of 0.5-16 mg/l, while cefepime mics were 8-64 mg/l for strains resistant to ticarcillin. the cefepime mic50 value for haemophilus spp. including many resistant to amoxycillin, was 0.03 mg/l. against methicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococcus aureus, cefepime mics were 0.5-16 mg/l; mics against methicillin-resistant staphylococci were 16- > 128 mg/l). against methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, cefepime mic values were 0.03-16 mg/l; corresponding values for methicillin-resistant strains  were 2-128 mg/l. streptococci (groups a, c and g) were sensitive to cefepime with mics ranging from < or = 0.008-2 mg/l (mic50, 0.03 mg/l; mic90, 0.25 mg/l). the activity of cefepime against group b streptococci and pneumococci were comparable, with mic50 values of 0.12 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively, and mic90 values of 0.03 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. most enterococci and all listeria monocytogenes strains had mics > or = 32 mg/l.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == iontophoresis and chloride-containing compounds: parameters required for killing.
AB  == fungi, and gram-positive and gram-negative organisms were susceptible to iontophoretic killing in simple media. iontophoresis did not depend on electrode  type but did require chloride-containing compounds in the medium. all organisms could be killed efficiently if chloride-containing compounds (for example sodium  chloride and calcium chloride) were present in physiological concentrations. effectiveness of iontophoretic killing could be reduced by nonphysiologically elevated concentrations of other substances (for example creatinine and albumin). the data suggest that iontophoresis should function well in urine, since chloride-containing compounds are present in adequate concentrations even if some naturally occurring compounds, such as creatinine or albumin, are elevated.

AB  == during a multicentre study performed in 26 french hospitals, 287 (3.2%) of 9038 enterobacteriaceae isolated, mainly enterobacter spp., serratia spp., citrobacter spp. and klebsiella spp. were classified as ceftriaxone resistant on the basis of an mic > 4 mg/l or the presence of an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase was present mainly in klebsiella pneumoniae (65  strains, 10.2%) and very rarely in escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter spp. and enterobacter spp. the extended-spectrum  beta-lactamases conferred low-level resistance to ceftriaxone in nearly 60% of the strains harbouring them, emphasizing the need for routine testing for the presence of these enzymes. among transconjugants three types of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase were identified. those resembling tem-3 were the most common, but  tem-21, and shv-4 were also found. clavulanate and to a lesser extent sulbactam inhibited all the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases encountered in this study.

AB  == twenty-three foals, between 1 and 7 months old, with signs of acute respiratory distress, were examined at the veterinary medical teaching hospital (vmth), university of california, davis, between 1984 and 1989. characteristic features included sudden onset of severe respiratory distress and tachypnea, cyanosis unresponsive to nasal oxygen, pyrexia, hypoxemia, hypercapneic respiratory acidosis, poor response to treatment, and histopathologic lesions of bronchiolitis and bronchointerstitial pneumonia. seven of the 23 foals were normal before the onset of respiratory distress, 3 foals were found dead, and 13  foals were being treated for respiratory tract infections at the time of presentation. laboratory data obtained for 13 horses showed increased plasma fibrinogen concentration (630.7 +/- 193 mg/dl), leukocytosis (18,607 +/- 7,784/microl), and neutrophilia (13,737 +/- 8,211/microl). thoracic radiographs showed a diffuse increase in interstitial and bronchointerstitial pulmonary opacity and, in 5 foals, an alveolar pulmonary pattern of increased density was also seen. in 3 foals heavy interstitial infiltration proceeded to a coalescing nodular radiographic appearance. microbiological culture of tracheobronchial aspirates (tba) from 9 foals yielded bacterial growth, but no one bacterial species was consistently isolated. microbiological culture of postmortem specimens of the lung from 6 foals yielded growth of bacteria that included escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, rhodococcus equi, or beta-hemolytic streptococcus spp. tracheobronchial aspirates from 4 foals and lung samples collected from a further 4 foals at necropsy yielded no bacterial growth. cultures were not taken from two foals premortem or  postmortem. virologic examination of tba, lung tissue, or pooled organ tissue from 12 foals was negative. viral culture of tba from 1 foal showed cytopathic effects and positive immunofluorescence for equine herpes virus type ii (ehv-ii). in addition to the 3 foals that were found dead, 11 foals died or were euthanatized. pathologic lesions were limited to the lungs in 50% of the foals; the remainder also had bowel lesions suggestive of hypoxic injury. the predominant histopathologic pulmonary lesions included bronchiolitis, bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial hyperplasia, and necrosis. many bronchioles were filled with mucoid and fibrinocellular exudate. the peribronchiolar interstitium and adjacent alveolar spaces were also infiltrated with inflammatory cells and contained proteinaceous edema fluid. type ii cell hyperplasia and hyaline membrane formation were observed in the majority of foals and in 2 foals alveolar multinucleate giant cells were also present.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [the antimicrobial activity of cefteram against recently clinically detected and  isolated strains].
AB  == in order to examine antibiotic activities of cefteram (cftm), its minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic's) and those of other cephem drugs were determined against clinically isolated strains received from july 1990 to june 1991 and from july 1992 to february 1993 from medical facilities throughout the country and against clinically isolated strains detected in our laboratory in samples from patients with various infectious diseases. the obtained results are summarized below. 1. no cftm-resistant strains were found among beta-streptococci, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae or even when found, they were present in extremely low proportions. 2. it appeared that streptococcus pneumoniae insensitive or resistant to beta-lactams, as well as cephems-resistant strains of escherichia coli were increasing. the former included benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae  (pisp) of pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), and the presence of the latter suggests the possibility of the existence of "extended broad-spectrum beta-lactamase" producing strains. the mic's of beta-lactams against the above pisp or prsp, and against cephems-resistant e. coli tended to be high, but those  of cftm were relatively low (in most cases). 3. proportions of strains resistant  to cephems, including cftm among citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and providencia rettgeri were  high, and in addition, the existence of these cephem resistant species suggests an increase in multiple drug resistant strains that show resistance to new quinolone drugs. 4. as mentioned above, cftm is by no means a perfect drug or utility drug and its antimicrobial activities do not cover some recent isolates with multiple drug resistance. except problems encountered with so-called "attenuated" strains of bacteria, increases in resistance can only be observed at a level of mic90's, and as far as mic80's are concerned, cftm still is as active  as before and may be used in the treatment of most infections we encounter in normal medical practices.

AB  == the methodology for isolating rat peritoneal mast cell was established. the main  pathogenic bacterial ultrasonicates of respiratory infection in guangzhou area have been examined for their ability to release histamine from purified rat peritoneal mast cells. the results were as following: (1) 7 pathogenic bacteria can cause direct release of histamine from rat mast cells. the most effective histamine releasers were p. mira (histamine release percent is 26.89% +/- 6.70%), strep. pneu (24.16% +/- 3.71%), e. coli (20.40% +/- 4.83%) and k. pneu (17.91% +/- 4.60%). (2) histamine release initiated by bacterial ultrasonicates was completed within 30 minutes e. coli differed from k. pneu induced histamine release was independent of its dose. (3) the products of k. pneu did not induce histamine release directly and bacterial hemolysin may play a potent role in bacteria-induced release of histamine. our findings provide some evidence for mechanism by which respiratory bacterial infection can precipitate or exacerbate  attacks of bronchial asthma.

AB  == bacteria that commonly cause infections of the normal urinary tract (eg escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus saprophyticus) do so because they possess specific urovirulence factors. adhesions of various types (often fimbriae) seem to be the most important of these. in e. coli several other factors have been recognized, and sub-sets of defined uropathogenic clones exist. on the other hand, urovirulence determinants are less easy to distinguish in species such as s. epidermidis and klebsiella pneumoniae, that rarely cause such  infections, or are pathogenic only in the presence of some abnormality or deficiency in host defences.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (caz) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout japan in 1989 and 1991. those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic90 of caz in 1991 were markedly higher against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. also, among other bacteria such as providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to caz were observed in high proportions. however, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of caz on streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella spp, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobic gpc (gram-positive cocci). 2. among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. it appears therefore, that caz failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these  strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. antimicrobial activities of caz on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. however, it was also demonstrated that caz maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. when it is additionally taken into account that caz is one of those limited drugs with activity against p. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that caz still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.

TI  == analysis of polar lipids from some representative enterobacteria, plesiomonas and acinetobacter by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry.
AB  == fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (fab-ms) was used to analyse lipid extracts of bacteria to assess its usefulness for analysing anionic phospholipids of potential chemotaxonomic value. the following micro-organisms were tested: acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae (2 strains), escherichia coli (3 strains), hafnia alvei, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, plesiomonas shigelloides, proteus mirabilis (3 strains), serratia liquefaciens and serratia marcescens. negative-ion spectra provide data for twenty-seven major carboxylate  anions (m/z 209-325) and for thirty-seven major phospholipid anions (m/z 645-774). generally, the largest carboxylate peaks were due to 16:1, 16:0, cyc17  and 18:1 while the largest phospholipid anion peaks were due to pe(32:1), pe(33:1), pe(34:1), pe(34:2), pg(30:2), pg(31:2), pg(32:2), pg(34:1) and ps(33:0). however, quantitative differences were observed. for example, acinetobacter lacked pe (33:1) but had exceptionally high peaks at m/z 748, ps(33:0), and m/z 281, octadecanoate. unknown 'carboxylate' peaks were detected at m/z 254, 256, 261, 268, 282 and 301. in some cases, unknown peaks appeared to  constitute possible homologous series being separated by delta m/z of 14(identical to methylene). for chemotaxonomic purposes, the complexity of the data required numerical analysis. using the pearson coefficient of linear correlation, as a measure of association, it was possible to compare all strains  analysed. typical results for strain comparisons were as follows: ent. cloacae vs ent. cloacae, r = 0.90 (ent. cloacae vs ac. calcoaceticus, r = 0.46). thus fab-ms represents an excellent means of obtaining large quantities of data on polar lipids of a range of bacterial isolates, which may be suitable for chemotaxonomic purposes.

TI  == survey of the prevalence of beta-lactamases amongst 1000 gram-negative bacilli isolated consecutively at the royal london hospital.
AB  == beta-lactamase expression was examined in 1000 consecutive gram-negative bacilli  isolated from urine, wound swab, sputum or blood specimens received at the microbiology laboratory of the royal london hospital. this survey, performed between january and april, 1991, followed a similar study undertaken in early 1982. the distribution of species was similar in the two surveys, except that the proportion of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates had increased from 11% in 1982 to 17.5% in the present study. this increase was balanced by a decreased proportion  of enterobacteria. amongst plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, tem-1 (especially),  tem-2, shv-1 and oxa types continued to predominate in enterobacteria. their frequency in escherichia coli was unchanged (46% in 1991 compared with 43% in 1982), but had increased from 5 to 22% amongst proteus mirabilis isolates. an apparent decrease in their frequency amongst enterobacter cloacae isolates, from  48% in 1982 to 17% in 1991, probably reflected changes to strain prevalence rather than enzyme prevalence. plasmid type beta-lactamases were present in fewer than 2% of p. aeruginosa isolates in both surveys. in the present study, chromosomal beta-lactamase derepression (constitutive hyperproduction) was detected in 10/76 isolates of e. cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, serratia spp. and morganella morganii, and in 2/170 p. aeruginosa isolates. these proportions were increased, compared with those seen the 1982 survey, though the significance was borderline (p approximately 0.05; chi 2 test). extended-spectrum plasmid mediated beta-lactamases, unknown in 1982, were  found in 11/70 klebsiellae pneumoniae isolates in the present study. ten of these organisms, representing at least five distinct strains, produced tem-10 enzyme, encoded by a plasmid of c. 90 kb; the remaining organism had an unidentified shv-derived enzyme.

TI  == a descriptive analysis of urine cultures: pure versus mixed isolates.
AB  == out of 5,670 urine cultures performed in 1989, 1,448 positive cultures with unique results were analyzed. of these 1,448, 67% were pure cultures, and 50% had at least one isolate with a colony count greater than 100,000 colony forming units/ml. pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and diphtheroids were more likely (p < 0.01) to occur in mixed than pure culture, while escherichia coli was more likely to occur in pure than mixed culture. the most common organism combinations were diphtheroids-coagulase negative staphylococcus (30 cultures), e. faecalis-coagulase negative staphylococcus (28), e. faecalis-p. aeruginosa (13),  k. pneumoniae-p. aeruginosa (9), and e. coli-p. aeruginosa (9).

TI  == [antibacterial activities of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == to investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (siso), mics of siso as well as other aminoglycosides (ags) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. results are summarized below: 1. no siso-resistant strains were observed among isolates of escherichia coli, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii. 2. in comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was higher, and siso-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the mrsa. also, siso-resistant strains of serratia marcescens increased. however, the rate of siso-resistant strains of  pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris, siso-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. mics of siso against providencia rettgeri and providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of siso was weak against genus providencia. 4. for comparison, according to mics of ofloxacin and imipenem, new  quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa. 5. siso is still one of the useful ags in the 1990's since it  maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.

TI  == urinary tract infection in acute spinal cord injury.
AB  == preservation of renal function and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections is the ultimate goal of any method of neurogenic bladder management in spinal cord injury patients. method--the hospital courses of fifty such patients  admitted to our rehabilitation department from august 1989 to august 1990 were studied according to age, gender, spinal cord injury level, method of bladder drainage on admission and upon discharge, type of urinary tract infections and results of bladder management were documented. results--forty-five men and ten women were studied. mean age of males was forty and females, forty-two. the commonest cause of injury was road traffic accident followed by accidents at work place. fifty-three percent had cervical cord injuries, thirteen percent thoracolumbar and sixteen percent lumbo sacral injuries. seventy-eight percent had an indwelling foley catheter upon admission. upon discharge eighty-two percent of spinal cord injury patients were able to void with/without tapping and compression. there were a total of one hundred and forty-three urinary tract infections in our study group. all positive urine cultures had greater than or equal to 100,000 cfu/ml. the commonest organisms causing urinary tract infection  were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus  mirabilis. conclusion--for bacteria to produce disease in the urinary tract, they must gain access and colonise the uroepithelium, induce inflammation and tissue damage. the indwelling catheter provides a direct access to the uroepithelium, making bacteriuria and subsequent infection inevitable. impaired voiding and sensation in spinal cord injury patients provides an excellent reservoir for the  multiplication of bacteria, tissue invasion and recurrent urinary tract infection. hence current methods of neurogenic bladder management have to focus on attaining a catheter-free status as soon as possible; relevant antibiotic therapy and careful attention to individual urinary tract problems to reduce morbidity and improve on spinal cord injury patient's future. although spinal cord injury patients are described, the material covered is applicable to any type of neurogenic bladder dysfunction.

TI  == brain abscess in infants.
AB  == brain abscesses are rare in infants and their clinical presentation is specific for this age group. seven cases of brain abscess in infants aged 2-11 months are  reported. the underlying cause was meningitis in four, sepsis in two, and unknown in one. gram-negative organisms were cultured in 6 patients. the abscess size was 5 cm or more in five cases; in four there were multiple lesions. two abscesses were aspirated and irrigated; four particularly large lesions were drained and repeatedly aspirated and irrigated. one craniotomy was done. there were two deaths, one in the postoperative period and the other 6 months after discharge. follow-up information is available for four children, showing a good result in only one of them. formation of an abscess should be diagnosed early, and close ultrasound monitoring or ct scanning in infants with bacterial meningitis and sepsis is essential. the prognosis in cases in which large/multiple abscesses develop is poor.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activities of ticarcillin alone and ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid against beta-lactamase producing and non-producing microorganisms.
AB  == a total of 818 clinical bacterial isolates were tested for the production of beta-lactamase by rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method and for the susceptibility to ticarcillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid (2 micrograms/ml) by agar dilution method. these included 83 strains of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), 31 of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), 49 of neisseria gonorrhoeae, 58 of haemophilus influenzae, 112  of escherichia coli, 118 of klebsiella pneumoniae, 58 of proteus mirabilis, 30 of proteus vulgaris, 60 of serratia marcescens, 113 of enterobacter cloacae, 60 of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 46 of bacteroides fragilis. the results revealed that  46.6% of p. mirabilis, 53.4% of h. influenzae, 57.1% of n. gonorrhoeae, 80% of p. vulgaris, 83.9% of mrsa, 85.6% of mssa, 87.5% of e. coli, 91.7% of s. marcescens, 95.7% of b. fragilis, 98.2% of e. cloacae, and 100% of k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa strains produced beta-lactamase. in general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to ticarcillin than beta-lactamase producers.  the ranges of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ticarcillin for beta-lactamase nonproducers of mssa, mrsa, h. influenzae, e. coli, p. vulgaris, s. marcescens, e. cloacae, b. fragilis and beta-lactamase producers of mssa, h. influenzae strains were all within the in vitro susceptible range. the presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the antibacterial activity of ticarcillin against beta-lactamase producers of mrsa, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris and b. fragilis strains. clavulanic acid had no synergistic activity for ticarcillin against s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa and e. cloacae.

TI  == klebsiella aerogenes urease gene cluster: sequence of ured and demonstration that four accessory genes (ured, uree, uref, and ureg) are involved in nickel metallocenter biosynthesis.
AB  == the region located immediately upstream from the klebsiella aerogenes urease structural genes was sequenced and shown to possess an open reading frame capable of encoding a 29.8-kda peptide. deletions were generated in this gene, denoted ured, and in each of the genes (uree, uref, and ureg) located immediately downstream of the three structural genes. transformation of the mutated plasmids  into escherichia coli resulted in high levels of urease expression, but the enzyme was inactive (deletions in ured, uref, or ureg) or only partially active (deletions in uree). ureases were purified from the recombinant cells and shown to be identical to control enzyme when analyzed by gel filtration chromatography  and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; however, in every  case the activity levels correlated to nickel contents as analyzed by atomic absorption analysis. ured, uree, uref, and ureg peptides were tentatively identified by gel electrophoretic comparison of mutant and control cell extracts, by in vivo expression of separately cloned genes, or by in vitro transcription-translation analyses; the assignments were confirmed for uree and ureg by amino-terminal sequencing. the latter peptides (apparent m(r)s, 23,900 and 28,500) were present at high levels comparable to those of the urease subunits, whereas the amounts of uref (apparent m(r), 27,000) and ured (apparent  m(r), 29,300) were greatly reduced, perhaps because of the lack of good ribosome  binding sites in the regions upstream of these open reading frames. these results demonstrate that all four accessory genes are necessary for the functional incorporation of the urease metallocenter.

AB  == antibiotic activities (mics) of ceftriaxone (ctrx) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of  other cephems. 1. when compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated mic90s of ctrx: staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. no changes were observed in mic90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and peptostreptococcus spp. 2. the mic90 of ctrx to s. pneumoniae was high because a  large number of benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) was present among this species. the mic80 to bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. other oxime-type cephems also had high mics against the above mentioned bacteria. therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as ctrx against pisp and b. fragilis group. 3. sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), cephamycin-resistant  as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. some of there resistant bacteria  are also ctrx-resistant, and ctrx had insufficient activities against them. 4. with regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with ctrx-resistance from year to year,  the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989  and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. it appears that those strains resistant to cephems including ctrx are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. ctrx, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. furthermore, considering that ctrx is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that ctrx is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.

TI  == review of the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == cefprozil is a newer oral cephalosporin with a spectrum of activity against organisms that include gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. a review of published data shows that cefprozil is active (susceptibility, less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml; moderate susceptibility, 16 micrograms/ml; resistance, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) against gram-positive species such as  streptococci, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, and listeria monocytogenes;  it may have marginal activity against some enterococci. among the gram-negative species, cefprozil has activity against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. for anaerobic species, cefprozil has activity against clostridial species, including clostridium difficile, peptostreptococci, and possibly bacteroides melaninogenicus and eubacterium. the  activity of cefprozil is generally greater than that of cephalexin and generally  similar to that of cefaclor. in these reports, cefprozil showed more in vitro activity than cephalexin and cefaclor against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci, beta-lactamase-positive methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and c. difficile, although the clinical significance of some of these differences has yet to be studied.

AB  == a multicenter randomized study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of ofloxacin with that of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (tmp/smx) in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection in adults. patients were randomized to receive either oral ofloxacin 200 mg daily for three days (102 patients), or oral tmp/smx 160 mg/800 mg twice daily for seven days (100 patients). the pathogen was eradicated in 73 (97.3%) of the 75 evaluable patients receiving ofloxacin and in 66 (97.1%) of the 68 evaluable patients receiving tmp/smx. the most frequently isolated pathogens were escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis. more urinary pathogens were susceptible to ofloxacin than to tmp/smx, although this difference was not statistically significant. the clinical cure rate for patients receiving ofloxacin was 93.3%, with 4% improved and 2.7% failed. for patients receiving tmp/smx, the clinical cure rate was 86.4%, with 12.1% improved and 1.5% failed. side effects were reported by 29.7% of the patients receiving ofloxacin and by 40.4% of the patients receiving tmp/smx. drug-related adverse experiences, as determined by the investigators, occurred in 5% of the ofloxacin patients and in 15.2% of the tmp/smx patients, a statistically significant difference. no patients receiving ofloxacin, compared with three patients receiving tmp/smx, discontinued therapy because of an adverse reaction. these results indicate that short-course ofloxacin is as effective as tmp/smx in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection. ofloxacin therapy is also better tolerated than tmp/smx.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a c-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. cefquinome inhibited members of the enterobacteriaceae at less than or  equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, salmonella shigella, proteus mirabilis, morganella, and providencia. although most citrobacter freundii and enterobacter  cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) greater than  16 micrograms/ml]. serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. the majority of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. most enterococci had cefquinome mics of 4-8 micrograms/ml. cefquinome was extremely active against group-a streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae with mics less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. it inhibited some enterobacter and citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of klebsiella, branhamella, and pseudomonas, but  it was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-5, and tem-9. its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) for most species except for enterobacter were within a dilution of mics.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach to evaluate efficacy of amikacin. reevaluation of in vitro mic break points in disc susceptibility test].
AB  == antimicrobial activities of amikacin (amk) against 269 strains of various clinical isolates obtained in 1989 were determined and the reliability of the amk disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics was studied. in addition, clinical significance of various systems for the interpretation of the  disc tests was evaluated to determine more useful method in the evaluation of clinical efficacy of amk. included in the study were a 3 category system of nccls, a 4 category system used in japan, and the system proposed by the british  society for antimicrobial chemotherapy. in this study, mics were determined using the mueller-hinton agar containing 50 mg/l of ca and 25 mg/l of mg at an inoculum level of 10(3-4) cfu/ml. mic80 values of amk against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 6.25 and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. those against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, enterobactor aerogenes, and citrobacter spp. were less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. mic values against pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens  were both less than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml. the disc susceptibility test  was carried out according to the instruction in the showa disc manual. inhibition zones obtained with the disc method were compared with mic values. the results of amk disc susceptibility test obtained either with 30 micrograms discs or 10 micrograms discs were well correlated with mics, indicating that the disc method  was reliable in estimating approximate values of mics (r = -0.807 to -0.897, p less than 0.01 in both instances). in the 4 category classification system currently used in japan, the break points in mic values of amk proposed are (+3)  mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (+2) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, and (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml. the results obtained with showa 30 micrograms discs and 30 micrograms discs prepared in this laboratory showed false positive results in 13% and 10.8% of the samples, and false negative results in 1.5% and 3.3%, respectively. in the 3 category classification system of nccls, the mic break points proposed are defined sensitive (s) for mic less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml and resistant (r) for mic greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. in this study, the 30 micrograms disc tests using the above-mentioned 2 different types of discs resulted in false positive responses in 6.3% and 5.2% of the samples tested and false negative results in 1.1% and 1.9% of the samples, respectively.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == the aminothiazolyl-cephalosporin ru 29 246 is the active metabolite of the prodrug-pivaloyl-oxyethyl-ester hr 916. ru 29 246 in vitro activity includes a wide range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. against methicillin-sensitive staphylococci ru 29 246 (mic90 of 0.25 approximately 2 micrograms/ml) was clearly more active than cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefixime and ceftibuten, but slightly less active than cefdinir. ru 29 246 inhibited hemolytic streptococci of the serogroups a, b, c and g as well as penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations similar to cefdinir, cefpodoxime and cefuroxime (mic90 less than or equal to 0.13 micrograms/ml), but less than the other oral cephalosporins investigated (cefixime, cefaclor and ceftibuten). mic90s of ru 29 246 against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, salmonella spp., shigella spp.,  proteus mirabilis and haemophilus influenzae were less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. only ru 29 246 and cefdinir demonstrated moderate activity against acinetobacter baumannii (mic90 greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). most strains of pseudomonas spp., serratia marcescens, enterobacter spp., hafnia alvei and bacteroides spp. were resistant to ru 29 246. ru 29 246 killed escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus at a rate of 99% to 99.9% at concentrations of two times mic. the ph value of the medium (range 5.5 to 8.5) and the inoculum size (range 10(5) to 10(7) cfu/ml) had no or only low influence on the antibacterial activity of ru 29 246. ru 29 246 is a broad spectrum cephalosporin including in its activity both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens and therefore--depending on the bioavailability of its prodrug--looks promising as to its therapeutic perspective.

TI  == long-acting chloramphenicol versus intravenous ampicillin for treatment of bacterial meningitis.
AB  == in most developing countries, bacterial meningitis (bm) is associated with a high case-fatality rate. the search for a simple, convenient, and inexpensive antibiotic treatment remains a priority. in this study, a non-blinded, multicentre, randomised clinical trial of 528 cases of bm was done in two hospitals in mali and niger, between march, 1989, and may, 1990, to see whether a double injection of long-acting chloramphenicol (on admission to hospital and 48  h later) is as effective as a course of intravenous ampicillin (8 days, 4 times a day). the cumulative case-fatality rate on day 4 (principal end-point) among the  chloramphenicol (254 patients) and ampicillin (274) groups were, respectively, 28% and 24.5% (relative risk 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.86-1.52). no outbreak occurred during the study period. the hospital case-fatality rate was 33.1%. main risk factors for death were associated with clinical condition on admission--ie, altered consciousness, convulsions, or dehydration. the case-fatality rates were 13% (21/161) for neisseria meningitidis, 36.1% (48/133)  for haemophilus influenzae, and 67% (77/115) for streptococcus pneumoniae. in a multiple logistic regression model, controlling for the differential distribution of potential risk factors (including bacterial species), there was no difference  between treatment groups. our findings suggest that long-acting chloramphenicol is a useful first-line presumptive treatment for bm in high-incidence countries.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ro 09-1428, a new catechol-type parenteral cephalosporin, was compared to that of ceftazidime, e-1040, cefpirome and cefepime against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. ro 09-1428 inhibited  group a streptococci at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, and group b, c  and g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.5 micrograms/ml, whereas for staphylococcus aureus ro 09-1428 had mics of 8-16 micrograms/ml similar to ceftazidime and e-1040. against pseudomonas aeruginosa ro 09-1428 was the most active agent, inhibiting isolates at less than or equal to 0.12-2 micrograms/ml,  and inhibited ceftazidime-resistant isolates. the majority of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, providencia, salmonella and shigella were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml as with the other cephalosporins. for most citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae  ro 09-1428 had higher mics of 4-16 micrograms/ml; most ceftazidime-resistant isolates of these species were resistant. anaerobes, enterococci and listeria monocytogenes were resistant to ro 09-1428. ro 09-1428 was not hydrolyzed by tem-1, tem-2, staphylococcus aureus pc-1, moraxella catarrhalis bro-1, enterobacter p-99, pseudomonas aeruginosa sabath-abraham or klebsiella beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-7 and tem-9. ro 09-1428 was markedly less active at an acid ph.

TI  == activity of some antiseptics against urinary tract pathogens growing as biofilms  on silicone surfaces.
AB  == the activity of chlorhexidine, mandelic acid and a mandelic/lactic mixture were tested against biofilms of four species of gram-negative nosocomial organisms that commonly infect the catheterized urinary tract. cells growing on silicone discs were exposed to concentrations of agents used in bladder instillation. citrobacter diversus biofilms proved to be sensitive to all three agents. pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae all survived  well in chlorhexidine but their viability was significantly reduced by the mandelic acid formulations. these results suggest that bladder instillations of mandelic acid or mandelic/lactic acids would be more effective than chlorhexidine in eliminating biofilms from catheter surfaces.

TI  == efficacy and safety of oral cefixime therapy in common infectious diseases in children.
AB  == twenty-nine children, including 20 boys and 9 girls, were enrolled in an open trial of oral cefixime therapy for common pediatric infectious diseases. patients aged between 0.5 month and 12 years with a mean +/- standard deviation of 2.3 +/- 2.8 years. the diagnoses included 10 of acute otitis media, 2 of purulent rhinitis, 4 of acute enterocolitis, and 13 of urinary tract infection. most children received 6-12 mg/kg/day of cefixime granules, orally twice daily for more than five days. all 10 cases (100%) of acute otitis media and 2 cases of purulent rhinitis were either cured, or improved by oral cefixime treatment. none of them was microbiologically evaluable. four cases (100%) of acute enterocolitis, 3 due to salmonella group b, one due to shigella flexneri, were also successfully treated with bacteria eradication. however, the cure rate of 13 cases of urinary tract infection was only 85% (11/13). seven escherichia coli and 4 proteus mirabilis infections were eradicated, whereas one each of enterobacter  cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae infections did not respond to treatment; these  two cases had a complicated course. the overall cure and improvement rate was 93%. although five patients had transient episodes of mild diarrhea, no significant adverse reaction was observed. in summary, oral cefixime given twice  daily was effective and safe in the treatment of a variety of common infectious diseases in pediatric patients.

TI  == antibacterial properties of human amniotic membranes.
AB  == amniotic membranes are widely used in a multitude of surgical applications and have been shown to reduce bacterial counts and promote healing in infected wounds. antibacterial properties of amniotic fluid are well documented and the presence of many potentially antibacterial factors has been demonstrated. no such factors have yet been found in amniotic membranes. we have applied a direct disc-diffusion susceptibility test to try to establish the possible existence of  such a factor. amniotic membranes did not inhibit five bacterial species when tested at 3 x 10(6) and 3 x 10(8) colony forming units/ml. however, complete growth inhibition of all organisms was seen immediately under the amniotic membrane discs. these results support the hypothesis that the antimicrobial effect of amniotic membranes in vitro is due to their close adherence to the wound surface.

TI  == differentiation of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides and haemophilus species in gram-stained direct smears.
AB  == the accuracy of examination of the gram-stained direct smear to classify presumptively gram-negative rods into three morphotype groups, that is, (a) enteric bacteria, (b) pseudomonas, and (c) bacteroides or haemophilus, was evaluated. randomly selected clinical strains (4-9) each of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, ps. aeruginosa, b. fragilis, and h. influenzae were used to produce peritonitis or subcutaneous abscesses in mice. a  gram-stained direct smear was prepared from exudate collected from each animal. the direct smears were examined to classify bacteria observed into one of the three morphotype groups. the percent accuracy was 82, 56, and 95, respectively, and 76 overall. the assumption was made that classification was based primarily on differences in length and width of the organisms. to test this hypothesis, we  prepared scanning electron photomicrographs from each specimen of exudate and measured the lengths and widths of bacteria. examination of the gram-stained direct smear was more accurate for classification of enteric bacteria, h. influenzae, or b. fragilis. electron microscopy was more accurate for classification of ps. aeruginosa. the higher length-width radio should be helpful in recognizing ps. aeruginosa in direct smears.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo evaluation of ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with high antipseudomonal activity.
AB  == ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with a catechol moiety attached at position 7 of the cephalosporin ring, showed high in vitro activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and streptococcus pyogenes, with mics for 90% of strains tested (mic90s) of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml. morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, citrobacter freundii, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited with mic90s of less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml. serratia marcescens was less susceptible to ro 09-1428, with a mic90 of 25 micrograms/ml. the most distinctive feature of ro 09-1428 was its potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus, with mic90s of 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. most of the ceftazidime-resistant strains of p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, and c. freundii were  inhibited by ro 09-1428, while those of s. marcescens were resistant at a concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. ro 09-1428 was more active than ceftazidime  against staphylococci. pbp 3 was the most sensitive target in e. coli and p. aeruginosa. the response to ferric iron in growth medium suggests that ro 09-1428 may be taken up by transport mechanisms similar to those of other catechol cephalosporins. in accordance with its in vitro activity, ro 09-1428 activity was equal to or greater than ceftazidime activity in efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice. the results indicate that ro 09-1428 is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with advantages over ceftazidime in its activity against p. aeruginosa, staphylococci, and ceftazidime-resistant strains of c. freundii and e. cloacae.

TI  == antimicrobial effects of lomefloxacin in vitro.
AB  == the mic of lomefloxacin was determined for 554 isolates from the urinary tract. some of the more resistant strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied in a dynamic in-vitro model in order to study dosing strategies. the model simulated, in mueller-hinton broth, the profile of plasma lomefloxacin concentrations in volunteers. bacteria were exposed to a range of lomefloxacin concentration profiles achievable by oral dosing. the first dose of lomefloxacin was rapidly bactericidal in a dose-dependent manner for all strains. on re-exposure, a dose-dependent inhibitory effect was observed. drug-resistant mutants were readily isolated from all bacteria tested on lomefloxacin-containing plates. these occurred at a high frequency in p. aeruginosa (10(-1)), but less frequently in k. pneumoniae (10(-3)). p. mirabilis (10(-5)), and e. coli (10(-6)). the number of resistant mutants isolated tended to be lower with use of higher drug concentrations. the results suggest that lomefloxacin dosing regimens ensuring maintenance of a high serum concentration: mic ratio will result in maximal antibacterial effects and minimal problems with resistant strains.

AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (cpfx), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of cpfx against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. the clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. interpreting mic level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. when activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, cpfx expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (oflx) and norfloxacin (nflx) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of cpfx against bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of oflx, and cpfx had similar activity against staphylococcus aureus to oflx. 2. in comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, cpfx was inferior to amoxicillin (ampc) against e. faecalis and inferior to ampc and cefaclor (ccl) against peptostreptococcus spp.  against all other bacterial species, however, cpfx expressed superior antibacterial potency to ampc and ccl. 3. scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to cpfx were observed among the s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. faecium, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of e. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of gr69153, a new long-acting cephalosporin.

TI  == characterization of the helicobacter pylori urease and purification of its subunits.
AB  == helicobacter pylori (formerly campylobacter pylori) is the causative agent of gastritis in man. helicobacter pylori cells contain a large amount of an extremely active urease (e.c.3.5.1.5). this enzyme is suspected to be a virulence factor since the ammonium ion produced from urea may be responsible for tissue injury and/or survival of h. pylori in the gastric environment. helicobacter pylori urease, native relative molecular mass approximately 600,000, was purified by agarose gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. deae-purified urease is highly active and has a km of 0.48 mm for urea. the enzyme has a pi of 5.93 and is active from ph 4.0 to 10.0, with an optimum at ph 8.0. the purified urease contains nickel and is composed of two protein subunits, with relative molecular  masses of 66,000 and 31,000. the subunits were separated and purified and the first 30 n-terminal amino acid residues were determined. a remarkably close relationship was found between both h. pylori urease subunits and jack bean (canavalia ensiformis) urease, the subunit of which is a single 840 amino acid polypeptide. this subunit is also largely identical to the high molecular mass subunits of the ureases of klebsiella aerogenes and proteus mirabilis, evidence that these four ureases are derived from a common ancestral protein.

TI  == colobronchial fistula: a rare complication of crohn's colitis.
AB  == a 29-yr-old white woman presented with chronic pneumonia in the left lower lobe and with left pleural effusion. she was known to have inflammatory bowel disease, but she was asymptomatic under maintenance treatment with 5-asa. she received numerous antibiotic regimens according to susceptibility testing of microorganisms cultured from sputum and bronchial lavage and on an empiric basis  was also given antituberculosis treatment, but there was no clinical improvement  or change in the chest radiographic findings. sputum was repeatedly examined and  yielded, among other organisms, clostridium inocuum, enterobacter, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus. on one microscopic examination of sputum, the presence of feculent material was suspected. a subsequent gastrografin enema revealed a cologastric and colobronchial fistula between the splenic flexture of the colon and the greater curve of the stomach and the bronchial system. segmental resection of the colon and resection of the lower lobe of the left lung were performed. histologic findings of the resected colon were consistent with crohn's disease. after a long period of postoperative  recovery, the patient returned to good general health and well-being. to our knowledge, a colobronchial fistula caused by crohn's colitis has not been previously reported.

AB  == for enterobacteriaceae, mic50s and mic90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: escherichia  coli 0.12 and 0.5, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, serratia  marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. the activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. haemophilus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as n. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic50s and mic90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic50 and mic90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were generally resistant: streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (mic50 and mic90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium perfringens (mic50 and mic90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). these results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of gentamicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activities of gentamicin (gm), compared with activities of other aminoglycosides (ags) and beta-lactam antibiotics, were studied against clinical  isolates obtained during a period of july-december 1989. 1. gm-resistant strains  were noted in 24% of staphylococcus aureus, 12% of enterobacter spp., 24% of serratia marcescens, 7% of morganella morganii and 26% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, but no gm-resistant strains were observed among isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris. 2. a majority of gm-resistant strains of s. aureus were methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and a large number of gm-resistant strains of enterobacter spp. was also resistant to new quinolones. gm showed, however, strong antimicrobial activities against new quinolones-resistant strains of s. marcescens, m. morganii and p. aeruginosa. 3.  among all the isolates tested of s. marcescens, 24% were gm-resistant, 72% were tobramycin (tob)-resistant, 86% were dibekacin (dkb)-resistant and 64% were amikacin (amk)-resistant, hence the incidence of gm-resistant strains was the lowest. this tendency was also observed with p. vulgaris. however, among p. aeruginosa, 26% were gm-resistant, 14% tob-resistant, 18% dkb-resistant and 22% amk-resistant, thus the incidence rate for gm-resistance was somewhat higher. these results suggest that different ags-modification enzymes were produced by various clinical isolates under the present condition. 4. comparing the ratio of  gm-resistant strains in the present study with those in 1980 and 1983, the ratio  increased among s. aureus, while decreases were observed among enterobacter spp., s. marcescens, p. vulgaris and p. aeruginosa, indicating that a unilateral tendency of increases in gm-resistant strains did not exist among clinical isolates over the years.

TI  == purification and characterization of urease from helicobacter pylori.
AB  == urease was purified 112-fold to homogeneity from the microaerophilic human gastric bacterium, helicobacter pylori. the urease isolation procedure included a water extraction step, size exclusion chromatography, and anion exchange chromatography. the purified enzyme exhibited a km of 0.3 +/- 0.1 mm and a vmax of 1,100 +/- 200 mumols of urea hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein at 22 degrees c in 31 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.0. the isoelectric point was 5.99 +/- 0.03. molecular mass estimated for the native enzyme was 380,000 +/- 30,000 daltons, whereas subunit values of 62,000 +/- 2,000 and 30,000 +/- 1,000 were determined. the partial amino-terminal sequence (17 residues) of the large subunit of h. pylori urease (mr = 62,000) was 76% homologous with an internal sequence of the homohexameric jack bean urease subunit (mr = 90,770; takashima, k., suga, t., and mamiya, g. (1988) eur. j. biochem. 175, 151-165) and was 65% homologous with amino-terminal  sequences of the large subunits of heteropolymeric ureases from proteus mirabilis (mr = 73,000) and from klebsiella aerogenes (mr = 72,000; mobley, h. l. t., and hausinger, r. p. (1989) microbiol. rev. 53, 85-108). the amino-terminal sequence  (20 residues) of the small subunit of h. pylori urease (mr = 30,000) was 65 and 60% homologous with the amino-terminal sequences of the subunit of jack bean urease and with the mr = 11,000 subunit of p. mirabilis urease (jones, b. d., and mobley, h. l. t. (1989) j. bacteriol. 171, 6414-6422), respectively. thus, the urease of h. pylori shows similarities to ureases found in plants and other bacteria. when used as antigens in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, neither  purified urease nor an mr = 54,000 protein that co-purified with urease by size exclusion chromatography was as effective as crude preparations of h. pylori proteins at distinguishing sera from persons known either to be infected with h.  pylori or not.

TI  == the antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the blood of patients in st  thomas' hospital, 1969-1988.
AB  == we have monitored the antibiotic sensitivity of bloodstream isolates of common bacteria over a period of 20 years. among the gram-positive bacteria, the proportion of isolates of staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, erythromycin, fusidate, or gentamicin has increased marginally, while that of coagulase-negative staphylococci (mostly staph. epidermidis) has increased markedly. enterococci are becoming serially more resistant to high concentrations of aminoglycosides. the enterobacteriaceae have become considerably less sensitive to ampicillin (and amoxycillin) and trimethoprim but more sensitive to  the aminoglycosides, whilst their susceptibility to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, imipenem, meropenem and temocillin has remained constant. we have some evidence that in-vitro resistance is clinically relevant since the mortality rate rises if inappropriate antibiotics are used empirically. although  many drug regimens could be used, we are able to recommend initial therapy with a combination of gentamicin and cefuroxime for most of our patients, the exceptions being those known to be infected with resistant organisms before the onset of septicaemia.

AB  == kt3777 is a novel carbacephem antibiotic structurally identical to cefaclor (ccl), except that the sulfur atom of position 1 of the cephem nucleus has been replaced by carbon. kt3777 was investigated for in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities in comparison with ccl, cephalexin (cex) and amoxicillin. the mic50 of kt3777 ranged from 0.2 to 3.13 micrograms/ml for clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. kt3777 possessed an antibacterial spectrum and potency similar to that of ccl. however, against e. coli and k. pneumoniae, kt3777 was about twice as active as ccl. kt3777 was more active than cex against all strains tested. killing-curve studies demonstrated bactericidal activity of kt3777 at concentrations above the mic. kt3777 showed good affinity for penicillin-binding  proteins 1a, 1bs, 3 and 4 of e. coli nihj jc-2. the protective effect of kt3777 against systemic infections in mice was comparable to that of ccl with a few exceptions and about 3 to 7 times greater than that of cex. kt3777 also proved effective against localized infections such as acute pneumonia and ascending urinary tract infections in mice.

TI  == comparative in vitro and in vivo activities of piperacillin combined with the beta-lactamase inhibitors tazobactam, clavulanic acid, and sulbactam.
AB  == tazobactam (ytr-830h), a novel beta-lactamase inhibitor, was compared with clavulanic acid and sulbactam for enhancement of the activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing, piperacillin-resistant clinical isolates. piperacillin mics were determined in media containing a fixed concentration of 2  or 4 micrograms of the inhibitors per ml. the higher concentration was generally  more effective. tazobactam was superior to sulbactam in enhancing the spectrum and potency of piperacillin. although the calvulanic acid combination was more potent, tazobactam was effective for a similar spectrum of resistant gram-negative clinical isolates containing beta-lactamase. mics were reduced to the susceptible range for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp.,  salmonella spp., and shigella spp. combinations with tazobactam and sulbactam, but not clavulanic acid, were effective against morganella spp. some antagonism of the activity of piperacillin was observed with clavulanic acid but not with tazobactam or sulbactam. the inhibitors were similarly effective with piperacillin against beta-lactamase-positive staphylococcus spp. and the bacteroides fragilis group. piperacillin-tazobactam was more effective against a  broader spectrum of gram-negative enteric bacteria than ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid was. combinations with tazobactam or clavulanic acid had a broader spectrum of activity than combinations with sulbactam against bacteria that produce characterized plasmid-mediated enzymes of clinical significance. in  particular, piperacillin with tazobactam or clavulanic acid, but not with sulbactam, inhibited tem-1, tem-2, and shv-1 enzymes. in vitro activity was reflected in vivo. tazobactam and clavulanic acid were superior to sulbactam in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of piperacillin in mice infected with beta-lactamase-positive e. coli, k. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus. only combinations with tazobactam and sulbactam were effective against the morganella infection. tazobactam has a good potential for enhancing the clinical efficacy of piperacillin.

TI  == outpatient antimicrobial susceptibility: comparison with inpatient susceptibility patterns.
AB  == because specific outpatient epidemiologic data on the susceptibility of organisms are not readily available to guide empiric antibiotic therapy in the ambulatory setting, we reviewed all positive culture reports of clinical specimens (n = 935) isolated exclusively from outpatients of the eastern carolina family practice center over a 1-year period. eighty percent were from urine cultures, 12 percent  from wound cultures, and 5 percent from sputum cultures. an antibiogram was developed that showed a pattern of bacterial resistance similar to that reported  elsewhere. more than 80 percent of urinary tract infections were caused by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis. more than 50 percent of skin and soft tissue infections were caused by staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococcus species. susceptibilities of these organisms were compared with those reported by the local hospital, and antimicrobial resistance  patterns were similar, which suggests that the choice of empiric antibiotic therapy can follow susceptibility patterns derived from either inpatient or outpatient laboratories in areas with similar resistance patterns. further research into the epidemiology and susceptibility of organisms isolated from outpatients is needed. whether the susceptibility of inpatient and outpatient antimicrobial resistance found in this investigation can be extrapolated to other geographic areas remains to be determined.

TI  == in-vitro activity of cefetamet (ro 15-8074) compared with other oral agents.
AB  == the bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities of cefetamet (ro 15-8074) were compared with those of cefadroxil, cefaclor, ampicillin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol and erythromycin against a total of 400 bacterial strains isolated from nosocomial respiratory tract and auditory canal infections. the broth macrodilution method was used to determine antimicrobial susceptibility. none of the compounds was effective against pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains. cefetamet was very active against ampicillin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae. proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli strains with the minimal inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the strains tested ranging from 0.25 to 1 mg/l. cefetamet at a concentration of 8 mg/l inhibited 90% of enterobacter aerogenes and 60% of s. epidermidis strains. in biophotometric studies, subinhibitory concentrations of cefetamet greatly lengthened the lag-phase and flattened the log-phase, the extent varying with the concentrations and species tested. it did not cause detectable lysis in the stationary-phase of the cultures. adding two to 32 times inhibitory concentrations of cefetamet to middle-log cultures, no or moderate lysis occurred., except with esch. coli. this observation suggests that cefetamet is primarily bacteriostatic for some of the strains tested.

AB  == the dependence of the antibacterial activity of the two oral cephalosporins cefixime and cefaclor on pharmacokinetic properties was investigated in an in vitro model using strains of enterobacteria and a streptococcal strain. in the cultures the course of serum concentrations of the respective antibiotic was simulated. the more rapidly attained (1 h) high peak levels (17.5 micrograms/ml)  of cefaclor (500 mg dose) in no case showed an advantage over the more slowly reached (3 h) low peak levels (2.5 micrograms/ml) of cefixime (200 mg dose). cefixime was comparable to cefaclor with respect to its initial killing velocity, whereas it was generally superior with respect to maximum values for reduction of bacterial counts. due to its long elimination half-life (2.5 h) cefixime prevented regrowth for at least twice as long as cefaclor, which has a short half-life (0.7 h). as a result of its antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetic  properties cefixime can be administered less frequently than cefaclor.

(415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == [evaluation of the treatment with oral ciprofloxacin: experience with 24 patients].
AB  == we have evaluated the clinical effectiveness and possible side effects of oral ciprofloxacin therapy in 24 patients (11 females and 13 males). two episodes from overall 25 infections were excluded of clinical and microbiological evaluation but were assessed regarding possible side effects. in most patients, the clinical condition was stable at the beginning of therapy. only 3 patients had nonfatal diseases. seventeen episodes were urinary tract infections (four of them with concomitant bacteremia), four chronic osteomyelitis, and two severe soft tissue infections; 21 episodes were monomicrobial, and two polymicrobial. the isolated organisms were mostly aerobic gram negative bacilli or facultative anaerobes: e.  coli (9), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), proteus mirabilis (5), serratia marcescens  (1), klebsiella pneumoniae (1), pseudomonas stutzeri (1), and acinetobacter calcoaceticus (1). there were only two gram positive isolates: staphylococcus aureus (1) and staphylococcus epidermidis (1). the overall clinical response rate was 91%. gastrointestinal tolerance was excellent. colonization by candida or enterococcus developed in 3 cases (13%), and only one of them developed superinfection. four patients developed several nervous system abnormalities, two increased transaminase activity and one drug exanthema. ciprofloxacin appears as  an effective drug for the monotherapy of several bacterial infections, including  severe enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas infections.

TI  == [effects of sulbactam on the activity of cefoperazone against various clinical isolates].
AB  == sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz) have been used in clinical infusion at ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 in japan and u.s.a., respectively. after an administration of these drugs as a 1:1 parenteral formulation, the ratio of levels of cpz and sbt in blood was 1:1/4 to 1:1/5 for 1 to 2 hours, whereas the ratio of free, unbound drug levels was 1:1.4 to 1:1.5. in urine these drugs were excreted at a ratio between 1:1 and 1:4 during 6 hours after the infusion. antimicrobial interaction  studies using various combinations of cpz and sbt were performed to obtain information with respect to the effect of sbt on the antimicrobial activity of cpz in vivo and the most appropriate ratio of these drugs for the in vitro test system. antimicrobial activities were determined using the agar dilution method and the disk diffusion susceptibility test. sbt increased the activity of cpz against various clinical isolates tested except enterococcus faecalis. cpz-sbt at a fixed ratio of 1:1/5 significantly increased the antimicrobial activity of cpz, resulting in decreases in mic values and increases in disk inhibitory zone diameters. these drugs at ratios 1:1 to 1:3 maximized the synergistic enhancement of the activity. therefore, a fixed ratio between 1:1/5 and 1:1 would be appropriate for the in vitro antimicrobial test system using either the agar dilution method or the disk susceptibility test. based on pharmacokinetic data for cpz and sbt, results of the present study on antimicrobial activity would support that the parenteral formulation of cpz-sbt at the fixed ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 for the intravenous infusion used in japan and u.s.a., respectively, are appropriate. the effect of sbt on the activity of cpz was more marked against clinical isolates with greater production abilities of beta-lactamase than against those with less production abilities. sbt/cpz, however, exerted a synergistic effect against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus without beta-lactamase production. the mic80 of sbt/cpz (1:1) against various clinical isolates with 10(6) cfu/ml inoculum size were as follows: s. aureus 12.5 micrograms/ml, staphylococcus epidermis 3.13 micrograms/ml, and e. faecalis 50 micrograms/ml. those of gram-negative bacilli were: escherichia coli 0.20 microgram/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae 0.20 micrograms/ml, proteus mirabilis 0.78 microgram/ml, proteus vulgaris 0.78 microgram/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa 12.5 micrograms/ml, serratia marcescens 25 micrograms/ml, enterobacter spp. 3.13 micrograms/ml, citrobacter spp. 12.5 micrograms/ml and acinetobacter spp. 0.78 microgram/ml.

TI  == effects of microamperage, medium, and bacterial concentration on iontophoretic killing of bacteria in fluid.
AB  == prevention of nosocomial urinary tract infections by iontophoresis is addressed.  an iontophoretic generator was used to provide microamperage (10 to 400 microa) to vials containing either synthetic urine or supplemented synthetic urine. bacteria were added to vials, and parameters of growth, bacterial killing, and multiple electrode materials were examined. escherichia coli and proteus species  were both inhibited and killed at various microamperages and with several electrode types, the most efficient being gold-gold as the anode-cathode combination. klebsiella pneumoniae in supplemented synthetic urine was least inhibited in growth, and higher microamperage (200 to 400 microa) was most effective in killing the bacteria. bacterial growth reduction and killing were directly related to increasing microamperage and were inversely related to bacterial concentration.

AB  == we have prospectively evaluated 227 episodes of community-acquired urinary tract  infection (uti) from october 1st to december, 15th, 1987. the urine samples, adequately collected, were processed in the bacteriology laboratory of the albacete general hospital. e. coli was the most commonly isolated organism (62%), followed by proteus mirabilis (6.6%), streptococcus faecalis (6.6%), serratia marcescens (6.6%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (6.2%). as regards the sensitivity of e. coli to the most commonly used antibiotics, there was a 56% resistance to ampicillin, 37% to cotrimoxazole, 40% to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, and 46% to  cephalothin. these are in contrast with the small number of resistance, at least  in vitro, to urinary chemotherapeuticals and phosphomycin. we emphasize the importance of the knowledge of the organisms more commonly involved in uti and their updated sensitivity to antimicrobials for the best management of these infections.

(ii) of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were  gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) of these gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were enterobacteriaceae were enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious gram negative bacilli. (iv) the more common species among the members of enterobacteriaceae were escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). the other common species included enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii and proteus vulgaris. the frequencies of salmonella species and shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. the most common isolate among other glucose fermentative gram negative bacilli was aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). the finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in taiwan. (v) of these glucose nonfermentative gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) pseudomonas species. (vi) the most common bacteria among fastidious gram negative bacilli was haemophilus influenzae, 96.2% (1,154/1,200). (vii) of these gram negative cocci, 59.4% (60/101) was neisseria gonorrhoeae and 6.9% (7/101) n. meningitidis. (viii) the more common isolates of gram positive bacilli included bacillus species and corynebacterium species (diphtheroids). (ix) of these gram positive cocci, the isolation rates of staphylococcus species and streptococcus species were 54.6% (10,838/19,827) and 45.4% (9,002/19,847), respectively. the most common isolate among gram positive cocci was staphylococcus aureus, 30.2% (5,994/19,847); the next, enterococcus, 24.9% (4,936/19,847); then s. epidermidis, 22.2% (4,390/19,847). the less common isolates were streptococcus pyogenes 1.1% (212/19,847) and s. pneumoniae, 1.7% (329/19,847).(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == a monoclonal antibody against the yersinia enterocolitica 60-kilodalton (kda) antigen, designated cross-reacting protein antigen (crpa), was obtained by cell fusion. the crpa common to gram-negative bacteria was purified from y. enterocolitica by the affinity chromatography with the monoclonal antibody (igg1) thus obtained. the purified crpa showed a single band of 60 kda in sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page), and reacted with rabbit antisera against y. enterocolitica, vibrio cholerae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei in western blot analysis. the monoclonal antibody, however, reacted with a 60 kda peptide from y. enterocolitica, but not with the antigens from other gram-negative bacteria such  as v. cholerae, e. coli, s. sonnei, salmonella enteritidis, serratia marcescens,  klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and p. aeruginosa. the results suggested that both species-specific and cross-reactive epitopes were present on  a crpa molecule.

TI  == blockage of urinary catheters: role of microorganisms and constituents of the urine on formation of encrustations.
AB  == long-term indwelling urinary catheters may become blocked in some patients by formation of encrustations made up of aggregated struvite crystals while other patients rarely develop blocked catheters. we have designated these groups as "blockers", "intermediates" or "non-blockers". to further understand this phenomenon we followed 32 catheterized elderly women in a nursing home. catheters were changed six times at 2 week intervals. patients tended to remain as "blockers", "intermediates" or "non-blockers" consistently over time. there were  no significant differences in use of antibiotics, clinical manifestations of urinary infection or fever among the groups. "blockers" were significantly more often colonized with proteus mirabilis and providencia stuartii than "non-blockers", and significantly less often with klebsiella pneumoniae. however, there was no evidence of interference among the organisms. "blockers" excreted a  significantly more alkaline urine, and lesser amounts of magnesium, urea and phosphate in their urine. two "blockers" in whom proteus sp. were eliminated by coincidental antimicrobial therapy converted to "non-blockers". these findings support the concept that "blockers" are patients who have prolonged colonization  with urease producing proteus mirabilis and providencia stuartii.

TI  == potencies of ceftriaxone and cefotaxime in a single chamber pharmacokinetic system simulating their in vivo half-lives.
AB  == ceftriaxone and cefotaxime are third-generation cephalosporins with similar in vitro potencies and spectra. however, previous studies have shown that ceftriaxone had superior in vivo activity (mouse pd50 values greater than or equal to 2-fold lower) compared to cefotaxime in 23 of 46 tested enterobacteriaceae. this superior activity was thought to be due to ceftriaxone's 5- to 8-fold longer half-life. the relationship between half-life (ceftriax-one 6 h, cefotaxime 1 h) and potency was examined by following bacterial kill curves in a single chamber, open-ended perfusion model over an 8-hour period. both antibiotics were compared for efficacy at both half-lives against four gram-negative bacteria. for two of the bacterial strains antibiotic potency differences in the perfusion model were determined largely by pharmacokinetics. for the other two strains intrinsic bacterial and antibiotic properties were of prime importance.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

TI  == in vivo antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == the therapeutic activities of orally administered fk482 were compared with those  of reference antibiotics against systemic and local infections with a variety of  bacteria in mice and rabbits. in systemic infections in mice, oral fk482 was almost as effective as oral cefaclor (ccl) and more effective than oral cephalexin (cex) against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis infections. however, fk482 afforded superior protective activity when given subcutaneously against e. coli infection in mice,  and this activity was more potent than that of subcutaneously given ccl. in comparison with ccl, the reason that the in vivo activity of orally given fk482 against mouse systemic infections was weaker than had been anticipated from its potent in vitro activity was due to its poor oral absorption in mice. in local infections in rabbits, a species in which fk482 was better absorbed than in mice, fk482 was more effective than ccl, cex or amoxicillin (ampc). against pneumonia induced by s. aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, fk482 was as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs of infected rabbits. in the oral treatment of experimental ascending pyelonephritis in rabbits, fk482 was superior to ccl and ampc against methicillin-resistant s. aureus infection, as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl against enterococcus faecalis infection, and as effective as cefixime (cfix) and more effective than ccl and ampc against e. coli infection in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the kidneys and urine.

AB  == sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz) is a preparation containing cpz and sbt, an inhibitor of beta-lactamases, at the ratio 1:1. the reliability of the sbt/cpz disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics and the utilization of the test in the evaluation of proper administrative doses were studied using 365 strains of clinical isolates. the antimicrobial activity of sbt/cpz was stronger than that of cpz alone. this increase in the antimicrobial activity due to the addition of sbt was well observed in the disc diffusion susceptibility test and mic values. the mic80 of sbt/cpz against staphylococcus aureus was 12.5 micrograms/ml, while that of cpz alone was 50 micrograms/ml. mic80s of sbt/cpz against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes were smaller than those of cpz, and were 0.20, 12.5, 25 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. however, mic80s of sbt/cpz against staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and  proteus vulgaris were not changed compared to those of cpz alone, and mic80s were 6.25, 0.20, 0.78, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. the reliability of the sbt/cpz disc diffusion susceptibility test in the quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs prepared in this laboratory, both of which  contained 30 micrograms of cpz and 30 micrograms of sbt. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the sbt/cpz disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of approximate mic values. to interpret results of the showa sbt/cpz disc test, the following 4 category classification was used: ( inverted question mark) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark 3 micrograms/ml less than mic  less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark15 micrograms/ml  less than mic less than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. in both 6 and 8 mm diameter disc tests, when uniform break points  of inhibitory zone diameter were similarly applied to all strains isolated clinically, some strains of s. aureus, e. faecalis, and p. aeruginosa, brought false positive (susceptible) results showing slightly greater inhibitory zone diameters compared to mics. however, if different break points against p. aeruginosa as indicated in this study were applied and e. faecalis was excluded from the test, excellent results were obtained in the quantitative estimation of  mics. antimicrobial activities of antibiotic agents have been reported to be reduced by serum protein binding.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == in vitro activities of cefuzonam (czon) against 273 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of mic's and the results of disc susceptibility test. the mic's were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6)cfu/ml. the mic80's of czon against streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, haemophilus influenzae and citrobacter spp. were less than 0.20 microgram/ml. the mic80's against serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes were both 6.25 micrograms/ml, and that against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100 micrograms/ml. the mic80's against staphy-lococcus epidermidis were 25 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. approximately 70% of strains of s. aureus were inhibited at concentrations less than 1.56 microgram/ml. for the interpretation of the czon showa 30 micrograms disc susceptibility test a 4 category system was used. in the 4 category system for showa disc containing czon, the following classification inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed: ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic less than 60 micrograms/ml. reliability of the czon  disc tests in estimating approximate mic values was studied using showa 30 micrograms discs and discs prepared in this laboratory containing 1-10 micrograms czon. a good negative correlation was observed between inhibitory zone diameters  and mic's, showing the reliability of the disc method. the results of the test using showa 30 micrograms disc against various clinical isolates were accurately  classified into the 4 groups except those against p. aeruginosa. some strains of  p. aeuruginosa showed false positive results, exhibiting relatively larger inhibitory zone diameters compared with mic's against these organisms. as czon is not effective against p. aeruginosa a much better overall correlation between mic's and the disc test would result when p. aeruginosa was excluded. with showa  30 micrograms discs of various cephalosporins, sub-classification of strains with mic less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. in this study, however, it was  demonstrated that differentiation of strains with mic's less than 0.5-1.56 micrograms/ml was possible when discs containing 1-10 micrograms of czon were used. according to recent concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including  penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding  of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in  the body.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == studies of metabolites in diarrheal stool specimens positive for klebsiella, serratia, and proteus spp. by frequency-pulsed electron-capture gas chromatography.
AB  == diarrheal stools from infants from which klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia liquefaciens, and proteus mirabilis were isolated as possible causative agents of diarrhea were studied. these stools, along with control stool specimens which were collected from infants in the same village of tamooh (near cairo, egypt), were analyzed by frequency-pulsed electron-capture gas chromatography (fpec-gc).  watery stools and formed stools, to which distilled water was added, were centrifuged, and the supernatant was extracted with organic solvents and derivatized with specific functional group reagents to form electron-absorbing derivatives of carboxylic acids, hydroxy acids, alcohols, and amines. results from the study showed distinct differences in fpec-gc profiles of stools positive for k. pneumoniae, s. liquefaciens, and p. mirabilis. the major differences found were that diarrheal stools from which k. pneumoniae was isolated contained acetoin, a hydroxy acid-labeled peak f, and an unidentified amine, peak a. s. liquefaciens diarrheal stools had fpec-gc profiles like the controls with the exception that an amine, peak a, was detected. the diarrhel stools containing p.  mirabilis produced a distinct amine profile.

AB  == susceptibilities of gram-negative bacterial strains isolated at the university hospital in 1987 to six beta-lactam antibiotics (azthreonam cefmetazole, ceftizoxime, latamoxef, aminobenzyl-penicillin and piperacillin) and two aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin and amikacin) were examined by agar dilution and the agar diffusion method. results obtained from both methods correlated well in most of the strains. most of the strains belonging to escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis were sensitive to the beta-lactam antibiotics except aminobenzyl-penicillin and piperacillin. they were also sensitive to aminoglycoside antibiotics. most strains of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens were sensitive to azthreonam, latamoxef and aminoglycosides, but were less sensitive to other beta-lactams. acinetobacter calcoaceticus was generally resistant to beta-lactams except ceftizoxime, but was sensitive to aminoglycosides. more than half of the strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to azthreonam, piperacillin and aminoglycoside antibiotics and only latamoxef was active in pseudomonas maltophilia.

TI  == production of a phosphatidylglycerol-like substance by genital flora bacteria.
AB  == bacteria contaminating amniotic fluid have anecdotally been shown to produce a phosphatidylglycerol-like substance, thus giving false positive tests for phosphatidylglycerol in vaginal pool fluid from patients with premature rupture of the membranes. isolates of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter  calcoaceticus, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus) were grown in broth and analyzed for the presence of phosphatidylglycerol-like material by one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography and also by a polyclonal, immunologic slide agglutination test (amniostat-flm). all species demonstrated a positive test result for phosphatidylglycerol by either thin-layer chromatography, slide agglutination, or both. the material migrated separately from cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine as determined by chromatography, but identically with the phosphatidylglycerol control. gram-negative species were more strongly positive than gram-positive organisms. colony counts on the order of 10(8) colony-forming units per milliliter were necessary to give positive test results for phosphatidylglycerol. the possible clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == a regional survey of the resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in clinical isolates of (facultative) aerobic micro-organisms.
AB  == from 1980 to 1986 a regional survey was performed to investigate the susceptibility of beta-lactam antibiotics in clinical isolates of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in 6 hospitals located in the southern part of the netherlands. each year 300 to 400 strains were tested. the susceptibility to representatives of the older and the newer beta-lactam antibiotics was determined by a microbroth dilution assay using an inoculum size of 10(5) colony forming units (cfu)/ml in iso-sensitest broth (oxoid). no significant differences in antibiotic sensitivity of the micro-organisms from the different hospitals were found. there was no evidence for an increase in antibiotic resistance of the strains during the sampling period. in contrast, there was a general tendency to  an increase in antibiotic sensitivity.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cefaclor, cephalothin and cefadroxil to 50 escherichia coli, 23 klebsiella pneumoniae and 20 proteus mirabilis strains was tested with the disc diffusion and microdilution plate techniques. cefaclor was more active than cefadroxil, while cephalothin was intermediate. the differences seriously affected the classification into the routine sir system. for susceptibility testing we question the use of cephalothin as a class representative of oral cephalosporins.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating the effective administrative dose of latamoxef. significance of a 4-category system interpretation of the latamoxef disc susceptibility test].
AB  == in vitro activities of latamoxef (lmox) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. lmox was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. it was also active against enterobacter aerogenes with mic80  of 1.56 micrograms/ml. lmox was less active against serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. it was also less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing mic80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. lmox was not active against enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the reliability of the lmox disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of lmox. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the lmox disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of lmox. for the interpretation of lmox disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of showa discs used on staphylococcus were relatively large compared to mics determined, probably due to decarboxylation of lmox sodium salt in the discs. however, those of difco discs were not, because difco discs use lmox ammonium salt. both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters  compared to mics determined against p. aeruginosa. using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for staphylococcus and p. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate mics. a 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is  generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows:  resistant (r) mic greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (i) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. the 4 category system uses break points as follows: mic less than  or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [the antimicrobial activity of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activities of sisomicin (siso) against clinical isolates obtained in the second half of 1986 were investigated together with other 4 aminoglycosides (ags) (gentamicin (gm), tobramycin (tob), dibekacin (dkb), amikacin (amk] and 2 cephems (cefotiam, cefotaxime), and were compared to the results reported in the period of late 1970's through early 1980's in japan. 1. the incidence of siso-resistant staphylococcus aureus in the present study was 18% and is comparable to that of the other studies suggesting that the incidence  of siso resistant strains remains on the stable level. the incidence of siso-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa showed the tendency of slight increase. 2.  siso-resistant strains of enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens and citrobacter  freundii did not show increase from the 1970/1980 levels. 3. isolation rates of siso-resistant indole(+) proteus varied depending on strains. isolation rates of  siso-resistant p. vulgaris and morganella morganii were both as low as 4%, but that of providencia rettgeri was as high as 60%. refering to an american study reporting that the genus providencia including p. rettgeri showed high incidence  of resistance to siso as well as to gm or tob, we pointed out that the antimicrobial activity of ags against genus providencia should be evaluated separately from those of other indole(+) proteus strains. 4. no siso-resistant strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae or p. mirabilis were found. 5. siso had good antimicrobial activity against most of the investigated species and siso may still be regarded as one of the clinically useful ags.

TI  == assessment of antiseptic bladder washout procedures using a physical model of the catheterised bladder.
AB  == a simple physical model of the catheterised bladder has been used to assess the activities of antiseptic agents that have been recommended as bladder instillations in the treatment of urinary tract infections in patients with indwelling catheters. the activities of povidone-iodine, phenoxyethanol, chlorhexidine, chlorhexidine supplemented with edta + tris, noxythiolin and neomycin were examined against selected species of uropathogens. except for phenoxyethanol against pv. stuartii and possibly ps. aeruginosa, single applications of these antibacterials for 30 min were not effective in sterilising urine in the artificial bladder. however, a second application 1 h later of phenoxyethanol but not chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine did eradicate ps. aeruginosa. it is suggested that bacteria growing as a film on the bladder wall are particularly resistant to antimicrobials.

TI  == in vitro activity of a new broad spectrum, beta-lactamase-stable oral cephalosporin, cefixime.
AB  == cefixime is a new orally absorbed iminomethoxy, aminothiazolyl cephalosporin. it  inhibits the majority, 90%, of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes,  branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. it inhibits 90% of the other members of the  enterobacteriaceae at concentrations less than 1 microgram/ml, with the exception of some strains of enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii and morganella morganii, cefixime does not inhibit enterococci, listeria, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, bacteroides spp. or staphylococci. in general, cefixime has in vitro activity superior to cephalexin, cephradine, cefadroxil and cefaclor against all bacteria with the exception of staphylococci. cefixime is not destroyed by most of the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases and its activity is not reduced by serum, blood or urine. cefixime overall has excellent in vitro activity against the commonly encountered respiratory and urinary tract pathogens.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of sulbactam/cefoperazone. comparison with other new cephems].
AB  == antimicrobial activities of sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz) against 50 fresh clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and pseudomonas aeruginosa were compared to those of  cpz, cefotiam (ctm), cefotaxime (ctx) and latamoxef (lmox). minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic's) of sbt and cpz mixed in a ratio of 1:1 were determined by  the dilution method using mueller-hinton agar and expressed by absolute concentrations of cpz. antimicrobial activities of sbt/cpz against principally penicillinase (pcase) producing bacteria, i.e., s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, were superior to those of cpz alone. the presence of sbt in concentrations around 0.39 approximately 1.56 micrograms/ml clearly enhanced cpz's antimicrobial activities against these pcase producing strains. the synergistic antimicrobial effects of sbt in combination with cpz were less pronounced against principally cephalosporinase (cepase) producing bacteria, i.e., c. freundii, enterobacter spp., s. marcescens, p. vulgaris, and p. aeruginosa, and exerted with sbt at concentrations around 3.13 approximately 12.5 micrograms/ml. comparative antimicrobial activities indicated by mic80's of tested agents showed that sbt/cpz had more stable activities against bacteria ranging from gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria than ctm, ctx and lmox. mic's of sbt/cpz were higher than 25 micrograms/ml against 8% of s. aureus, 18% of c. freundii, 10% of enterobacter spp., 26% of s. marcescens, 2% of p. vulgaris, and 18% of p. aeruginosa. these resistant strains against which the addition of sbt showed no synergism, may possess other mechanism of resistance than beta-lactamase production. it is concluded that the presence of cpz resistant strains is an actual current problem and not an imaginary future problem, and that the number of resistant strains against other new cephems which have different chemical structure from cpz is increasing. when these present bacteriological environments are considered, the appearance of sbt/cpz in the clinical practice is timely and meaningful.

TI  == gentamicin resistance among gram-negative bacillary blood isolates in a hospital  with long-term use of gentamicin.
AB  == between 1977 and 1985, gentamicin was the only formulary aminoglycoside at the buffalo veterans administration medical center. during this time, there was a significant increase in the amount of gentamicin purchased. amikacin represented  11% or less of the total aminoglycoside purchased in the same period, but purchases of this agent also significantly increased. because of this long-term use of gentamicin, a retrospective analysis of gentamicin resistance among gram-negative bacillary blood isolates was performed. the results of this review  revealed no significant change in the overall incidence of gram-negative bacteremia; approximately 75% of these bacteremic episodes were hospital acquired. the mean yearly gentamicin-resistance rate of gram-negative blood isolates was 13.2% (range, 6% to 18%) with no significant change in the rate for  the period reviewed. however, for certain strains there were fluctuations in the  percentage of resistance from year to year, suggesting that clusters of infections due to these organisms had occurred. bacteremic infection due to resistant organisms was a major contributor to the overall level of gentamicin resistance among blood isolates. amikacin resistance among gram-negative blood isolates was rare. in conclusion, despite the predominant use of gentamicin there was no change in the gentamicin resistance rate among gram-negative bacillary blood isolates during a nine-year period. the rate of gentamicin resistance among blood isolates appeared to be related to outbreaks/clusters of infections due to  resistant strains rather than the frequency of use of gentamicin.

AB  == a new semisynthetic oral cephalosporin, bmy-28100, was evaluated for in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities in comparison with cefaclor and cephalexin. bmy-28100 showed in vitro activity 3- and 10-fold more potent than that of cefaclor against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively. bmy-28100 was slightly better than cefaclor and about 4 times more  active than cephalexin against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae.  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis were comparably susceptible to bmy-28100 and cefaclor. the bactericidal activity of bmy-28100 against s. aureus, e. coli and p. mirabilis was equal to or twice as high as mic  value, which was similar to that of cefaclor. the stability of bmy-28100 against  penicillinases was nearly comparable to that of cefaclor, whereas cefaclor was somewhat unstable to cephalosporinases. bmy-28100 was about twice as active as cefaclor against three gram-positive bacterial infections. bmy-28100 was also more potent against infections of h. influenzae and p. mirabilis, but slightly less active against e. coli juhl than cefaclor. blood level parameters of bmy-28100 were significantly superior to those of cefaclor and slightly better than cephalexin in mice and rats. the urinary recovery of bmy-28100 was somewhat  higher and comparable to that of cefaclor and cephalexin, respectively. bmy-28100 was more stable than cefaclor in human and calf sera at 37 degrees c.

TI  == the resistance of urinary tract pathogens to chlorhexidine bladder washouts.
AB  == isolates of providencia stuartii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis from urinary-tract infections in spinally-injured patients together with escherichia coli 10418 were challenged with chlorhexidine (200 mg l-1) in a model of a catheterized bladder under conditions which simulate the bladder washout technique. all species survived the antiseptic. organisms growing on the wall of the bladder model appeared to be particularly resistant and electron microscopy showed that these cells were embedded in a protective glycocalyx. the effect of chlorhexidine bladder washouts on the bacterial flora in the urine of patients was also observed and shown to be minimal and temporary. examination of urinary sediments from patients revealed the presence of micro-colonies of bacteria embedded in a polysaccharide matrix. we conclude that bladder washouts with chlorhexidine are not likely to eliminate  established infections with organisms that occur in patients with indwelling bladder catheters.

TI  == purification and characterization of the nickel-containing multicomponent urease  from klebsiella aerogenes.
AB  == klebsiella aerogenes urease was purified 1,070-fold with a 25% yield by a simple  procedure involving deae-sepharose, phenyl-sepharose, mono q, and superose 6 chromatographies. the enzyme preparation was comprised of three polypeptides with estimated mr = 72,000, 11,000, and 9,000 in a alpha 2 beta 4 gamma 4 quaternary structure. the three components remained associated during native gel electrophoresis, mono q chromatography, and superose 6 chromatography despite the presence of thiols, glycols, detergents, and varied buffer conditions. the apparent compositional complexity of k. aerogenes urease contrasts with the simple well-characterized homohexameric structure for jack bean urease (dixon, n. e., hinds, j. a., fihelly, a. k., gazzola, c., winzor, d. j., blakeley, r. l., and zerner, b. (1980) can. j. biochem. 58, 1323-1334); however, heteromeric subunit compositions were also observed for the enzymes from proteus mirabilis, sporosarcina ureae, and selemonomas ruminantium. k. aerogenes urease exhibited a  km for urea of 2.8 +/- 0.6 mm and a vmax of 2,800 +/- 200 mumol of urea min-1 mg-1 at 37 degrees c in 25 mm n-2-hydroxyethylpiperazinen'-2-ethanesulfonic acid, 5.0 mm edta buffer, ph 7.75. the enzyme activity was stable in 1% sodium dodecyl  sulfate, 5% triton x-100, 1 m kcl, and over a ph range from 5 to 10.5, with maximum activity observed at ph 7.75. two active site groups were defined by their pka values of 6.55 and 8.85. the amino acid composition of k. aerogenes urease more closely resembled that for the enzyme from brevibacter ammoniagenes (nakano, h., takenishi, s., and watanabe, y. (1984) agric. biol. chem. 48, 1495-1502) than those for plant ureases. atomic absorption analysis was used to establish the presence of 2.1 +/- 0.3 mol of nickel per mol of 72,000-dalton subunit in k. aerogenes urease.

AB  == to study the transfer of cefuzonam (czon, l-105) into female genital organs, concentrations of the compound in pelvic dead space exudate were measured in cases of radical hysterectomy due to cervical cancer and analyzed by the two-compartment model. when czon 1 g was drip-infused intravenously, the concentration in the cubital vein blood was 46.95 micrograms/ml at 1 hour after the start of infusion. concentrations in the pelvic dead space exudate reached the peak of 11.29 micrograms/ml at 2.44 hours after the start, were higher than 4 micrograms/ml after 8 hours and were higher than 1.7 micrograms/ml after 12 hours. the area under the concentration-time curve in the pelvic dead space exudate was 77.85 micrograms x hr/ml. from these results czon was considered to be effective when administered at 1 g against infections of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and haemophilus influenzae, but increased dose levels seemed necessary  against infections of staphylococcus epidermidis and bacteroides fragilis. in 3 cases of obstetric and gynecological infections the efficacy of czon was good in  2 cases and unknown in the other case.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of diethyldithiocarbamate and dimethyldithiocarbamate against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus has appeared which is highly resistant to both methicillin  and aminoglycosides. current therapy involves long-term intravenous therapy of vancomycin. since vancomycin is currently the only drug used to treat these patients, there is a need to develop additional antimicrobial therapy. the in vitro antimicrobial effect of the metal chelator, diethyldithiocarbamate (ddtc) and its structural analog dimethyldithiocarbamate (dmtc) were investigated. both  ddtc and dmtc were effective against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). by agar diffusion, ddtc at 10 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 12 to 21 mm and at 100 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 26 to  34 mm against mrsa. the dmtc produced slightly greater zone sizes against mrsa of 16 to 24 mm and 24 to 37 mm for 10 micrograms per disk and 100 micrograms per disk, respectively. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for dmtc against mrsa was 6 micrograms per ml. both ddtc and dmtc were also effective against enterococci, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, salmonella species, serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii at 100 micrograms per disk. the mics of dmtc for klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, salmonella and citrobacter freundii were approximately 128 micrograms per ml while the mics for proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens was greater than or equal to 256 micrograms per ml. in addition, dmtc was synergistic with gentamicin against mrsa and coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. additive and synergistic effects of dmtc were displayed with gentamicin against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant  s. aureus.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == post-antibiotic suppressive effect of ciprofloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the post-antibiotic suppressive effect (pae) of different antibacterial agents against gram-positive bacteria has been known since the 1940s. recently, it has been demonstrated that quinolone antimicrobial agents exert a pae against gram-negative bacteria. in this study, the paes of ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus faecalis were determined. the differences in pae determined by three different techniques--filtration, centrifugation, and dilution--were assessed for s. aureus and e. coli. ciprofloxacin had a pae by all three methods, and filtration was used in the majority of studies. a ciprofloxacin concentration of 3 micrograms/ml in mueller-hinton broth, ph 7.4, with two hours of exposure produced a pae of three to four hours for gram-negative bacilli, and 1.9 hours for s. aureus, but had no effect on s. faecalis. exposure of organisms in urine to 300 micrograms/ml of ciprofloxacin for two hours produced a two- to six-hour pae for e. coli, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, and k. pneumoniae. use of mueller-hinton broth with a  magnesium concentration of 8 mm, ph 5.5, yielded similar results. using human serum, a four-hour pae was found for p. aeruginosa. there was a progressive increase in the pae as the duration of ciprofloxacin exposure was increased from  0.9 hours to three hours. increasing the ciprofloxacin concentration from two to  eight times the minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) for p. aeruginosa or from four to 16 times the mbc for e. coli did not cause a significant difference  in the pae using a two-hour exposure. overall, ciprofloxacin produced an excellent pae for most gram-negative bacteria and for s. aureus, but not for s. faecalis. a pae caused by ciprofloxacin can be demonstrated in broth supplemented with magnesium, in urine, in serum, and in broth with the ph adjusted to an acidic level and with the increased magnesium concentration found in urine. these results support less frequent dosing programs for ciprofloxacin in the treatment  of tissue and urinary infections.

TI  == clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin therapy for gram-negative bacillary osteomyelitis.
AB  == the efficacy and toxicity of ciprofloxacin, an orally administered fluoroquinolone, were evaluated in 24 infections in 23 patients with osteomyelitis caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli. the diagnosis was confirmed by surgical findings and the results of bone biopsy and culture of bone or deep soft tissue. the aerobic gram-negative bacilli were pseudomonas aeruginosa (15 isolates), serratia marcescens (five isolates), escherichia coli (three isolates), enterobacter species (three isolates), proteus mirabilis (one isolate), pseudomonas fluorescens (one isolate), and klebsiella pneumoniae (one isolate). minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) were 1.56 micrograms/ml or less for all but one isolate. nine infections were polymicrobial, involving aerobic gram-positive cocci or anaerobes in addition to aerobic gram-negative bacilli. additional antibiotics to which the aerobic gram-negative bacilli were resistant were given when the additional organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin. patients received 750 mg of ciprofloxacin twice daily for a mean of 62 days. peak serum levels of ciprofloxacin were at least threefold higher than the mbcs in 20 of 24 patients. twenty of 22 infections in which a full course of therapy was completed were without evidence of active disease at one to 17 months posttreatment. a sternotomy wound infection relapsed after eight weeks  of therapy with a newly resistant s. marcescens strain, and an infection of a compound fracture relapsed two months posttreatment with a still sensitive p. aeruginosa strain. toxicity was minimal in most patients: eosinophilia (six patients), nausea (eight patients), mild elevation in transaminase levels (three  patients), pruritus (one patient), diarrhea (two patients), thrush (two patients), rash (two patients), and mild leukopenia (one patient). two additional patients had severe side effects (vertigo in one and acute renal failure in another) that required discontinuation of ciprofloxacin therapy. overall, ciprofloxacin is a promising agent for the oral treatment of gram-negative bacillary osteomyelitis.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of ceftizoxime. observation from mic and ceftizoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  == in vitro activities of ceftizoxime (czx) against 328 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. czx was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 0.20 microgram/ml. it was also active against serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes with mic85 of  3.13 micrograms/ml. czx was less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing inhibitory activities against only 47 and 78% of these clinical isolates, respectively, at a dose level of 12.5 micrograms/ml.  czx was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis. the  reliability of czx disc diffusion susceptibility tests for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter  discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (eiken), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of czx. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the czx disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of czx, except against p. aeruginosa and e.  faecalis. for the interpretation of czx disc tests, a 3 category system has been  used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows: resistant (r) mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (ms) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at  250 words)

TI  == [treatment of urinary tract infections with solcourovac].
AB  == urinary tract infections are among the most common infections found in women. if  recurrences or reinfections become frequent treatment can be problematic. immunisation of the patients by vaccinating them against urinary tract pathogens  offers a possibility of managing these infections. in clinical trials we tested solcourovac, a new vaccine to counteract bacterial pathogens, with regard to efficacy, frequency of recurrence, and tolerance. 113 of the 118 patients included in this study with bacteriuria (urine culture germ count greater than or equal to 10(5)/ml), had acute cystitis. 47 of these patients had recurring urinary tract infections. follow-up examinations were conducted after 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 12 months. a urine culture assay was performed during each examination, as  well as a relevant bacterial differentiation test and a urine sediment evaluation. two to six weeks after termination of the vaccination series 72.6% of the patients were largely free from signs and symptoms. the rate of recurrence/reinfection dropped from 2.5 to 0.24 infections for a period of 12 months. after one year, 94 of the patients (80%) were still free from reinfection.

TI  == n-nitrosamine formation in urinary-tract infections.
AB  == urine samples from 31 patients with urinary-tract infections and from 31 controls were analysed for volatile nitrosamines, n-nitrosamino acids, total n-nitroso compounds as a group, and nitrite/nitrate. the concentration of n-nitrosodimethylamine was significantly elevated in urines infected with escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae. the levels of nitrite, n-nitrosoproline and total n-nitroso compounds, when expressed as the amount per mol creatinine, were also significantly increased in patients with bacteriuria. several bacterial strains were capable of catalysing nitrosation of  morpholine at neutral ph. these results suggest that n-nitroso compounds can be formed in vivo in the infected bladder, which could explain the association between urinary-tract infections and increased risk for bladder cancer.

TI  == worldwide study of cefoperazone susceptibility.
AB  == in vitro susceptibility to cefoperazone of more than one million clinical aerobic bacterial isolates was evaluated in 369 hospitals in japan, the united states, canada, france, austria, and hungary. standard versions of the disk diffusion method were used according to interpretive criteria approved in the respective countries, and comparisons were made among the countries and among various body sites. susceptibility of organisms varied little within most species among the countries. minor differences in methodology and in interpretive criteria may explain some of the variations observed among countries and hospitals. the susceptibility of key pathogens to cefoperazone among countries ranged from 91% to 98% for escherichia coli, 73% to 91% for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 90% to 95% for klebsiella pneumoniae, 73% to 92% for enterobacter cloacae, 74% to 92% for staphylococcus aureus, and 91% to 97% for proteus mirabilis. susceptibility of isolates from the urinary tract did not vary markedly from that in other body sites.

AB  == ceftetrame (ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (ro 15-8074), two new orally administered aminothiazolyl imimomethoxy cephalosporins, inhibited hemolytic streptococci and  streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml but were less active against staphylococci than were cephalexin and cefaclor. they did not inhibit s. faecalis, s. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, corynebacterium jk species, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including ampicillin-resistant isolates,  were inhibited at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml. both agents inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, salmonella species, shigella species, citrobacter diversus, and aeromonas hydrophila resistant to ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, although many isolates of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime were not inhibited by these agents. a marked inoculum effect was noted for enterobacteriaceae carrying the richmond-sykes type 1a chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, but plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases did not hydrolyze the compounds. both drugs inhibited the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of e. cloacae, p99.

TI  == do clinical microbiology laboratories report complete bacteriology in urine from  patients with long-term urinary catheters?
AB  == bacteriuria associated with long-term urinary catheters (those in place for greater than or equal to 30 days) appears to be the most common nosocomial infection in u.s. medical care facilities. this bacteriuria is polymicrobial and  dynamic and accompanied by fevers, catheter obstructions, bacteremias, and deaths. we compared the reporting by our research laboratory of bacteria present  in urine from long-term-catheterized nursing home patients with that by two commercial laboratories. the commercial laboratories isolated significantly fewer bacterial species at 10(5) cfu/ml of urine specimen. organisms well recognized as causes of urinary tract infections in noncatheterized patients (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae) were isolated in comparable frequencies by both the research and commercial laboratories. however, other organisms, including uncommon uropathogens like providencia stuartii and morganella morganii, which were actually among the most frequent bacteriuric species in these long-term-catheterized patients, were isolated significantly less frequently by the commercial laboratories. reasons for the discrepancies are unclear but may involve use of different techniques. more complete reporting may  lead to better understanding of the polymicrobial bacteriuria of long-term catheters and its associated complications. this, in turn, may result in improved patient care and infection control in nursing homes.

TI  == aztreonam in the treatment of severe urinary tract infections in pediatric patients.
AB  == aztreonam was administered to 30 patients, ages 0.03 to 15.4 years, with severe and in 21 cases complicated urinary tract infections caused by members of the family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa which were resistant to ampicillin and susceptible to the study drug in vitro. a mean dose of 47.7 mg/kg  was given intramuscularly every 12 h to 26 patients. in four patients with renal  insufficiency, the dose was reduced according to pharmacokinetic data. permanent  urine sterilization and clinical cure were achieved in 22 patients, 13 of whom had urological malformations. in two patients with p. aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis infections, the treatment failed. another patient had an escherichia coli reinfection 21 days after the end of therapy. four patients with various urological abnormalities had gram-positive superinfections, and two patients had  gram-negative superinfections during and at the end of therapy: all six had indwelling ureteric splints or pyelostomy as predisposing conditions. no adverse  clinical effects were observed. some transient and slight or moderate alterations were observed at the end of treatment: eosinophilia (nine cases), elevation of hepatic enzymes (eight cases), prolongation of prothrombin time (three cases), and neutropenia (one case). a pharmacokinetic study was performed in six patients with normal renal function and in seven patients with various degrees of renal insufficiency. the elimination half-life of the drug was inversely correlated with the glomerular filtration rate. at the dosage used, aztreonam proved effective for severe urinary tract infections caused by members of the family enterobacteriaceae in pediatric patients.

TI  == bacterial adherence to bladder uroepithelial cells in catheter-associated urinary tract infection.
AB  == to assess the role of bacterial adherence to uroepithelial cells in the pathogenesis of nosocomial urinary tract infection, we prospectively studied 55 patients with indwelling urinary catheters. we obtained uroepithelial cells from  the bladder and urine for culture on the patients' entry into the study and every two to four days during catheterization. in all, 235 collections of uroepithelial cells from these patients were used in an in vitro adherence assay with six gram-negative bacterial strains. with uroepithelial cells from patients who did not have bacterial infections, the adherence of the bacteria used in the assay differed significantly according to species. the least adherence occurred with escherichia coli gr12; the adherence increased with (in order) proteus mirabilis, e. coli j96, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. with cells collected just before the onset of bacteriuria, adherence  of these gram-negative strains was higher in patients in whom gram-negative rod infections developed than in those with gram-positive coccal infections (p = 0.005). analysis with the cox proportional-hazards model demonstrated that a significant increase in bacterial adherence to uroepithelial cells in the bladder occurred two to four days before the onset of bacteriuria, but that adherence returned to base-line values with the onset of bacteriuria. these results suggest that a transient increase in the adherence of gram-negative bacteria to bladder epithelial cells may be an important early event in the development of catheter-associated bacteriuria.

TI  == in vitro activity of ci-934, a new quinolone, compared with that of other quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ci-934, a new 4-quinolone, was determined against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the mics for 90% of the isolates tested were 0.25 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.5 microgram/ml for streptococcus faecalis, 0.25 microgram/ml for staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant strains, and less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml for escherichia coli, salmonella and shigella spp., klebsiella spp., proteus spp., and citrobacter spp. ci-934 had activity superior to that of other quinolones against streptococci by four- to eightfold. against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, ciprofloxacin was 2- to 18-fold more active; ofloxacin and norfloxacin were twofold more active or similar to ci-934. ci-934 inhibited ampicillin-cephalothin-resistant urinary isolates of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis and cefoxatime-resistant acinetobacter spp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii. the medium, inoculum size, and oxygen concentration, as well as the addition of serum, had not major effect on the activity of ci-934. magnesium at a concentration of 9 mm increased mics and mbcs four- to eightfold, and testing at  ph 6 increased mics as much as 32- to 64-fold for some organisms in comparison with mics at ph 7. the frequency of spontaneous mutation to resistance was comparable to that for other new quinolones, but resistant isolates could be selected by repeated subculture.

TI  == characterization of pathogenic bacteria by automated headspace concentration-gas  chromatography.
AB  == automated headspace concentration-gas chromatography (ahc-gc) was used to profile the volatile metabolites produced by proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. bacterial cultures were incubated in trypticase soy broth and examined at 24 h. the profiles were consistent for each genus examined and variation observed among the different strains of each species was chiefly quantitative. the volatiles were identified by concurrent headspace concentration-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and consisted mainly of isobutanol, isopentanol, isopentyl acetate, 1-undecene and methyl ketones. there were sufficient differences in the profiles in the 4-6 min  elution period to distinguish p. aeruginosa and s. aureus from each other and from the other two bacteria. p. mirabilis and k. pneumoniae typically showed three intense peaks which corresponded to isobutanol, isopentyl acetate and isopentanol. the determination of volatiles by ahc-gc is sensitive, rapid and offers a possible alternative for automatic detection and characterization of pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == the efficacy of pefloxacin in comparison to gentamicin in the treatment of experimentally induced peritonitis in rats.
AB  == a reproducible experimental model of intra-abdominal infections in rats has been  devised in order to stimulate intra-abdominal sepsis in patients. pre-operatively, the rats were fed with lean ground beef for two weeks in order to change the intestinal flora to one similar to that of humans. a 1 cm segment of ileum was isolated on its vascular pedicle. the intestine was then divided at  each end of the segment and intestinal continuity was re-established by an end-to-end anastomosis. the segment of ileum was then returned to the abdominal cavity. this experimental model was used to compare the efficacy of pefloxacin alone and in combination with metronidazole with the combination gentamicin and metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections. seventy per cent of the untreated animals died within two days. within three days 40% of the animals  receiving pefloxacin died. animals treated with pefloxacin plus metronidazole or  gentamicin plus metronidazole had a significantly decreased mortality and increased cure rates during the experimental period. only 5% of these animals died. thus the combination of pefloxacin and metronidazole seems to be as successful as gentamicin plus metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == bacterial colonization of hemasite access devices.
AB  == vascular access ports (hemasites) were recovered from patients in whom they had become foci of infection and were examined according to microbiologic and morphologic techniques. all were covered on their extraluminal surfaces by well-developed biofilms consisting of host material and bacteria and their extracellular products. one hemasite from which staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis were cultured was covered by a biofilm that consisted of coccoid bacterial cells and occasional fungal cells. another hemasite from which  proteus mirabilis was cultured was covered by a polymicrobial biofilm consisting  of at least six morphologically distinct bacterial types and their extracellular  products. this direct observation of the biofilm mode of bacterial growth on these devices suggests that the colonizing organisms will not be completely recovered by routine microbiologic techniques and that bacteria in the biofilm will tend to resist both host clearance mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. removal of the device, with its accretion of bacterial biofilm, should allow the  resolution of the associated infection.

AB  == a-56619 and a-56620 are two new aryl-fluoroquinolones which are as potent as or more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally and subcutaneously in mouse protection tests against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae. a-56619 and a-56620 were more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. a-56620 was as potent or two- to threefold more potent than norfloxacin when administered subcutaneously against members of the family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. infection with salmonella typhimurium was more effectively treated with a-56619 (50% effective dose [ed50], 1.4 mg/kg per day) than with norfloxacin (ed50, 62.8 mg/kg per day). e. coli or pseudomonas pyelonephritis in mice was more effectively treated with a-56619 or a-56620 than with norfloxacin. after oral treatment, the  ed50s of a-56619 and a-56620 were less than 12.5 mg/kg per day against e. coli and 62.9 and 38 mg/kg per day against p. aeruginosa pyelonephritis, respectively. norfloxacin was ineffective at 200 mg/kg per day against e. coli or p. aeruginosa pyelonephritis. a-56619 and a-56620 were also more potent than norfloxacin in treatment of mixed bacterial pyelonephritis caused by e. coli and streptococcus faecalis. a-56619 was at least 30 times more potent than norfloxacin and a-56620  was 4 to 11 times more potent than norfloxacin when administered against klebsiella pneumonia in mice. a-56619 and a-56620 were at least 2 to 10 times more potent than norfloxacin against staphylococcus aureus infections in immunosuppressed mice. a-56619 was equally potent in all in vivo tests when administered orally or subcutaneously, whereas a-56620 was similar to norfloxacin in being more potent when administered subcutaneously. the peak serum levels after subcutaneous and oral administration of a-56619 and a-56620 were higher than that of norfloxacin. the serum hal-lives of a-56619 and a-56620 after subcutaneous and oral administration were longer than the serum half-life of norfloxacin.

TI  == comparative activity of ofloxacin and seven other antimicrobials against urea-splitting microorganisms.
AB  == urinary tract infections caused by urea-splitting bacteria are severe clinical conditions and very difficult to treat due to their association with calculi, and because such bacteria form ammonium hydroxide raising the urinary ph and thereby  creating an unfavourable condition for the action of most antimicrobials. we tested ofloxacin, norfloxacin, nalidixic acid, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, gentamicin, co-trimoxazole and nitrofurantoin against 143 gram-negative and 99 gram-positive bacteria, all urea-splitting, isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. all drugs were tested using media at two different phs (ph 7.4 and ph 8.5) and two inoculum sizes (10(4) and  10(6) cfu). although ofloxacin and norfloxacin had a similar spectrum of activity, ofloxacin had somewhat greater intrinsic activity against gram-positive organisms. mics of ofloxacin for 90% of proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and the corynebacterium group d2 were greater than or equal to 4 mg/l. the activity of the other drugs varied, but there were many strains resistant to these antimicrobials. the ph and inoculum size did not significantly affect the activity of ofloxacin so that this drug should be useful for the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by the commonest urea-splitting bacteria involved in such infections.

TI  == interspecific reconstitution of maltose transport and chemotaxis in escherichia coli with maltose-binding protein from various enteric bacteria.
AB  == in escherichia coli, the periplasmic maltose-binding protein (mbp), the product of the male gene, is the primary recognition component of the transport system for maltose and maltodextrins. it is also the maltose chemoreceptor, in which capacity it interacts with the signal transducer tar (taxis to aspartate and some repellents). in studies of the maltose system in other members of the family enterobacteriaceae, we found that mbp is produced by salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and serratia marcescens. mbp from  all of these species cross-reacted with antibody against the e. coli protein and  had a similar molecular weight (about 40,000). the shigella flexneri and proteus  mirabilis strains we examined did not synthesize mbp. the isoelectric points of mbp from different species varied from the acid extreme of e. coli (4.8) to the basic extreme of e. aerogenes (8.9). all species with mbp transported maltose with high affinity, although the vmax for k. pneumoniae was severalfold lower than that for the other species. maltose chemotaxis was observed only in e. coli  and e. aerogenes. in s. typhimurium lt2, tar was completely inactive in maltose taxis, although it signaled normally in response to aspartate. mbp isolated from  all five species could be used to reconstitute maltose transport and taxis in a delta male strain of e. coli after permeabilization of the outer membrane with calcium.

TI  == lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  == the most important lower respiratory infection is pneumonia, the fourth leading cause of death. most cases of bronchitis are of viral etiology and are not major  problems. empyema can present an important problem in management. although the diagnosis of pneumonia is usually relatively straightforward, the specific etiologic diagnosis remains a major problem. availability of empyema fluid or a positive blood culture result can be helpful in making the etiologic diagnosis, but these are unavailable in most patients. screening of sputum gram stains under 100 x magnification is very important; there should be fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells, more than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or both per field of this size. the major causes of pneumonia are streptococcus pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, anaerobic bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, various gram-negative aerobic or facultative bacilli and legionella. however, many other organisms are  capable of causing pneumonia, even in the immunocompetent host. further adding to the problem is the fact that a number of different organisms are manifesting increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. our study with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid included seven patients with pneumonia, one with empyema, and one with purulent tracheobronchitis. organisms recovered from pleural fluid, transtracheal aspiration and sputum or tracheostomy aspirate included multiple anaerobes, pneumococci, s. aureus, hemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae,  k. ozaenae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, proteus  mirabilis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, neisseria meningitidis and branhamella catarrhalis. several of the organisms were ticarcillin resistant. eight of the patients had cures and the other patient showed improvement. only minor side-effects were encountered--coombs' positivity (without hemolysis), eosinophilia, drug fever and one case of questionable neutropenia.

AB  == the antibacterial effects produced by ticarcillin disodium plus clavulanate potassium, a combination of the broad-spectrum penicillin ticarcillin, and the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid as the potassium salt, have been measured in vitro and in experimental infection studies. the presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the activity of ticarcillin against a wide range of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. these included ticarcillin-resistant strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, and the anaerobe bacteroides fragilis. in addition, beta-lactamase-producing isolates of  hemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ticarcillin and clavulanate. clavulanic acid did not influence the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible bacteria. the bactericidal effects of the antibiotic combination were measured in an in vitro kinetic model in which the drug concentrations were varied to simulate those measured in humans after intravenous dosing with ticarcillin (3.0 g) and clavulanate potassium (100 mg clavulanic acid). in these tests, ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid had pronounced bactericidal activity against ticarcillin-resistant bacteria. the protection of ticarcillin by clavulanic acid from inactivation by bacterial beta-lactamases in  vivo was demonstrated in experimental infection models in which the efficacy of the ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid combination against infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria was correlated with the presence of effective concentrations of both antibiotic and inhibitor at the site of infection.

AB  == endometritis is considered to be a polymicrobial infection, involving aerobes, anaerobes, and genital mycoplasmas. aerobic gram-negative rods make up 7%-25% of  all genital isolates, but findings from studies in which special collection techniques were used suggest that many of these may be contaminants from the lower genital tract. bacteremia occurs in 4%-30% of patients with endometritis, and aerobic gram-negative rods account for approximately 25% of blood isolates. both selected therapy studies and studies of intrauterine cultures collected at surgery from patients at risk for endometritis suggest the significant role of aerobic gram-negative rods. among them escherichia coli is the most common isolate in both genital and blood cultures. klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis rank next, followed by enterobacter species. pseudomonas species account for fewer than 0.6% of genital isolates. overall, aerobic gram-negative rods are causally involved in 10%-20% of cases of endometritis following cesarean section.

TI  == [carbenicillin resistance of gram-negative bacteria: incidence, biochemical and genetic determinism].
AB  == of nine hundred ampicillin resistant (amp-r) enterobacteria strains, isolated in  hospital between july and december 1981, 73,7% are also carbenicillin-resistant (carb-r). this particular double resistance varies depending upon the species considered: indole positive proteus (23%), enterobacter cloacae (64%), citrobacter freundii (67%), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (73%), proteus mirabilis  (75%), serratia marcescens (90%), escherichia coli (91%), providencia stuartii (96%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (100%). the biochemical and genetic basis of resistance to beta-lactamines was studied in 27 strains belonging to these 9 species. a constitutive beta-lactamase was found in all the strains. these enzymes were identified by determination of the isoelectric point on crude sonic  extracts, the enzymic activity profile, the inhibition by clavulanic acid and cloxacillin of enzyme activity. two types of enzymes were predominant: tem-1 (20  strains) and tem-2 (7 strains); two strains of klebsiella pneumoniae produced both shv-1 and tem-1. the transfer by conjugation to e. coli k12 of ampicillin and carbenicillin resistance was obtained with 14 strains: (e. coli: 9, c. freundii: 1, k. pneumoniae: 1, e. cloacae: 2, p. stuartii: 1). in all strains but one e. coli we noted the co-transfer of other antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == effects of antimicrobial agents fed to chickens on some gram-negative enteric bacilli.
AB  == total and antimicrobial agent-resistant aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-negative enteric bacilli in fecal samples of broiler chickens fed growth-promotional levels of antimicrobial agents were determined quantitatively. two 8-week studies were conducted utilizing groups of chickens fed antimicrobial-supplemented rations; the second study involved feed "pasteurization" as a means of minimizing colonization from the feed. dilution/spread-plating/replica-plating techniques on selective media were used to obtain counts of total organisms and those resistant to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, ampicillin, or kanamycin. the predominant aerobic  and facultative anaerobic gram-negative organism was escherichia coli, which was  detected in all samples at levels ranging from 10(5) to over 10(10) cfu/g of feces. less common were proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas sp., which varied in occurrence and levels from group to group (range, less than  10(3) to 10(8) cfu/g). resistance to all antimicrobials (except chloramphenicol in e. coli) was commonly observed at incidences exceeding 10(3) cfu/g in the total populations. colonization of the chickens' intestinal tracts by susceptible and resistant strains of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and pseudomonas sp. appeared to  result from their presence in the environment of the newly hatched chickens. ration pasteurization did affect p. mirabilis, which appeared to colonize from the feed. the results suggest that colonization by, and proliferation of, antimicrobial-resistant aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-negative enteric bacilli in chicken intestinal tracts may be less dependent on selection through antimicrobial supplementation of the ration than on their prevalence in environments from which they can colonize newborns.

AB  == after iv, im, and subcutaneous injection of single dosages of amikacin (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg of body weight) in each of 4 dogs, the elimination kinetics of amikacin were determined. the pattern of urinary excretion and cumulative amount  excreted unchanged in 24 hours were also determined. amikacin had a short half-life (approx 1 hour) that was independent of the dosage. intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg gave apparent volume of distribution of 226 +/- 37 ml/kg and body clearance of 2.64 +/- 0.24 ml/min.kg (mean +/- sd, n = 4). within 6 hours, greater than 90% of the antibiotic was excreted in the urine, regardless of the route of administration. for isolates of common bacterial species from the canine urinary tract, minimum inhibitory concentrations of amikacin, gentamicin,  tobramycin, and kanamycin were determined in vitro. cumulative percentages were approximately the same for urinary isolates of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and coagulase-positive staphylococci that were susceptible (minimum inhibitory concentrations less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) to increasing concentrations of amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin, in vitro. klebsiella pneumoniae was significantly more susceptible to amikacin than were the other bacteria evaluated. widest variations in susceptibility to aminoglycosides were found with urinary isolates of streptococcal species. for dogs with normal renal function, an amikacin dosage of 10 mg/kg (im or subcutaneously) is recommended every 8 hours for treatment of systemic infections, and every 12 hours for treatment of urinary tract infections caused by susceptible bacteria.

AB  == self-transmissible plasmids carrying his and nif genes from klebsiella pneumoniae have been introduced into three his mutants of proteus mirabilis: strains 5006-1, wr19 and wr20. expression of his by the transconjugants was unequivocal, if slightly temperature-sensitive, but none was nif+ when tested for acetylene reduction in anaerobic glucose medium using inocula from rich or glucose-minimal  aerobic agar cultures. succinate or pyruvate in place of glucose, low glucose, lower temperature or elevated na2moo4 did not allow nif expression and no nitrogenase mofe-protein peptide was detected immunologically after exposure to conditions in which diazotrophic enterobacteria, normal or genetically constructed, derepress nif. one strain, p. mirabilis wr19, carrying the his nif kmr plasmid pmf250 was examined in detail. the nif activator gene nifa was introduced on the plasmid pck1. such derivatives remained nif- when tested, after aerobic growth on rich agar media, with normal or low glucose, with succinate or  with elevated mo. however, pre-conditioning by aerobic growth on glucose-minimal  agar led to subsequent anaerobic expression of nif in glucose medium from pmf250  in wr19 carrying pck1. nh+4 or proline could serve as n-source in the glucose-minimal agar. maximum activity was about 5% of that of k. pneumoniae in our assay conditions. material cross-reacting with anti-serum to the nitrogenase  mofe protein was formed. nitrogenase activity was not 'switched off' by nh+4. p.  mirabilis wr19 (pck1) showed nh+4-constitutive temperature-sensitive kanamycin resistance (a nif-related phenotype of this plasmid) in aerobic glucose minimal medium.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == screening of microorganisms for nitrosation catalysis at ph 7 and kinetic studies on nitrosamine formation from secondary amines by e. coli strains.
AB  == thirty-eight strains of microorganisms isolated from infected human trachea, urine, blood and faeces were examined for their ability to form n-nitrosomorpholine from morpholine and nitrite at ph 7.25. twenty-five bacterial strains exhibited nitrosation activity, including 18 out of 19 strains of escherichia coli and three out of nine pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus morganii,  proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and neisseria strains; e. coli a10 strain showed the highest activity. formation of n-nitrosomorpholine was proportional to the incubation time up to 2 h and to the number of resting e. coli a10 cells; the reaction followed michaelis-menten kinetics. nitrosation rate appeared to be dependent on the pka value of several amines studied. as the nitrosation catalysis was heat-labile, our data suggest that n-nitrosation is catalysed by a bacterial enzyme(s). this reaction may lead to enhanced endogenous nitrosation in subjects suffering from an achlorhydric stomach or from chronic urinary tract infections.

AB  == all strains of staphylococcus aureus and gram negative bacilli (enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter) isolated from 01.01 to 03.31.83 were studied using agar diffusion with augmentin-impregnated discs (amoxicillin 20 micrograms + clavulanic acid 10 micrograms). augmentin is active  against penicillinase-producing staphylococci susceptible to methicillin, whereas methicillin-resistant strains are also resistant to augmentin. according to the susceptibility of strains to amoxicillin, carbenicillin and cefalotin, enterobacteriaceae can be divided into five main phenotypes, of which four are resistant. "rsr" and "rrr" phenotypes, which are cephalosporinase producers, are  chiefly found among enterobacter, serratia, citrobacter and indole + proteus; in  these groups a change in inhibition diameters indicating activity of augmentin is observed only in a significant number of proteus vulgaris strains. "rrs" and "rri" strains are penicillinase producers found mainly among e. coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae and oxytoca, and proteus mirabilis; they emerge as very susceptible to augmentin. pseudomonas aeruginosa is never susceptible to augmentin. augmentin is slightly more active than amoxicillin on some acinetobacter strains but the difference is too inconsiderable to be of clinical significance.

AB  == an in vitro study was performed investigating the bactericidal ability of five common cleaning agents for leg bags against organisms frequently causing urinary  tract infection in spinal cord injured (sci) patients. individual disposable uridrain leg bags were inoculated with urine containing greater than 10(5) colonies/ml of the selected organism. the organisms used were: pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, herellea, and enterococcus. each pair of inoculated bags (one bag for immediate or 0 hour culture and one bag for 24 hour culture) was filled with 30 ml of the test solution, cleaned, drained, and then cultured. the  tested solutions included: plain tap water, 1/4% acetic acid, 3% hydrogen peroxide, sporicidin 1:16 dilution, and 0.06% sodium hypochlorite. the results demonstrated that plain tap water had no effect on reducing the bacterial counts  and that 1/4% acetic acid and 3% hydrogen peroxide had only a marginal effect across the spectrum of organisms. sporicidin and 0.06% sodium hypochlorite exhibited complete bactericidal ability. in the final analysis, 0.06% sodium hypochlorite is the most cost efficient and readily accessible to patients. in practical application, disinfecting daily with 0.06% sodium hypochlorite can decrease external contamination of urinary drainage appliances in sci patients.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of norfloxacin and other agents against ocular pathogens.
AB  == 302 clinical isolates representing 16 bacterial species most often implicated in  ocular infections were tested in vitro against norfloxacin and a panel of antibacterial agents. on the basis of the 90% minimal inhibitory concentration (mic90) data, norfloxacin was 4-32 times more active than the next best antimicrobial tested against citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria  gonorrhoeae and staphylococcus epidermidis, with overall mic90 less than or equal to 1 mg/l. norfloxacin was equal in activity to polymyxin b against klebsiella pneumoniae (mic90 = 1 mg/l), and it ranked second to both polymyxin b against pseudomonas aeruginosa and cotrimoxazole against staphylococcus aureus, (mic90 =  2 mg/l in each case). along with neomycin and cotrimoxazole, norfloxacin (mic90 = 1 mg/l) ranked second to gentamicin and tetracycline against moraxella species. compared to erythromycin (mic90 less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l), norfloxacin (mic90 less than or equal to 16 mg/l) was considerably less active against streptococci. overall, norfloxacin was the most active agent in both potency and  antibacterial spectrum against the test organisms. these results suggest the potential use of norfloxacin in the treatment of superficial bacterial infections of the eye.

TI  == in vitro effect of ph and glucose concentration on the antibacterial activity of  norfloxacin in urine.
AB  == the in vitro effect of ph and glucose concentration on the antibacterial activity of norfloxacin in urine was studied. norfloxacin effectively inhibited the growth of four gram-negative pathogens in urine in vitro at ph values of 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0. the antibacterial activity of norfloxacin in urine was reduced severalfold at ph 6, but minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) at this ph remained clinically significant. glucose at concentrations of 200 mg/dl and 400 mg/dl (simulating glucosuria of diabetes) did not significantly affect the antibacterial activity of norfloxacin when tested against clinical isolates of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. norfloxacin appears to be a highly effective antibiotic in vitro under conditions which simulate normal and diabetic states.

AB  == urine specimens were obtained from 312 obstetric outpatients by sterile midstream technique and aliquots placed in both becton-dickinson urine culture tubes and sterile conventional tubes. quantitative cultures were made from each tube, and each tube was screened for bacteria with the abbott ms-2 urine screening system.  the time required to detect bacteriuria was recorded for both specimens. isolates from specimens containing greater than or equal to 50,000/ml gram-positive cocci  or greater than or equal to 100,000/ml gram-negative bacilli were identified and  antimicrobial susceptibility tests performed. delayed (24 hr) quantitative cultures were done from becton-dickinson tubes. by these criteria, 124 urine specimens were positive in both conventional and becton-dickinson tubes. escherichia coli (n = 72), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 20), enterobacter cloacae (n = 8), proteus mirabilis (n = 4), group b streptococcus (n = 12), and enterococcus (n = 8) were isolated. time for detection of positive urine samples  was similar in both types of tubes. delayed cultures had significant numbers of false-positive results. antimicrobial susceptibility results did not appear to be influenced greatly by becton-dickinson tube transport. the ms-2 cannot adequately discriminate cultures containing less than 50,000 colony-forming units/ml of urine. the becton-dickinson tube appears to be compatible for use with the ms-2 for purposes of screening for bacteriuria.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (cmx) was determined using agar dilution at  inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml against 333 clinical bacterial isolates. cmx was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes and haemophilus influenzae and also streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae with mic values in the range of 0.024 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. against staphylococci and serratia marcescens, cmx showed the antimicrobial activity with mic90 6.25 micrograms/ml. however, cmx was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter anitratus and exhibited no useful activity against streptococcus faecalis. reliability of cmx disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of the antimicrobial activity was also investigated, using 8 mm diameter disc (showa) and 6 mm diameter disc (wako), both of them containing 30 micrograms of cmx. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, capable of utilizing cmx disc susceptibility test for the estimation of proper administrative dose of cmx. using 6 mm diameter disc containing 30 micrograms cmx, fuchs et al. have proposed the following tentative zone size break points: greater than or equal to 22 mm =  mic 8 micrograms/ml, susceptible; 15 to 21 mm = mic 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (intermediate); and less than or equal to 14 mm = mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, resistant. in this investigation, the  following zone size break points have preferred: greater than or equal to 25 mm = mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml (3+); 20 to 24 mm = mic greater than 3  to 15 micrograms/ml (2+); 16 to 19 mm = mic greater than 15 to 60 micrograms/ml (+) and less than or equal to 15 mm = mic greater than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml (-). based on cmx pharmacokinetic data currently available, mic break points proposed, less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, would be useful for estimating the administrative dose of this antibiotic to obtain the effective blood level (e.g. the bacteriostatic activity in serum 1: greater than or equal to 8 for treatment of severe infection.

AB  == chemiluminescence (cl) is a sensitive indicator of phagocytosis and intracellular killing; however, little is known of the normal cl response by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes to different pathogenic microorganisms. we investigated the luminol-enhanced cl response of normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes to a number of common bacterial pathogens and two yeasts. we analyzed  the cl response to viable and heat-killed microorganisms at 25 and 37 degrees c.  the cl response to all microorganisms was greater and more rapid at 37 degrees c. variable responses were observed with viable and heat-killed microorganisms; some were unaffected, whereas other demonstrated reduced cl. each microorganism caused a reproducible response pattern, which could be placed into two general categories. in the first category were those which caused a rapid exponential rise and decay in cl: enterobacter cloacae, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, and zymosan. in the second category were those which rose slowly over a longer time course to a poorly defined peak: pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus pyogenes. the cl response also reflected serum opsonic activity. the effect of inactivated complement, factor b, and removal of specific antibody were investigated. increasing the concentration of zymosan gave a proportional rise in peak cl; however, a strain of e. coli caused a variation in  peak time rather than peak height. different cl kinetics were shown for three strains of k. pneumoniae, possibly a result of each having different membrane or  cell wall characteristics. this study defines the nature and factors affecting the normal cl response to a variety of common pathogenic microorganisms.

TI  == do antibody-coated bacteria reflect local immune response in the urinary tract?
AB  == we examined whether antibody-coated bacteria (acb) reflect local immune response  or passive adsorption of immune globulins (ig). for this purpose, bacterial subcultures from infected urines and third-party bacteria were incubated with ig  preparations. these were obtained from infected urine either by removal of ig from acb (dissociation in alpha-methylmannoside, 0.1 m glycine-hcl, or 3 m nascn) or by staphylococcal protein a affinity chromatography from the supernatant of infected urine. coincubation of either ig preparation with bacterial substrains of the original urine and with third-party strains (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, several escherichia coli strains, enterococci, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus) caused coating of the bacterial surface with ig. coating was not measurably influenced by coincubation  with various carbohydrates or by preincubation of bacteria with glucosidases. adsorption of ig was observed after heat denaturation and formalin treatment of bacteria and was independent of bacterial growth phase. coating was observed both with intact igg and with f(ab)2 fragments. we further examined the proportion of  bacteria coated with iga, igg, and igm in urines of 200 bacteriuric women with symptomatic urinary tract infection. the frequency histogram plot showed a continuous nonlinear unimodal distribution. consequently, any selection of a 'normal range' is arbitrary. it is concluded that coating of the bacterial surface with ig may not necessarily reflect local immune response. a major problem of the acb test is definition of the normal range.

AB  == the following have been demonstrated: with a standardized model of p. mirabilis peritonitis in icr mice, when optimal doses of an aminoglycoside antibiotic (kanamycin) are given so as to reduce mortality maximally, abrupt and significant increments occur in endotoxemia, which cannot be attributed to impairment of clearance of endotoxin. within the antibiotic-treated groups, these increments in endotoxemia correlate with mortality. the level of endotoxemia in the antibiotic-treated survivors is significantly greater than in animals dying without antibiotic therapy. mp, although unable to reduce mortality from p. mirabilis peritonitis in the absence of antibiotic therapy, does so when endotoxin is added to the challenge inoculum. it is concluded from these observations that aminoglycoside antibiotic treatment can shift the lethal mechanisms during p. mirabilis peritonitis from those involving bacterial proliferation and low levels of endotoxemia to those involving bacterial death and release of large amounts of endotoxin. it is postulated that this shift in lethal mechanisms could account for the ability of mp to reduce mortality when used in conjunction with antibiotics. finally, since animals surviving after antibiotic treatment have significantly greater endotoxemia than those dying without such treatment and since mp does not reduce mortality in the absence of antibiotic therapy but does so if endotoxin is added to the challenge inoculum, it appears that endotoxin may not play a critical role in the pathogenesis of mortality from untreated p. mirabilis peritonitis. whether the present correlation observed between the significant rises in endotoxemia produced by antibiotics and the protection afforded by mp extends to other models of gram-negative sepsis, or to human gram-negative sepsis, is under study.

TI  == efficacy of ceftizoxime administered twice daily in hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections.
AB  == the efficacy and safety of ceftizoxime administered twice daily were evaluated in 215 hospitalized patients with documented lower respiratory tract infections. the majority of patients received 1 to 2 gm of ceftizoxime intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours; the mean dosage was 2 gm/day, and the mean duration of therapy was 8.9 days. clinical cure was achieved in 204 (95%) of the 215 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. one hundred and thirty-eight patients were both clinically and bacteriologically evaluable. the clinical response rates, by organism, were: streptococcus pneumoniae, 100% (50/50); haemophilus influenzae, 96% (25/26); gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter sp, serratia sp, pseudomonas sp, klebsiella sp, citrobacter sp, and morganella morganii), 86% (32/37); and staphylococcus aureus, 92% (12/13). in the other 77 patients with clinical symptoms, no pathogen was isolated or insufficient follow-up data were collected to assess bacteriologic response. adverse reactions, which were infrequent, were similar to those reported in other us trials of the drug. the findings indicate that ceftizoxime,  1 to 2 gm bid, is effective and safe in the treatment of lower respiratory tract  infections in hospitalized patients. this low-dose regimen can significantly reduce the cost of cephalosporin therapy.

TI  == a microbiological evaluation of apalcillin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of apalcillin was tested against 350 clinical isolates of escherichia coli, enterobacter, klebsiella, proteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus faecalis. using a minimal inhibitory concentration of 16 mg/l as the breakpoint, only 19.7% of the strains were resistant to apalcillin. a regression analysis demonstrated that it is possible to test bacteria for sensitivity with a 20 micrograms apalcillin disc. the results on mueller-hinton agar are very similar to those on iso-sensitest medium. like other ureido penicillins, apalcillin is sensitive to most beta-lactamases; it is effective against ampicillin-resistant strains since it penetrates the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria well and is highly effective against target proteins. strains producing high amounts of beta-lactamases do become resistant to apalcillin.

TI  == transferable resistance to cefotaxime, cefoxitin, cefamandole and cefuroxime in clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia marcescens.
AB  == in conjugational crosses, three klebsiella pneumoniae strains and one serratia marcescens strain have been demonstrated to transfer resistance determinants to newer types of cephalosporins. while klebsiella strains donated cefotaxime, cefamandole and cefuroxime resistance to escherichia coli k-12 recipients, the genetic analysis of exconjugants after the transfer of plasmids from serratia strains to proteus or salmonella recipients showed that the cefoxitin resistance  determinant was also co-transferred. in subsequent transfer cycles of this plasmid, cefotaxime and cefoxitin resistance determinants segregated in contrast  to the relative stability of plasmids derived from klebsiella strains in subsequent transfer cycles. from results obtained in this study, it may be concluded that in some strains of nosocomial enterobacteriaceae, resistance to newer cephalosporins could be transmissible and thus plasmid-located.

TI  == inhibition of bacterial multiplication by the iron chelator deferoxamine: potentiating effect of ascorbic acid.
AB  == since iron is essential for the multiplication of microorganisms, the effect of the iron chelator deferoxamine, with or without ascorbic acid, on the growth of 43 strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, alcaligenes faecalis, neisseria meningitidis and species of salmonella, enterobacter, pseudomonas and providencia, was investigated with the use of an automated turbidimeter. addition of deferoxamine (25-400 micrograms/ml) to the incubation medium was inhibitory in a dose-dependent fashion. at concentrations between 200-400 micrograms/ml, growth was about 25% lower than control values. however, when ascorbic acid (100 micrograms/ml) was added to the culture medium, this antimicrobial activity of deferoxamine was significantly increased to on average 75% of the control value (p less than 0.05). ascorbic acid alone had no bacteriostatic properties. growth  in the presence of 200 micrograms/ml deferoxamine combined with 100 micrograms/ml ascorbic acid was significantly lower than that in control media without additions (p less than 0.001). addition of ferric citrate to the culture medium at a concentration sufficient to saturate all of the deferoxamine with iron, abolished the growth inhibiting effect of deferoxamine. the results provide evidence that deferoxamine is bacteriostatic due to its capacity to deplete iron  which would otherwise be used for bacterial multiplication, and that ascorbic acid enhances this antibacterial property of deferoxamine.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftriaxone, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was tested  against 450 strains isolated from blood cultures and compared with that of various other antibiotics. the compound was comparable to cefotaxime for all species tested. it was more potent than cefoperazone, cefamandole and ticarcillin in inhibiting enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp. and serratia marcescens). the mic95 of ceftriaxone for these strains was 0.5 microgram/ml. the drug was less active against staphylococcus aureus than cefamandole, cloxacillin and vancomycin, but most isolates were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftriaxone was comparable in activity to ticarcillin (mic95 = 64 micrograms/ml), and inferior to cefoperazone, ceftazidime and cefsulodine. levels of ceftriaxone in serum and various body fluids were determined by bio-assays. due to its very long half-life (8 h), ceftriaxone serum levels 24 h after i.v. or i.m. injection of 1 and 2 g were still above the mic95  of all strains tested except pseudomonas aeruginosa. levels in bile, synovial and cerebro-spinal fluids were high.

AB  == for two years transferable antibiotic resistance (tar) was studied by replicator  methods in strains of enterobacteriaceae isolated in a 900-bed hospital. transfer to an escherichia coli recipient was demonstrated in 21% of 7,800 enterobacteriaceae. it was most common in klebsiella (37% of isolates) and least  in acinetobacter (6%). the mean number of phenotypic resistance markers (rms) transferred was higher from klebsiella pneumoniae or enterobacter cloacae than from e. coli or p. mirabilis. k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae especially transferred 7 or more rms much more often than other species. some rms were associated with a particular species, e.g. streptomycin with e. coli, kanamycin or gentamicin with  e. cloacae and kanamycin with p. mirabilis. the same was true of certain patterns of resistance transfer, e.g. ap-km and p. mirabilis, ap-sm and e. coli, ap-km-gm-tm-cm and k. pneumoniae. however, many of the commonest resistance phenotypes were transferred from several species and from several biotypes within any given species. resistance patterns transferred from e. coli were detected sporadically throughout, whereas many of those transferred from klebsiella, enterobacter or proteus were found only for a limited time.

TI  == relationship between cecal population levels of indigenous bacteria and translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes.
AB  == translocation is defined as the passage of viable bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the mesenteric lymph nodes (mln) and other organs. the  extent of translocation of certain indigenous, oxygen-tolerant bacteria from the  cecum to the mln, spleen, liver, kidney, and peritoneal cavity were determined in diassociated or triassociated gnotobiotic mice. minimal bacterial translocation occurred to the spleen, liver, kidney, or peritoneal cavity. however, most bacterial strains readily translocated to the mln. the percentage of the total population of each bacterial strain in the ceca was compared with the percentage  of the total population of that strain in the mln. there was a direct relationship between the numbers of a particular bacterial strain populating the  ceca of diassociated or triassociated mice and the numbers of viable bacteria of  this strain present in the mln. thus, the cecal population level of a particular  bacterial strain determined the numbers of viable bacteria of this strain translocating to the mln. the translocation of these bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract is an important first step in the pathogenesis of infection caused by members of the normal intestinal microflora.

TI  == evolution of complex resistance transposons from an ancestral mercury transposon.
AB  == the molecular interrelationship of a transposon family which confers multiple antibiotic resistance and is assumed to have been generated from an ancestral mercury transposon was analyzed. initially, the transposons tn2613 (7.2 kilobases), encoding mercury resistance, and tn2608 (13.5 kilobases), encoding mercury, streptomycin, and sulfonamide resistances, were isolated and their structures were analyzed. next, the following transposons were compared with respect to their genetic and physical maps: tn2613 and tn501, encoding mercury resistance; tn2608 and tn21, encoding mercury, streptomycin, and sulfonamide resistance; tn2607 and tn4, encoding streptomycin, sulfonamide, and ampicillin resistance; and tn2603, encoding mercury, streptomycin, sulfonamide, and ampicillin resistance. the results suggest that the transposons encoding multiple resistance were evolved from an ancestral mercury transposon.

TI  == [susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefotaxime].
AB  == susceptibilities of 737 strains of 19 species of bacteria to cefotaxime (ctx) were determined based on the inhibition zone diameter obtained by the single-disc method. four categories were assessed. 1. susceptibility of clinical isolates to  ctx and 6 other antibiotics against most strains, ctx showed higher antibacterial activity than other drugs (cet, abpc, sbpc, cmz, gm, amk), especially for s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae. furthermore, ctx was more active than  the other antibiotics against e. coli, indole (+) proteus, p. mirabilis, klebsiella sp., s. marcescens, h. influenzae and e. cloacae. 2. susceptibility of strains isolated from different clinical materials ctx showed the highest antibacterial activity against most strains isolated from sputum, urine, pus, blood and cerebrospinal fluid. however, ctx was occasionally less than potent amk and gm against strains isolated from bile. against p. aeruginosa strains derived  from clinical materials, the following results were obtained: amk greater than cfs, fom greater than ctx greater than gm greater than sbpc 3. susceptibility of  clinical isolates in 7 different fields ctx was the most active antibiotic tested in the fields of internal medicine, pediatrics, urology, obstetrics & gynecology, dermatology and otorhinolaryngology. but in surgery, ctx was less potent than gm  and amk. 4. susceptibility of clinical isolates of inpatients and outpatients ctx showed excellent activity against many beta-lactamase resistant strains isolated  from patients.

TI  == transtracheal aspiration in pulmonary infection in children with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == six transtracheal aspirations (tta) and expectorated sputum specimens were collected from four children suffering from cystic fibrosis who had pulmonary infection. specimens obtained from both sites were cultured for aerobic bacteria  and tta aspirates were also cultured for anaerobes. differences in bacteria isolated in tta and sputum aspirates were present in all instances. six isolates  were recovered in both sites (three pseudomonas aeruginosa, two staphylococcus aureus and one aspergillus flavus). five aerobic isolates were recovered only in  the expectorated sputum and not in tta aspirations (two klebsiella pneumoniae and one each of p. aeruginosa, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis). nine organisms were isolated only from the tta (two each of veillonella parvula and alpha hemolytic streptococci, and one each of bacteroides fragilis, b. melaninogenicus, lactobacillus sp., haemophilus influenzae and gamma hemolytic streptococci). the recovery of anaerobic organisms from four of the six tta specimens suggests a possible role for these organisms in the etiology of pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis. we found tta to be helpful in the bacterial diagnosis and management of pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis.

TI  == preliminary report comparing piperacillin and carbenicillin for complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  == piperacillin is a new semisynthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of in vitro  activity against common gram-negative urinary tract pathogens. we compared the efficacy and safety of piperacillin versus carbenicillin in patients with complicated urinary tract infection. a total of 56 adult patients (mean age 55 years) in stable medical condition with 1 or more structural genitourinary abnormalities entered the study. of these patients 27 were evaluated for antibiotic efficacy. there were 20 lower tract and 7 upper tract infections, of which 17 were acute and 10 were chronic. patients were randomized into 2 groups:  17 patients with 18 organisms received single agent treatment with 181 mg. per kg. intravenous piperacillin daily for 6 days and 10 patients with 11 organisms received 270 mg. per kg. intravenous carbenicillin daily for 6 days. infecting organisms were escherichia coli 45 per cent, proteus mirabilis 14 per cent, klebsiella pneumoniae 14 per cent. enterobacter species 10 per cent, pseudomonas  aeruginosa 7 per cent and so forth. antimicrobial susceptibility assessed by measurement of minimal inhibitory concentration and disk diffusion zone size demonstrated superior activity of piperacillin over carbenicillin for most micro-organisms tested. all patients responded clinically. the bacteriologic cure rate was 72 per cent at 5 to 9 days after therapy in both groups. three patients  who received piperacillin had urosepsis and were cured. no resistance emerged during therapy. superinfections developed in 5 patients on carbenicillin (50 per  cent) and in 4 patients on piperacillin (24 per cent), and none was resistant to  piperacillin. superinfections were attributed to catheterization and structural genitourinary abnormalities. the over-all incidence of adverse effects in patients on piperacillin was less than that of those on carbenicillin, 31 and 51  per cent respectively. side effects in both groups were mild and did not require  discontinuation of therapy. there were no significant alterations in fluid and electrolyte balance, or hematologic or renal function.

AB  == the activity of three aminoglycosides and six beta-lactam antibiotics on strains  of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococci was studied. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics), the minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs), and the minimal antibiotic concentrations (macs) were determined after 5 h of incubation in broth cultures by colony-forming-unit counts. the mics were also determined by agar dilution after 24 h of incubation. the mics on agar after 24 h of incubation were higher than those in broth after 5 h of incubation. the differences ranged from 1.1- to 14.2-fold, but in most cases were only three- to  fivefold (p less than 0.05 to less than 0.001). the mbcs at 5 and 24 h were comparable in 71% of tests. for current practice, the mbc of enterococci can be determined after 5 h of incubation with antibiotics. the aminoglycosides showed mbcs which were closer to the mics than were those of the beta-lactam antibiotics, which required a higher multiple of the mic to show a bactericidal effect. the mbcs of oxacillin and cefamandole for s. aureus after 5 h of incubation were greater than 128 times the respective mics. the macs ranged from  1/1.5 to 1/7 of the 5-h mics. the three endpoints, mic, mbc, and mac, indicate the antibacterial range of an antibiotic in terms of inhibition of growth and bacterial survival. the data suggest that the antibacterial range of an antibiotic is similar for most strains of a given species and is, to some extent, a characteristic of similar antibiotics.

TI  == [curative action of mezlocillin on experimental infections in mice (author's transl)].
AB  == the curative action of mezlocillin on 10 severe experimental infections in mice was determined and expressed as effective dose 50 (ed50). the ed50 against infections produced by 5 strains of gram-positive bacteria was distinctly lower than the ed50 against infections produced by 5 strains of gram-negative bacteria. infections due to proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae were the least susceptible to mezlocillin. the determination of mics and mbcs of mezlocillin against the strains used in the experiments showed a linear relationship between  mbc and ed50 for listeria spp., e. coli spp., s. typhimurium and pr. mirabilis. for strains of 3 species (s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae and e. insidiosa) with very  low mbcs, the ed50 was related to virulence. the diversity of the results shows that various types of experimental infections should be used when testing an antibiotic.

TI  == influence of bacterial products on the motility of stallion spermatozoa.
AB  == sterile filtrates were prepared from equine isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (genitalium), proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus zooepidemicus, streptococcus equisimilis, actinobacillus equuli, and corynebacterium equi and mixed individually with extended stallion semen. when diluted in the extended semen the filtrates represented bacterial populations of 0.5 x 10(6), 1 x 10(6), 2 x 10(6) and 4 x 10(6) cells/ml. ph values were recorded for each filtrate. specimens were monitored for percentage motile spermatozoa at 30-min intervals until they reached 10% or less for 2 consecutive observations. all specimens were maintained at 25 degrees c in a water bath. ten specimens were examined from each of 5 clinically normal stallions. the major reduction in percentage motile spermatozoa as compared to the control sample occurred before the first observation. from this point the rate of deterioration in motility in the filtrates approximated that of the control. the differences detected between the filtrates and control in percentage motile sperm cells were all statistically significant at p less than 0.01.

TI  == biochemistry and action of clavulanic acid.
AB  == the destruction of amoxycillin by beta-lactamase action represents an important mechanism of bacterial resistance to the drug. data is presented to illustrate that clavulanic acid used in the form of its potassium salt inhibits the amoxycillin destroying action of many different types of beta-lactamase for example: the staphylococcal enzyme, the clinically important plasmid mediated enzymes of the tem, shv, oxa and pse types and the chromosomally controlled enzymes produced by proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae. the mechanisms by which clavulanic acid inhibits beta-lactamases and potentiates the antibacterial action of amoxycillin are discussed.

AB  == infection with opportunistic agents was reproduced in rabbits by introduction of  proteus and klebsiella bacteria into a section of the narrowed (but not ligated)  small intestine. the presence of infection was documented by clinical signs, isolation of the causative agents, and immunological changes. light and electron  microscopy revealed an inflammatory process of the type of catarrhal enteritis with predominant involvement of the epithelial sheet ("epithelitis") and reactive changes in the base of the mucous membrane and submucous layer. morphological differences of the infections caused by proteus and klebsiella were demonstrated. the level and intensity of pathological changes appear to be associated with the  degree of conditionality of the pathogenic properties of enterobacteria.

TI  == in vitro adherence of bacteria to prosthetic vascular grafts.
AB  == the adherence of staphylococci and enterobacteriaceae radiolabelled with 3h-thymidine to dacron and polytetrafluoroethylene prosthetic vascular graft materials was investigated using an in vitro method. adherence readily occurred after a few minutes of incubation. enterobacteriaceae adhered to dacron in a 10-100 times greater number per mm of length than to polytetrafluoroethylene. the addition of velour to the dacron graft further increased the number of adherent bacteria. in contrast, the adherence of coagulase-negative and positive staphylococci per mm of length was roughly the same to dacron and polytetrafluoroethylene. the adherence of bacteria to vascular graft materials may be part of the underlying pathogenesis of vascular graft infections and differential adherence amongst various graft materials could be of clinical importance. however, in the absence of controlled clinical studies, the significance of these findings remains to be determined.

TI  == complementary activity of mezlocillin and the combination of amoxicillin with clavulanic acid on enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == the mics of amoxicillin, mezlocillin and brl 25,000, a combination of two parts amoxicillin and one part clavulanic acid (2am + 1ca), were measured for 331 enterobacteriaceae strains which produced beta-lactamases as demonstrated by nitrocefin. the mic values for mezlocillin and the combination 2am + 1ca were very similar for the total number of the strains investigated. when investigated  separately according to the bacterial species, three different sensitivity groups were established for the above-mentioned preparations: 1) species with the same or similar sensitivity to mezlocillin and 2am + 1ca (escherichia coli and shigella spp., amoxicillin-resistant strains); 2) species which were more sensitive to mezlocillin than to the combination 2am + 1ca (citrobacter spp., enterobacter cloacae, serratia spp. and indole-positive proteus as well as strains of e. coli and shigella spp. which produce a cephalosporinase and are sensitive to amoxicillin); 3) species which are more sensitive to 2am + 1ca than  to mezlocillin (amoxicillin-resistant salmonella spp., proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae). this complementary activity of mezlocillin and 2am + 1ca  against enterobacteriaceae depended on the beta-lactamases produced.

TI  == the inhibition of beta-lactamases from gram-negative bacteria by clavulanic acid.
AB  == the beta-lactamase from klebsiella pneumoniae e70 behaved in a similar fashion to the tem-2 plasmid mediated enzyme on reaction with clavulanic acid. both enzymes  produced two types of enzyme-clavulanate complex, a transiently stable species (t((1/2))=4min at ph7.3 and 37 degrees c) and irreversibly inhibited enzyme. in the initial rapid reaction (2.5min) the enzymes partitioned between the transient and irreversible complexes in the ratios 3:1 for tem-2 beta-lactamase and 1:1 for klebsiella beta-lactamase. biphasic inactivation was observed for both enzymes and the slower second phase was rate limited by the decay of the transiently stable complex. this decay released free enzyme for further reaction with fresh clavulanic acid, the products again partitioning between transiently stable and irreversibly inhibited enzyme. this cycle continued until all the enzyme had been irreversibly inhibited. a 115 molar excess of inhibitor was required to achieve complete inactivation of tem-2 beta-lactamase. hydrolysis of clavulanic acid with product release appeared to occur with the inhibition reaction, which explained this degree of clavulanic acid turnover. the stoichiometry of the interaction with klebsiella beta-lactamase was not examined. the penicillinase from proteus mirabilis c889 was rapidly inhibited by low concentrations of clavulanic acid. the major product was a moderately stable complex (t((1/2))=40min at ph7.3 and 37 degrees c); the proportion of the enzyme that was irreversibly inactivated was small. the cephalosporinase from enterobacter cloacae p99 had low affinity for the inhibitor and only reacted with high concentrations of clavulanic acid (k=4.0m(-1).s(-1)) to produce a relatively stable complex (t((1/2))=180min at ph7.3 and 37 degrees c). no irreversible inactivation of this enzyme was detected. the rates of decay of the clavulanate-enzyme complexes produced in reactions with proteus and enterobacter enzymes were markedly increased at acid ph.

TI  == [prerequisites for enhancement of the efficacy of fosfomycin by glucose-6-phosphate in treatment of experimentally infected animals (author's transl)].
AB  == in chemotherapy of otherwise fatally infected mice (intraperitoneally) the effective dose50 (ed50) of fosfomycin (2 single doses, subcutaneous application 1 and 6 h post infect.) was decreased significantly by supplementing the antibiotic solution with 100 mg glucose-6-phosphate (g-6-p) per kg animal and per injection  if also the mic of the infecting strain (klebsiella oxytoca and k. aerogenes ii)  was lowered by addition of g-6-p (25 mg/l) to the nutrient medium (table 1 and 2). with strains not exhibiting any influence on the mic no such effect was observed (table 1). from this it is concluded that the enhancement of antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin in vivo is based on the same mechanism as in vitro. this mechanism is the initiation of a second route of transportation into  the bacterial cell (7), the hexose-6-phosphate transport system that apparently is inducible not only in vitro but also in vivo. blood levels of g-6-p sufficient or above to induce this system in vitro (5 mg/l) were being held with doses of 100 mg/kg body weight in dogs during 70 to 120 min (fig. 3) and 45 to 70 min (fig. 4) when applied subcutaneously or intravenously respectively. these periods of contact area adequate to induce a considerable decrease of the mic. with the strain used (k. oxytoca) the mic of 128 mg/l was lowered by contact with g-6-p during 60 or 120 min to 16 or 8 mg/l respectively (fig. 5). for full induction of the hexose-6-phosphate system resulting in a mic of 2 mg/l however, 8 h were necessary. from the above findings it is concluded that clinical studies are necessary. as g-6-p is a (short-lived) physiological product of cell metabolism and nontoxic such studies are justifiable in cases where therapeutic use of fosfomycin can be regarded as an indication.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of ceftazidime was compared with the activities of cefoperazone, cefotaxime, cefsulodin, cefuroxime, cephalothin and cefatriaxon against 331 clinical bacterial isolates. against escherichia coli, salmonella, enterobacter, proteus mirabilis and indole-positive proteus ceftazidime, with mic90 of < or = 0.25 mg/l, was more active than cephalothin, cefoperazone and cefuroxime but less active than cefotaxime and ceftriaxone klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia, acinetobacter and citrobacter were inhibited at higher concentrations (mic90 1-4 mg/l). the activity of ceftazidime against pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mic90 of 4 mg/l) was four times that of cefoperazone, five times that of cefatriaxon and ten times that of cefotaxime, but similar to that of cefsulodin.  against staphylococcus aureus and lancefield groups a and b streptococci ceftazidime was less active than the other cephalosporins. group d streptococci were resistant. haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by < or = 0.25 mg/l. there were no significant inoculum effects on ceftazidime and mbcs were within one twofold dilution of mics. the addition of 50% human serum had no effect on mics and mbcs.

AB  == three new cephalosporins, ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, and cefotiam, were evaluated  in vitro against clinical isolates, and their activities were compared with those of other cephalosporins, mezlocillin, and tobramycin. all three new cephalosporins were very active against gram-positive cocci (except enterococci), but mezlocillin was more active against streptococcus ssp. cefotiam and cefamandole were the most active antibiotics against streptococcus aureus. ceftazidime had broad-spectrum activity against all gram-negative bacilli tested, except enterobacter spp. ceftizoxime was active against all, except enterobacter  spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. although cefotiam was quite active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, it was inactive against indole-positive proteus spp., serratia spp, and p. aeruginosa. the in vitro activity suggests that ceftazidime should prove useful as a broad-spectrum  antibiotic, in those settings in which the most likely pathogens are gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == hemagglutination of human type o erythrocytes, hemolysin production, and serogrouping of escherichia coli isolates from patients with acute pyelonephritis, cystitis, and asymptomatic bacteriuria.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to study potential virulence factors associated with escherichia coli urinary pathogens isolated from patients with urinary tract infection. these factors were compared with characteristics of normal-flora e. coli isolated from stool specimens of healthy individuals without a history of urinary tract infection. the potential virulence factor focused on in this study was hemagglutination (ha) of human type o erythrocytes by e. coli urinary pathogens. a total of 265 strains of e. coli isolated from patients with  urinary tract infections were tested for their ability to hemagglutinate human type o erythrocytes; of these, 148 (56%) were ha positive. only 6 of 36 fecal e.  coli strains (17%) isolated from healthy controls were ha positive. this significant association of the presence of hemagglutinin on e. coli that causes urinary tract infections indicates the likelihood that ha is a marker of virulence. only 12% (5 of 43) of proteus mirabilis and 3% (3 of 104) of klebsiella pneumoniae urinary isolates were ha positive. there was a trend for ha-positive e. coli to be isolated from patients with kidney infections and positive tests for antibody-coated bacteria rather than bladder infections and negative tests for antibody-coated bacteria, although the difference was not statistically significant. there was a significant correlation (p < 0.025) between hemolysin production and ha; 67% (69 of 103) of the isolates that produced hemolysin also hemagglutinated human type o erythrocytes. there was no significant correlation between ha and motility, although there was a trend for flagellated organisms to be non-hemagglutinators. there was a marked correlation  between the presence of hemagglutinin and the serogroup of the e. coli isolate; serogroups o4, o7, and o50 were almost always ha positive (57 of 63; 90%). in contrast, serogroups o8 and o25 were rarely ha positive (2 of 30; 7%).

TI  == evaluation of the four-hour micro-id technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative, gram-negative rods from blood cultures.
AB  == a 4-h micro-id technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative gram-negative rods from positive blood cultures was compared to subculture and species identification of single colonies by api 20e and micro-id, using standardized inocula. a total of 127 patients (220 positive cultures) were studied. isolates included 96 escherichia coli, 46 klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 klebsiella oxytoca, 8 enterobacter aerogenes, 17 enterobacter cloacae, 19 serratia marcescens, 2 serratia liquefaciens, 8 proteus mirabilis, 1 salmonella species, 1 morganella morganii, 6 haemophilus influenzae, 2 haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 bacteroides fragilis, 3 acinetobacter calcoaceticus biotype anitratus, and 1 pseudomonas maltophilia. in 90% of the cultures, identification  by micro-id was identical to that obtained after subculture; if the 15 non-enterobacterial isolates were excluded, the corresponding figure was 96.6%. enterobacteria identified incorrectly by direct micro-id were three s. marcescens (two identified as s. liquefaciens, one as hafnia alvei), two s. liquefaciens (both identified as e. cloacae), and two k. pneumoniae (one identified as klebsiella ozaenae, the other as serratia rubidaea). none of the 15 non-enterobacterial cultures were correctly identified by micro-id (non-identifiable, or classified as providencia/yersinia/klebsiella species). although biochemical discrepancies between direct and final micro-id tests occurred in 41% of the enterobacterial cultures, this did not seriously interfere with identification. direct species identification of enterobacteriaceae from blood cultures by direct micro-id is accurate and easily performed and identified organisms within 4 h compared to at least 24 h by most other methods; the direct  micro-id technique would be rendered even more valuable by the additional capability of identifying non-enterobacterial gram-negative isolates.

TI  == in vitro activity of n-formimidoyl thienamycin (mk0787), a crystalline derivative of thienamycin.
AB  == n-formimidoyl thienamycin (mk0787) is a derivative of thienamycin, a unique, new  beta-lactam antibiotic. its activity against 285 aerobic and facultatively anaerobic clinical isolates was compared with the activities of cephalothin, ampicillin, penicillin g, ticarcillin, and tobramycin. all of the 285 isolates, with the exception of 1 staphylococcus epidermidis isolate, were inhibited by a concentration of n-formimidoyl thienamycin of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. more than 50% of all isolates were inhibited by the lowest concentration of n-formimidoyl thienamycin tested (0.125 micrograms/ml); 98% of staphylococcus aureus and 80% of s. epidermidis isolates were inhibited by n-formimidoyl thienamycin at a concentration of 0.125 micrograms/ml. only 2 of 45 enterococci were not inhibited by 1 microgram of n-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml, and this drug was the most active agent tested against 162 gram-negative bacilli. it inhibited more than 95% of the gram-negative isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. n-formimidoyl thienamycin was as active or more active than tobramycin against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis and substantially more active than  ticarcillin. all 16 isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms of n-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml. the marked in vitro activity of this drug against a wide variety of clinical isolates makes it  a promising new antibiotic.

TI  == cefamandole treatment of pulmonary infection caused by gram-negative rods.
AB  == the increasing incidence of pneumonia caused by h. influenza and the problem of beta lactamase production (18% of strains in recent reports) are important considerations in the therapy of pneumonia. an antibiotic that is effective for these strains and other common respiratory pathogens will be useful for the therapy of pneumonia. cefamandole nafate is a new cephalosporin antibiotic with an antimicrobial spectrum similar to cephalothin with increased activity against  escherichia coli, proteus spp., enterobacter spp., and haemophilus influenzae. seventeen patients with pneumonia presumed to be due to susceptible gram-negative organisms isolated from transtracheal aspirate or sputum were treated with 6 to 8 g/day of parenteral cefamandole nafate. organisms isolated were haemophilus influenzae in 6, e. coli in 3, proteus mirabilis in 2, klebsiella pneumoniae in 1, serratia marcescens in 1 and mixed gram-negative rods in 4. the serratia were  resistant (mic greater than 100 microgram/ml and 50 microgram/ml): other mic's ranged from 0.2 to 6.2 microgram/ml; median 1.6 microgram/ml. satisfactory clinical response (improvement in pulmonary function; resolution of infiltrate; decrease in temperature, sputum production and white count) was noted in 13 of 17 patients. two patients died from their underlying disease. adverse clinical reactions questionably related to cefamandole included sgot rises in 3 and rash in one. serum antibiotic levels were 22.0 to 88.0 microgram/ml (peak) and 1.1 to  12.5 microgram/ml (trough). sputum levels were 0.27 to 2.5 microgram/ml. cefamandole appears to be an effective antibiotic for treatment of gram-negative  pneumonia caused by susceptible organisms.

AB  == the requirements for immunoglobulin and the alternative and classical complement  pathways for phagocytosis and intracellular killing of clinical isolates of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens by normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes were determined. human sera deficient in immunoglobulin or classical pathway activity, or both, were compared for their ability to promote phagocytosis os and killing of 13 bacterial strains by the polymorphonuclear leukocytes. seven of the thirteen microorganisms required immunoglobulin for phagocytosis and killing and utilized only the classical complement pathway. three required immunoglobulin and utilized both the classical and alternative pathways. the other three microorganisms required minimal immunoglobulin and utilized the alternative or classical pathway, or both. none of the microorganisms utilized the alternative pathway in immunoglobulin-deficient sera or could be forced to utilize this pathway in sera  deficient in both immunoglobulin and classical pathway activity. these results demonstrated a heterogeneity in the requirements for immunoglobulin and the alternative and classical complement pathways for phagocytosis and intracellular  killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes among various genera of gram-negative aerobic bacilli, as well as among strains of the same species. in addition, the results suggested that a mechanism of classical pathway activation dependent upon minimal immunoglobulin participates in phagocytosis and intracellular killing of  certain gram-negative aerobic bacilli.

TI  == lethal effect of complement and lysozyme on polymyxin-treated, serum-resistant gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == when genetically serum-resistant escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and citrobacter freundii, but not pseudomonas aeruginosa or proteus mirabilis, were exposed to polymyxin b, they became susceptible to the bactericidal action of normal human and rabbit sera. in constrast, beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics did not render any serum-resistant bacteria serum-sensitive. synergy  between polymyxin b and the serum bactericidal system could be demonstrated by the addition of polymyxin b to bacteria in vitro, as well as to bacilli in serum  from rabbits injected with the antibiotic. polymyxin b-treated bacteria were killed by normal, lysozyme-depleted, c2-deficient, and hypogammaglobulinemic sera, but not by heated or c6-deficient sera. these findings indicate that polymyxin b-treated bacteria can be killed via the alternative complement pathway. however, c3 and c3b were detected on the surface of serum-resistant e. coli, regardless of whether the bacteria had been treated with polymyxin b. this  observation suggests that a change in susceptibility to the alternative complement pathway was not the only explanation for the acquired serum sensitivity. polymyxin b may also affect a step in the complement sequence beyond the activation of c3, a step that is apparently blocked in serum-resistant gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == experimental gram-negative bacterial sepsis: prevention of mortality not preventable by antibiotics alone.
AB  == outbred swiss mice were inoculated intraperitoneally or intravenously with one 90 to 100% lethal dose of escherichia coli o:18, proteus mirabilis, or klebsiella pneumoniae. after carefully timed intervals, aminoglycoside antibiotics were begun at dosages nnd intervals predetermined to constitute optimal therapy. with  progressive increases in delay of antibiotic therapy, mortality rates increased progressively from 0% to 90 to 100%. standardized models of infection were developed by selecting delay periods before initiating antibiotic therapy such that 50 to 70% mortalities resulted. utilizing these models, agents with reputed  anti-endotoxin activity were administered concomitantly with the delayed antibiotic therapy to determine if any could prevent gram-negative septic mortality no longer preventable by the antibiotics alone. the following were observed: (i) adrenal corticosteroids prevented mortality that was no longer preventable by optimal aminoglycoside antibiotics alone. the following were preventable by optimal aminoglycoside antibiotic therapy alone; (ii) specific antisera also did so, provided anaphylaxis was circumvented; (iii) in one model (p. mirabilis), such protection by adrenal corticosteroids and specific antiserum could be additive; (iv) adrenal corticosteroids and specific antiserum acted synergistically with the aminoglycoside antibiotics--no protection was achieved by delayed administration of the steroids or antiserum alone; (v) timing was crucial--the synergistic protective activity of adrenal corticosteroids and of specific antiserum with aminoglycosides declined rapidly as infection progressed; (vi) cyclophosphamide pretreatment markedly impaired the synergistic protective activity of specific antiserum and of adrenal corticosteroids with aminoglycosides; (vii) no reputed anti-endotoxin agents other than adrenal corticosteroids and specific antiserum proved capable of preventing mortality not preventable by aminoglycoside antibiotics alone. these included antisera to rough mutant enterobacteriaceae of rc, rd, and re chemotypes, anticoagulants (heparin), ascorbic acid, antiproteolytic agents (aprotinin), alpha adrenergic blockers (phenoxybenzamine), prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors (acetylsalicylic acid, sodium salicylate, indomethacin), nicotinamide, glucose, and insulin-glucose-potassium mixtures.

TI  == bactericidal activity of cefadroxil, cephalexin, and cephradine in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model.
AB  == cefadroxil (duricef, mead johnson and company), resembles cephalexin and cephradine in spectrum of antibacterial activity but differs in human pharmacokinetic properties. whether the latter are likely to affect activity in vivo was assessed by determining bactericidal activity against clinical isolates  under conditions simulating the variation of drug concentration in the blood stream after an oral dose of 500 mg to adults. in this kinetic model, cefadroxil  was more active than cephalexin or cephradine against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and one of two strains of escherichia coli. the other strain of e. coli was virtually unaffected by the cephalosporins. s. pyogenes was equally susceptible to all three cephalosporins. analysis of the results suggest that the pharmocokinetic properties of an antibiotic affect its activity in the blood stream, provided the susceptibility of the infecting organism is concentration-dependent within the range of drug concentration occurring in serum.

AB  == the production of lipase and phospolipase by certain members of the enterobacteriaceae was examined by thin-layer chromatography of resting-cell suspensions incubated with triolein or lecithin. most strains of serratia marcescens produced both enzymes while most strains of serratia liquefaciens exhibited strong lipase but only a minor phospholipase activity. enterobacter spp. (25 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (20 strains), escherichia coli (15 strains), citrobacter freundii (7 strains) and proteus spp. (20 strains) lacked both types of enzymic activity except for the following: three strains of enterobacter cloacae, two of proteus mirabilis and three of proteus vulgaris possessed slight lipase activity; about one-half of the enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter hafniae strains examined produced slight phospholipase activity. it is suggested that tests for lipase and phospholipase should be used in conjunction with those for dnaase production and sugar fermentation for the differentiation of s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens.

TI  == combined activitiy of clavulanic acid and ticarcillin against ticarcillin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == fifty-one clinical isolates of ticarcillin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli were  tested for susceptibility to combinations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid (brl 14151), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were measured by a microdilution method, and minimal bactericidal concentrations for selected strains were measured by the broth dilution method. ticarcillin mics were >/=128 mug/ml for all and >/=512 mug/ml for 38 (75%) of the strains. thirty-nine strains of enterobacteriaceae tested included escherichia coli (14), klebsiella pneumoniae (16), citrobacter sp. (3), enterobacter sp. (3), salmonella enteritidis (1), serratia marcescens (1), and proteus mirabilis (1). ticarcillin mics for 34 strains (88%) were lowered at least threefold by the addition of 1.0 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. against 33 strains (85%), the mics were 64 mug or less per ml in the presence of 5 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. in contrast, the mics for seven of eight strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were unaffected by the addition of up to 10 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. ticarcillin with 5 mug of clavulanic acid per ml was bactericidal against ticarcillin-resistant (mic >/= 2,048 mug/ml) e. coli, k. pneumoniae, enterobacter, and p. mirabilis.

AB  == in vitro activity of bl-s786, a new parenterally semisynthetic cephalosporin, was investigated against 570 bacterial isolates. bl-s786 inhibited most escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella. it inhibited some enterobacter and indole-positive proteus, but it was less active against these later species than was cefamandole, cefuroxime, or cefoxitin. it was not active against serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or bacteroides fragilis. bl-s786 was the least active new cephalosporin tested against staphylococci and was less active than cephalothin against streptococcal species. the activity of bl-s786 was not altered by the type of assay medium nor by 50% serum. the size of the test inoculum altered the minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations  for inhibition of some organisms, particularly those with richmond type i beta-lactamases. bl-s786 was not hydrolyzed by the r-factor-mediated, richmond type iii beta-lactamase, but it was hydrolyzed by type i beta-lactamases.

AB  == twenty-six patients, 20 to 77 years of age, were treated with netilmicin, mean dose 2 mg/kg every 8 h intramuscularly or in a 20-min intravenous infusion. the mean serum half-lives in patients with creatinine clearances of >/=90 ml/min and  60 to 90 ml/min were 3.2 and 3.4 h, respectively. in patients with serum creatinines of </=1.4 mg/100 ml and creatinine clearances of >/=60 ml/min, mean serum levels were 9.0 and 1.2 mug/ml, respectively, 5 to 15 min and 7.5 h post-intravenous infusion, and 7.1 and 1.7 mug/ml, respectively, 1 and 8 h post-intramuscular injection. twenty-five patients had acute pyelonephritis; 7 of the 25 had bacteremia. the infecting bacteria were escherichia coli (15), proteus mirabilis (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), klebsiella pneumoniae (1), enterobacter hafniae (1), and both proteus rettgeri and proteus morganii (1). all were inhibited by 6.3 mug of netilmicin per ml, except for the p. rettgeri, which required 25 mug/ml for inhibition. of 23 patients who could be evaluated, 19 were bacteriologically and clinically cured at follow-up. of the remaining four, one relapsed, two became reinfected, and one was lost to follow-up. five patients developed nephrotoxicity; two of the five had previous renal insufficiency. three patients, one with abnormal renal function, developed ototoxicity detected only with audiograms. these studies suggest that netilmicin is effective in serious gram-negative bacillary infections, but is nephrotoxic and ototoxic in humans.

AB  == apalcillin (pc-904) is active against carbenicillin- and ampicillin-resistant strains of gram-negative bacilli. among pseudomonas aeruginosa strains highly resistant to carbenicillin (>/=3,200 mug/ml), half of them were susceptible to pc-904 at a concentration of 50 to 1,600 mug/ml. the minimal inhibitory concentration of pc-904 against p. aeruginosa strains resistant to carbenicillin  (400 to 1,600 mug/ml) ranged from 3.1 to 25 mug/ml. ampicillin- and carbenicillin-resistant enterobacteriaceae strains were similarly susceptible to  pc-904. however, drug resistance to pc-904 was already apparent among some strains of p. aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and p. morganii, recently isolated in japan; i.e., 4, 35, 32, 4, 6, and 14% of strains isolated were resistant. pc-904 was more active, on  the other hand, than ampicillin and carbenicillin against antibiotic-susceptible  enterobacteriaceae and also showed high activity against most species of pseudomonadaceae, especially p. cepacia and p. aeruginosa. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of pc-904 were greatly affected by inoculum size when the organisms tested were strains producing large amounts of beta-lactamase.

AB  == measuring ethanol formed from arabinose by escherichia coli and dimethyl disulphide formed from methionine by proteus mirabilis is a rapid way of detecting these organisms in the urine. ethanol and dimethyl disulphide are detected by head-space gas-liquid chromatography. since sedimented organisms and  not whole urine are used the method is not subject to interference from compounds within the urine. when it was tested on 122 samples of urine, 94 from patients with suspected urinary infection and 28 supposedly uninfected control specimens,  the results correlated well with viable counts by a conventional bacteriological  method. as well as being rapid (results available in four hours) the method is reliable, easy to use, and could be automated. it now requires extensive testing  in a hospital laboratory.

AB  == cefaclor (lilly 99638) and cefatrizine (bl-s640, sk&f 70771) are orally absorbed, broad-spectrum semisynthetic cephalosporins. they were compared in vitro with cephalexin, cephaloglycin, and cepharadine against a variety of aerobic pathogenic bacteria by an agar dilution procedure. cefaclor and cefatrizine were  found to be similar or superior to cephalexin, cephaloglycin, and cephradine in terms of activity against gram-positive cocci other than enterococci. only cefatrizine demonstrated any potentially useful activity against some susceptible isolates of enterococci. cefaclor and cefatrizine also were highly active, equally or more so than the other oral cephalosporins, against several gram-negative species including escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, and klebsiella pneumoniae. none of the cephalosporins were particularly active against enterobacter cloacae. both cefaclor and cefatrizine were active against proteus mirabilis; cefatrizine was uniquely active against indolepositive proteus species.

AB  == cefaclor, a new oral cephalosporin, was compared in vitro with cephalexin and cephradine against 233 organisms. evaluations were performed in mueller-hinton and nutrient broth and agar using two inoculum sizes. in agar, cefaclor had greater antibacterial activity than either cephalexin or cephradine against isolates of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and salmonella typhi. all three drugs were relatively inactive against isolates of enterococci, enterobacter species, and indole-positive proteus. cefaclor, however, did exhibit the greatest activity of  the three antibiotics against these organisms. although there was wide variability with respect to test parameters, the broth results generally paralleled the agar results. in nutrient broth a clear separation of the results  with these three cephalosporins was seen with k. pneumoniae, e. coli, and s. typhi. cefaclor was the most active, cephalexin had intermediate activity, and cephradine was the least active. from the data obtained in this in vitro study, it can be concluded that cefaclor, which has a substituted chloro group attached  to the molecule, had increased antibacterial activity over cephalexin and cephradine. comparative clinical trials with cefaclor will determine whether the  differences outlined above are of clinical significance.

AB  == analytical isoelectric focusing of plasmid-coded beta-lactamases in polyacrylamide gels gives rise to several satellite bands in addition to one major active band (microheterogeneity). when the r plasmids are transferred by conjugation into 4 different bacterial species (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi-murium, proteus mirabilis) the position of the main  band remains constant, but the number and position of the satellite bands are changed. furthermore, the minimal inhibitory concentrations of several beta-lactamines are also changed when the plasmids are transferred between these  different host strains. these facts suggest that the bacterial host might modify  the physical structure and the activity of plasmid-determined beta-lactamases. they also suggest that identification of beta-lactamases and comparison of their  isoelectric focusing patterns should always be carried out using the same bacterial host strain.

AB  == as a means to development of guidelines for therapeutic application to human disease, preparations of human polyvalent gamma-globulin immune to pseudomonas aeruginosa (pg) were studied in acute infections in mice. pg was highly effective in controlling lethal infections induced in mice by the major immunotypes of p. aeruginosa; greater than or equal to 10 microgram of of gamma-globulin per mouse  protected against challenge with less than or equal to 10(6) 50% lethal doses of  p. aeruginosa. pg was less than or equal to 57 times more effective than normal human gamma-globulin. the active antibody component is specific for each immunotype; it is of the igg type and undoubltedly is directed against the o-antigen. pg was was not protective against challenge with escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, or klebsiella pneumoniae; a low degree of cross-protection was seen against serratia marcescens. in a model infection involving mice in a terminal stage of advanced p. aeruginosa infection, human plasma immune to p. aeruginosa proved ineffective, but the gamma-globulin component showed moderate activity. the apparent irreversibility of this late-stage infection is not clearly ascribable to a toxin. it is postulated that  the successful treatment of advanced p. aeruginosa infections in humans would require multiple therapeutic approaches, including passive immunization with a high-potency, specifically immune globulin.

AB  == gram-negative rods are unusual pharyngeal isolates in normal man, which suggests  the presence of effective oral defense mechanisms against these organisms. to understand this protection better, we studied the elimination of gram-negative rods from the mouth after gargle challenge. suspensions of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis (108 organisms per ml) were gargled  by normal volunteers, and pharyngeal swabs for serial quantitative cultures were  taken for 3 hours. initial swabs yielded approximately 10(5) organisms. bacterial counts rapidly decreased, and less than 1 per cent of the original inoculum was still recoverable 3 hours later. studies of tongue, pharynx, and buccal mucosa samples showed the most rapid decrease in buccal mucosa samples and the slowest decrease in tongue swabs. to evaluate physical clearance, gargle challenges were  performed using e. coli radiolabeled with technetium-99m. external counts of the  oral cavity decreased rapidly, with 21.8, 14.7, 8.9, and 7.8 percent of the initial counts remaining at 30, 60, 120, and 180 min, respectively. nonpiliated e. coli adhered poorly to buccal epithelial cells in vitro, in contrast to good adherence when piliated strains were tested. despite these findings, no differences in radiolabel clearance was noted in vivo using piliated and nonpiliated e. coli for gargle challenges. normal oral defenses against gram-negative rods are highly effective and seem to involve both physical clearance and local bactericidal activity.

TI  == ceftezole, a new cephalosporin c derivative i. in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity.
AB  == ceftezole, a new cephalosporin antibiotic similar to cefazolin, has the following chemical structure: (6r,7r)-8-oxo-7[2-(1h-tetrazol-1-yl)acetamido]-3-[(1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylthio)meth yl]-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-carboxylic acid. ceftezole was found to be a broad-spectrum antibiotic, active in vitro against many species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria except pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia  marcescens and proteus vulgaris. the activity of ceftezole against clinical isolates of escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. appeared to be nearly equal to that of cefazolin and higher than those of cephaloridine and cephalothin. cross-resistance was observed between ampicillin and cephaloridine, but not between ampicillin and ceftezole, in susceptibility tests on clinical isolates of p. mirabilis. the in vitro activity was little affected by the inoculum size, the presence of human serum or the test medium. ceftezole exhibited apparent bactericidal activity at the concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) against both s. aureus and e. coli. the development in vitro  of resistance by s. aureus 209p and e. coli nihj to ceftezole after 16 transfers  was similar to or somewhat slower than that to other drugs tested. ceftezole was  relatively stable in nutrient broth and minimally degraded in the serum or tissue homogenates of rats. ceftezole, in a single subcutaneous administration, exhibited somewhat less efficacy in mice against intraperitoneal infections with  streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae or p. mirabilis than either cephaloridine or cefazolin. however, ceftezole exhibited efficacy similar to that of cephaloridine or cefazolin when administered in three doses. furthermore, ceftezole was as effective as cefazolin in the treatment of experimental abscesses in mice caused by subcutaneous inoculation with s. aureus.

TI  == susceptibility of "enterobacteria" to penicillins, cephalosporins, lincomycins, erythromycin, and rifampin.
AB  == agar dilution tests for susceptibility of gram-negative rods and enterococci were done with a number of penicillins, cephalosporins, lincomycin analogues, erythromycin, and rifampin. many in the first three categories were investigational drugs. all were generally less active than aminoglycoside and tetracycline antibiotics against gram-negative rods and more active against enterococci. cephalosporins as a group were more active than penicillins against  klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli and less active enterococci. both groups were equally active against enterobacter, proteus, and providencia but inactive against most strains of serratia and all strains of pseudomonas; however, ticarcillin, carbenicillin, and bl-1654 were active against most strains of pseudomonas. penicillins and cephalosporins were more active against proteus mirabilis than against indole-positive proteus. lincomycins had little or no activity against gram-negative rods but were moderately active against enterococci. erythromycin was more active than the lincomycins, but rifampin was  much more active than either of these types of drug. of the penicillins, ticarcillin, carbenicillin, and bl-p1654 were the most active against gram-negative rods, whereas bl-p1654, amoxicillin, and ampicillin were the most active against enterococci. the penicillinase-resistant penicillins, cyclacillin, and penicillin v were essentially inactive against gram-negative rods. of the cephalosporins tested, cephanone and cefamandole were the most active against most gram-negative rods, whereas cephaloridine and cephacetrile were the most active against enterococci. the least active of the cephalosporins against most species were cephradine, cephalexin, and cephapirin, but cefoxitin was the least  active against enterococci.

TI  == factors influencing the immune enhancement of intrapulmonary bactericidal mechanisms.
AB  == the effect of specific immunization on the antibacterial defense mechanisms of the murine lung was assessed against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus aureus (smith), serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. immunization by aerosol inhalation significantly enhanced the intrapulmonary killing of pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis but not the remaining organisms. with p. mirabilis, systemic immunization induced higher titers of specific serum  agglutinins as compared with local respiratory tract immunization; however, local immunization was more effective in enhancing pulmonary bactericidal activity than was parenteral vaccination. passive immunity against p. mirabilis or aerogenic challenge with preopsonized p. mirabilis significantly enhanced intrapulmonary killing of the homologous organism. with s. aureus, pulmonary bactericidal activity was not accelerated by aerosol challenge with the preopsonized organism, nor was it accelerated in passively immunized mice. these data demonstrate that the immune enhancement of pulmonary bactericidal activity is governed by the bacterium used for challenge and the route of immunization. the results further demonstrate that with p. mirabilis, antibody-mediated mechanisms are involved in  the immune enhancement of pulmonary bactericidal activity.

TI  == diversity of beta-lactamase activity among clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == various properties (specific activity, inducibility, substrate profile, and susceptibility to inhibitors) of the beta-lactamase activity present in 39 strains of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated during a two-month period in the bacteriology laboratory of a large general hospital were  investigated. among the 39 strains there appeared to be at least 16 distinct enzymes. most enzymes from escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and proteus morganii were active against both penicillins and cephalosporins, whereas those from proteus vulgaris, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed activity primarily against cephalosporins. both types of enzyme were found among strains of enterobacter. there was a general correlation between amount of enzymic activity and levels of resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. discrepancies between enzymic activity and resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. discrepancies between enzymic activity and resistance may be due to variations in the roles intrinsic mechanisms play in resistance to various antibiotics.

TI  == [resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides in gram negative bacteria. 1. molecular and genetic characterization of r-factors (author's transl)].
AB  == with frequent use of aminoglycoside antimicrobials and beta-lactam antibiotics in hospitals in the last few years, the number of bacterial strains resistant to these chemotherapeutics increased. lately, strains of e. coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, serratia, proteus and pseudomonas resistant to many antimicrobials  (ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, gentamycin, tobramycin, sisomycin, neomycin, paromomycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, sulphonamides) were isolated from patients of the university hospital in zuerich. the resistant phenotype of two representative strains (klebsiella pneumoniae 1 and serratia marcescens 2) could be transferred by mixed cultivation to e. coli k-12. multiple resistance of strain 1, and addition, could be transferred to salmonella typhimurium, serratia marcescens, providencia, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae in varying frequencies. transfer to pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, could not be achieved. spontaneous instability of resistance was observed in 0.15% of the cells of an overnight brothe culture and in 90% of the cells of a three months old culture. conjugation, instability and the response to the sex phages ms-2 and if-1 suggested that resistance was mediated by a monomolecular r-factor, belonging to the fi+-type. this suggestion  was confirmed by molecular characterization of the resistance plasmids. after transfer of the r-factors of k. pneumoniae 1 (r-fk 1) and serratia marcescens 2 (r-fk2) into e. coli k-12, plasmid dna was labelled with (methyl-3h) thymidine, and isolated by isopycnic centrifugation in cesiumchlorid-ethidium-bromide. analysis of plasmid dna then was carried out by sedimentation in a 5-20% neutral  sucrose gradient together with reference plasmids of known molecular weights and  sedimentation constants. the analysis revealed that r-fk1 had a molecular weight  of 54 x 10(6) and r-fk2 of 50 x 10(6) daltons. the values were confirmed by contour length measurements of open circular forms with an electron microscope. a comparison of the sedimentation profile of labelled plasmid dna from strain 1 and 14c-labelled dna of e. coli k-12 (r-fk1) showed that the wild-type strain contained, besides the large resistance plasmid, at least two smaller "cryptic" plasmids. these smaller plasmid molecules were also found in antibiotic susceptible variants of strain 1, which did not contain the 54 x 10(6) dalton plasmid molecule, responsible for the resistant phenotype. the number of copies of r-fk1 in e. coli k-12 was determined to be 2, indicating stringent control of  replication. it is discussed that the growing number of isolations of strains of  escherichia, klebsiella, serratia, proteus, providencia and pseudomonas, exhibiting the same resistance phenotype, results from the spread of the r-factor described above among the hospital bacterial flora.

AB  == cefamandole nafate, a new cephalosporin for parenteral use, was evaluated in vitro against 231 recent clinical isolates and in 12 patients. cefamandole had activity equivalent to cefazolin against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae. cefamandole was more active than cephalothin or cefazolin against proteus mirabilis. both cefamandole and cefazolin were as active as cephalothin against s. aureus, were slightly more active against k. pneumoniae, and were considerably more active against e. coli. all strains of indole-positive proteus sp. were inhibited by 6.3 mug of cefamandole per ml but only 20% were inhibited by 25 mug of cefazolin or cephalothin per ml. eighty-eight percent of enterobacter sp. was inhibited by 25 mug of cefamandole per ml, but only 20 and 5% were inhibited by the same concentration of cefazolin  and cephalothin, respectively. peak levels of cefamandole ranged from 6.0 to 110  mug/ml in serum and levels ranged from 440 to 16,800 mug/ml in a 4- to 6-h collection of urine after a 500-mg or 1-g intramuscular dose (6.1 to 17.3 mg/kg)  in patients with endogenous creatinine clearances of >/=31 ml/min. these levels were done after the first dose, at mid-therapy, and at the end of therapy. there  was no evidence of accumulation with the 500-mg or 1-g dose given every 4 to 6 h. the percentage of the dose excreted in the urine within the first 4 to 6 h after  administration of cefamandole was >/=43%. the half-life of cefamandole in serum was 49 to 126 min.

TI  == abnormal forms of bacteria produced by antibiotics.
AB  == subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics can produce in vitro aberrant forms of bacteria that are similar to those observed in specimens and cultures from patients being treated with antibacterial agents. eight species of bacteria were  grown on membranes placed on agar containing subinhibitory concentrations of nine antibiotics. the resulting organisms were examined by gram stain and electron microscopy. gram stains showed filamentous and granular forms of enterobacteria with bipolar staining, giant staphylococci, and rodlike pneumococci. electron micrographs showed changes in the number and distribution of ribosomes in enterobacteria and septum abnormalities in cocci. such abnormal forms can occasionally simulate the appearance of quite different species, and they may indicate the presence of a subinhibitory antibiotic concentration at the site of  infection as a result of prior antibacterial therapy.

TI  == effect of surfactants on antibiotic resistance.
AB  == the effectiveness of surfactants as potentiators of antibiotic activity on several resistant strains of bacteria, selected from clinical sources and laboratory collections, was studied using a tube dilution assay. bacterial strains included members of the enterobacteriaceae and staphylococci. cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (ctab), tween 80 (tw80), a mixture of n-alkyldimethyl betaines (l14), and alpha-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy) propionic acid (tcp) were tested in combination with pencillin g (peng), methicillin (met), streptomycin (sm), polymyxin b (pmb), and chlortetracycline (ctc). growth response to the drug combinations was compared with the response to each drug alone. ctab and l14 but not tw80 or tcp were found to potentiate the activity of  ctc on strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and klebsiella pneumoniae. studies on the inhibition of protein synthesis by ctc in cells of a strain of e.  coli suggested that the surfactants increased the uptake of antibiotic into the cells. ctab and l14 almost completely sensitized strains of p. mirabilis, serratia marcescens, k. pneumoniae, and e. coli to pmb. with the exception of k.  pneumoniae, tcp was also effective in potentiating the activity of pmb on the above strains whereas tw80 showed potentiation only with a strain of e. coli. ctab and l14 but not tcp or tw80 potentiated the activity of peng but not met on  strains of staphylococci. studies of penicillinase in the cells suggested that the surfactants inhibited the formation of this enzyme possibly at the level of induction. none of the surfactants were found to potentiate the activity of sm.

TI  == prevalence of gram-negative rods in the normal pharyngeal flora.
AB  == we obtained throat cultures from 100 randomly selected people free from any chronic upper or lower respiratory disease who did not work in a hospital and who had not experienced any acute illness or received any antibacterial therapy in the 4 weeks preceding culture. eighteen percent harbored either a species of enterobacteriaceae or pseudomonas aeruginosa in their pharynx. in all cases, colony counts were low, the majority being detected in broth media selective for  gram-negative rods. there were no clear-cut age or sex distributions of gram-negative pharyngeal carriage. these data imply that, in at least some cases, isolation of gram-negative rods from sputum of untreated patients may be a normal finding, and that in some patients with pulmonary infection, the pretreatment, upper respiratory tract flora may serve as the source of subsequent superinfection with gram-negative rods.

TI  == bacterial studies of clindamycin-associated colitis. a preliminary report.
AB  == the cause of pseudomembraneous colitis is not known but has been attributed to an alteration in the microbial flora of the colon. to test this hypothesis, a blind, prospective study was undertaken in which fecal samples were cultured quantitatively for aerobic and anaerobic organisms. the patients from which these samples were taken were all receiving clindamycin and had diarrhea secondary to the use of the drug. we were able to show definite differences in the colonic microflora which correlated with the presence of pseudomembranes on biopsy. those patients who had diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis showed a striking decrease, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in the number of anaerobes present. those patients who had diarrhea but no pseudomembranes had large numbers of anaerobes which qualitatively approximated normal fecal cultures but quantitatively were fewer in number. a third group of patients, which had resolving pseudomembranous colitis, and were no longer symptomatic, had large numbers of anaerobic organisms which approximated those found in normal fecal cultures. there were no differences among the three groups with regard to facultative anaerobic microflora. thus, the presence of pseudomembranous colitis  correlated directly with a striking quantitative and qualitative decrease in the  anaerobic microflora of the colon. the symptom of diarrhea alone appeared to have no meaning with regard to changes in the bacterial flora. resolution of pseudomembranous colitis was associated with a return of the anaerobic microflora.

TI  == systematic difference in the methylation of ribosomal ribonucleic acid from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == a survey of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was performed to compare the distributionof n6-methylated adenine. it was found that (i) all the gram-positive strains tested, staphylococcus aureus, sarcina lutea, bacillus stearothermophilus, bacillus subtilis, and bacillus megaterium, contain neither n6-monomethyl adenine (m6a) nor n6-dimethyladenine (m26a) in 23s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna). in the case of s. aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, strains which are clinically resistant to erythromycin contain m26a. (ii) the gram-negative strains salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae all contain m6a but  not m23a in 23s rrna. these observations suggest the existence of at least one systematic structural difference between the ribosomes of the two classes of bacteria. because of the demonstrated relationship between n6-dimethylation of adenine in 23s rrna and clinical resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in staphylococci and streptococci, the observed  systematic differences found in rrna methylation combined with greater cellular permeability may be related to the relatively greater efficacy of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in treating infections caused by gram-positive organisms.

TI  == interference with alpha-antitrypsin studues in stored serum by presumed bacterial proteases.
AB  == contamination of werum by certain gram-negative bacteria has been shown to spoil  the serum for measurement of trypsin inhibitory capacity (stic) or for antitrypsin phenotyping. such sera develop intense fibrinolytic activity when the stic has dropped to itsminimal level, but antitrypsin concentration as measured by radial immunodiffusion remainsconstant. cultures of enterobacter, klebsiella,  bacillus subtilis, and pseudomonas species were shown to have this capability, but production of the fibrinolytic enzyme by the bacteria was most proficient in  the presence of human serum. the enzyme is believed to be of bacterial origin because of its lack of esterase activity, and because activation of serum plasmin by streptokinase did not affect the stic. care mustbe taken to avoid bacterial contamination of blood that is to be submitted for an sticassay and/or antitrypsin phenotyping. serum should be prepared quickly, frozen soon,and stored and transported in a frozen state.

TI  == use of bile-esculin agar for rapid differentiation of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == bile-esculin agar has been used for several years for the presumptive identification of group d streptococci. all members of the enterobacteriaceae family will also grow on this medium, but only certain ones can hydrolyze esculin to 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin, which reacts with iron to produce a characteristic blackening of the medium. one thousand and six cultures from clinical specimens representing 20 genera were isolated and identified. heavy inocula from fresh pure culture isolates on heart infusion agar were placed on bile-esculin agar slants and incubated at 35 c. the slants were examined at 4 h and again at 18 h for esculin hydrolysis. shigella, salmonella, arizona, proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, providencia alcalifaciens, and providencia stuartii all produced negative results. klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, and serratia rubidaea produced a positive reaction in 4 h. the other  remaining eight genera exhibited varying results. the use of this medium in conjunction with triple sugar iron-lysine iron agar has been of great value in differentiating the klebsiella-enterobacter-serratia group from other enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == evaluation of antibacterial activities of cephalosporin antibiotics: cefazolin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, and cephalexin.
AB  == the antibacterial activities of 4 cephalosporin antibiotics, cefazolin, cephaloridine, cephalothin and cephalexin, against 330 isolates of bacteria from  patients at national taiwan university hospital, were determined by an agar plate dilution technique. cephalosporins possess strong antibacterial activity against  gram-positive bacteria except enterococci. staphylococcus aureus is the most susceptible among the organisms tested. more than 90% of staphylococcus aureus strains are suppressed by cefazolin, cephaloridine and cephalothin at the concentrations of 3.13 mug/ml or less, except that 49.1% are suppressed by cephalexin. the relative potency of cephalosporins against staphylococcus aureus  in decreasing order is cephaloridine, cephalothin, cefazolin, and cephalexin. the gram-negative bacilli, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis are less susceptible to cephalosporins than the gram-positive cocci. among the cephalosporins, cefazolin is the most active against the gram-negative  pathogens tested. the relative potency of antibacterial activity of cephalosporins against e. coli in decreasing order is cefazolin, cephaloridine, cephalexin, and cephalothin. one hour after the intramuscular injection of 500 mg of cefazolin, the maximum concentration of 33.3 mug/ml is reached in the serum. the sufficient high levels are sustained for 8 hours. very high concentrations of cefazolin are also found in the urine.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cefoxitin, 3-carbamolyloxymethyl-7-alpha-methoxy-7[2-(2-thienyl)acetamido]-3-cephem-4-carboy xlic acid, was investigated. activity against gram-positive organisms was less than that of cephalothin and cephloridine. it was highly active against gram-negative bacilli, with activity against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and klebsiella pneumoniae equal to that of currently available cephalosporins. in addition, it was active against certain enterobacter strains, serratia marcescens, indole-positive proteae and herellea. the strains of these latter bacteria were strains susceptible to carbenicillin and ticarcillin. pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonas species were resistant. changes in ph, inoculum  size, and type of growth medium had no significant effect on the activity of the  antibiotic. cefoxitin was highly resistant to hydrolysis by various types of gram-negative beta-lactamases. the precise role of resistance to beta-lactamase hydrolysis varied from strain to strain. bacterial resistance to cefoxitin was not necessarily related to hydrolysis of the antibiotic. however, the resistance  of cefoxitin to hydrolysis did contribute to its activity. cefoxitin could function as an inducer of beta-lactamase activity and effectively bound to purified beta-lactamases.

TI  == r-factor-mediated beta-lactamases that hydrolyze oxacillin: evidence for two distinct groups.
AB  == the enzymatic and molecular properties of 14 oxacillin-hydrolyzing beta-lactamases, all of them r-factor-specified, were studied, and two distinct groups were found. four of the enzymes had a molecular weight of 24,000, were active against methicillin, and had an electrophoretic mobility of -0.1 cm/h. eight enzymes had a molecular weight of 45,000, low activity against methicillin, and an electrophoretic mobility of +0.5 cm/h. the remaining two enzymes were similar to those of the second group in being relatively inactive against methicillin, but their molecular weight was lower (42,000) and their electrophoretic mobility was different (-0.1 cm/h). all the enzymes of both groups were sensitive to inhibition by sodium chloride. the two groups were not completely homogeneous in their enzymatic properties; seven possible subtypes could be recognized.

AB  == heat-stable antibacterial activity in the following suspensions was demonstrated  against pseudomonas aeruginosa at ph 6.5, 6.0, and 5.5: (i) pooled colon contents of normal mice; (ii) an anaerobic, 48-h culture of normal mouse feces; and (iii)  anaerobic, 48-h cultures of different bacteria from human colon flora (escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis). the lower the ph of the medium, the greater was the antibacterial activity of these suspensions. the antibacterial activity of five fatty acids (propionic, butyric, isobutyric, acetic, and formic acids) was greater against p. aeruginosa than against three enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p.  mirabilis) at all fatty acid concentrations (0.16 m to 0.005 m) and at the 3 ph values studied (5.5, 6.0, and 6.5). as the ph value increased, the antibacterial  activity decreased. antibacterial activity was greater at higher fatty acid concentrations, and at each ph value it was greatest for the fatty acids having high pk(a) values. lactic acid, with the lowest pk(a), exhibited little or no antibacterial activity. acetic and butyric acids, two of the three predominant volatile fatty acids determined by gas chromatography in the mouse colon contents and in the anaerobic culture of mouse feces, occurred in vivo in concentrations which inhibited growth of p. aeruginosa in vitro at the ph of the mouse cecum. these results suggest that undissociated short-chain fatty acids produced by the  colon flora may be a mechanism of intestinal resistance to colonization by p. aeruginosa.

AB  == cefazolin sodium, a cephalosporin for parenteral use, was evaluated in vitro and  in 26 patients. cefazolin had activity equivalent to cephalothin against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, group a streptococci, and proteus mirabilis. cefazolin was four- to eightfold more active against escherichia coli and slightly more active against klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas  cephalothin was slightly more active against indole-positive proteus species. after a 500-mg dose of cefazolin intramuscularly, peak concentrations in the serum were high enough to inhibit all strains of s. pneumoniae, s. aureus, group  a streptococci, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis, as well as 60% of strains of proteus species other than p. mirabilis. all of 26 patients (18 with pneumonia, 6 with urinary tract infection, and 2 with skin infections) responded  clinically and bacteriologically to cefazolin therapy. there were no major side effects of therapy, and no patient complained of pain at the site of intramuscular injection. cefazolin is an effective cephalosporin which can be used intramuscularly for therapy of serious bacterial infections. its major advantages over other cephalosporins are higher, more sustained concentrations in the blood and apparent lack of pain on intramuscular injection.

TI  == butirosin, a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex: antibacterial activity in vitro and in mice.
AB  == butirosin is a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex which has broad gram-negative and gram-positive inhibitory antibacterial activity, as well as some bactericidal properties. significantly susceptible bacteria include strains  of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, and pathogenic gram-negative species such as enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae,  proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris, salmonella enteritidis and s. typhimurium, shigella flexneri and s. sonnei. good activity by parenteral dosing was obtained  in various acute mouse infections. butirosin is especially interesting because of its activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro, including gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates, and in experimental mouse infections at relatively low doses.

TI  == amoxycillin: a new semi-synthetic penicillin.
AB  == amoxycillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzylpenicillin) is a new semi-synthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity similar to that of ampicillin. penicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci were sensitive to concentrations of 0.1 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. strains of haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by a level of 0.5 mug/ml, and most strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, shigella sonnei, salmonella species, and streptococcus faecalis were sensitive to a concentration of 5 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. penicillinase-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus and strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, indole-positive proteus, klebsiella, and enterobacter were insensitive to amoxycillin. the new penicillin was bactericidal in activity, as with other penicillins, and its antibacterial activity was not reduced in the presence of serum. after oral administration to volunteer subjects amoxycillin produced serum concentrations twice as high as those obtained with similar doses of ampicillin, and the penicillin was recovered unchanged in high concentrations in the urine. the absorption of amoxycillin was not greatly influenced by food, and administration  of probenecid resulted in increased and more prolonged concentrations of amoxycillin in serum.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of tobramycin, a new aminoglycoside antibiotic.
AB  == one hundred fifty-two strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella-enterobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus species, and staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by 3.1 mug of tobramycin/ml in a broth-dilution method and showed zones of inhibition of 16 mm or more around a 10-mug tobramycin disc in the kirby-bauer method. tobramycin was most active against s. aureus, 100% of strains being inhibited by 0.1 mug/ml. all strains of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and indole-positive proteus species, and 80% of enterobacter species were inhibited by 0.8 mug of tobramycin/ml, whereas only 48% of p. mirabilis strains were inhibited by this concentration. tobramycin was approximately twice as active as gentamicin against s. aureus, four times as active against p. aeruginosa, slightly more active against e. coli and enterobacter species, equally active against p. mirabilis, and slightly less active against k. pneumoniae. the minimal bactericidal concentrations of tobramycin and gentamicin  were the same as or twice the minimal inhibitory concentrations for all strains except those of p. aeruginosa, against which greater concentrations of both gentamicin and tobramycin were required for bactericidal activity. tobramycin sterilized cultures of s. aureus, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa, but the rate of bactericidal action was faster with a combination of tobramycin and carbenicillin than with either antibiotic alone in the same concentrations. tobramycin retained potency in the presence of 200 to 600 mug of carbenicillin/ml for at least 6 hr of incubation at 37 c, but lost potency in the presence of 600 mug of carbenicillin/ml by 24 hr of incubation and in the presence of 800 mug/ml by 2 hr of incubation.

AB  == 7-[alpha-(1-methyl-4-pyridiniothio)-acetamido] cephalosporanic acid, referred to  herein as bl-s 217, is a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic cephalosporin that offers several advantages over cephalothin. a comparison of the activity in vitro of these antibiotics indicates that bl-s 217 is about eightfold more effective against streptococcus pyogenes and diplococcus pneumoniae. against gram-negative  bacteria, bl-s 217 possesses a broader antibacterial spectrum than cephalothin, particularly against members of the enterobacteriaceae family; e.g., bl-s 217 inhibited over 20% more strains of both escherichia coli and klebsiella than cephalothin and also showed some advantage in tests against salmonella and enterobacter. overall, of 208 strains of enterobacteriaceae tested, 172 were susceptible to bl-s 217 compared to 149 for cephalothin. bl-s 217 was less bound  to human serum proteins than cephalothin and gave higher peak blood levels in mice after intramuscular administration. the ld(50) of bl-s 217 in mice after subcutaneous administration was in excess of 4,000 mg/kg. when administered by the same route to mice experimentally infected with cephalothin-sensitive bacterial strains, this new cephalosporin was 20 times more effective than cephalothin in s. pyogenes and d. pneumoniae infections and 3 to 4 times more efficacious in an e. coli infection. its therapeutic efficacy was comparable to that of cephalothin in infections produced by strains of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis.

AB  == the effect of mg(2+) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) on the in vitro activity of coumermycin a(1) and novobiocin was determined against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis grown  in trypticase soy broth or defined synthetic medium. in the presence of edta, the activity of coumermycin a(1) was significantly enhanced (8- to 40-fold) against all four organisms in the synthetic medium lacking mg(2+); novobiocin activity was increased to a lesser extent (4- to 16-fold) against three strains and remained unchanged against p. mirabilis. addition of 200 mug of mg(2+) per ml to  the synthetic medium containing edta completely reversed the enhancement of activity of both antibiotics by edta only against p. aeruginosa. the addition of  mg(2+) to the synthetic medium appreciably inhibited the activity of novobiocin (sixfold) but not coumermycin a(1) against e. coli, and had little or no effect on the activity of either antibiotic against the remaining organisms. k. pneumoniae showed the greatest susceptibility to both antibiotics, and addition of edta enhanced this activity from 4-fold to 20-fold in all of the media tested. subinhibitory concentrations of both antibiotics induced filament formation by all four organisms in all media. in addition, lysis of k. pneumoniae cells was observed.

AB  == concentrations of cephalexin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin c) in serum and urine were determined in normal volunteers and patients. the in vitro antibacterial activity was also studied. all strains of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci and diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 3.1 mug/ml. of the staphylococcus aureus strains, 88% were inhibited by 6.3 mug/ml, and 12.5 mug/ml was inhibitory for all s. aureus, 80% of escherichia coli, 72% of klebsiella-aerobacter, and 56% of proteus mirabilis strains. about 90 to 96% of e. coli, klebsiella aerobacter, and p. mirabilis strains were inhibited by 25 mug of cephalexin per ml. pseudomonas and indole-positive proteus strains proved to be quite resistant to cephalexin. cephalexin was well absorbed after oral administration. a peak serum concentration of cephalexin of at least 5 mug/ml was achieved in each volunteer with 250 and 500-mg doses. a mean peak serum concentration of 7.7 mug/ml was achieved with 250-mg doses; 12.3mug/ml was achieved with 500-mg doses of antibiotic. food did not interfere with absorption. probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. over 90% of the administered dose was excreted  in the urine within 6 hr. the mean peak serum concentration of cephalexin after an oral dose of 500 mg was adequate to inhibit all group a streptococci, d. pneumoniae, and s. aureus, 85% of e. coli, and about 40 to 75% of klebsiella-aerobacter and p. mirabilis strains. levels of cephalexin in urine were adequate to inhibit over 90% of e. coli, and p. mirabilis and 80 to 96% of klebsiella-aerobacter strains.

TI  == the role of immunity in the pathogenesis of experimental hematogenous pyelonephritis.
AB  == hematogenous pyelonephritis was produced in rats utilizing multiple strains of escherichia coli, a strain of klebsiella pneumoniae, and a strain of proteus mirabilis. three patterns of hematogenous pyelonephritis occurred which represent an interrelationship between an immune response to the infecting bacteria and the development of obstructive uropathy as a consequence of infection. first, the course of pyelonephritis due to strains of escherichia coli was acute, self-limited, and associated with the development of circulating agglutinins. following healing, this pattern of infection was associated with acquired resistance to reinfection with the same bacterial strain. second, the course of pyelonephritis due to a strain of klebsiella pneumoniae type c was chronic. this  infection was not associated with the production of circulating agglutinins against encapsulated strains. acquired resistance to reinfection by the homotypic strain could not be demonstrated following eradication of infection but was produced by the passive transfer of concentrated antiserum. third, pyelonephritis due to proteus mirabilis was associated with circulating agglutinins and resistance to reinfection with the same organism following eradication of infection, yet the course was chronic. the chronicity appeared to be the consequence of obstructive uropathy resulting from calculi which developed during the course of the infection. resistance to reinfection was demonstrated in infections with strains of e. coli and p. mirabilis. the resistance is associated with specific immunity as demonstrated by the observation that: (a) it is type-specific, (b) it is of at least 3 months' duration, and (c) it can be passively transferred by means of rabbit antiserum. since k. pneumoniae failed to evoke capsular antibodies in the rat, resistance to infection with k. pneumoniae  was produced only by means of passively transferred concentrated rabbit antiserum and not by prior infection. immunity can be demonstrated to have a significant role in the pathogenesis of experimental hematogenous pyelonephritis only in the  absence of obstructive uropathy.
